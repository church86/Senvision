Quotes in the article Lehman Brothers Holdings Capital Trust V LHHMQ ▲ 0.1050 +0.0026 +2.54% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 84.59 -0.36 -0.42% The settlement made public on Wednesday requires approval by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman in Manhattan. It follows JPMorgan's agreement last January to pay $1.42 billion in cash to resolve most other claims, in what had been an $8.6 billion lawsuit against the largest U.S. bank to recoup money for Lehman creditors. JPMorgan, which had been Lehman's largest secured creditor, was accused of exploiting its leverage as Lehman's main "clearing" bank to siphon critical liquidity in the last few days before Lehman went bankrupt on Sept. 15, 2008. Lehman creditors have maintained that JPMorgan unnecessarily extracted billions of dollars of collateral, and by doing so obtained a windfall at their expense. In a court filing, lawyers for Lehman said the settlement avoids the uncertainty of continued litigation and millions of dollars of additional legal fees, and is "in the best interests of the Lehman estate and its creditors." No one admitted wrongdoing, the settlement agreement said. JPMorgan has already set aside money for the accord, according to a regulatory filing. A hearing to consider approval is scheduled for Feb. 16. Once Wall Street's fourth-largest bank, Lehman reported $639 billion of assets when it filed for Chapter 11 protection, making its bankruptcy by far the largest in U.S. history. Lehman emerged from bankruptcy in March 2012, and has since been winding down. Creditors have recouped more than $110 billion, and bondholders once projected to receive just 21 cents on the dollar have recovered close to twice that sum.

Presumably the only reason for a company insider to choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money – maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. Within the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, only nine companies have experienced such buying over the trailing six month period, one of which was JPMorgan Chase & Co (Symbol: JPM), where an investment totaling $2.8K was made by Director Laban Jackson.

MUST CREDIT: Washington Post photo by Jabin Botsford. By Matthew Campbell, WP Bloomberg Jan 30, 2017 at 8:29 am | Print View President Donald Trump vowed to end business as usual in Washington. Global companies are now learning just what that means. What began before his inauguration, with attempts to cajole corporations like Toyota into keeping jobs in the U.S. with critical tweets, is now escalating into a crucial test for business leaders trying to maintain the cross-border flows of people and goods that underpin commerce in the 21st century. Trump’s Friday signing of an executive order barring the citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S., on the heels of his war of words with Mexico over trade, alarmed executives from big employers including General Electric, Google and Microsoft. A chaotic weekend of protests, emergency court hearings and White House rebuttals left executives with a tricky choice: speak out and risk drawing fire from an outspoken president, or stay silent and face criticism from employees and activists. GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt’s response underscored the delicate balance business will have to strike. “We have many employees from the named countries and we do business all over the region,” he said in an internal email. While he called those staff “critical to our success,” he avoided direct criticism of Trump’s policy. GE “will continue to make our voice heard with the new administration and congress and reiterate the importance of this issue,” he said. Trump’s order shut the door to nationals of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — including refugees, visiting scholars and, at least temporarily, even permanent American residents who happened to be abroad for work or holidays. Confusion reigned in the first 48 hours of its implementation, with border agents and airlines unsure how to interpret the rules. The decision, termed a “Muslim ban” by critics, fulfills a campaign promise that even Trump allies had suggested shouldn’t be taken literally, signaling the White House’s new occupant is committed to at least some of his most controversial pledges. “We would never think this would become any kind of an issue,” Ludwig Willisch, chief executive officer of North American operations at Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, said at an automotive conference on Saturday. “This country is a melting pot, freedom of speech, everybody gets together and creates this great country. So, we were not prepared for this kind of thing.” Criticism from pockets of corporate America, which was matched by statements from the leaders of Germany, France, and Canada, stood in stark contrast to the warm words toward Trump just a week ago. Executives at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Switzerland, including AT&T’s Randall Stephenson and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon, praised Trump’s promises to overhaul corporate taxes and invest in infrastructure. Optimists suggested he would quietly drop pledges to tear up trade deals and reconsider defense commitments to allies. Trump has “had this extraordinary honeymoon where Wall Street has kind of discounted all the negative aspects,” Richard Fenning, the CEO of consultancy Control Risks, told Bloomberg Television. As companies react to the migrant ban, “perhaps that honeymoon is starting to be over,” he said. The about-face was epitomized by Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk; last week he praised Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, as a potentially “excellent” pick. On Sunday, Musk tweeted that migrants “don’t deserve to be rejected” and asked his 6.89 million Twitter followers to read the immigration order and suggest changes. On the other hand, U.S. auto companies, whose home state of Michigan has a large Arab community, have yet to make their views known. Wall Street has also largely stayed out of the fray. At some of its biggest banks, executives said they were struggling to understand whether the order will ultimately apply to employees who work in the U.S. with green cards or legal work permits. If it doesn’t hit visa holders, few major companies’ employees will be affected, according to one executive who asked not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to comment. On Sunday, JPMorgan said it was working to assist affected staff. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said Trump’s move left him with “deep concern, a heavy heart and a resolute promise.” The coffee chain will redouble efforts to hire as many as 10,000 refugees over five years in 75 countries, he wrote in a note to employees Sunday. Reaction was sharpest from the technology industry, with Twitter awash in reminders that Apple’s late co-founder, Steve Jobs, was the son of a Syrian immigrant. Among the first to speak out was Google CEO Sundar Pichai, himself an immigrant from India, who called the policy “painful.” Another India-born CEO, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, took to LinkedIn to highlight “the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, for the world.” Trump should expect sustained challenges from the tech industry in particular, said Ian Bremmer, CEO of political consultancy Eurasia Group, because it differs significantly with him on issues from net neutrality to immigration. “While most every CEO wants to just ‘get back to business’ after Trump’s election, that’s going to prove much harder” for technology leaders, he said. “There’s going to be a fight.” Compounding business leaders’ unease was the order’s confused implementation, which included unclear directives on how border agents should treat lawful permanent residents, and contradictory statements about how it would affect those who hold passports from two countries — for example, a dual citizen of Iran and the U.K. For now, lawyers are advising such individuals not to travel to the U.S., or to stay put if they already live there. The new rules came into force with no transition period, leaving carriers like Emirates and American Airlines Group Inc. unsure what to do with passengers booked to fly to U.S. airports, or already in the air. “We are committed to protecting our people and will provide whatever support is necessary to protect them and their families,” Michael Roth, CEO of advertising firm Interpublic Group of Cos., wrote in an email. --With assistance from Mary Schlangenstein Christopher Palmeri Gabrielle Coppola Deena Kamel Yousef Eric Pfanner Richard Clough Hugh Son and Dakin Campbell Your next Nation & World articles Starbucks to speed up hiring of vets ami ...

"We started the year calling for SMid-caps (small- to mid-cap stocks) to be range bound with upside risk based on our assumption that Trump would focus first on implementing those electoral promises that were clear wins (tax cuts and infrastructure spend), leaving the more questionable plans regarding global trade for much later. ... Instead, it seems like global trade is his No. 1 focus from the start, something which in our opinion adds downside risk to our 2017 outlook," global strategist Eduardo Lecubarri wrote in a note to clients Thursday. "We believe investors seem to be overly complacent, with many metrics pointing to a market that is trading on best-case-scenario assumptions, and with little consideration being given to the fact that 2017 is now arguably the year with the highest political risk that we have seen in the last two decades," he added. The strategist said Wall Street analysts already estimate 18.1 percent corporate earnings growth in 2017 for small- and mid-cap stocks versus 6.3 percent growth last year. He said the forecast is "aggressive" as the expected tax cuts from Trump have not occurred yet. In addition he cited how volatility measures are low, technical indicators seem "overbought" and equity markets are near all-time highs even with the political risk.

Custody tarts The custodian-bank business A big deal roils the industry’s usually placid waters Feb 4th 2017 | NEW YORK Add this article to your reading list by clicking this button Tweet NO ACTOR has ever sat nude in a bathtub to explain the intricacies of the bank-custody business, as Margot Robbie did for mortgage-backed securities in “The Big Short”, a successful film. The blame lies with the custody business’s virtues, not its flaws. Instead of the 2% fees Ms Robbie mentions for offloading rubbishy securities onto suckers, bank-custody fees are tallied in hundredths of a percentage point. Custody bankers are generally neither glamorous nor crooked. They are accountants and software engineers catering to well-informed clients: the owners and managers of huge amounts of financial assets. The services they offer include: holding, valuing and transferring securities; receiving interest and dividends; and providing notice of corporate actions. The business grows with the financial markets, but more slowly. Years of almost seamless and scandal-free performance have made the business well-nigh invisible. But not quite. In this section Emerging markets’ Trump tantrum abates, except in Turkey India floats the idea of a universal basic income What if interest expenses were no longer tax-deductible? Why even win-win trade deals are tough Ethiopia’s state-of-the-art commodity exchange “Alt-beta” funds offer hedge-fund-like investments more cheaply The custodian-bank business In defence of NAFTA Reprints Related topics JPMorgan Chase Industries Financial services State Street Investment services Custody has habitually been “sticky”: the loss of a large account is unusual. But on January 25th BlackRock, a gargantuan asset manager, announced that it was moving custody assets worth $1trn from State Street to JPMorgan Chase. State Street’s shares dropped by 7%, or roughly double the percentage of assets lost. In a business that relies on economies of scale, marginal assets have disproportionate value since they provide revenue without much extra cost. Custodians are like utilities, providing critical infrastructure. The three biggest are State Street, BNY Mellon, and JPMorgan Chase, each overseeing more than $20trn in assets. Next is Citigroup with $15trn. When many custodian-bank executives started work, their jobs entailed the meticulous counting of mountains of paper securities. Now these banks have to invest fortunes in computing power. State Street spent over $1.1bn on hardware in 2016, and was probably matched by the two other giants, says Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW, a research firm. These investments matter. State Street and BNY Mellon do not have the same breadth of businesses as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, but they are designated “systemically important institutions” because it is absolutely essential that their systems work. They hold and price trillions in assets; a glitch could create havoc. Some temporary outages have happened, but nothing persistent. The occasional scandal has also emerged. Several custodians have settled charges of pocketing excessive amounts from foreign-exchange dealings. But this has, so far, caused minimal disruption. By dint of their position, the custody banks also have extraordinary access to information. They know which markets are efficient, how money is flowing, the value of their customers’ holdings and what form they take. That information is, slowly, becoming a valuable product in itself. Their work may never be explained by a woman in a tub, but when the financial world is on fire, they may be able to tell her how hot the water is.

Will Trump break up the big banks? Posted on Thursday, February 2, 2017 by CNN in Business News Wall Street stalwart JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is heading to Washington on Friday to meet with President Trump. It will be Dimon’s first meeting with Trump as part of the president’s CEO advisory group. The summit is likely to feature lots of talk about slashing burdensome regulation, including on banks. Trump just this week pledged to “do a big number” on the Wall Street reform law known as Dodd-Frank. But will Trump also bring up his pre-election pledge to bring back Glass-Steagall? Returning that Great Depression-era law would force the mega banks to break themselves apart by separating their Wall Street investment bank divisions from their Main Street checking account business. On the one hand, a revival of Glass-Steagall would fly in the face of Trump’s push to accelerate the American economy by massively reducing regulation. Renewed talk of bringing back Glass-Steagall, which was repealed in 1999 under President Clinton, would surely upset the markets as well as pragmatists in the Trump administration like former Goldman Sachs executives Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin. But Trump did bash big banks before the election, especially Goldman Sachs. Breaking up the banks would appeal to Trump’s populist message of draining the swamp by uprooting the establishment. The new president could also argue it solves the Too Big To Fail problem that the 2008 financial crisis exposed. Plus, it’s something that Republicans like John McCain and liberals such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders broadly agree on. Glass-Steagall was even included in the official Republican Party platform during Trump’s convention. It would also please Steve Bannon, Trump’s powerful chief strategist who Time suggested this week may be the “second most powerful man in the world.” Bannon (another former Goldman banker) told BuzzFeed in 2014 that he believes “you really need to go back and make banks do what they do: Commercial banks lend money, and investment banks invest in entrepreneurs and to get away from this trading.” That sounds a lot like Glass-Steagall. It’s not totally clear where Trump stands on this right now. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, was asked on Wednesday if Trump still supports reestablishing Glass-Steagall. “The president’s position is consistent, yes,” Spicer said. But Spicer also suggested the question is a better one for Mnuchin, Trump’s treasury secretary nominee whose confirmation is being held up by Senate Democrats due to concerns about his business and financial ties. During his confirmation hearing, Mnuchin said he’s not in favor of going back to Glass-Steagall as it was written in the 1930s. He warned that separating retail banks and investment banks could hurt access to credit and upset markets by limiting liquidity. Mnuchin did say he’s in favor of a “21st Century Glass-Steagall” — but he didn’t explain precisely what that is. Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington State, cosponsored legislation with Warren and McCain called the “21st Century Glass-Steagall Act” that expands on the original law by also separating derivatives trading and other shadow banking activities. Asked if Trump supports this legislation, Mnuchin said in a follow-up written response that the administration believes new legislation “should reflect the reality of today’s financial institutions and markets.” In any case, there doesn’t seem to be enough appetite in Congress for bringing back Glass-Steagall. Glass-Steagall doesn’t have a “ghost of a chance of returning in 2017,” Nathan Dean, a financial policy analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a report this week. More likely, Congress will take up a form of the Financial Choice Act, a Republican bill that offers a mix of carrots and sticks. On the one hand, the bill would encourage big banks to raise more capital — arguably more than they would want to raise — so that they can avoid enhanced regulation. But the Financial Choice Act would also gut key elements of Dodd-Frank, including the Volcker Rule that bans banks from making risky bets with their own money. It would also repeal the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the watchdog agency inspired by Warren. “The most likely development is that we get less, not more regulation,” said Robert Shapiro, a former Obama adviser and senior fellow at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business.

Paul Sakuma/AP/File | Caption Fullscreen Loading... Chris Moon ValuePenguin February 2, 2017 —Last Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase and Intuit Inc. announced a partnership to share customer bank account information, beginning what may be a sea change in the consumer banking industry. Naturally, the deal will first affect those who bank at Chase and use Intuit's personal finance applications, which include Mint, TurboTax and QuickBooks. Currently, these applications have a combined audience numbering in the tens of millions. But even if you’re not a customer with Chase and Intuit, here are some major (and largely positive) ways the deal may eventually affect online banking for all customers. A Different — and Possibly Faster — User Experience The deal promises to make the use of apps and an online bank account faster in several ways. At present, apps like Mint stay current with your bank account by periodically logging in with the bank, a method that creates added strain on the bank's servers and creates lag between the app and your account. Intuit's new partnership with Chase allows the company's finance apps to obtain customer bank account data from Chase automatically and continuously, through the use of application programming interfaces (APIs). This direct connection should reduce the time and processing power Intuit's apps require to fetch data. Mint, for example, will be faster at downloading the latest transactions from your Chase account and factoring them into its budgets and charts. This changeover also promises a faster user experience. Until now, financial apps required users to provide their bank ID and password so that the program could log in as the user and copy account data from the bank's site. Following the deal, Intuit's apps will instead redirect users to a Chase login screen, which will then permit the apps to download information directly through the Chase API. In the press release announcing the deal, the two companies suggest that users may only have to deal with these prompts one time, after which Intuit receives a token from Chase authorizing it to download future data as needed. While that promises a less cumbersome process, it remains to be seen whether Chase and Intuit won't make logins necessary for each new session. Could you be a Federal Reserve banker? Better Protection of Your Financial Data Given how information breaches in the past have compromised individual users across multiple accounts, you’re forgiven if you fear that increased centralization of data will be akin to putting all your eggs into one basket, and that a single breach at Chase may compromise your entire financial record. In fact, Chase and Intuit promise the opposite, and they may be right. Again, we’ll have to see how this plays out in practice, but a direct business-to-business connection via APIs theoretically allows information to remain more secure than in the old system. Rather than giving up IDs and passwords to a slew of apps, users with Chase accounts will only log in with Chase, keeping their credentials secret from third parties. In short, the fewer places information is stored, the easier it is to protect. And given Chase's vast resources and keen interest in digital security, it's far better situated to provide that protection than the typical fintech company. A Boom in Other Such Partnerships Given the technical and security advantages at stake, other major banks will certainly monitor the progress of Chase's new initiative to determine whether they need to do the same. Although APIs have been in wide use on the Internet for over a decade, they haven't played a role in the more recent explosion of third-party apps like Venmo and Mint, which let consumers transfer and budget money through features that banks themselves have been slow to provide. Assuming all goes well, the Chase-Intuit agreement brings these apps one step closer to occupying a permanent position in the financial services industry. Until now, such deals may have been delayed because traditional banks were reluctant to relinquish their control over customer information. Because they’re uniquely placed to gather consumer account data, banks have been leery of sharing that treasure trove too freely. However, with online services and apps swiftly reshaping the way people use money, banks risk falling behind if they don’t adapt and integrate into the new way things work.

Be for something! Stoller is #6: Right now, Democrats are just panicking and whining and saying, “You have to say mean things about Trump on Twitter,” as if that’s a strategy. Instead, you should fight Trump on economic populist grounds. Today, farmers face monopoly power in the form of Bayer, Monsanto, ADM, and Tyson. People in urban areas face other monopolies, but they’re driven by the same concentrated financial power. The ideology of Democrats should be to break up that power. Meanwhile, at #10, John R.

Trump’s Fast Start Likely Puts the House in Play in 2018 Stuart Rothenberg, Inside Elections. “In 2010, voters told President Obama that he had gone too far, too fast, with health care reform, a $787 billion economic stimulus package, the bailout of the banks, cash for clunkers and a generally liberal agenda.” Not in Massachusetts, where it was Obama’s failure to deliver on foreclosures that cost him the state and with that, the Senate. Donald Trump is finally floating an idea liberals can love Quartz Health Care One thing red state voters don’t like about Obamacare is that it sucks Matt Bruenig. Good take: It is absurd that someone whose income is 130% of the poverty line can go to a doctor but someone whose income is 140% of the poverty line cannot. Yet that is the reality the design of Obamacare has created. This design generates enormous resentment because it is actually bullshit that making a little more money makes health care unaffordable. As we’ve been saying… On the “bubble” at the poverty line, see here from 2013: Bonus points to ObamaCare for program design, since Kaiser actually encouraged “consumers” to game their income when enrolling to be on the side the the bubble they preferred, with ObamaCare navigators helping them, thereby encouraging corruption.

Really? On a Vacuum cleaner? Thats a 25-30 amp load, and many US household power sockets are fused (with a breaker) at 20 amps. Reply ↓ Alex February 2, 2017 at 9:21 am Um, not quite sure what point you’re trying to make… That their power consumption numbers for vacuum cleaners are wrong? Perhaps, but there are other loads in a typical home that can reach 3000 W. The numbers cited may also include shop-vacs, which are specified at those numbers. In any case, it’s an interesting approach, using AC or DC as appropriate for the device using the power. The thing to remember with anything efficiency or sustainability related is that there is never one solution – there are many solutions, each one appropriate to the given situation and need. Reply ↓ Uahsenaa February 2, 2017 at 11:41 am I think your math is off here. The typical vacuum motor runs at 120V, which would make the range 4.2-25 amps, not 25-30. At normal operation, the motor wouldn’t necessarily be drawing at the upper limit, though I have seen vacuums trip breakers, especially when clogged or otherwise straining the motor. In other words, those numbers don’t surprise me at all.

The ring mains (usually there’s two, one for “upstairs”, one serving “downstairs”) have 32 amp breakers. So we have no fear of monster power draws from domestic appliances. Those 100 volt 10 amp jokes you guys in the US stick on your walls (yes, I know heavier duty designs are fitted where higher loads are expected such as kitchens, utility rooms etc.) make me chuckle and groan at the same time.

Reply ↓ skippy February 3, 2017 at 2:03 am I’ve got a 100A main breaker, followed by 32A for stove, 20A for water, 3 x 16A for the kitchen, bedrooms etc and the usual 8A for lights. Airconn usually goes on 3-phase. Also have Ground Fault Circuit Interupters (GFCI) – have a switch which is intended to cut the power when the Active and Neutral currents are different and/or current flows in the Earth. But as always when doing any electrical work, at home or on the job, I disconnect power and check for residual currant with a multi meter. I still remember working for a mob doing energy saving up grades in L.A. with old ballasts in them – PCBs lol. Supervised the subbies, so I went on the tools to get a better view of the job characteristics for a bit. Heaps of funny story’s, anywho…. Fun facts…. The Cleaning Lady and the Dog (A coautionary tale) Before GFCIs, in one hospital some surgeons were operating on a patient. They had an EKG monitor (for electrical heart pulses) connected to an electrical socket on one side of the theatre, and also an Intracardiac Blood Pressure monitor (with internal heart catheter) connected to an electrical socket on the other side of the theatre. Both were “Earthed” on the patient for safety. Suddenly, a 50Hz potential appeared on the EKG and the patient’s heart fibrillated. The surgeons quickly disconnected the monitors and the patient was revived. When they checked the monitors, the potential had disappeared. They reconstructed the senario with a dog on the table instead of a human. The strange signal had disappeared. However, after a fortnight of testing, suddenly the mysterious signal reappeared. They rushed out of the theatre (leaving the dog) and found a cleaning lady with an electric scrubber in the next room. Examining the scrubber, they found that it was leaking 1A into the Earth leads. This is how the mathematics worked out. Since they had connected the monitors to different electrical sockets there was 30m of Copper wire (radius 1mm) between the Earth connections of the monitors. The Earth wire had a resistivity of 1.7×10-8Ωm, a length of 30m and a radious of 1mm. It’s resistance therefore equaled 1.7×10-8×30/(π0.0012) = 0.17Ω. The 1A current through the wire produced 0.17V in the Earth wire between the two Earth connections. Between one Earth connection and the other Earth connection, the resistance through the heart was 3200Ω. There was then a current of 0.17/3200 = 0.05mA through the heart. As this was an internal flow through the body it was enough to produce ventricular fibrillation. Hospitals now have GFCIs that are much more sensitive than normal household devices, and other protective services. Other protective devices in general, include relays, circuit breakers and fuses and electronic monitoring devices. They are designed to protect against over-current, over-voltage, and reversing polarity (in a 3 phase system). Reply ↓ Isolato February 2, 2017 at 2:47 pm I think everyone is a bit off here! I have lived on my little island here on solar and generator power for 20 years. Some of the loads are DC 24v but most of the power comes back out of the batteries and is converted to AC at about 92% efficiency. I looked at an all DC system when I designed the place.Like a boat. Not enough of our world was ready then or now. Everything DC is much more expensive. And, as for costs. These writers must be drunk!. By the time you figure in battery replacement our costs are closer to $2/kwh compared to grid power a few miles away at 10 cents for the same power. Our electrical usage is about 2 kwh/day, of course heat and the refer work on propane…so. Reply ↓ Anon February 2, 2017 at 5:49 pm Good for you, Isolato. Here’s a link to an fully off-grid, passive solar Eco-Home that was designed and built nearly 30 years ago: http://land2plan.com/solar-pv-design/ Today’s AC to DC inverters are very efficient, but would be prohibitively expensive for the project in India.

Reply ↓ timbers February 2, 2017 at 7:30 am Just a quickie before heading to work: A couple of days ago on NPR Nina Totenburg said towards the end of her commentary and analysis of Trump prospects of getting what he wants with a matter-of-factly delivered “and Republicans can aways eliminate the filibuster anytime they want with a simple majority vote.” So different from eight years ago. Reply ↓ Uahsenaa February 2, 2017 at 11:44 am It’s interesting how Republicans can always get what they want through whatever means avails them, but when it comes to something even remotely progressive (ahem, with broad public support), then all of a sudden we need a broad, bipartisan coalition for reasons that never get explained. That way, when the whole thing falls apart, they can insist that it was just never meant to be. Reply ↓ OpenThePodBayDoorsHAL February 2, 2017 at 1:09 pm Whatever you may think of him, it’s amazing to watch Trump’s raw wielding of power, remarkable what one guy can do when he has actual convictions he actually gives a sh*t about.

Currently, the Wall Street/big bank’s thugs have almost destroyed the American middle/working class. Trump is trying to dismantle their strangle hold on the American economy, and they are viciously fighting back. They have- through ownership of all of the huge American media machine; and the fact that they own a large number of local, state and national legislators who inform the media choir promoting the Wall Street agenda- of stopping Trump from breaking their economic socio-political agendas and reversing many of their legal agendas; and can also provide the constant anti Trump monologue which in combination with their bought and paid for media/political allies who produce the media wall-to-wall manufactured anti Trump dialogue. Corporation’s overwhelming control of the media, political and social establishments; means that in order to reverse this anti democratic establishment socio/political control, Trump has to move quickly and effectively. The best chance for the corporate agenda to stop Trump from ending the Wall Street ‘elitist’ control and freeing and empowering the working majority; is a non stop wall-to-wall assault. Having 100% of the media to control the public dialogue for corporate interests and against the vast majority and Trump’s agenda to free them from corporate control means that Trump has almost no way to fight back except to dismantle the anti-democratic social/political and corporate structures as quickly as possible. As they have shown in the past with Lincoln and Kennedy they are very comfortable using social decapitation and even murder as a final solution to prevent change which would free and benefit the vast majority. Trump is very far from the corporate agenda projection of him.Contrary to the corporate owned and controlled illusion Trump is actually out to end their increasing strangle hold on wealth and the means to produce it.

Instead of making a hilarious meme out of “alternative facts,” Dems should be pushing an alternative, positive, forward-thinking vision, with issue-specific legislation and proposals. They should be taking advantage of people being willing to be out in the streets by making them partners in that positive vision.

Medicare for all would seem to be a natural for a progressive platform. But I attended an informal breakfast meeting last Saturday, of concerned Democrats in our small city, where the big question seemed to be, who can we get to run against our very conservative Congress person.

It is highly likely that neither will actually go to the Doctor, except for preventive care because of high deductibles and copays.Even with preventive care, unless the Doctors code it right, the offshoots ( time for your colonoscopy- time for your shingles shot) will come out of your first 5k that you are supposed to pay. And we know that the majority of americans have less than 4K in savings- and have seen what the 1k and 2k deductible premiums cost? What is the most likely is that those who are hovering in the 130% -140% range treat the policy as a insurance against er costs should they get hit by a bus. It is not much of a leap to suggest that if one’s income is 130-140% of the poverty level , then that person is more likely to be among the majority of Americans who have less than 5K in savings- often much less. And its obvious that this was more or less planned ( the famous “skin in the game” comments of the architects). Everyone associated with this should be damned ashamed. Expanded medicare for all is the only way out. No, I do not think it will happen but anything short of it will be just as bad or worse than the current status quo. Reply ↓ Pat February 2, 2017 at 8:02 am Actually, no it doesn’t. people who are at 138% of the poverty line qualify for expanded MEDICAID in states that accepted it. Yes, the government can claw back assets,if they have any after a certain age, but there is no immediate payment required. So it wasn’t even just technically correct, if they live in a state with expanded Medicaid they are right and you are incorrect. So the person in the article griping had a legitimate point. As do you. Both or you want a health care policy that provides health care for everyone. ACA did not as it hollowed out a huge middle to give a whole lot of private interests profits with no health care attached. Reply ↓ Anne February 2, 2017 at 8:34 am I think what most people want is a system where the insurance industry is no longer able to act as a barrier to actual care. If a married couple with 2 kids is paying $1,000/month for insurance, and has a $6,000 annual deductible to meet, that is almost $20,000/yr that is coming out of their pockets and going…where, exactly? Because the couple in question is my daughter and son-in-law and their two kids, and I can assure you that even if the well-child/adult visits, screenings and immunizations were not covered at 100% because of the mandates, they would not have had to pay anywhere near that for care in an average year. Okay, so what they aren’t “using” of their premiums is likely going to pay for someone else whose premiums don’t cover what the insurance is paying out in claims, but what is being built in isn’t for the insurance companies to get to zero in terms of dollars paid in v. dollars paid out, but for a third category – profit – to jump the line ahead of “dollars paid out.” I guess these companies subscribe to the “pay yourself first” philosophy: they take their cut and people just have to make do with whatever they decide is left over to pay actual claims. It is money that isn’t going into the general economy, money that can’t be set aside for retirement, or a 529 college plan. or even into savings as an emergency fund. I guess this is the part where I am reminded that the GOP wants my daughter to take that money and put it in a health savings account. Which is all well and good, but it isn’t solving the essential problem, which is that the insurance industry is more interested in enriching itself and its stockholders than it is in actual health care. How this is not obvious, i will never know, but I expect it has something to do with the fact that the people who have the power to restructure the system to put the emphasis on care, as opposed to insurance, have not faced the kinds of choices average people do, and many of them benefit from the current design. One wonders how much better our physical, mental and economic health would be in a system that puts care as a priority over profits. Reply ↓ Chris M. February 2, 2017 at 9:19 am And it’s not just a matter of deductibles. In our area (NE Ohio) the only semi-affordable plans, even after subsidy and a $5-6,000 deductible, have extremely narrow networks. The 2 major hospital systems are excluded, as are their docs. You are relegated to public or charity hospitals – mediocre, farther away, and accessible to the uninsured even before Obamacare. Medicaid patients have a broad network, including the two major systems. I’m convinced Obamacare put Trump over the top in Ohio. It did with our votes. Reply ↓ Pat February 2, 2017 at 9:23 am I don’t disagree with you. But I think it is simpler than that. It isn’t about the specific obstacle. Regardless of whether the obstacle is Insurance, or Big Pharma or Private Hospitals, most people just want a health care system where they can go to the doctor if they need to, get care if they need it and don’t have to bankrupt themselves either before or after going to the doctor. And they sure as hell don’t want to have to wade through sales marketing bull to pick a plan/doctor/hospital and examine long bills with outrageous prices that aren’t the same for everyone to make sure they aren’t being overcharged at any point in the process. They also don’t want to see someone else with a system that appears simpler and fairer to them because they aren’t poor enough or fortunate to be a CEO. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef February 2, 2017 at 10:11 am The scary part is I don’t know how much more expensive and worse it will get when it comes to health care.

Reply ↓ Katniss Everdeen February 2, 2017 at 10:45 am The most often cited figures are that 20 million people are participating in obamacare. Of those, 15 million “benefit” from Medicaid expansion while 5 million get “coverage” through insurance purchased on the exchanges. To date, 31 states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid. By far the state benefiting the most from the expansion was California, with 2,113,000 residents gaining Medicaid coverage, followed by New York (631,000) and Illinois (572,000). No surprise there. http://familiesusa.org/product/50-state-look-medicaid-expansion Most of the obamacare miracle “success” stories seem to come from those individuals who have gained access to “healthcare” through the Medicaid expansion, and most of the horror stories seem to come from those mandated by the “law” to purchase individual coverage on the exchanges. It really seems almost pointless to “debate” obamacare generally, since it is really two very different “programs” experienced and paid for in very different ways by participants, depending on which side of an arbitrary economic line one falls. Unfortunately for the clinton cohort of obamacare defenders, however, one thing does seem to be undeniable. The geographic distribution of obamacare screwees was inconsistent with an electoral college blowout last November. Reply ↓ Anne February 2, 2017 at 11:38 am If we want to get technical about it, aren’t all of us with insurance, whether purchased on an exchange, purchased on the individual market, obtained through ability to be covered via Medicaid, or who have employer-provided insurance, participating in “Obamacare?” So, it’s not like those of us with employer-based insurance won’t lose anything if the ACA is repealed – we will still have insurance, but many of us (probably depending on where we live) won’t have the mandated coverages the ACA required. As a proponent of single-payer, I was never a supporter of the warmed-over GOP/written-by-industry-lobbyists ACA or the long, slow implementation that allowed insurance companies to have years of lead time to raise premiums, and figure out how to game the parts they didn’t like, but to the extent that it has benefited millions who otherwise would have nothing, I can’t bring myself to cheer for its demise, especially knowing that whatever monstrosity “replaces” it is certain to provide even less benefit to all of us in one way or another. Insurance companies are a barrier to care, not a facilitator: they want you to have it, but they’d really rather you not actually use it. Reply ↓ jrs February 2, 2017 at 1:08 pm Another thing is that more and more employers while they may still help to pay the costs (it does help, it’s hardly nothing) are kicking employees on to individual type programs. It helps to have the metal tiers to even evaluate these, and know there are some standards for the various tiers (not good enough and very slippery standards with things like balance billing, as we know but … how is absolutely nothing better? It’s not) On the other hand the ACA is part of why employers are kicking employees on to these plans, the Cadillac tax etc.. Reply ↓ Katniss Everdeen February 2, 2017 at 2:40 pm ….mandated coverages the ACA required. See hobby lobby.

Went to an urgent care facility while visiting my daughter in a different state because she had an under-one-year-old and I had a resurgence of a cold sore (herpes); spent a long time waiting and maybe 5-10 minutes not with a doctor but with a nurse or equivalent. The bill was $303! That’s $1,818-$3,636/hour, for a nurse-practitioner and no fancy tests! I’m paying $40, which would be fair, probably even low (though it’s ($240-480/hour), if it were the whole price. But my insurance (Medicare Advantage) is paying $263. Who’s going to reimburse them (plus profit)? Has anyone explained why prices are so high, using actual costs rather than generalities about, say, the cost of technology? Reply ↓ Yusu February 2, 2017 at 7:50 am This French election is surprisingly interesting. Fillon’s demise opens the door for Macron, Hamon, or Melenchon to join Le Pen in the second round. Macron is polling at 20% on very similar policies to the extremely unpopular outgoing government (admittedly in ‘aspirational’ packaging). Hamon and Melenchon represent two alternatives for the European left. The former, who just won the socialist party primary against ex-prime minister Valls, is close to Varoufakis’ Diem25, which for economic reasons naked capitalism readers will be familiar with, stands for a new EU treaty to avoid a break up. Melenchon on the other hand is part of plan B, which considers Lexit an option in the short term. They also present two responses to unemployment, Hamon basic income and Melenchon increased government employment. Although it is still early, it seems unlikely that either left candidate can go through if both stand. A single left wing candidate would have a real chance. Reply ↓ PlutoniumKun February 2, 2017 at 8:50 am I’m not familiar with how the French nomination system works, but would it be possible for the mainstream right to dump Fillon and nominate someone else? Or are they stuck with him? It would seem the question now is that if they are stuck with Fillon, then the centre right voters have nowhere to go, so would whichever way they break could decide things. I would imagine that someone as slippery as Macron would be tempted to veer right to try to grab their attention. Reply ↓ european February 2, 2017 at 10:29 am I think they can still change the candidate. Xavier Bertrand is rumoured to have chances for that (don’t know him). Does anyone else think that Fillons problems are bad news for Le Pen? I know the polls said he would be her toughest opponent in the second round, but i never bought that. He is such a far right Thatcherite that the Left could never vote for him, not even against Le Pen. Macron is easier to swallow for the Left (not easy, easier!) and of course the neoliberal media love him. Reply ↓ David February 2, 2017 at 10:38 am That’s the question being furiously discussed now. There’s nothing in the party’s statutes to cover this kind of situation, which, as far as I know, has never arisen before in a French election. There seems to be no way in which Fillon can actually be forced to go, and, whilst most people now think his days are numbered, the longer he stays the worse it will get. But getting rid of him is only stage one. The more important question is who would replace him, and there is no natural candidate. Juppé, who was decisively beaten by Fillon in the primaries, has repeatedly said he won’t run. This could conceivably change, but even if he eventually does agree to run he’ll be typecast as the substitute introduced at the last moment. The other possibility is of course Sarkozy (whose people may be behind at least some of these leaks) who disappeared from public view after the primaries but is just starting to edge back into visibility again. There are three or four younger potential candidates but they don’t have much name recognition. But how would you go about deciding? Again, there are no rules about this. With less than three months to the election, organising another primary is impossible, and so the decision will have to be made by the grandees of a bitterly divided and shell-shocked party which only ten days ago was confident of victory. And many of the decision-makers have a personal stake, because they face their own electors for parliamentary seats shortly afterwards. Fillon’s core constituency is the provincial, rather old fashioned middle class, many of whom are in a state of shock right now. Some may stick with his replacement, some may defect to the FN, some to Dupont-Aignan (who picks up a reliable 3% or so each time) and possibly some to Macron, but he represents everything they dislike – young, arrogantly clever, wealthy merchant banker, and most of all a cynical opportunist of no fixed convictions. So long as Mélenchon and Hamon are at odds, the Left will probably not make it into the second round. As a result of recent events, the main Right-wing party may not either. A second round between two of Le Pen, Bayrou and Macron looks a real possibility. Oh, and it will get more complicated than this before April. Reply ↓ PlutoniumKun February 2, 2017 at 12:56 pm Now the inquiry is widening to include Fillon’s children. It seems they may have been on his state funded payroll too. This must surely sink him completely. Reply ↓ David February 2, 2017 at 1:46 pm Yes, Fillon himself admitted this in an ill-judged attempt at transparency, saying that two of his children were “avocats” – i.e. practising lawyers – with special technical knowledge. It later turned out that they were just law students and no-one is quite sure what they did. It’s typical of the man’s unforced errors: he seems to be constitutionally incapable of telling the truth. By rights he ought to be gone already but he’s still desperately clinging on, partly because no-one can agree on a replacement. Reply ↓ Sue Madden February 2, 2017 at 6:18 pm Agree, Fillon has handled this all through breathtakingly badly. However, hanging in there hardly seems an option, all the more so since this evening on “Complemente d`enquete” on France 2 they showed a clear video of an interview with Penelope Fillon for an article for the Sunday Telegraph from the crucial years (when she is now shown to have been paid a considerable salary by the state for her services) describing her modest house-wifely private life, saying very clearly that she didn`t work for her husband in any capacity. Reply ↓ Ed February 2, 2017 at 1:06 pm David Lindsay, who is an excellent blogger that NC readers should be more aware of, wrote that whoever makes it to the second round who is not Le Pen will win, so it might as well be Melenchon. If Fillon has to drop out, the Socialists and the establishment right for the first time in the history of the Fifth Republic will effectively not be fielding presidential candidates, both due to the completely avoidable error of holding US style primaries. Hamon is effectively the Green candidate. If Fillon has to drop out, the establishment right might as well back Bayrou, who is an idiot, but at least a right wing politician. Otherwise figure out a way to bring back Sarkozy. Macron, the other option, seems a bit too Tony Blair like and if the establishment right backs him they risk alot of defections of their voters to the FN. Reply ↓ Pat February 2, 2017 at 7:52 am Anecdote to connect to the Bruening article on ACA. Acquaintance who was one of the biggest supporters of ACA is young, an artist, and has an ongoing and expensive medical condition. One of my questions about how unwavering this support was was answered when they came out and admitted that they had made sure to put the full amount into an IRA so they could be sure they qualified for expanded Medicaid. IOW, once again that was the only thing that meant they would have the coverage they needed. Even with a subsidy, they couldn’t have afforded their health care with an exchange policy. Another acquaintance just had some needed heart surgery on Medicaid (I knew about how ACA worked for them.) I believe in single payer. I also believe that even with that, sometimes people will need more help from the system. I fought against the inequities of ACA from the beginning because it was clear that except for the very rich or the poor, ACA meant less and less health care for more and more money for everyone else. My problem with my acquaintance is that they couldn’t manage being grateful that it was good for them but notice that essentially having to use strings to remain on Medicaid obviously means that it is beyond inadequate as a national health CARE policy. And I found a lot of that kind of “I’m okay, so it is great!” mindlessness. Especially when trying to figure out why people didn’t like the policy.

Racism may be deplorable but that doesn’t make them irredeemable. Reply ↓ Eclair February 2, 2017 at 11:44 am Well, yes. And this teaser quote reflects what I have been screaming to the TV news presenters (my husband is celebrating his retirement by watching all the news programs he can find … oy!): “Once a portion of the region’s refugee populations began to move northward, into the European Union, the ruling political elites effectively transferred the costs to the working class, by crowding them out of already reduced social services that have shrunk under austerity, and expecting them to be accommodating. Protests from the working class were then labelled “racist” and “xenophobic,” especially by supposed “progressives”. The point here ought not to have been whether those who can least afford making room for refugees and migrants should be welcoming or hostile—the point is that Western nations should not have created those refugee populations in the first place, as they did with their invasions, occupations, and bombing campaigns.” Reply ↓ Katniss Everdeen February 2, 2017 at 12:02 pm ……. and expecting them to be accommodating. I would change that to demanding that they be accommodating, and vilifying them from every direction and in every way imaginable should they resist. Reply ↓ Uahsenaa February 2, 2017 at 8:22 am I watched most of the confirmation hearings and have to say that Tillerson seemed like the least wack-a-doodle of the nominees Trump put forth. Certainly when Lindsay Graham threw a temper tantrum over Jerusalem being the true capital of Israel (yes, this was the subject of an entire line of questioning), Tillerson looked like the adult in the room. And if Graham is against him, he can’t be all bad. DeVos and Mnuchin, on the other hand, were complete weasels. Reply ↓ Pat February 2, 2017 at 9:27 am I didn’t watch, but truth be told after reading some of the transcripts I agree with you. Although I would add Price on the unacceptables for generally being an asshole just more upfront about it than DeVos and Mnuchin, weasels AND assholes. Reply ↓ Uahsenaa February 2, 2017 at 11:33 am Price was bad as well. He constantly evaded–and not very deftly at that–questions concerning a whole host of issues, most notably the Repulican desire to block grant Medicaid funding, when the Medicaid expansion was one of the few genuinely good things to come out of the ACA. DeVos has no business being anywhere near public education in the US. She has no clue what is actually involved in teaching, and if she weren’t filthy rich, no one would pay her opinions on the matter any mind at all. Perhaps because I am an educator myself, this one hits particularly close to home. And Mnuchin actually tried to make it seem like foreclosing on people was the only honorable thing to do in the situation! Reply ↓ Lynne February 2, 2017 at 12:38 pm Honestly, it seems to me that the Democrats concerned with Bannon and Trump, not to mention the uproar over immigration bans, would rush to get Tillerson approved, to counterbalance Bannon’s noxious influence.

Reply ↓ Jim Haygood February 2, 2017 at 10:05 am ‘I understand he makes his living from fees and commissions because he has knowledge and time to evaluate them.‘ There’s a difference between fees and commissions. An adviser who charges only a fee (say 1 percent of the amount managed annually) isn’t paid to favor particular products. Whereas commissions create biases — toward particular products, toward churning. The Labor Dept’s fiduciary rule was supposed to end such bad incentives for retirement accounts. But Wall Street delayed it so they can keep ripping off the public. Reply ↓ kgc February 2, 2017 at 9:55 pm Not to mention incentives (neither overt fees nor overt commissions) to steer clients to products favored by management, often issued by affiliates of the asset manager. Or just paying higher fees (though the SEC does – currently – require disclosure of after-fee returns, which helps). Or… or… so many possibilities, so little time! But trying to manage your own investments takes more time, including learning the industry and the many different scamming structures, than most people have. I spent more than 20 years in the industry and can grok most scams (i.e., products posing as high-yield that actually benefit the issuer/adviser) in a few minutes. But even now, in semi-retirement, I don’t actively trade or watch markets. I don’t have the time. Reply ↓ PlutoniumKun February 2, 2017 at 8:36 am Re: Immigration and Capital Zero Anthropology. Must read. One thing I’d add to this analysis is that the left has always in my opinion been hamstrung by the Marxist insistence on the international unity of the working class. This has always resulted in the left having a very contradictory and confused approach to nationalism. This can be seen most overtly in countries like Ireland, where the left wing has always been completely divided between the ‘internationalist’ strand represented by the mainstream left (both soft and hard left), which completely rejects the notion that it is progressive to support Irish unification on the basis of working class unity, and so frequently found itself implicitly supporting British colonialism and imperialism. The ‘nationalist’ strand of the left, represented by Sinn Fein and smaller hard left splinter groupings end up having a firmer grip on the working classes, while the ‘internationalist’ left finds itself working happily with the establishment. It was an old joke in Irish left wing circles that the Left loved national liberation movements, so long as they were at least 5,000 miles away from Europe. You can see similar splits in other countries with nationalist questions, such as in the Basque or Catalonian parts of Spain. Ultimately, it comes down to confused thinking. By insisting on an international working class struggle and anti-racism, the left has found itself with the millstone of being pro-immigration and anti-nationalist (in the broadest sense) around its neck. Working class people who care about their communities find themselves excluded from this narrative at best, or at worst accused of being racist, when all they want is to keep their communities intact and to maintain some strength in negotiating with the bosses. Of course, anti-immigration policies can be racist. If you look at 19th Century American labour history the conflict over business bringing in cheap biddable Chinese labour resulted in a very nasty racist backlash against all Asians. In mining towns like Butte, Montana, Japanese-American small business owners were driven out by a backlash against coolie labour – and this was orchestrated by mining unions. There is I think undoubtedly parallels in the way the modern IT industry is using Asia as a cheap recruiting ground for biddable workers, just as the construction and mining industry did 150 years ago. But the lesson has to be learned that it should be possible to oppose this, without being racist. Its a tricky balance, but if the left doesn’t find a way to do it, it will repeatedly be outmanoevered in working class communities by right wing populists. Reply ↓ Ted February 2, 2017 at 11:21 am “The Left” is not an essential political identity. As the article argues, a political left that has as a central logic the idea that labor has interests in direct opposition to capital is the only left that can make a difference for working people (e.g., all people who are not capitalists, no mater where they hail from). Most of “the left” today are liberals or “progressives” of one stripe or another who seek to further the growth of capital and hopefully one day count themselves among the ranks of capitalists (although as aspirant capitalists they would be in favor of all of the most popular humanitarian causes of their day should they ever find themselves with a seat in the executive suite). For this “left” the growth of capital under a veneer of magazine inspired liberal humanitarianism is the very definition of “progress”…and has been since the 19th century Victorians made this sort of thing a high art. The “left” that has nearly died from the suffocating pressure of having its neck stomped by the jackboots of “progrssives” everywhere, is a left that keeps the conflict between labor and capital in the modern world system its central feature. Reply ↓ OpenThePodBayDoorsHAL February 2, 2017 at 1:50 pm Hear hear, there’s a very simple litmus test: is it good for labor, or good for capital. “Good for labor” should be defined as “increases wage income as a share of national income”, not “adds to my pathetic 401k”. The idea that tiny crumbs in a 401k somehow offset the unimaginable gains by the rentier owners of the means of production with their assets held tax-free offshore with a bought-and-paid-for crony state protecting their monopolies is a joke.

I just notice that the base seems annoyed with it’s neos and agree with the Rs that liberal is a dirty word so the base has adopted the term progressive. People are going to look up what progressive is. First peek is usually wiki: 5 aspects of progressivism? Nobility of Western civilization; worth of economic/technological growth; scientific/scholarly knowledge obtained through reason over faith; the intrinsic importance and worth of life on Earth. In other words: imperialism, economic growth, technocratic, separation of church and state (that’s laughable), worth of life Progressivism….. is a strategy not an ideology. It is grounded in history as a method for advancing liberal ideals. An ameliorating strategy of conservatism not an opposition strategy. It is still a corporate philosophy… unionization and regulation as strategy – is an acceptance of corporations as the base structure. Conservatism: Here’s a convo on conservatism with a definition I find accurate: Neo-liberal: [maybe you have heard the definition of a neoliberal: a liberal who has been mugged by reality but refuses to press charges. In any case, one of the salient developments of the late 1960s and 1970s was the intellectual journey of various liberals and social democrats toward conservative positions and affiliations. By the early 1980s many of them were participating in the Reagan Revolution.] http://www.nationalreview.com/article/434548/conservative-intellectuals-george-nash-traces-history Additional…Liberal: What’s the difference between a liberal and a progressive: very little. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-sirota/whats-the-difference-betw_b_9140.html Additional….Progressive: http://www.politicususa.com/2013/06/15/liberals-progressives-difference-matters.html… Progressivism… having pragmatic discussions with the center-right. Even when some recognize that, in ways, liberalism has morphed into liberal rights for capital and identity politics, there is the forgotten aspect of progressivism as, with it’s own historical debate (which I find problematic) a strategy for advancing liberalism. R 25 of the vote and D 26% of the vote. If I am asked to pick sides, the answer is no… let’s you and him fight. Neos 8.6 liberals 8.6 progressives 8.6% of the vote. If I am asked to pick sides, the answer is no…. let’s you and him and him fight. Based on what I am seeing, the argument isn’t to move left, but merely in-fighting of the appropriately defined 3 branch coalition of the Democrat party. Imperialism, economic growth, technocratic, separation of church and state, worth of life? No thanks. Which brings me back to: Republicans/conservatives have a five plank ideology/platform. Democrats are Republican-lite. Neo-liberals are conservative-lite. Liberals are neo-liberal-lite. Progressives are liberal-lite. Stated it once, will state it again…. the only way to get rid of a neo-liberal is if a progressives hands are wrapped around their neck… it’s a cold-dead hands situation. Reply ↓ Lee February 2, 2017 at 12:25 pm The nation state is the largest, most powerful jurisdictional unit over which citizens currently have even a long shot at controlling. Given nation states’ monopolies on currency production, the means of coercion, and as a source of widely shared sense of individual and group identity, wielding their power is an absolutely necessary step toward any possibility of workers of the world ever uniting. A country like the U.S., which is large, powerful and containing enough human and natural resources to achieve a high degree of autarky and therefore independence, could serve well as a positive, progressive exemplar to the working classes of other nations. I won’t hold my breath but one can dream, can’t one? Reply ↓ Kurt Sperry February 2, 2017 at 2:47 pm I would go further and say the US is almost the only country large and potentially autonomous enough to actually put “a positive, progressive exemplar to the working classes of other nations” into practice against globalist opposition. If anything remotely resembling the true economic left ever took power in the US, the the (good) shock waves would circle the globe. Not to get exceptionalist but, like the USD as the only viable global reserve currency, the US political process is probably going to have to be the tool that pries the labor/capital balance back to a more even footing. Size matters here. Reply ↓ Foppe February 2, 2017 at 2:20 pm PK: But the lesson has to be learned that it should be possible to oppose this, without being racist.

The way the Dutch SP tries to do it is by emphasizing the fact that we shouldn’t encourage the destruction of foreign communities by inviting those who are of use to us to emigrate; and to discourage emigration by arguing for development programs ‘there’. It’s a hard sell, though, even within the party, because of people’s associations with being “welcoming”, and the refugee discourse. Also, no money, so only a long-term ‘solution’, which makes it seem like a cop-out.

The left wing there has traditionally been much more anti-immigrant than in Sweden or much of the rest of Europe in that they seem to have believed that it is impossible to maintain a strong social safety net if there is a large inflow of poorer immigrants. I suspect they are right about that – but it still hasn’t stopped Denmark from having a strong populist right party.

The final section, “It’s almost comforting, in a way, to imagine yourself as a pawn. There’s no moral duty involved”, reminds me of work done by Judy Butler and others about the dangers of reliance on critique in the academy. It seems as if we’ve made ends of the means provided by the Frankfurt School: Adorno and others praised criticism, but I doubt they’d see the way most engage with criticism as constructive. Stop critiquing, come up with new ideas! Reply ↓ Patricia February 2, 2017 at 10:18 am Yes, more new ideas, please! To re-quote from politico article: “It’s almost comforting, in a way, to imagine yourself as a pawn. There’s no moral duty involved: The evil plan is grand and inscrutable; it gives a sense of order in what looks like disintegration, and tells you what your place is in it. But there is a moral duty, and we need to face up to it. And maybe, just maybe, sometimes the people in charge are just as blinkered as we are.” IMO, one part of our problem is that we are too familiar with novels, tv shows, and films. In art, nothing happens that is not later found to be important. Details are clues that affect story plot and help determine the conclusion. But life isn’t that way. Life’s tales are many, contradictory, overlapping. In life, one needs to stay loose, recognize happenstance, be ok with uncertainty, not indulge magical thinking. Another aspect regarding the stories we’ve been told is how evil is handled. It’s often given more 3-dimensionality than the good to make clear its fearsomeness and to produce some adrenalin flow. To serve this, evil people/groups are often played as geniuses while the good people/groups are ‘common folk’ who win by the skin of their teeth or by lucking out just because they are good. This is disempowering–our stories need to do better on this. Art is not life. Reply ↓ cocomaan February 2, 2017 at 1:39 pm I really like your observation about how evil is portrayed as having an enormous amount of cunning. George RR Martin’s book series, made into Game of Thrones, has a number of conniving characters who are wholly evil and seem always to be successful (moreso in the show than the books). There’s a little movement in fantasy circles against what they call “grimdark“. I don’t wholly share the impulse, but it’s an interesting foil to popular culture. Reply ↓ Kurt Sperry February 2, 2017 at 3:10 pm Greed almost always has far better organizational competence than altruism. Greed is an obsessive, all-consuming beast with fangs; altruism and empathy are more like distracted puppies. No contest. Reply ↓ Patricia February 2, 2017 at 4:59 pm Yeah, greed is an endlessly driving beast. I wouldn’t say that altruism is its foil, though. Empathy might be, although it’s a tool used by successful sociopaths as well as, say, SJWs. Maybe greed’s foil is ‘loving neighbor as self’—humans need it to be healthy (so it contains drive), and part of its power is that it broadens/spreads rather than absorbing/narrowing. The problem with this kind of love is that it makes people happy/comfortable, which can minimize drive, until threatened. Perhaps.

You do nothing but bend over backwards for power. You thought Clinton was going to be the next President so you pack of hyenas savaged Sanders day after day until she won. Then you had no clue why Trump had any traction. Here is why: Obama screwed over the entire country by fixing wall street and letting the rest of us twist in the wind. Of course to find out about how bad he screwed us over you would have to find real reporters. http://www.commondreams.org/news/2009... and http://www.billmoyers.com/2015/02/14/... Rather than condemn his selling out to wall street he got nothing but praise from the mainstream. He dropped more bombs than bush and got heaps of praise for that too. Just how far were you willing to go to avoid criticizing him because of his race? White guilt. He can be a good person who does bad things and that does not say a damn thing about any other black person in this country. I have never regretted voting for someone so much in my life.

He ultimately ruled that state court prosecutions of tribal citizens for offenses committed on tribal lands “strongly suggest[ed]” county officials in eastern Utah were involved in “a renewed campaign to undo the tribal boundaries [already] settled” by higher courts. “Gorsuch also wrote a 2013 decision that renewed a historical accounting lawsuit aimed at benefitting Osage Nation citizens.” https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/politics/trump-chooses-neil-gorsuch-us-supreme-court/ Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef February 2, 2017 at 12:11 pm Can we redo NAFTA?

Reply ↓ Pat February 2, 2017 at 10:11 am So this is all about the release of the hacked DNC and Podesta emails to the public right? So here are some very important Questions for you: What 17 agencies “investigated” the so-called Russian interference in our elections? How did these investigations fit into their jurisdiction? How many of those 17 agencies and which have been involved with the forensic examination of the DNC server? Private corporations investigating have a legal obligation to tell the truth to the American public right? Or is their obligation to the entity that hired them and so they are under no obligation to report anything but what their employers which? The DNC has no reason to lie or obstruct about this, right? Yahoo has never been hacked by non government bad actors, right? If the goal of the Russian government is to guarantee that Hillary Clinton does not get elected how does the mere release of these emails which received less coverage than the iconography of the Beyonce pregnancy announcement today accomplish this? And how did the Russian government convince Clinton and the Clinton campaign to ignore the power of the electoral college and limit their ground operations and campaign appearances in states they needed? Here’s the thing, I’ll get up in arms about Russia interfering in our election when people who haven’t repeatedly lied to the public about such important things as weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, mass surveillance of Congress AND the public, and their programs to render and torture people provide more evidence than “these things that could all apply to bad actors not attached to the Russian government really do mean the Russian government were behind this, trust us!” Reply ↓ A February 2, 2017 at 10:33 am You know, it’s possible to believe both things – that Hillary ran a flawed campaign AND that Russia was involved. Emails didn’t get coverage, are you kidding me? Both the HUGE scandal of Hillary using a private server (how quaint when compared to Trump’s hidden tax returns just for starters), and the content of the hacked DNC and Podesta emails were covered constantly. Which agencies? I don’t know all 17, but isn’t FBI getting FISA warrants and then signing onto the assessment enough? The fact that CIA was wrong on Iraq and WMD – though wasn’t it Cheney’s shadow intelligence – doesn’t mean they’re wrong on everything. And the ongoing investigation goes beyond hacks – it’s Trump’s campaign’s collusion and taking Russian money. Here’s a cute video of Sam B interviewing Russian trolls.

When something fails, you do not blame someone and anyone else: you have a deep, hard, painful look in the mirror at what failed and why. In our case that was the Bush/Obama/Hilary continuum and the ongoing saga of the party that used to represent the interests of the great swath of Americans, not just billionaires and foreign countries. That party just re-appointed a leader who then stated “I don’t think the people want change”.

Reply ↓ Pat February 2, 2017 at 12:01 pm First off no Russian official or spy told Hillary Clinton to try to avoid FOIA by using a private server that was her own stupidity, entitlement and yes incompetence. Coverage of that was totally inadequate if only because most of America still doesn’t know about the lack of encryption for the first months she used it and still haven’t realized that yes it was to avoid the public’s clear legal right to know what she was doing as State that she did it in the first place. Oh, and that without a full forensic examination of the server itself it was impossible for any investigatory agency to truly say it had not been hacked by outside forces – yes Russia. Oh, and China, Israel, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Great Britain, etc because if they didn’t their spies weren’t doing their job. Two. Seventeen agencies didn’t investigate. The office which speaks for seventeen agencies released the first public notice that this was happening and was conflated by Clinton herself (in apparently a failure of reading comprehension not to mention knowledge of security protocols) to seventeen agencies investigated and said. Most of them would have little or no jurisdiction in these matters. Three. No public investigatory agency has examined the DNC server. That was done by a private company hired by the DNC themselves. They denied access to the server to the government. See the comment above about hacking. Four getting FISA warrants is pretty much pro forma anymore. And no their signing on to the assessment doesn’t mean diddly to me. Give me something other than cyrillic keyboards and Russian holidays. As for lying, I didn’t just mention Iraq. I mentioned a couple of recent things one of which the FBI was right in the middle of. And I didn’t even get into the whole long FBI history of manipulating people and evidence. Show me where there is any evidence of this investigation into Trump collusion and taking Russian money. Facts not speculation. So sources and ones that aren’t talking about rumors and preferably have more than one source. As for full coverage, when you can show me two voters who either stayed home or didn’t vote for Clinton who were intending to do so before the releases who can tell me five revelations from the hacks that changed their minds that were actually in the releases. Pizzagate and Terrorist Huma do not count. Although I do have to wonder if those people you know were ever intending to vote for Clinton. The Russian thing is an excuse. Period. Clinton lost because she was the wrong candidate at the time, with the terrible instincts who ran an incompetent campaign. Putin didn’t force her to cheat. Or to ignore and insult Sanders supporters. He didn’t tell her to try to win the election by campaigning for moderate Republican voters. He sure as hell didn’t tell her to run against Trump not for anything that the public might want. Clinton did NOT have this election stolen from her SHE LOST and doesn’t want to admit to herself that she is the reason. And the people who didn’t bother to leave the beltway bubble that put all their support on her are trying to find anything that means they didn’t fall for the con that it was her turn and she was inevitable. We have much bigger problems than the Russians. Or giving Clinton an out. Reply ↓ A February 2, 2017 at 12:44 pm Yesterday the Democrats sent a letter demanding Pentagon investigate Flynn taking money from Russia (for an appearance on RT *and on other separate occasions*). We shall see if anything comes out of this. But if FBI getting warrants and signing onto the assessment doesn’t mean anything to you, then why would any evidence presented by them in the future? I’m not denying any of what you said about Clinton’s campaign. But I don’t see how anyone can deny that multiple factors caused her to (barely) loose, that Russian hacks & trolls, the FBI letter, AND voter suppression all played a huge role. Our biggest problem right now is that we have an insane person in the white house. Reply ↓ Foppe February 2, 2017 at 2:36 pm No, the biggest problem right now is that we live in a historical context in which all except the corporate and status-quo-endorsed candidates can win. Creating alternative organizational structures, news media/communication platforms is far more important than pondering the relative (in)sanity of the dude about whose election both parties are mostly sanguine, if you ignore the fact that he/his winning broke lots of rice bowls. (Again, if the Dems really consider him a protofascist, why did they put up a hack as their preferred alternative? Why did they allow Her to suck all money/energy from all down-ballot races, thus guaranteeing 2/3 branches of govt would be in GOP hands?) Reply ↓ Pat February 2, 2017 at 4:28 pm The Democrats sent a letter. Waaa waa. So after almost a year being told that speaking fees that totaled well over a million for MULTIPLE speaking engagements with Goldman Sachs meant nothing, NOW the Democratic leadership is concerned about speaking engagements. So we get a letter asking about a speaking engagement in Russia with Putin from 2015 by the RETIRED Flynn, linking it to the emoluments clause because in 2015 Flynn knew Trump would run for President, slaughter 17 other candidates to get the nomination and the Democrats would be stupid enough to nominate Hillary Clinton so he might have a job in the government again. Let’s get this straight. No, she did not barely lose, she lost big time by the only count that matters – 304 to 166. Do you get that, she lost so many states that despite winning a few big ones she lost by 138 votes out of only 470. If you take out California from the vote totals, Trump also had the majority of the cast ballot votes. One state and one state alone accounts for her entire popular vote lead. Yes, it was close, but not as close as many Clinton supporters would like. It wasn’t barely lost. She blew it. Stop making excuses. Russia is not and was not the problem here. Not paying attention to the real state of the Union and what voters want and need was. If Trump worries you so much go after his actions, try to make Democrats act like they oppose him. It took how many confirmation votes for not Vice President Kaine to say no? But more importantly try to get them to actively change direction and providing real leadership by offering alternatives to what is going on here and letting people start demanding that – similar to the demands to repeal the ACA… Focusing on Russia is not going to accomplish anything but allow Democrats to ignore their massive mistakes and continue business as usual of blaming someone else for their failure to lead and represent their voters. Reply ↓ A February 2, 2017 at 6:06 pm No, it is not a violation because he is part of Trump’s campaign but because he is a retired general who always needs to clear foreign payments, for the rest of his life. And he didn’t. And my emphasis was on payments on other separate occasions, not the speaking fee. Why take away Calfironia?? Didn’t realize a huge state can just be thrown out but every rural vote is precious and significant. Why don’t we take away Texas and count the EC votes then! Focusing on Russia will accomplish them not thinking they can get away with meddling in our elections without consequences. You bet the focus will continue. Reply ↓ lyman alpha blob February 2, 2017 at 6:02 pm Why waste taxpayer dollars investigating whether Flynn got paid by RT? Let’s just assume he did. Where exactly is the problem?

And if your argument is going to be that RT is state owned propaganda as opposed to CNN, MSNBC, etc. maybe you should do a little research about who those outlets really answer to. A tip for you – read the leaked emails and see who it was that asked the media to support Trump in the Repub primary in the first place, which the media proceeded to do like the good little pro-establishment lapdogs that they are.

Orrin Hatch’s office three times to voice her concerns about President Donald Trump’s administration. Each time, after a series of rings, she reaches the same message: “I’m sorry, but that mailbox is full. Please try again later.” And then the call disconnects. It’s a hurdle that purportedly hundreds of Utahns have faced in recent weeks, trying to reach the senator’s office. With a flood of new executive orders from Trump — including the controversial refugee-and-immigration edict — and Cabinet nominee hearings, many residents hoped to give input to Hatch, R-Utah, that he might take into account during votes. But most haven’t been able to get through. Later in the article, Sen. Hatch blames the problem on robocalls. Maybe, but I’m skeptical. When The Salt Lake Tribune tried phoning Hatch’s Washington, D.C., number, the line went to the full voicemail message and hung up.

Theoretical models – better models usually come out of better data so you can start to sift out the noise from the signal. Better quality data with more granularity allows for models to be better calibrated so that you can see when your empirical coefficients are working or not. When your empirical coefficients have to big a spread on their possible values, then you know you need a secondary model within them. 3. So the data are the key. It is critical to continue to focus on getting more and better data. Only data can help calibrate the models and point out shortcomings. This is tough, gritty work that costs money, takes time, and needs to be planned and funded years in advance. Faster computers will just give more precision to wrong models if the data is not there to support and calibrate. The unique geography of the United States gives a dual threat of coastal hurricanes and interior thunderstorms and tornados unlike pretty much anywhere else in the world. Both are difficult to model and need lots of research and data to improve predictions. Reply ↓ Katharine February 2, 2017 at 11:13 am Love your opening comment! Reply ↓ DarkMatters February 2, 2017 at 12:26 pm “Will Global Warming Make Hurricane Forecasting More Difficult?“ What delicious irony: an article predicting future difficulty of prediction! I agree with DH’s call for improving our technical resources and meteorological data, and fully expect this to be done. However, hurricanes seem to be one of the unwarranted sources of alarmism in the climate change controversy. I do mean controversy: the climate “consensus” is misrepresented, and corporate anti-warming research money pales into insignificance compared with pro-warming research funding; which side is more tainted, I mean influenced, by financial incentive is moot, and at this point, irrelevant. Having vented a little, I’ll call attention to a 2011 article by well-known hurricane researcher Christopher W. Landsea. Under his Climate Change is Real heading, he describes how he interprets this phrase: “there is substantial evidence – in my view – that mankind has caused a significant portion of this warming through greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane. I do not know whether the human contribution toward the warming is relatively small (~a quarter) or large (~two-thirds), but do agree that there is quite a bit of evidence that mankind is altering the global climate and will continue to do so in the future.“ Hardly one of the chicken-little flock. His tepid level of anxiety persists throughout this comprehensive article. At the end of a carefully enunciated discussion, he presents his conclusion: With “business as usual emission”, he estimates a 2-3 C temperature rise by 2100, and that this will change hurricanes as follows: Frequency: Numbers may see a moderate decrease (~25%) Wind (Intensity): Small increase (~3% stronger) Storm Surge: Small increase (~3% higher) produced by the hurricane (but also must add on additional amount from overall sea level rise) Rainfall: Moderate increase per cyclone (~10% within ~325 km [200 mi]), but reduced overall numbers may offset increase per cyclone Genesis Location/Track: Somewhat uncertain, but no indications of large changes These conclusions, based on status-quo inaction, are hardly apocalyptic. I would like to see more open debate between parties on climate issues (especially on feedback mechanisms and cloud behavior). It’s often possible to judge the merits of an argument by the rhetoric brought to bear. But such public arguments seem to be scarce: climate sceptics have accused advocates of flat out refusing to engage. Perhaps, but I really don’t know whether the accusation is justified. Reply ↓ reslez February 2, 2017 at 7:14 pm So according to that guy we don’t have to worry about hurricanes. Cool. Of course sea levels will be 20-30 feet higher. I don’t know if that counts as apocalyptic but it might be prudent to move away from the coasts.

Bloomberg is very kind to act as a mouthpiece for them and repeat what they say without critique. Hey execs, here’s a crazy idea: you can train them yourself and offer raises to keep them from leaving! To a degree, this is a problem that employers have greatly contributed to themselves by slashing jobs and training at the first sign of a slow down so they can hit their numbers for a quarter or two. Reply ↓ Jim February 3, 2017 at 1:47 am from the article: “While the tech sector is offshoring to plug the skills gap, U.S. manufacturers have relied even more heavily on another trend: automation, which helps them to compete with lower-cost foreign labor markets. Large employers are also using contingent workers, who work on-demand, as a way to stay nimble. One-third of companies predicted that 30 percent of their workforce will be flexible in the next year.” It takes years to develop skilled machinists and other tradespeople necessary for industrial manufacturing. That sure as hell isn’t going to happen when “30 percent of their workforce” will be contingent. The jobs have to be real, the “tribal knowledge” has to be passed along, the institutional memory has to be intact. Based on several decades working at the largest airplane manufacturer in the US, I’d say the chance of your typical MBA understanding that is pretty low. Reply ↓ Ulysses February 2, 2017 at 10:51 am From the ZeroAnthropology piece linked above: “You will see your capitalist bosses keeping wages down and workers cowed and oppressed by (among other things) hiring immigrants whose experience of extreme poverty, violence, and other forms of misery in their lands of origin make them more than ready to work obediently and without outward complaint for $10 an hour or less in ‘modern manufacturing’”. The reality is far worse. Cowed workers from Honduras are a pretty cheap source of labor– but they can’t match the practically free labor available to U.S. capitalists in US. prisons: that house one in every four prisoners worldwide. “The 13th Amendment still allows for slavery and involuntary servitude if it’s used as punishment for a crime. According to the Marshall Project, federal work programs pay up to $1.15 an hour while wages at state prisons average 20 cents an hour.

Persistent surpluses (three years in a row) above 6pc of GDP are illegal. Germany is not even close to compliance, and the picture has been getting worse, not better. Germany’s structural surplus is a different and separate issue from currency manipulation. In a world of irredeemable fiat currencies, they’re all manipulated. Criticism of Germany from Britain, whose pound sterling has shed 15% of its value vs the USD since last June, is particularly rich. It’s like one sex worker denouncing another as a prostitute.

People in urban areas face other monopolies, but they’re driven by the same concentrated financial power. The ideology of Democrats should be to break up that power. Tell that to these Democratic Senators in the pocket of the drug & bank monopolies Between 2010 and 2016, a handful of the Democratic senators who voted “nay” were amongst the top Senate recipients funded by pharmaceutical companies: Sen. Booker received $267,338; Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) received $254,649; Robert Casey (D-PA) received $250,730; Michael Bennet (D-CO) received $222,000. As the former mayor of Newark, Cory Booker faced corruption scandals and increased crime and unemployment levels as his star power outside the state rose. He is heavily favored by Wall Street, with securities and investment firms donating $1.88 million to Booker during the 2014 midterm elections; their second-favorite candidate was Mitch McConnell.

The other is that this shell game collapses if interest rates rise. Reply ↓ Ed February 2, 2017 at 11:51 am On the Mike Whitney article, as Matt Stoller has pointed out, the statistic that life expectancy fell is all you need to know. In my lifetime, the media has always been over-hyping the American economy, turning what on the face of it are mild upturns into booms and turning declines into “recoveries”, and this dates back at least to the Reagan administration. Trump has actually already tried to correct that by having the government publish the accurate unemployment figure. He already found out that the government already publishes the more accurate unemployment figure (U6 instead of U3) but the media just ignores it and publishes the rosier one anyway. Of course, the fact alone that Trump is President will likely change this. Reply ↓ Lynne February 2, 2017 at 1:51 pm I know retirees who are desperate to see rates rise. Right now, their savings gets minuscule returns and Wall Street gets fat. And anytime I mention the economy to Dems, they proudly proclaim that the stock market went up “thanks to Obama.” How can so many people believe that the stock market is the economy? That’s a serious question. I don’t understand. Of course, now we’re no longer supposed to care about the stock market since it didn’t crash upon inauguration. That will change as soon as there is a correction, no doubt. Reply ↓ Ed February 2, 2017 at 11:45 am “Liberals On the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown Politico. Excellent read, better than the headline.

A few weeks ago, people were saying that we should wait until Trump has done some things as President before criticizing him. Well, at that time, he had already stated his intention to nomination Pruitt, Mnuchin, DeVos, and other unqualified or unethical people to high office, so it was quite appropriate to criticize him then. Now, it continues to be appropriate to criticize Trump for the terrible things his is doing. http://www.npr.org/2017/02/02/513028085/senate-republicans-bypass-another-boycott-by-democrats-to-advance-epa-nominee Reply ↓ Anne February 2, 2017 at 12:50 pm And not only could we end up with Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary, it looks like we are getting Jerry Falwell, Jr. to “reform” education regulations: The Trump administration has asked Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. to lead a panel on reform of higher education regulations, the leader of the evangelical Christian school said Tuesday. “In the Department of Education, there’s too much intrusion into the independent accreditation,” Falwell told The Washington Post in a telephone interview. “There’s too much intrusion into the operation of universities and colleges.

That is not correct. People who are on Medicaid in my state of California between the ages of 55 and 65 get those managed care costs clawed back from their estates, 100%. That can be $40,000 annually. That’s ok if you don’t own anything, but for those who own homes and hope to pass on to family when they die can forget about it. That’s why I turned it down, will pay the fine, and hopefully won’t experience critical health problems before I’m eligible for Medicare.

Reuters reports that the settlement made public on Wednesday requires approval by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman in Manhattan. It follows JPMorgan's agreement last January to pay $1.42 billion in cash to resolve most other claims, in what had been an $8.6 billion lawsuit against the largest U.S. bank to recoup money for Lehman creditors. JPMorgan, which had been Lehman's largest secured creditor, was accused of exploiting its leverage as Lehman's main "clearing" bank to siphon critical liquidity in the last few days before Lehman went bankrupt on Sept. 15, 2008. Lehman creditors have maintained that JPMorgan unnecessarily extracted billions of dollars of collateral, and by doing so obtained a windfall at their expense.

Watters, 48, had said he wanted to retire from the bank later this year, according to a memo sent to employees by consumer and community banking chief Gordon Smith and seen by Reuters. Watters recently oversaw the launch of the Sapphire Reserve premium credit card, which attracted attention for its lucrative bonuses for new accounts. Piepszak, 46, is currently head of business banking under Smith and has been at the bank for more than 23 years, according to the memo. She will hold both jobs until a successor is named, Smith said. Watters has been with the bank for 18 years. Before running the card business, he was in charge of mortgages as that business tried to adjust to the aftermath of the financial crisis. Smith described Watters as "someone who runs to a fire." Piepszak had worked under Watters in mortgages. As head of business banking for two years, she has overseen increases in deposits and loans, Smith said. Card accounts increased nearly 20 percent in 2016 as the bank offered additional incentives to attract customers. JPMorgan and Citigroup Inc have been competing more aggressively the last two years in cards, which they have seen as one their most promising business. Cards became relatively more attractive than capital markets under post-crisis capital rules. Both banks believe they can profitably take business from American Express Co which has long enjoyed higher returns on equity. The executive changes were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.

The settlement made public yesterday requires approval by US Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman in Manhattan. It follows JPMorgan’s agreement last January to pay US$1.42 billion in cash to resolve most other claims, in what had been an US$8.6 billion lawsuit against the largest US bank to recoup money for Lehman creditors. JPMorgan, which had been Lehman’s largest secured creditor, was accused of exploiting its leverage as Lehman’s main “clearing” bank to siphon critical liquidity in the last few days before Lehman went bankrupt on Sept. 15, 2008. Lehman creditors have maintained that JPMorgan unnecessarily extracted billions of dollars of collateral, and by doing so obtained a windfall at their expense. In a court filing, lawyers for Lehman said the settlement avoids the uncertainty of continued litigation and millions of dollars of additional legal fees, and is “in the best interests of the Lehman estate and its creditors.” No one admitted wrongdoing, the settlement agreement said. JPMorgan has already set aside money for the accord, according to a regulatory filing. A hearing to consider approval is scheduled for Feb. 16. Once Wall Street’s fourth-largest bank, Lehman reported US$639 billion of assets when it filed for Chapter 11 protection, making its bankruptcy by far the largest in US history. Lehman emerged from bankruptcy in March 2012, and has since been winding down. Creditors have recouped more than US$110 billion, and bondholders once projected to receive just 21 cents on the dollar have recovered close to twice that sum. ― Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Uphill task for Geely if Proton deal goes through, research house says Chatime owner accuses Malaysian franchisee of using unapproved ingredients KL shares higher at mid-day If Trump hits China, regional demand would ease blow in Asia Moody’s eyes downgrade for Sime Darby after planned units spin-off Jakim’s new certification enables Halal Pharmaceuticals to expand locally, globally US airlines tumble amid fear Trump travel ban will spread An iPhone made in America?

Theresa May wants to avoid that mistake. by Simon Kennedy @simonjkennedy More stories by Simon Kennedy and Tim Ross @TimRoss_1 More stories by Tim Ross February 3, 2017, 2:44 AM EST Sign up to receive the Brexit Bulletin in your inbox, and follow @Brexit on Twitter. Prime Minister Theresa May has a plan in case of failure. Tucked away in the final pages of the government’s 75-page plan for the Brexit negotiations was the line that the government would draft emergency laws to protect the economy in the event that the talks break down without the sweeping free trade deal May wants. Source: Getty Images “The government is clear that no deal for the U.K. is better than a bad deal for the U.K.,” the white paper said. “In any eventuality, we will ensure that our economic and other functions can continue, including by passing legislation as necessary to mitigate the effects of failing to reach a deal.” The government also warned of financial market disruption if banks can’t secure access to the EU. The contingency work suggests a desire to avoid repeating the mistake of May’s predecessor, David Cameron, who entered June’s referendum without a plan for losing, leaving the U.K. unprepared for Brexit. Some criticized the white paper, released Thursday, for lacking depth and for assuming the U.K. can enjoy too many of the advantages of EU membership, including easy trade, while giving up the responsibilities such as free movement of people. “The administration is misjudging both the political and practical scale of the task ahead,” said Malcolm Barr, an economist at JPMorgan. “We see increasing grounds for concern that the plan as constituted cannot be credibly constituted.” The document serves as the basis for the next round of parliamentary talks on handing May the power to start the Brexit talks by the end of June. Some of May’s fellow Tories said on Thursday they want a binding vote on the draft deal before it’s too late to be changed, while others want more assurances on the future of EU citizens already in the U.K. Postcard from Malta May will join her (for now) fellow EU leaders for talks in Malta on Friday, where she will try calm nerves about U.S. President Donald Trump. A ship patrols in the port of Valletta in Malta on Feb. 2. Photographer: Filippo Monteforte/AFP via Getty Images Taking advantage of her one-on-one meeting in the White House a week ago, May will paint herself as having an inside track with Trump, perhaps hoping it will give her leverage over her EU counterparts in the Brexit talks. Backing the wrong side would, however, have repercussions. “It’s pretty clear she needs to choose her priorities well,” Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat told Sky News.  Also on Friday, a court will hear whether there should be a full-scale lawsuit on whether June’s referendum covered membership of the European Economic Area or not. Brexit Secretary David Davis refused to rule out a parliamentary vote on that. Frankfurt Eyes 10,000 As the race to raid Britain’s banking talent heats up, Frankfurt’s lobby group said it expects to draw as many as 10,000 finance jobs from London over the next five years. It anticipates the exodus beginning imminently, Hubertus Vath of Frankfurt Main Finance said on Thursday at a London conference organized by City and Financial. “We’re not talking months any more,” Vath said. “We’re talking weeks.” Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and UBS are already said to be considering the German financial capital as their new EU hub. Vath acknowledged Germany’s tight labor laws are a deterrent but said politicians were reviewing them. Deutsche Bank Chief Regulatory Officer Sylvie Matherat said the bank “won’t be a first mover” on shifting staff. Separately, Spain’s securities regulator said it plans to increase its workforce by about 15 percent as part of its plan to cope with potential demand from investment firms after Brexit. Ireland’s central bank said it is hiring “immediately’’ to quicken authorizations for firms wanting to work there. U.K. Plc Taking Over U.K. companies are making more acquisitions abroad than they were before the referendum despite the falling pound making their targets more expensive by a fifth in dollar terms. Reckitt Benckiser’s $16.7 billion surprise bid for baby food producer Mead Johnson Nutrition this week was the second U.K. suitor in a month to make a move on a U.S. target. The first — British American Tobacco’s agreement to purchase Camel cigarettes maker Reynolds American for almost $50 billion — was the biggest overseas buyout by a U.K. firm since 2008. Despite sterling’s slide, British companies will generate sales in other currencies that can then be swapped back to the U.K. at a premium, Bloomberg’s Manuel Baigorri and Ruth David note. All told, British buyers have announced almost $126 billion of cash or cash-and-stock deals for targets outside of the country since the referendum. That’s up 72 percent from the same period a year earlier. Brexit Bullets AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said the U.K. will need its own drug agency after Brexit Scotland to vote on Tuesday on May’s draft plan to trigger Brexit Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Brexit would cause substantial economic damage to the U.K. The U.K. lawmaker who represents London’s financial district in Parliament said he sees the risk of “very little progress" in Brexit negotiations a year from now. “I’m slightly pessimistic,” Mark Field said. On the Markets The pound snapped a two-day rally on Thursday and gilts rose after the Bank of England signaled that it isn’t primed to tighten monetary policy even as it boosted its outlook for economic growth. “The Brexit journey is really just beginning,” Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said. “While the direction of travel is clear, there will be twists and turns along the way.” Brexit has brightened the outlook for U.K. solar funds, with higher power prices lifting earnings for the industry and prompting trading volumes at three London-listed U.K. solar funds to more than double since June, according to Bloomberg’s Anna Hirtenstein. And Finally… The government’s white paper was barely a week in the works, and it may have shown. Forced upon her by disgruntled Conservatives, May only agreed on Jan. 25 to publish the document. The chatter in Westminster was that it only reached the printers in the pre-dawn hours of Thursday, with some noting on Twitter that time stamps on some of the pages suggested the final version was only completed after 4 a.m. Sections of it were copied word-for-word from May’s speech in London last month. Errors were also spotted. Page 32 of the report appeared to suggest Britons are allowed a minimum of 14 weeks of paid vacation per year. It was later corrected to show the correct amount of about 5 weeks.

Follow @Asia_G3 Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Feb 3, 2017 12:30 AM EST Bond investors can sometimes be too sanguine, and Mongolia looks to be an example of that. The country's sovereign notes have returned 1.5 percent over the past three months, the best performance among nine Asian markets, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The nation's 10.875 percent U.S. currency debentures due 2021 are trading at 105.3 cents on the dollar to yield 9.3 percent, while its 5.125 percent bonds that mature in 2022 yield 8 percent, down from 11 percent 12 months ago. Risk Versus Reward At a yield of 9.3 percent, Mongolia's bonds seem to be offering a decent return...unless you consider the likelihood of default Source: Bloomberg That's despite the Development Bank of Mongolia LLC facing a $580 million note repayment next month that would wipe out more than half the country's $1.1 billion in reserves. The possibility of a default's so real that people are even donating their jewelry to the government in the hope it gets over the line. Thin Cushion Mongolia's foreign currency reserves dropped below $1 billion last year and were at $1.2 billion at the end of December Sources: IMF, Bloomberg Investors are taking a more optimistic view, betting the International Monetary Fund will finalize a rescue package that will allow the payment to be made and give Mongolia sufficient credibility to sell new bonds to meet other maturities -- there's about $645 million coming due in 2018. They're also emboldened by the fact that coal and copper -- Mongolia's two main exports -- have recovered from wild selloffs. Newcastle futures rose 87 percent last year while copper rose 16 percent, having plunged 47 percent from its peak in February 2013 to a low in January last year. But even after those rallies, the price of the two commodities remains depressed versus historic levels. Plus some 80 percent of exports are to China, where demand is slowing. Mongolia's 10.875% notes: sold at par Trading at: 105.3 cents Things could go the way of Mozambique, which is on the verge of default after an expected IMF handout didn't happen. Even if multilateral organizations find no fault with Mongolia, political developments can push a nation over the edge. As a young finance reporter, I remember attending a press conference with then Argentine minister of economy Domingo Cavallo in Sao Paulo in 2001. I recall being very impressed with his explanation of how he planned to avert a crisis by moving the peso's peg from the dollar to a basket that would include the euro -- then worth less than a buck -- and the yen. The market was buying it at the time, too. Unfortunately for Cavallo, Argentinians were more inclined to bang pots on the streets than donate riches, and one of the biggest sovereign defaults in history happened a few months later. Mongolia doesn't have a pegged currency and like South Koreans during the Asian financial crisis, its citizens are willing to make personal sacrifices so the nation doesn't miss its obligations. But unlike politics, finance is more of an exact science and here, the math doesn't add up. The last time Mongolia had a budget surplus was back in 2010, a meager $33.2 million. Last year's $1.5 billion deficit was the highest since at least 2000 and almost three times the figures recorded in 2014 and 2015. Down the Drain Mongolia hasn't recorded a surplus in six years and its latest deficit was a record Source: Bloomberg The tugrik's 20 percent drop against the dollar in 2016 was its worst one-year loss since 2000 as well. More than 10 percent of loans in the country are nonperforming and some say official statistics underestimate the problem. It was perhaps figures like these that prompted Franklin Templeton to exit its investment in Mongolia last year. Michael Hasenstab might have missed the latest rally, but, as any savvy investor knows, chasing the last dollar can sometimes be a loss-making strategy.

Image Credit: REUTERS/Carlos Barria (Reuters) – U.S. President Donald Trump will likely face questions about his executive order restricting some travel to the United States when he meets with the CEOs of major U.S. companies at the White House on Friday. Companies whose chief executives are expected to attend the meeting of the president’s business advisory panel include JPMorgan Chase, General Motors, Blackstone Group LP, IBM, and Walt Disney, two officials briefed on the meeting said on Wednesday. Activists are already pressuring the CEOs to raise concerns about the travel restrictions at the meeting, which comes at the end of another turbulent week for the Trump administration. Trump’s order last Friday, barring travel into the United States by people from seven Muslim-majority countries, touched off public protests and stirred unease among employees at many big U.S. companies. CEOs have been faced with difficult choices to either criticize Trump’s move at a time when they are trying to win White House support on tax and trade policies, or remain silent and take heat from consumers and employees dismayed by the order. The Trump administration says the travel ban is aimed at strengthening national security. Backlash over the measure knocked the wind out of the post-inaugural stock market rally, although major indexes rebounded on Wednesday. Trump’s executive order put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Along with protests it has prompted legal challenges in the United States and drawn criticism from several leading U.S. companies. Among those critics, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wrote in an email to employees Saturday that “the ban will impact many innocent people — an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump’s first business advisory group meeting.” Trump will kick off the two-hour meeting with an address lasting 10-15 minutes and will be followed by Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire founder of private equity group Blackstone <BX.N>, who chairs the panel and assembled it at Trump’s request. Four topics will be discussed — regulatory relief, women in the work force, tax and trade, and infrastructure — with two to three people talking briefly about each subject to help shape “how the administration should be thinking,” according to a person familiar with the matter. Investors said the CEOs would be mindful of Trump’s penchant for rebuking companies publicly. “Given recent history, being called out publicly is something that the CEOs in that room and other CEOs will absolutely be mindful to avoid,” said Jim Russell, vice president at Bahl & Gaynor Inc, which oversees $17 billion and owns shares in several of the companies attending Friday’s meeting. “I’m sure they will pick their fights carefully and articulate them carefully.” It was not clear if all 19 members of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum would attend Friday’s meeting. Other members include the CEOs of Tesla, Wal-Mart and Boeing. Tesla founder Elon Musk said this week that the travel order should be modified and he would seek a consensus among members of the advisory council. Ford Motor Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and CEO Mark Fields have also criticized the travel measure. GM has declined to take a position. On Wednesday, a group of religious investors, human rights groups other activists urged members of the business advisory panel to speak out against the travel restrictions at the meeting with Trump. In a joint letter to the corporate leaders, the group said Trump’s order “undermines respect for human rights and the lives of workers and their families in the U.S. and beyond, and disrupts economic activity and company operations.” The letter was signed by dozens of people, including representatives of firms focused on socially-responsible investing like Calvert Research and Management and Domini Impact Investments. Others included representatives of the International Corporate Accountability Roundtable, the Institute for Human Rights and Business and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. Companies that have been most critical of Trump’s immigration orders include Netflix, Apple, and Amazon.com, none of which form part of the business advisory panel.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Main Menu Compliance Training Veteran, Anil D’Souza, Joins Traliant Team 3 February 2017Military News Traliant, a leader in interactive online compliance training, welcomes Anil D’Souza to the management team as VP, Learning. MANHATTAN BEACH, CA, USA, February 2, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ — Traliant, a leader in interactive online compliance training, announced today that Anil D’Souza has joined its team as VP, Learning. Over the past 20 years D’Souza has instructionally authored over 800 learner hours of blended learning programs, focusing primarily on ethics and regulatory compliance topics. He has designed programs for a variety of progressive, international organizations including such firms as JPMorgan Chase, Standard Chartered Bank, and General Electric. Prior to joining Traliant, he was the Director of Products, Quality, and Innovation in the compliance learning division of Thomson Reuters. “The challenge with compliance training is that nobody really wants to take it,” observed D’Souza. “Since staff motivation is typically low, the training must be relevant, engaging and interactive if it is to be effective. If eLearning can also be adapted to an organization’s look, feel and vocabulary, it further enhances effectiveness as people tune-out when training doesn’t appear to be relevant to them. Traliant has wrapped these important concepts into a big vision of taking compliance training ‘from boring to brilliant,’ and I’m very excited to be able to help bring this vision to life.” Andrew Rawson, Traliant’s CMO, further commented, “I worked with Anil previously and his ability to lead a team of instructional designers, subject matter experts, graphic designers and course developers to rapidly build highly engaging, media-rich compliance training is without parallel.” Traliant launched its Preventing Discrimination and Harassment Suite in December 2016. A Code of Conduct training suite will be available in March 2017. About Traliant: Traliant was founded by industry veterans from some of the most successful compliance training companies in the nation to meet the challenge of transforming compliance training from boring to brilliant. Backed by Martinson Ventures, Traliant delivers millennial-friendly, broadcast-quality compliance training on an eLearning platform that allows revolutionary text and video customization—at off-the-shelf prices. Traliant has received industry-wide recognition for its innovative work. For more information on Traliant visit: http://www.traliant.com.

Quotes in the article Liberty All-Star Equity USA ▲ 5.40 +0.02 +0.37% Facebook Inc FB ▼ 130.84 -2.39 -1.79% Twitter Inc TWTR ▲ 17.78 +0.54 +3.13% Terms of the deal were not set because this is the initial filing. But we do know that Snap Inc. plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “SNAP.” And the underwriters are a who’s who of Wall Street financials, including Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Deutsche Bank AG (USA) (NYSE:DB). A look through the Snap Inc. S-1 provides a few more highlights for the Snapchat IPO: An average of 158 million people use the Snapchat app on a daily basis, and they create 2.5 billion snaps a day. Over 60% of the daily active users (DAUs) use the Chat Service every day to send Snaps and talk with friends. Last year, Snap posted revenues of $404.5 million but also a hefty net loss of $514.6 million. This compares to a top line of $57.7 million and loss of $372.9 million in 2015. The Snapchat IPO should be one of the largest — if not the biggest — offerings of the year. The Los Angeles Times also points out that the Snap Inc. IPO is expected to be the “biggest initial public offering ever for a Los Angeles company.” The Snapchat IPO: The Next Facebook Inc (FB) ... Or Twitter Inc (TWTR)? Snapchat was founded just five years ago by a pair of former Stanford students as a class project. It has now grown into one of the most popular apps in the world, allowing users to snap photos and short videos, and apply various filters and effects to them.

 A former Wall Street analyst made a $145 million trade of a lifetime to join Snap Matt Turner Feb. 2, 2017, 7:04 PM 1,639 facebook linkedin twitter email print Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Office of Snapchat, speaks the Financo CEO Forum 2016 on January 18, 2016 in New York City. Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images Snapchat's parent company Snap Inc. has set in motion what could be the biggest tech flotation in years.  The filing for its initial public offering revealed the compensation of Imran Khan, a former JPMorgan research analyst turned Credit Suisse technology banker, who moved the company in January 2015 as chief strategy officer.  Now, for a bit of background, Khan made the kind of move many on Wall Street dream of, swapping a job in finance for a big role at a fast-growing startup.  Others have done the same. Anthony Noto, a Goldman Sachs banker became Twitter's CFO in 2014, and Ruth Porat became Alphabet's finance chief last year.  But for Khan, who worked on the IPO of Alibaba Group, Groupon and China's Weibo before he moved to Snap, this trade is going to pay off like no other.  Khan received $145.3 million in stock awards in 2015, according to the filing, in addition to $230,000 in salary. In 2016, he received a $5.3 million bonus, in addition to $241,539 in salary. Khan is sure to be the envy of Wall Street.

But a rebound in copper and the prospect of an IMF rescue package has turned the country’s dollar bonds into an investment winner. The notes returned 1.5 percent in the three months through Thursday, the most among nine Asian markets, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes. The price of copper, which accounts for around a third of Mongolian exports, is up 20 percent over the period amid supply risks and signs U.S. President Donald Trump will ramp up infrastructure spending. Speculation the International Monetary Fund will soon finalize a relief program has AllianceBernstein LP and Morgan Stanley Investment Management predicting the bond rally can continue. The IMF mission has arrived in Mongolia and a relief program of around $500 million could be completed before the end of February, Citigroup Inc. said in a Jan. 26 note. “The current level is yet to price in the prospects of external support and FDI inflows,” said Vincent Tsui, an economist at AllianceBernstein in Hong Kong. The IMF package will be accompanied by support from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and others, likely to be worth more than $1 billion, he said. The Mongolian notes have beaten a 0.8 percent drop in a JPMorgan index of emerging-market and frontier sovereign global paper over three months. The yield on Mongolia’s dollar debt due April 2021 fell 156 basis points to 9.29 percent from a three-month high on Nov. 29. There’s a “strong likelihood” the nation will tap international markets after getting the IMF package, Citigroup said in the note. See also: Mongolian Bonds May Look a Winner Now, But at What Cost?: Gadfly The yields spiked to a high shortly after Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings cut their ratings on Mongolia, citing rising debt and the risk of a balance-of-payments crisis. S&P Global Ratings had already lowered its assessment of the country in August. Mongolia is struggling with: A 1.6 percent contraction in the economy in the first nine months of 2016, compared with 9.1 percent growth over the same period of 2014 A budget deficit amounting to 19.5 percent of GDP last year, from 5 percent in 2015 A 20 percent plunge in the tugrik against the dollar in 2016 and a drop in foreign-exchange reserves to a seven-year low in October The copper rally, which started in late October, is generating optimism the country can recover. The global market for the metal could swing to a deficit amid supply risks from the world’s largest mine in Chile as well as in Indonesia, according to Barclays Plc. The U.S. election has been positive for copper in terms of sentiment, as has China’s latest five-year plan, said Sam Spring, the chief executive officer of Kincora Copper Ltd., a miner with exploration rights in Mongolia. ‘Nice Narrative’ “It’s a nice narrative that the two largest economies in the world might, for the first time, be undertaking significant infrastructure expansion programs at the same time,” said the Melbourne-based Spring. Although, the bull market in the metal is being driven more by supply risks, he said. The rally in Mongolian sovereign bonds means valuations are a “little less attractive,” said Philippe Petit, a Singapore-based senior investment manager at Pictet Asset Management, who said he’d taken profits in the past few weeks. The IMF deal needs to be agreed, followed by a successful dollar bond sale, to trigger further gains before a presidential election in June, he said. Investors are also watching to see whether the state-owned Development Bank of Mongolia will be able to redeem a $580 million bond that matures in March. The country’s liquidity position is strong enough to fully repay the notes, the finance ministry said in a statement on Jan. 20. “We have maintained a long-risk position in Mongolian sovereign and quasi-sovereign bonds,” said Warren Mar, the New York-based head of emerging-market credit strategy at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. He said he was watching for two key signposts: the IMF announcement and the repayment of the development bank notes. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Photographer: Andy Rain/EPA Prime Minister Theresa May is making plans for emergency laws to protect the U.K. economy in case Brexit negotiations break down without a free-trade deal, as concerns grow that she’ll fail to achieve the sweeping agreement she wants. In its 75-page plan for Brexit, May’s government said on Thursday that while it was expecting to find common ground with the 27 other members of the European Union, it will prepare contingency measures to avert economic chaos if the discussions collapsed. “The government is clear that no deal for the U.K. is better than a bad deal for the U.K.,” according to the ‘white paper’ document on leaving the EU. “In any eventuality, we will ensure that our economic and other functions can continue, including by passing legislation as necessary to mitigate the effects of failing to reach a deal." Failure to secure access to the single market for banks and other financial-services companies would also risk “market fragmentation’’ and the withdrawal of services for U.K. and European businesses, it added. Brexit Secretary David Davis vowed to try to avoid a “cliff edge” scenario. May’s preparations emerged in her government’s first written blueprint for “an ambitious and comprehensive free-trade agreement” with the EU after Brexit. They suggest she’s keen to avoid repeating the mistake of her predecessor, David Cameron, who was faulted for not having a plan for losing last year’s EU referendum, leaving the U.K. unprepared for the Brexit talks when he did. Bitter Failure Lawmakers and analysts including former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne have warned that May is unlikely to persuade the EU to give her the free-trade deal she’s aiming for, given her ambitions in other areas such as immigration. They worry talks will turn bitter and the U.K. and EU will end up making a clean break. “The administration is misjudging both the political and practical scale of the task ahead as it seeks to replicate much of the status quo in a new agreement with the EU,” said Malcolm Barr, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in London. “We see increasing grounds for concern that the plan as constituted cannot be credibly delivered.” Although May’s government has been bullish in predicting it can land a trade deal before it leaves the EU in two years, such a timeframe would be unprecedented, especially as a pact between the U.K. and EU would likely have to include services as well as goods. EU officials have also said they want to settle the divorce first before debating a new relationship. Read: A guide to what Theresa May’s Brexit vision means for the EU Global businesses based in the U.K. “may choose to vote with their feet” rather than waiting to see what deal the premier can deliver, Barr said.  Forced upon her by lawmakers, including some from May’s own Conservative party, the white paper provides the basis for the next round of discussions as Parliament inches toward handing the premier the power to start Brexit talks by March 31. The Article 50 law will be debated again next week after it won support of a majority in the House of Commons. Some fellow Tories said on Thursday they want May to promise them a binding vote on the draft Brexit deal before it is too late to be changed. “We can’t predict what is going to happen in two years, and I don’t want to sign a blank check,’’ Neil Carmichael, a Conservative member of Parliament, said by telephone. “What we need is the reassurance from the government that Parliament will be properly involved and will be given a meaningful say at the end of this process.’’ Read here about why Brexit’s detour through Parliament matters. The main opposition Labour party is likely to try to force a vote on giving legislators a binding say over the pact, while some others in the House of Commons may seek faster guarantees that EU citizens currently living in the U.K. will be allowed to stay. May only has a working majority of 16. The document itself contained little new information. Sections of it were copied word-for-word from May’s speech in London last month, in which she announced she wanted to take the U.K. out of the EU single market, regain control over migration and lawmaking, and strike a new customs agreement with the bloc. Reforms to migration will require legislation and may be pushed back until after a lengthy transitional period lasting several years, the document suggested. In Parliament, Davis refused to rule out another vote on leaving the European Economic Area. A court will hold a hearing on Friday to decide whether there should be a full-scale lawsuit on whether June’s referendum covered membership of the EEA, which as well as the EU’s 28 members, includes Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. "Once we are outside the EU, the question of whether we automatically cease to be a member of the EEA becomes a legal empty vessel," said Davis "We will look at that. If we do propose to withdraw from the EEA, we will come back and tell the House." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The top ranked bank brand is Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), a state-owned Chinese bank with a brand value of $47.83 billion in 2016, a 32% improvement compared with 2015’s brand value. Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC) was the runner-up with a brand value of $41.62, a 6% year-over-year decline. A banking brand value report was released Wednesday by branding and strategic consulting firm Brand Finance. Wells Fargo had been the leading banking brand for the previous four years, but the fake customer account scandal cost it the top ranking in 2016. All four of China’s top-ranked banks are state-owned. Here’s a list of the top 10, together with their brand value, the year-over-year percentage change and the bank’s brand rating as assigned by Brand Finance. ICBC: $47.83 billion brand value; up 32%; rating AAA Wells Fargo: $41.62 billion; down 6%; rating AA+ China Construction Bank: $41.38 billion; up 17%; rating AAA- JPMorgan Chase & Co.

China’s economy and businesses across all sectors are growing rapidly, expanding both organically and through a strong demand for foreign acquisitions, creating opportunity for its lenders and financial service providers. Foreign M&A activity has significantly accelerated in the last two years, hitting a record high in 2016 Banking 500 Executive Summary with such notable takeovers as ChemChina’s acquisition of Syngenta or Haier Group’s of GE’s home appliance division. … China’s banks look set for further international expansion that should see a further strengthening of their positions … In addition to the $2.6 billion damage caused to Wells Fargo’s brand value by the fake account scandal, Agricultural Bank of China’s New York City branch also got socked with a sexual harassment claim brought by the bank’s chief compliance officer that cost it nearly $4 billion in brand value.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Main Menu Compliance Training Veteran, Anil D’Souza, Joins Traliant Team 2 February 2017Military News Traliant, a leader in interactive online compliance training, welcomes Anil D’Souza to the management team as VP, Learning. MANHATTAN BEACH, CA, USA, February 2, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ — Traliant, a leader in interactive online compliance training, announced today that Anil D’Souza has joined its team as VP, Learning. Over the past 20 years D’Souza has instructionally authored over 800 learner hours of blended learning programs, focusing primarily on ethics and regulatory compliance topics. He has designed programs for a variety of progressive, international organizations including such firms as JPMorgan Chase, Standard Chartered Bank, and General Electric. Prior to joining Traliant, he was the Director of Products, Quality, and Innovation in the compliance learning division of Thomson Reuters. “The challenge with compliance training is that nobody really wants to take it,” observed D’Souza. “Since staff motivation is typically low, the training must be relevant, engaging and interactive if it is to be effective. If eLearning can also be adapted to an organization’s look, feel and vocabulary, it further enhances effectiveness as people tune-out when training doesn’t appear to be relevant to them. Traliant has wrapped these important concepts into a big vision of taking compliance training ‘from boring to brilliant,’ and I’m very excited to be able to help bring this vision to life.” Andrew Rawson, Traliant’s CMO, further commented, “I worked with Anil previously and his ability to lead a team of instructional designers, subject matter experts, graphic designers and course developers to rapidly build highly engaging, media-rich compliance training is without parallel.” Traliant launched its Preventing Discrimination and Harassment Suite in December 2016. A Code of Conduct training suite will be available in March 2017. About Traliant: Traliant was founded by industry veterans from some of the most successful compliance training companies in the nation to meet the challenge of transforming compliance training from boring to brilliant. Backed by Martinson Ventures, Traliant delivers millennial-friendly, broadcast-quality compliance training on an eLearning platform that allows revolutionary text and video customization—at off-the-shelf prices. Traliant has received industry-wide recognition for its innovative work. For more information on Traliant visit: http://www.traliant.com.

British consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser's $16.7 billion bid for U.S. baby formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition on Thursday, pushed the value of deals announced so far this year to almost $35 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data, the highest in nine years. Bankers say fears of an economic slowdown after Britain leaves the EU has put pressure on companies to secure growth in new markets and business areas, making them more open to large deals than they were before the June vote on EU membership. "Brexit is a long-term structural shift which needs to be addressed now," Dwayne Lysaght, head of UK M&A at JPMorgan, said. "M&A has its risks but strategically sound, well-financed and properly implemented takeovers have enormous benefits in the long run." Last week, Britain's biggest retailer Tesco announced a 3.7 billion pound takeover of food supplier Booker, increasing its exposure to the fast-growing catering sector. That was followed by a long-awaited announcement by Royal Dutch Shell that it was selling a package of oil and gas fields to private equity-backed Chrysaor for up to $3.8 billion. "Of course there may be bumps in the road with Brexit but CEOs are seeing the glass half full," said Pieter-Jan Bouten, managing director at boutique investment bank Greenhill, which acted as lead adviser to Tesco on its purchase of Booker. Most of the companies announcing takeovers, including Tesco and Reckitt, have seen their share prices rise when their deals became public, pushing bankers to tout the benefits of doing transactions now. Outbound M&A, where British firms buy companies or assets overseas, has risen 548 percent so far this year, with deals valued at $19.5 billion, while inbound M&A has dropped 63 percent to $2.4 billion, Thomson Reuters data shows. Last year, the fall in the pound to a 31-year low after the Brexit vote was followed by SoftBank's $32 billion swoop on chip designer ARM Holdings, raising the prospect that foreign companies were looking to buy up British firms on the cheap. But bankers said the threat of becoming a takeover target has prompted other British companies to go on the offensive. "UK Plc want to be in control of their own destiny, rather than waiting to see what is going to happen and risking becoming prey," Bouten said. ($1 = 0.7973 pounds) (Reporting By Pamela Barbaglia.

REUTERS/Stephen Hird/File Photo By Pamela Barbaglia | LONDON LONDON Britain has had its strongest start to the year for M&A activity since 2008 on the back of a spate of big deals, a sign that some businesses are trying to plan for a more uncertain future outside the European Union. British consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser's (RB.L) $16.7 billion bid for U.S. baby formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition (MJN.N) on Thursday, pushed the value of deals announced so far this year to almost $35 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data, the highest in nine years. Bankers say fears of an economic slowdown after Britain leaves the EU has put pressure on companies to secure growth in new markets and business areas, making them more open to large deals than they were before the June vote on EU membership. "Brexit is a long-term structural shift which needs to be addressed now," Dwayne Lysaght, head of UK M&A at JPMorgan, said. "M&A has its risks but strategically sound, well-financed and properly implemented takeovers have enormous benefits in the long run." Last week, Britain's biggest retailer Tesco (TSCO.L) announced a 3.7 billion pound takeover of food supplier Booker, increasing its exposure to the fast-growing catering sector. That was followed by a long-awaited announcement by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) that it was selling a package of oil and gas fields to private equity-backed Chrysaor for up to $3.8 billion. "Of course there may be bumps in the road with Brexit but CEOs are seeing the glass half full," said Pieter-Jan Bouten, managing director at boutique investment bank Greenhill (GHL.N), which acted as lead adviser to Tesco on its purchase of Booker. Most of the companies announcing takeovers, including Tesco and Reckitt, have seen their share prices rise when their deals became public, pushing bankers to tout the benefits of doing transactions now. Outbound M&A, where British firms buy companies or assets overseas, has risen 548 percent so far this year, with deals valued at $19.5 billion, while inbound M&A has dropped 63 percent to $2.4 billion, Thomson Reuters data shows. Last year, the fall in the pound to a 31-year low after the Brexit vote was followed by SoftBank's (9984.T) $32 billion swoop on chip designer ARM Holdings, raising the prospect that foreign companies were looking to buy up British firms on the cheap. But bankers said the threat of becoming a takeover target has prompted other British companies to go on the offensive. "UK Plc want to be in control of their own destiny, rather than waiting to see what is going to happen and risking becoming prey," Bouten said. (Reporting By Pamela Barbaglia.

(Greg Allen/Invision/AP) Share Written by Oliver Staley February 02, 2017 As CEO of a family-run business, Donald Trump had little occasion to practice his persuasive powers. He was used to getting his way. As president, he has so far displayed this command-and-control style of leadership, issuing a rapid volley of executive orders and firing the acting attorney general when she displeased him. But when he meets with some of the US’s most influential CEOs tomorrow—many deeply skeptical about his positions on trade and immigration—he won’t be able to browbeat them into submission. He’ll need to use persuasion to show them the wisdom of his actions if he wants their support. Among the CEOs expected to attend the first meeting of Trump’s business advisory council are Jamie Dimon, of JP Morgan; Ginny Rometty, of IBM; Mary Barra, of General Motors, and Robert Iger, of Disney. Trump prides himself on being a tough negotiator, but persuasion should be part of the tool kit for any deal maker. Effective persuasion doesn’t rely on manipulation or deception, but on establishing credibility, finding common ground, and relying on solid evidence, says Jay Conger, a business professor and author of The Necessary Art of Persuasion. “People must understand persuasion for what it is—not convincing and selling but learning and negotiating,” Conger writes. Robert Cialdini, a marketing professor and author of Influence: Science & Practice, has boiled down persuasion to six principles: Liking: People like those who like them, and are more receptive to someone they enjoy being around. Offering genuine praise and compliments opens doors and relaxes people. Reciprocity: You have to give something to get something. From crude gestures such as gift-giving to more subtle offers of help or information, giving creates an opportunity for a favor to be returned. Social proof: We’re more likely to change our behavior when we know others have as well. It’s the principle behind including lists of donors on charity solicitations, or reminding college students how many of their peers don’t drink. Consistency: People are more likely to take action if they’ve committed to it. Getting a commitment, either verbally or in writing, can help seal the deal. Authority: We defer to experts, and trust the power of credentials. If you have evidence from authorities, deploy it. Scarcity: People are more likely to seize opportunities they feel are rare, or going to increase in value. If there is a closing window to make a deal, we’re more likely to act. Whether Trump can marshall these forces tomorrow is an open question. But listening and making the case for his positions will certainly earn him more support from America’s CEOs than any number of angry tweets.

Their simultaneous leadership comes at a time when banking faces multiple challenges and could stand to innovate by increasing diversity. It's also a time when the conversation about more diverse leadership is growing and getting louder. "Whenever younger women see our generation in those leadership roles it gives them great hope that the glass ceiling is broken and we're going to new heights," said Mary Lynn Lenz, president and CEO of Foothills Bank. "It saddens me that we don't have more women in those prominent positions, but at least we're setting a precedent." Patti Husic, president and CEO at Centric Bank, agreed it "sends a powerful message" — one Geena Davis spoke about at the banquet for American Banker's Most Powerful Women last year: if she can see it, she can be it. Rainey herself said she was inspired by Terry Jorde, the ICBA's first female chairman. "Early in my career there weren't as many women in the C-suite," Jorde said. "Now we take it for granted that women can — and should — have a place in the executive offices. We elevate women where there is talent." Stay woke: It's easier to make it in the business world if you're a straight, white man, says Barclays CEO Jes Staley, and it's up to senior executive leaders to try to level the playing field. "You make Barclays a place where a single, working mother can thrive and leave on a Tuesday at 1pm with no sense of guilt at all — that woman will stay," he said. "You make Barclays a place where a gay man can feel as comfortable at 4pm on a Thursday as with his friends on a weekend — that individual is going to stay. There is a growing recognition that corporations have to be in tune with the world around them." Staley also said embracing diversity is "the most effective vehicle I have found to hire and retain staff" and that if a company can ensure leaders at the top of organizations embrace "the right values, it permeates with incredible speed throughout the organization." Grooming female leaders of tomorrow: Canada's major banks are readying their female leaders for their top posts, says Bill Downe, chief executive of Bank of Montreal and the country's longest-serving bank CEO. "There are five large Canadian banks," he said. "I think it's inevitable… There are women who are in development to be candidates to be CEO. There are men who are also being groomed but we're building depth of bench that has gender balance." No major Canadian bank has ever had a female CEO. For that matter, the largest U.S. banks haven't either. … Bad bank-data deals: Big banks increasingly are developing application programming interfaces to make their customers' data available to third parties. But discrete deals between banks and third parties — like JPMorgan Chase's deal with Intuit, or Wells Fargo's with accounting software provider Xero — would be a bad outcome for consumers and the industry as a whole, according to Jennifer Tescher, president and CEO of Center for Financial Services Innovation, and Beth Brockland, a CFSI managing director. Consumers benefit from having a choice of financial providers — including the apps they use to manage their financial lives — but that choice becomes limited when community banks, credit unions and other smaller institutions can't connect with digital tools like Mint or Digit. "We need a broader set of industrywide standards and best practices if we are to arrive at solutions that support consumer choice and innovation," they said. Risky business: A study by Australia's Sydney Morning Herald disputes the Lehman Sisters theory, finding instead that just increasing female staff in banks is unlikely to change the way risk is managed. The Lehman Sisters theory emerged in 2015 when IMF director Christine Lagarde said "female leadership is more inclusive and probably more risk-averse. What would have happened if Lehman Brothers had been Lehman Sisters?" — implying the financial crisis could have been averted if more women served senior management. The Herald asked bank employees to self-report their risk management behavior and indicate the extent of their aversion, or lack thereof, to risk. The survey shed light on women outside the risk averse female stereotype that are just as risk tolerant as their male counterparts — those are the women who tend to reach the management roles where risk management decisions are made. Choose love: Virgin Money CEO Jayne-Anne Gadhia offered advice at the 2017 Women in Finance Summit last week on how to handle unfeminist men: "You'll find that as you have more children, your love doesn't lessen, it multiplies and perhaps this is how we should handle men wary of equality." Role call George Soros has tapped Dawn Fitzpatrick, a senior executive at UBS Asset Management, to run his $25 billion family office as chief investment officer. Fitzpatrick, a 25-year veteran of UBS, was named one of our Most Powerful Women in Finance in 2015 and 2016. Citi has named Christina Mohr vice chairman of the bank to develop C-suite relationships, after more than 20 years serving the mergers and acquisitions business, most recently as a managing director. BankMobile, the digital-only neobank aimed at millennials and owned by Customers Bancorp in Wyomissing, Pa., gave Luvleen Sidhu, chief strategy officer, the added title of president. Tracey McDermott, the former acting head of the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, is joining Standard Chartered as head of corporate, public and regulatory affairs. Key Bank has made Renee Murdock its corporate responsibility officer for the Hudson Valley/Metro NY market. She previously served in a similar role for First Niagara Bank in the Eastern Pennsylvania market. The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation has promoted Ann Shuman, a managing director and deputy general counsel, to general counsel. In case you missed it Double duty: The Bloomberg Financial Services Gender-Equality Index has doubled. Bloomberg recognized 52 firms last week, up from the 26 when the benchmark debuted last year. The index measures the organizations' commitment to building gender-equal workplaces. This year's constituents have an average of 24.2% female representation on boards; the percentage of female executives at member firms increased by 25.2% between fiscal years 2014 and 2015; 73% require a gender-diverse slate of candidates for management roles; 75% provide returnship programs for women. Check out the list here. Bringing mothers back: Speaking of returnships, a group of U.K. members of Parliament is urging the government and employers to bring more mid-career women back into the workplace through returnships — paid training schemes for once senior leaders at work who have taken significant family leave. The program typically lasts three or six months and aims to improve women's technology skills and confidence and generally get them reacclimatized to the corporate world, with the help of a mentor. The concept was introduced by Goldman Sachs in the U.S. in 2008; Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank brought it to the U.K. in 2014. "I realized I wanted to be part of a company again," said Ines Faden, a mother to a 12- and a 14-year-old who had a 20-year career in investment banking before stepping back for six years to look after her family. After a three-month returnship she has launched her second career as a deputy treasurer. "I missed office life, but a career gap is a mortal sin to have on your CV and I knew it would be difficult to find work." Beyond banking Not what you did, but how: The White House announced the firing of former acting Attorney General Sally Yates two minutes after informing her it would take place, issuing a "scorched-earth condemnation" about her "betrayal" for not defending Trump's controversial executive order travel ban, the Washington Post reports. "All the hubbub then about Trump's decision to dismiss Yates on Monday night kind of misses the point," it wrote. "It's not that Yates was dismissed that's important and telling. It's how she was dismissed that matters." Read the full article here. Why women leave: There's a growing population of Americans who don't have a job and aren't looking for one — a frustrating trend that received a lot of attention in the wake of the presidential election in November. Thus far, the narrative has focused on men in rural areas who've lost factory jobs. Women are part of the trend too, but they're leaving the workforce for a different reason: they're still the primary caregivers of their families, and when choosing between inflexible work conditions and taking care of family, they tend to choose the latter. "I think the only reason anyone is talking about missing male workers is because there's so many missing female workers," said Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan. "Male participation was declining for a very long time, and no one seemed to care about it because household incomes were rising because women's participation and hourly earnings were increasing."

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Uber faces more protests Thursday over CEO’s Trump ties By Marisa Kendall / February 2, 2017 at 9:00 AM Activists are planning national protests against Uber on Thursday, including in Palo Alto, San Francisco and Oakland, to demand that CEO Travis Kalanick leave President Donald Trump’s business advisory council. Protests are planned for 1 p.m. at Uber’s Palo Alto office, 4:15 p.m. at Uber’s Oakland office, and 5 p.m. at Uber’s San Francisco office, as well as in cities including San Diego, New York, New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Seattle and Hoboken, New Jersey, and even outside the White House, according to news releases and Facebook posts. The protests are part of an ongoing backlash against Uber in response to Kalanick’s decision to accept an invitation to sit on Trump’s advisory council, which also includes CEOs from Tesla, JPMorgan Chase, General Motors, IBM and Walt Disney. Protestors blockaded Uber’s San Francisco headquarters last month during Trump’s inauguration, and anger directed toward the Uber CEO intensified after Trump signed a controversial order Friday blocking refugees from entering the country for 120 days, barring Syrian refugees indefinitely and prohibiting the entry of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days. Kalanick, who said the travel ban “will impact many innocent people,” promised to raise the issue with Trump during Friday’s advisory council meeting. But tension reached a boiling point over the weekend after Uber users, angry over how the company responded to a taxi strike at New York’s JFK Airport, started deleting their Uber accounts en masse, calling attention to their cause with the #DeleteUber hashtag. Activists say #UberRidesWithHate — the rallying cry they’ve coined for Thursday’s protests — is the next step. Who wants to send a message to @Uber? Tech shouldn't cozy up to human rights abusers. Tomorrow 1PM Palo Alto #UberRidesWithHate #deleteuber https://t.co/X5FmjjooCo — Jeffrey Buchanan (@JRBinSV) February 1, 2017 Ok so you #deleteUber ? Now let's rally against the Trump loving sycophant tomorrow! #UberRidesWithHate https://t.co/g75nMg9KDS — Elana Brooklyn (@Elana_Brooklyn) February 2, 2017 In New York the Independent Drivers Guild, a quasi union that represents Uber drivers, also launched a petition Thursday calling on Kalanick to step down from Trump’s council. “As a company whose success is built on a foundation of hard work by immigrant workers,” guild founder Jim Conigliaro, Jr. wrote in an emailed statement, “Uber can and should do better to stand up for immigrants and their workers.” .@Uber is collaborating with Trump, so #UberRidesWithHate!

"As we move forward in 2017, I ask each of you to help us better understand the many cultures and nations we serve," he said in the memo. "Lend your ear to differing voices and opinions. Embrace the diversity of our people and the world around us." Fink is one of several Wall Street CEOs who has sent a memo to employees in recent weeks, with many addressing President Donald Trump's move to sign an executive order temporarily barring entry to the US by all refugees and by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries. Fink on Monday sent a memo to staff, also signed by Blackrock president Rob Kapito and Jeff Smith, global head of human resources, addressing the executive order.  JPMorgan has set up a hotline for those who think they may be affected by the executive order. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein sent a memo to employees vowing to minimize any disruption resulting from the order. And Mike Corbat, the CEO of Citigroup, said "we are concerned about the message the executive order sends." Here's the memo from Fink in full: Executive Communication Renewing our principles as a global leader To: All employees Dear colleagues, For most of the last half century, the trend of globalization has moved almost exclusively in one direction: forward. Fueled by the transformative power of technology, the flow of people, goods, and capital accelerated across international borders. Nations grew closer together. The world became more intertwined and interdependent. Today, however, globalization is in retreat. The backlash against globalization that began in the Middle East, then spread to Europe, has now taken firm root in the U.S. While globalization has fueled economic growth and lifted millions out of poverty, it has also created dislocation and distributed benefits unevenly. As a result, economic nationalism is rising in many countries. The security and trade architecture that has governed recent decades is being redefined, and we are likely to see a fragmentation of global trade and capital flows as a result. At this time of profound change, I think it is important for us as a firm to recommit ourselves to certain core principles. First, we must rededicate ourselves to operating as a truly global company. Since our founding 29 years ago, BlackRock has sought to engage with and embrace talent and clients from cultures in all corners of the world. We will not retreat from that commitment. I have frequently talked about the need to be local in every market where we operate. The current environment makes that more urgent than ever. While we need to operate as One BlackRock across the globe, we also need to be German in Germany, Japanese in Japan and Mexican in Mexico. Even as we leverage the benefits of our global scale, we need to work to be more relevant to our clients in each market than any local player. The needs of investors in São Paulo differ from those in London, as those in Abu Dhabi differ from those in Hong Kong. The market dynamics are different. The cultures are different. The way people save and invest are different. We need to understand those differences and deliver advice and solutions that meet the unique needs of clients in each market. We also need to be active and engaged corporate citizens in these communities. We need to promote our commitment to long-termism. We need to contribute constructively through the products and services we provide as well as our philanthropy, policy advocacy, and the relationships we forge. As part of these efforts, BlackRock’s senior leadership engages with governments and leaders around the world – from the White House to 10 Downing to Zhongnanhai – when we believe engaging in public-private dialogue is necessary for long-term solutions. Second, we must renew our commitment to diversity and inclusion. These cannot be buzzwords – they are principles by which we must live. The employees of BlackRock represent more than 50 nations and speak more than 100 languages. We are people of many races, faiths, and cultures. That diversity is our strength. To deliver our commitments to our clients, we must attract the best talent, wherever we find it in the world. We need to nurture a culture where people of all types feel valued, included, and encouraged to reach their full potential. Read More I recognize that this is an uncertain time – and an uneasy one. More than ever, we must continue to lead by example, living out our commitment to inclusion and to strengthening our ties with clients and partners around the world. As we move forward in 2017, I ask each of you to help us better understand the many cultures and nations we serve. Lend your ear to differing voices and opinions. Embrace the diversity of our people and the world around us. Deepen the bonds with the communities in which we operate. That always has been, and will remain, the BlackRock way.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoMore By Caroline Humer NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Wednesday proposed an increase of 0.25 percent on average in payments to health insurers who offer Medicare Advantage insurance, which provides health benefits to more than 18 million elderly or disabled people. Enrollment in these plans grew by about 7 percent last year to account for about one-third of Medicare members, making it an important growth business for private insurers who are facing changes in their business as Republicans seek to repeal and replace Obamacare. It is not clear if Republicans will make any broad changes to the Medicare Advantage program, or to Medicare. Ipsita Smolinski, managing director at Capitol Street in Washington D.C. said on Wednesday that Medicare Advantage could get a boost amid the Republican push for private programs. The payment rate increase of 25 basis points was in line with estimates that analysts had released ahead of time and shares of insurers including UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc, two of the largest providers of these plans, were little changed in after-hours trading. JPMorgan's Gary Taylor said in a research note last week that he had been expecting a proposal for payments that were flat to slightly up from the rate that the government is now paying insurers who provide plans. Last year, the government proposed an increase of about 1.35 percent but later trimmed that back about 50 basis points. But insurers have 30 days to respond to the proposed payment rates and other changes included in the regulatory notice, which this year was 159 pages long, and may ask for a bigger increase. "The 2018 update is only a smidge better than flat which I suspect may anger some plans," Smolinski said. She said she expected that the payment rate could rise between now and when final rates are set. Insurers use the payment rate information provided by the government to prepare bids to sell Medicare Advantage plans in specific areas. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the division of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services that regulates Medicare, will announce the final rate on April 3. It said that it expected an additional 2.5 percent increase in payments related to coding of medical services. The payment rate takes into account annual growth in medical costs and statutory requirements to reduce government payments to insurers for Medicare Advantage closer to the level it pays in traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Marilyn Tavenner, the CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry's biggest lobbying group, said that it is reviewing the notice to be sure "the program is protected from harmful cuts."

Executives Are Against President's Executive Orders On Immigration, Travel By Lydia O'Neal @LydsONeal On 02/02/17 AT 10:19 AM Close Topping off his second week in office, President Donald Trump has planned to meet with a litany of corporate executives Friday. Many of them hailed from the “President’s Strategic and Policy Forum,” an advisory group of business leaders he formed in December, but some of the encounters may prove to be a bit awkward. The list of corporate leaders includes JPMorgan & Chase Co.’s Jamie Dimon, General Motors Co. chief executive Mary Barra and Travis Kalanick, the CEO of Uber, along with the heads of Walt Disney Co., the private equity firm Blackstone Group LP and IBM Corp., Reuters reported, citing “two officials briefed on the meeting.” The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the conference, tacked Toby Cosgrove, the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, on to the list. The meeting, according to the Journal, will center on "regulation, women in the workforce, tax and trade and infrastructure development." All the executives were part of the group assembled in December, which also includes Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk and PepsiCo chief Indra Nooyi—both of whom have openly criticized the new president. Kalanick faces a balancing act as he enters the White House Friday, having been criticized from both sides of the aisle in the wake of Trump’s chaos-causing executive order barring asylum seekers, visa and green card holders from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the U.S. He railed against the travel ban, saying it was “against everything @Uber stands for” in a tweet Sunday. Uber has set aside $3 million to fund legal efforts against the order, he added. The company drew backlash when it halted surge pricing during a protest by mostly Middle East-born New York City taxi drivers, effectively negating their service boycott around the John F. Kennedy Airport. The hashtag #DeleteUber gained traction online. Related Stories Trump To Step Away From Business-Related Duties Tim Cook Says Apple Is Considering Taking Legal Action Against Trump Immigration Order As of Thursday, both Kalanick and Musk had reportedly signed a joint letter the tech community planned to send to Trump in opposition of the travel ban, the Journal reported, citing “people familiar with the matter.” IBM said in a Jan. 30 statement on the order that the company “will continue to work and advocate” for the free flow of people and ideas. Meanwhile, hundreds signed an open letter urging Cosgrove of the Cleveland Clinic to distance himself from the administration, and a Sudanese medical resident at the prestigious hospital awaited a court hearing on the status of her H1-B specialty work visa as of Wednesday.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Main Menu WPP’s GTB broadens expertise with acquisition of Zubi Advertising Services in the U.S. 2 February 2017Military News DEARBORN, Mich., Feb. 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — GTB announced today the acquisition of Zubi Advertising Services, Inc. („Zubi”), a full-service advertising agency that focuses on the Hispanic market in the US. The acquisition and integration of Zubi into GTB’s offering represents a strategic move for the agency as its clients are increasingly aiming to connect effectively with the Hispanic consumer.  The U.S. Census expects the Latin population to more than double with the next two generations. Founded in 1976 by Tere Zubizarreta — with a typewriter, a modest retainer, and one phone line to service her first client, Banco Popular — Zubi is headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida with offices in Los Angeles and Detroit. Zubi employs approximately 120 people and has a blue chip client roster that includes the likes of Ford Motor Company, J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Dunkin’ Donuts. „This affiliation is part of our evolution to provide our clients with best-in-class resources and to work together to grow through new business opportunities.  Michelle and I are confident that the legacy of Tere Zubi will continue for decades to come,” said Joe Zubi, Chief Operating Officer, whose sister, Michelle Zubi, currently serves as the firm’s Chief Administrative Officer. „We’re delighted to welcome Zubi into the GTB family,” said Satish Korde, GTB’s Global Chief Executive Officer.  „Zubi does outstanding work and exhibits an authentic culture of extraordinarily talented people.  For GTB, this acquisition exemplifies our approach to bring the best to bear for our client.” Now a key part of an agency team that spans across six continents, Zubi will benefit from the diverse resources of the WPP group of companies.  The acquisition continues WPP’s strategy of investing to strengthen its „horizontality” offer to clients by enhancing the capabilities of its global client teams, such as GTB, and in important markets such as the US. About GTB: Headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan, and founded in 2007, GTB is an industry-leading advertising and communications agency. Formerly known as Team Detroit, Blue Hive and Retail First, the agency unified under the single name GTB in May 2016. A WPP company, GTB has 49 global offices across six continents.

Condemned house remains in Sandy Springs after 4 years Nearly four years after it was condemned, a fire-damaged house at 337 Hilderbrand Drive still stands vacant. The house attracts homeless people, while large trees out front drop limbs, most recently onto a neighbor’s roof and truck. And no one officially involved has been able to do anything about it. Not its former occupant, Charles Farlow, who says legal tangles prevent him from selling. Not one of the world’s biggest banks, JPMorgan Chase, which may or may not hold the deed, but definitely won’t fix the property. Not city inspectors, who at one point were reduced to issuing a blanket citation to “whichever entity is responsible.” The fire-damaged house at 337 Hilderbrand Drive lingers in disrepair nearly four years after it was condemned. (Photo John Ruch) Neighbors circulated a petition last fall that pushed the city to take more legal action, which still is pending, and they say they’ll believe in results when they see them. “No one will stand up and say, ‘That’s my property. I’m sorry it happened and I’ll make it right,’” said the neighbor whose truck was smashed by the fallen limb, and who asked not to be named. The Hilderbrand house is among thousands nationwide left in disrepair amid legal confusion and finger-pointing in the wake of the 2007-2008 mortgage crisis. Some major cities, such as Los Angeles, have sued or prosecuted big banks over vacant homes. Sandy Springs has taken Farlow, Chase or both to court several times — even jailing Farlow at one point — with little result. City Code Enforcement Manager Yvonne Smith said she wishes state or federal laws would offer “more clarity … and more responsibility placed on the lien-holder” in such cases. At a Jan. 6 court hearing, the city won the ability to demolish the house if it’s deemed a safety hazard, according to City Attorney Wendell Willard, but an official decision was not expected until another court hearing on Feb. 3. If the city does tear down the house, it will seek reimbursement, Willard said–but it remains unclear who, if anyone, would foot that bill. Farlow, who runs Authentic Beauty Salon on Roswell Road, said he understands the neighbors’ frustrations. “It’s been in some crazy — I don’t know what the word is — Catch-22, some kind of limbo,” Farlow said. “I’ve been stuck between a rock and a hard place.” Farlow said the 2007 mortgage crisis caused him to lose several rental properties in Florida and elsewhere in Georgia, and put him in danger of foreclosure on 337 Hilderbrand, where he was living. He said he stopped making mortgage payment to the lender, Chase, and put the house’s ownership in the name of his mother, Myrleen. A tree limb fell during a recent storm from 337 Hilderbrand onto a neighbor’s truck. (Special) Then came the house fire on Feb. 16, 2013. City inspectors condemned the house six days later after finding “ceiling and walls are missing in certain areas,” among other damage, according to city Code Enforcement records. Farlow said he couldn’t afford to repair or demolish the house. So he continued what he called a financial “game” with Chase, who he said previously refused to refinance his loan. He said he filed bankruptcies, sued the bank and tried various loan modification schemes, including a $1,000 “scam” deal with a Las Vegas man. “I guess I’m a little vindictive,” Farlow said. “The government bailed banks out, but didn’t do anything to bail us out. … I thought, ‘If you’re going to play this game, I’m going to play this game, too, but I’ll play it even better than you.’” In May 2014, the city arrested Farlow for continuing code violations, according to city records, and he said they jailed him for nearly 10 days. At the time, the city contracted jail services in the south Georgia city of Pelham, more than 230 miles away. Farlow said the jailing hurt his business and did nothing to solve his financial troubles, and he still is considering bringing a lawsuit. “I run a business in Sandy Springs,” Farlow said. “I disappeared off the face of the Earth for nine-and-a-half days.” The jailing did not fix the property’s condition. Farlow, who said he still sometimes picks up mail at the property, confirmed neighborhood reports of homeless people recently breaking in. “They left me a note asking if they could stay the winter,” he said. Around the time of his jailing, and in the years since, Farlow attempted to give Chase the deed or arrange a sale, he said. He said he currently has a potential buyer, but that Chase has not agreed and wants a higher price. But Chase’s exact role with the property remains unclear and in dispute. While Fulton County property records and City Attorney Willard say Chase current holds the deed, Chase spokesperson Elizabeth Seymour said that’s not true. “We will work with the city toward a meaningful resolution for this property,” she said in an email. “Currently, we do not own the property and, as such, have no legal right to perform work on the property.” A fresh condemnation notice was placed on the front door of 337 Hilderbrand by city inspectors following a Jan. 6 court hearing. (Photo John Ruch) In an interview, Seymour could not explain why county records say otherwise. She said Chase considers the property to be in “pre-sale,” meaning a foreclosure could be pending, but that Farlow’s complex legal situation might be delaying that. “We would have been more proactive if we had foreclosed on it,” she said. Code Enforcement officials began focusing on Chase in January 2015, city records show, and over the next six months got contradictory answers and actions from the bank. At first, Chase said it didn’t even hold the loan. After inspectors found Chase’s name on the deed, the records say, the bank said “service” for the property was done by a Texas company that never answered inspectors’ phone calls. In May 2015, Chase agreed to do such maintenance as lawn-mowing, but reversed that decision a month later. City Councilmember Chris Burnett, who heads the local Bank of Sandy Springs, said he recently called Chase officials about 337 Hilderbrand and reminded them of the industry’s recent bad reputation for various big-bank scandals. “I said, ‘This would be a great opportunity for your bank to avoid a negative public relations issue’ … and most importantly, they solve an issue that should have been solved years ago,” Burnett said. Burnett said he also brought up a recent program where Chase gave $4 million in grants for housing and other revitalization in Atlanta and Gwinnett County. “I pointed that out and said, ‘How about pulling out a little of the 4 million [dollars] and get this one house resolved?’” he said, adding there has been no solid answer from Chase. The house’s unnamed neighbor says the city should treat a “deep-pocketed corporation” as strictly as it did Farlow, “even if it’s a bank and it’s hard. You need to step up and do the right thing and make the right decisions.” “The property is an embarrassment to the city,” the neighbor said.

Kudlow is out, evidently a casualty of objections from National Economic Council Director and former Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn. Hassett could still get the gig but it’s been weeks now since his appointment seemed imminent. White House spokespeople did not respond to MM’s request for comment on the status of the CEA, which is tasked with developing economic forecasts for the White House and coordinating with OMB and Treasury, the so-called “troika” of macroeconomic data generation for the West Wing. Story Continued Below One person familiar with the process told MM it looked as though the CEA was “getting taken out back and shot.” But this person also said the White House could change course and wind up announcing Hassett or someone else for the job at any moment. Another source inside the administration said there will in fact be a CEA chair and that interviews are ongoing. POLITICO’s Tara Palmeri has more on this here but it also looks like Anthony Scaramucci is now out, at least for now, as a senior adviser to Trump after selling his hedge fund business and planning a move to Washington. The Mooch seems to be a victim of chief of staff Reince Priebus consolidating power and not wanting yet another prominent voice in President Donald Trump’s ear. The NYT reports that while Scaramucci won’t become director of the White House office of public liaison, he may get another West Wing job “down the road.” The broader reason all this matters to Wall Street and corporate America is that executives want as many voices that are generally pro-free trade/free markets and in favor of more moderate immigration policies around Trump to counter the Steve Bannon/Peter Navarro approach to protectionism and nationalism. Kudlow and Hassett both fit that mold as does Scaramucci. Cohn does as well along with incoming Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. SPERLING DEBUT — Gene Sperling, the dean of Democratic policy wonks, debuts as a contributing editor for The Atlantic this morning. His first piece looks at the question of whether we will be able to trust economic data coming out of this administration. The first jobs report of the Trump era comes out Friday. “On the evening of September 1, 2011, I had the unpleasant task of delivering the confidential August jobs report to President Obama before it would be made public the next day. ‘I don’t like the look on your face,’ I remember the president saying to me in the Oval Office. ‘The job number is zero,’ I said. ‘Zero?’ he asked. ‘What do you mean, ‘zero’?’ “‘The payroll jobs data is zero,’ I replied. Incredulous, the president asked, ‘You mean it is exactly zero? Like, if I took that paper out of your hand and looked at it, I would just see a zero?’ ‘Yes,’ I replied with a wince. “Yet, however negative or seemingly unfair this trend was, there was one thing neither the president nor anyone on his team would consider doing: attacking the credibility of the workers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). … “On the eve of the release of the first jobs report during Trump’s presidency, this leads to a pressing question: Will he revive the Nixonian tradition of interfering with federal economic agencies if they announce numbers that do not please him?” Read it here. DAILY WTF NUMBER 1 — Via AP: “President Donald Trump threatened in a phone call with his Mexican counterpart to send U.S. troops to stop ‘bad hombres down there’ unless the Mexican military does more to control them itself, according to an excerpt of a transcript of the conversation obtained by The Associated Press. “The excerpt of the call did not make clear who exactly Trump considered ‘bad hombres,’ — drug cartels, immigrants, or both — or the tone and context of the remark, made in a Friday morning phone call between the leaders. It also did not contain Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's response” Read more. DAILY WTF NUMBER 2 — WP’s Greg Miller and Philip Rucker: “It should have been one of the most congenial calls for the new commander in chief — a conversation with the leader of Australia, one of America’s staunchest allies, at the end of a triumphant week. Instead … Trump blasted Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over a refu­gee agreement and boasted about the magnitude of his electoral college win, according to senior U.S. officials briefed on the Saturday exchange. “Then, 25 minutes into what was expected to be an hour-long call, Trump abruptly ended it. At one point Trump informed Turnbull that he had spoken with four other world leaders that day — including Russian President Vladi­mir Putin — and that ‘This was the worst call by far.’” Read more. FED DOES NUTHIN’ — Fed Pantheon’s Ian Shepherdson: “The FOMC statement did enough to keep alive the idea that rates could rise in March, but the ball is now mostly in Congress' court. If a clear plan for substantial fiscal easing has emerged by the time of the meeting on March 15, policymakers can incorporate its potential impact on growth, unemployment and inflation into their forecasts, then a rate hike will be much more likely. IHS Markit’s Nariman Behravesh, Sara Johnson, and Ozlem Yaylaci: “There were two main changes to the FOMC statement at the first meeting of the year, both signaling that the next rate hike might come as early as March. … IHS Global Insight expects the next hike to come in June, but new data on employment, inflation, and GDP could convince the Fed to move in March.” HEDGE FUND WINNERS — Via the LCH Investments list of top performing hedge funds: Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world with more than $160B in AUM, made the most money for clients last year, allowing it to retain the title of generating more money for investors than any other hedge fund in history.

Email Mary Lee on mlee@politico.com and follow her on Twitter @msverymary. THIS MORNING ON POLITICO PRO FINANCIAL SERVICES — Patrick Temple-West on how the GOP is at odds with asset managers over SEC rules — and to get Morning Money every day before 6 a.m. — please contact Pro Services at (703) 341-4600 info@politicopro.com DRIVING THE DAY — President Trump speaks around 8:00 a.m. at the Nat’l Prayer Breakfast … House Financial Services has an organizational meeting at 11:00 a.m. … Jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. expected to dip to 250K from 259K … Productivity and unit labor costs at 8:30 a.m. expected to rise 1.0 percent and 1.9 percent respectively. “TRUMP ADVISER” A CONTRADICTION — Timothy O’Brien on BloombergView: “Rex Tillerson, who ran Exxon Mobil for a decade before signing on as Donald Trump's secretary of state, is reportedly ‘baffled’ that the White House didn't consult with him on its controversial executive order restricting travel and immigration … James Mattis … is said by the Associated Press to be ‘particularly incensed’ about exactly the same thing. “They may be in for more surprises, however, because there's a good chance that Trump merely sees them as hood ornaments atop the little engine of state he's building at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. For most of Trump's career he has only trusted a small group of longtime loyalists at the Trump Organization, and even then he has often tightened the circle further to family members.” Read more. MORE MUNCHIN MADNESS — As we predicted, Steven Mnuchin cleared Senate Finance on partisan lines with no Democrats boycotting the vote. No surprise but progressives are incensed. Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform: “The majority on the Senate Finance Committee has chosen to ignore lies and evasions, to ram through the Mnuchin nomination in defiance of its own procedures, and to all vote YES despite both the known facts about his bank's abusive and sometimes illegal foreclosure practices, and serious unanswered questions other matters” GOP FORCES SENATE VOTES TO FLOOR — POLITICO Pro’s Zachary Warmbrodt and Adam Cancryn reports: “Senate Republicans cast aside obstruction from Democrats on Wednesday and advanced President Donald Trump's nominees to head the Treasury Department and HHS to the Senate floor. “A day after Senate Finance Committee Democrats refused to show up for a vote on Treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin and Health and Human Services nominee Rep. Tom Price, Republicans on the committee agreed Wednesday morning to suspend quorum rules that required a member of the minority party to participate in the confirmation vote.” Read more. JPMORGAN TO PAY LEHMAN $797.5M — Reuters’ Jonathan Stempel: “JPMorgan Chase & Co will pay $797.5 million in cash to end all litigation brought on behalf the former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, whose September 2008 collapse triggered a global financial crisis. “It follows JPMorgan's agreement last January to pay $1.42 billion in cash to resolve most other claims, in what had been an $8.6 billion lawsuit against the largest U.S. bank to recoup money for Lehman creditors.” Read more. THE RULE TILLERSON TRIED TO KILL — POLITICO’s Michael Grunwald reports: “Back in 2010, ExxonMobil’s then-CEO, Rex Tillerson, was deeply worried about Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms, a bipartisan amendment that required drilling and mining companies to disclose any payments they make to foreign governments. So Tillerson and one of his lobbyists paid a half-hour visit to the amendment’s Republican co-author, then-Senator Richard Lugar, to try to get it killed. “So after all of Trump’s promises to drain the swamp, an anti-anti-corruption bill pushed by Big Oil and his own top diplomat might be the first policy legislation to reach his desk.” Read more. GRAPHIC — Bloomberg: Why NAFTA matters as illustrated by the journey of one tiny widget. HOUSE ERASES OBAMA-ERA RULES — POLITICO Pro’s Alex Guillen: “The House passed two bills on Wednesday that will erase regulations targeting the coal industry and the oil and mining sector, launching Republicans' offensive against a series of late-term rules put in place by former President Barack Obama. “If it passes the Senate and is signed by President Donald Trump, as is expected, the vote will mark the first time in 15 years that lawmakers successfully used the Congressional Review Act to unwind executive branch actions — and Republicans lawmakers who were enraged over Obama’s expansive regulatory agenda say they are prepared to deploy the tool to kill a dozen or more rules on energy, labor and guns.” Read more. WHITE HOUSE TO LOOK AT VISA PROGRAMS — WSJ’s Laura Meckler: “The White House and lawmakers in Congress appear poised to take on another contentious slice of immigration policy: the visa programs favored by technology and other companies. “A draft of an executive order under consideration directs the government to re-examine a range of visa programs to ensure they prioritize and protect ‘the jobs, wages and well-being of United States workers.’” Read more. CFPB ORDERS $13M IN FINES — POLITICO Pro’s Lorraine Woellert: “The CFPB ordered MasterCard International Inc. and UniRush to pay $10 million in restitution and a $3 million fine after a technological breakdown prevented thousands of prepaid-card customers from accessing their money. “Taking action under a Dodd-Frank Act provision governing "unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices," or UDAP, the bureau took action after an October 2015 failure that affected nearly 50,000 users of a prepaid card service called RushCard.” Read more. DEMOCRATS PRESS WELLS FARGO — NYT’s Emily Glazer: “A half-dozen Democratic senators sent a letter to Wells Fargo& Co. Wednesday asking questions following a Wall Street Journal article about the bank giving advance notice of internal inspections to branch employees, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by the Journal. “Sent by Senator Bob Menendez (D, N.J.) along with other Democratic members of the Senate Banking Committee, the letter asked Wells Fargo Chief Executive Timothy Sloan 15 questions about employees who the story said shredded papers and forged signatures to cover up questionable sales practices.” Read more. GUIDELINES ON ‘TOO-BIG-TO-FAIL’ CLEARINGHOUSES — POLITICO Pro’s Fiona Maxwell reports: “The Financial Stability Board has published its latest guidelines on how authorities should act to prevent the failure of clearing houses. “The standards aim to guide regulators in developing frameworks for saving central counterparty clearing houses, or CCPs, that are on the brink of failure.” Read more. SENATE VERSION OF TAX REFORM PLAN — POLITICO Pro’s Colin Wilhelm reports: “The Senate will work on its own tax reform plan rather than just wait for the House's version to pass, Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told business leaders at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce this morning. “‘I know that a handful of senators have serious reservations over border adjustability,” Hatch said, though he praised House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady's efforts as well as the general idea of moving to a territorial tax system, “which would be much better than what we currently have.’” Read more. TRUMP AIDE’S DEAL WITH CHINESE FIRM — NYT’s Sharon LaFraniere, Michael Forsythe and Alexandra Stevenson: “A secretive Chinese company with deep ties to the country’s Communist Party has become one of the biggest foreign investors in the United States over the past year, snapping up American firms in a string of multibillion-dollar deals. But it is one of its smaller deals that is apparently stalling the White House career of a top adviser to President Trump. “It is the second time a politically connected Chinese company has chased a business deal with an incoming White House official. And it is evidence of the unusual confluence of interests between superrich members of the new Trump administration who need to unwind complex financial portfolios to comply with government rules and international firms eager to buy American assets.” Read more. READY TO RIP APART ‘DODD-FRANK’ — Public Integrity’s Jared Bennett reports: “Now that Donald Trump is president, the banking industry is well on its way to accomplishing what has been its top priority goal for years: upending Dodd-Frank, the massive regulatory law that emerged from the financial crisis. “Members on the Republican-controlled House and Senate banking committees, many of whom received some of the heftiest sums of campaign donations from banks, have readied bills that would weaken many of the law’s protections; they argue the changes are necessary to reduce costly regulations and give consumers more choice in the financial services market. With that kind of influence, Wall Street will probably get much of what it wants.” Read more. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — MORE CEO REACT TO THE TRAVEL BAN — Tech:NYC drafted a letter about the Trump EOs on Sunday. More than 400 people signed it in the first 12 hours, including folks like Travis Kalanick. Sine the draft went wide, 1,600 people have signed. The version that went to the White House today had more than 2,000 names, according to organizers. See it here. TRAVEL BAN COULD HIT GE — POLITICO’s Tara Palmeri and Bryan Bender: “The Iraqi government is warning that a pair of pending deals with General Electric could be at risk from .. Trump's travel ban, according to internal State Department documents. The industrial conglomerate, which builds everything from nuclear reactors to aircraft engines, already has sizable interests in Iraq, including power contracts worth more than a billion dollars and hundreds of employees in the country.” Read more. « View Archives Authors: Ben White bwhite@politico.com @morningmoneyben Mary Lee mlee@politico.com About The Author Ben White is POLITICO Pro's chief economic correspondent and author of the “Morning Money” column covering the nexus of finance and public policy.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Feb 2, 2017 at 7:47AM With the fourth-quarter earnings season coming to a close, it's time to update the list of the 10 biggest banks in America. Without further ado, here it is: Bank Assets (Millions) JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) $2,490,972 Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) $2,187,702 Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $1,930,115 Citigroup (NYSE:C) $1,792,077 US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) $445,964 PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) $366,380 Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) $357,033 Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) $333,469 State Street (NYSE:STT) $242,698 BB&T (NYSE:BBT) $219,276 Data source: YCharts.com. JPMorgan Chase maintained its position atop the industry, with $2.5 trillion worth of assets. That seems big, but if you also factor in the assets that JPMorgan administers for institutional investors, and are thus not on JPMorgan's balance sheet, the figure climbs to $23 trillion. Bank of America retained its position at No. 2. This isn't likely to change anytime soon, as it's neither aggressively growing its asset base nor contracting it. The one bank that could eventually challenge Bank of America for its slot is Wells Fargo, which just last year eclipsed Citigroup to become the third biggest U.S. bank. Wells Fargo has benefited from its prudence going into the financial crisis, which enabled it to more than double in size thanks to its 2008 acquisition of Wachovia. Citigroup found itself in the exact opposite situation. After going into the crisis as the biggest bank in America, Citigroup had to change course. It's since aggressively scaled back its operations to raise capital and simplify its operations. Image source: Getty Images. Outside the big four banks, U.S. Bancorp retained its rank as the nation's largest regional bank. Based in Minneapolis, U.S. Bancorp is arguably better positioned than any of these banks to outperform the industry in the years ahead. U.S. Bancorp is big enough to benefit from economies of scale, which is one of the reasons it's such an efficient bank. Yet it's small enough to avoid the more onerous regulatory environment confronting its multitrillion-dollar peers. Also on the list are regional banks PNC Financial, BB&T, and Capital One Financial, the last of which was once a monoline credit card company before acquiring its way into the regional banking space. Finally, the two biggest custodial banks in the country make the list, too -- Bank of New York Mellon and State Street. These institutions are unique because most of their size comes, not unlike JPMorgan Chase, from the fact that they administer assets for other institutions. To this end, each of these banks has more than $30 trillion worth of assets under custody, administration, or management. Ultimately, when it comes to investing in bank stocks, there are both positive and negative aspects that accompany size, as I noted with respect to U.S. Bancorp. How these aspects balance out is institution-specific and is something investors should look into before buying any of these stocks.

It's not a particularly sexy part of the industry, but investors were sold on ClearMotion Inc.'s vision for using technology to give your car a smoother ride. Silicon Valley's New Enterprise Associates, World Innovation Lab, Eileses Capital and Qualcomm's VC arm were among those contributing funds. JPMorgan Chase's asset management group led the funding round and took a seat on the company's board of directors. ClearMotion was founded in 2009 by Massachusetts Institute of Technology students seeking to design a better shock absorber. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The part is found on the wheels of every car and truck sold today. The startup hopes to set itself apart with software that controls the vehicle's actuators, helping to quickly identify and react to road conditions like speed bumps and potholes and improve vehicle suspension systems. Shakeel Avadhany, the company's 29-year-old chief executive, somehow manages to pitch shocks like they're an Apple product. "We want to do for motion what noise-canceling headphones do for noise," he said. "Traditional shock absorbers play defense against the road. We're playing offense." The auto industry is in the midst of an overhaul thanks to several trends happening simultaneously. Cars are going electric, learning to drive themselves and becoming computers on wheels. Detroit is also grappling with the future of automobile ownership in a world of autonomy and ride-hailing apps. Tech investors are anxious about missing the next turn. Venture funding for auto-tech startups topped $1 billion in 2016, according to research firm CB Insights. The largest deal last year was an investment of at least $200 million in the secretive autonomous-car startup Zoox. "We are just scratching the surface in terms of technology that will enable the automobile," said Kittu Kolluri, a director and investor in ClearMotion. The latest round of funding was ClearMotion's third, but the 115-person company still has a long way to go. Its product isn't being manufactured yet, and it declined to disclose any supplier agreements.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES The last refugees Utah couple sentenced to jail in connection with death of baby Berkeley campus chaos over canceled Milo Yiannopoulos appearance spurs free-speech questions Comments: Utah football: In Texas and Hawaii, Utes take a step forward in recruiting Utah football: Utes strike gold with some targets, miss out on some big ones as well ELEVATE H&R Block Announces Two New Offers: Refund Advance of Up to $1,250 and Free Federal 1040EZ   Professional-in-Residence Jim Mortensen Prepares Students to Become Top Advisors   3 Unforgettable Date Night Ideas   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

Companies whose chief executives are expected to attend the meeting of the president's business advisory panel include JPMorgan Chase & Co , General Motors Co , Blackstone Group LP , IBM Corp , Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Walt Disney Co , two officials briefed on the meeting said on Wednesday. Activists are already pressuring the CEOs to raise concerns about the travel restrictions at the meeting, which comes at the end of another turbulent week for the Trump administration. Trump's order last Friday, barring travel into the United States by people from seven Muslim-majority countries, touched off public protests and stirred unease among employees at many big US companies. CEOs have been faced with difficult choices to either criticise Trump's move at a time when they are trying to win White House support on tax and trade policies, or remain silent and take heat from consumers and employees dismayed by the order. The Trump administration says the travel ban is aimed at strengthening national security. Backlash over the measure knocked the wind out of the post-inaugural stock market rally, although major indexes rebounded on Wednesday. Trump's executive order put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Along with protests it has prompted legal challenges in the United States and drawn criticism from several leading U.S. companies. Among those critics, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wrote in an email to employees Saturday that "the ban will impact many innocent people - an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump's first business advisory group meeting." Trump will kick off the two-hour meeting with an address lasting 10-15 minutes and will be followed by Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire founder of private equity group Blackstone , who chairs the panel and assembled it at Trump's request. Four topics will be discussed -- regulatory relief, women in the work force, tax and trade, and infrastructure -- with two to three people talking briefly about each subject to help shape "how the administration should be thinking," according to a person familiar with the matter. Investors said the CEOs would be mindful of Trump's penchant for rebuking companies publicly. "Given recent history, being called out publicly is something that the CEOs in that room and other CEOs will absolutely be mindful to avoid," said Jim Russell, vice president at Bahl & Gaynor Inc, which oversees $17 billion and owns shares in several of the companies attending Friday's meeting. "I'm sure they will pick their fights carefully and articulate them carefully." It was not clear if all 19 members of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum would attend Friday's meeting. Other members include the CEOs of Tesla Inc , Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Boeing Co . Tesla founder Elon Musk said this week that the travel order should be modified and he would seek a consensus among members of the advisory council. Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and CEO Mark Fields have also criticized the travel measure. GM has declined to take a position. On Wednesday, a group of religious investors, human rights groups other activists urged members of the business advisory panel to speak out against the travel restrictions at the meeting with Trump. In a joint letter to the corporate leaders, the group said Trump's order "undermines respect for human rights and the lives of workers and their families in the U.S. and beyond, and disrupts economic activity and company operations." The letter was signed by dozens of people, including representatives of firms focused on socially-responsible investing like Calvert Research and Management and Domini Impact Investments. Others included representatives of the International Corporate Accountability Roundtable, the Institute for Human Rights and Business and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. Companies that have been most critical of Trump's immigration orders include Netflix Inc , Apple Inc , and Amazon.com Inc , none of which form part of the business advisory panel.

(AMD) Stock Won’t Stop at $12 The Snapchat IPO: The Next Facebook Inc (FB) … Or Twitter Inc (TWTR)? Here’s Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Will Definitely Gain 20%-Plus Recent Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Won’t Stop at $12 Here’s Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Will Definitely Gain 20%-Plus Why Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Is Under Siege View All Posts Investors who are looking for a potential turnaround candidate in 2017 that can outperform the market should consider FireEye Inc (NASDAQ:FEYE). Despite the stock’s 6% rise year to date, FEYE stock — currently around $13 — is poised to reach $17 per share, delivering some 35% returns. FEYE Stock and the Need for Cybersecurity Source: David via Flickr (Modified) Imagine a world where you didn’t have to keep multiple passwords for the various websites you visit daily and a world where you didn’t have to worry that the point-of-sale system at the checkout counter of your favorite retailer could steal your credit card number and other personal information. Now wake up. In the world we live in, it’s cybersecurity companies like FireEye, which accounted for over half of the advanced malware industry revenue in 2015, that help prevent these things from happening. With hackers attacking major companies like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and The Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD), cybersecurity continues to be an increasingly important issue that companies must address, especially as they transition their business more towards mobile platform platforms and mobile apps. As a pioneer of the green field malware sandbox niche, FireEye is poised to re-capture what it lost in the cyber security space. FireEye Growth Prospects In a February 2016 report by consulting company NTT Com Security, half of the 1,000 business executives said they did not have a formal plan in place to secure and protect company data if they were hacked. These corporations now have no other choice by to spend money. In 2020, these organizations are expected to spend $101.6 billion on cybersecurity software, services, and hardware, according to research by the International Data Corporation (IDC). That level of spending amounts to a 38% rise from the $73.7 billion that IDC projects organizations will spend on cybersecurity in 2016. This puts FireEye and FEYE stock in a great situation. FireEye still has best-of-breed security offering that can help market share from network security vendors like Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT), thanks to its malware sandboxing technology, used for detecting advanced security threat before they find their way into a network. And with the corporations lacking adequate threat-prevention/threat-detection tools, FireEye’s revenue — which have slowed in recent years — should begin to climb. “Security has become heavily scrutinized by boards of directors demanding that security budgets are used wisely and solutions operate at peak efficiency,” said Sean Pike, IDC’s vice president of security products, in a statement. Bottom Line for FEYE Stock FireEye will report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results on Thursday. The company, which has beaten analysts’ earnings-per-share estimates in five straight quarters, is projected to lose $1.13 per share in the current fiscal year and lose another 46 cents per share in fiscal 2017. After losing 41% of its value in 2016, FireEye’s cost-cutting efforts are expected to have meaningful impact on its bottom line, as 2017 adjusted loss projected to narrow from $1.47 per share to 47 cents. Combined with new product launches to grow the top line, FEYE stock could be a hidden gem, reaching $17 per share. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

[Photo: Flickr user Tyne & Wear Archives] More from Robot Revolution Wearables That Detect Emotion Could Tell You When The Conversation Is Getting Awkward GoPro Re-Launching Its Recalled Karma Drone, But It May Be Too Late At San Francisco's New Cafe X, A Robot Makes Your Coffee Just The Way You Like It Steven Melendez 01.31.17 5:34 AM It's no secret that finding good workers isn't easy, particularly in the competitive tech world. Hiring managers can spend hours using primitive keyword search tools to sift through half-relevant resumes on job boards, and workers with in-demand skills get bombarded with emails from recruiters offering them jobs they’re not particularly interested in, says Ed Donner, cofounder and CEO of New York startup Untapt. "Hiring tech people is an incredible pain point," says Donner, who previously headed a technology team with hundreds of employees at JPMorgan Chase. "It’s still impossibly hard to find talent." More On The Future Of Job Hunting: This Is How AI Will Change Your Work In 2017 What It's Like To Use A Chatbot To Apply For Jobs How "Blind Recruitment" Works And Why You Should Consider It Untapt is one of a number of companies looking to make it easier to digitally dig through piles of resumes, using machine learning techniques to develop algorithms that predict how well-suited a candidate is for a job. Advocates and industry experts say that adding automation to recruiting can save time and money and can potentially help hiring managers find and consider a more diverse set of applicants. Helping to Eliminate Bias "People are very subject to unconscious bias, and with the help of the machine, you can overcome a lot of the unconscious bias," says Tom Haak, director of the HR Trend Institute. "When the machine learns what you’re looking for, it can say, if you find this type of candidate positive, here are other ones." Untapt, which launched in early 2015, is focused on filling financial tech positions, and its software is designed to locate candidates with particular technical skills more efficiently than could be done through traditional text searches of resumes and cover letters. If a company is looking to hire developers adept at functional programming, a software development technique popular in parts of the fintech world, Untapt’s tool can learn to recognize that experience in certain programming languages is likely a good sign, Donner says. Untapt "You’re dealing with this very noisy data set with a lot of information," he says. "That kind of problem is perfectly suited to artificial intelligence and to machine learning." The company keeps track of which candidates its software surfaces actually get interviewed and for which positions, and uses that information to continually refine its algorithms, which Donner says often already outperform human recruiters in terms of the percentage of candidates called in for interviews. Untapt also looks to surface candidates from underrepresented groups—such as women, veterans, and people of color—and more generally find candidates who might be overlooked by traditional recruiters. "We also have features in Untapt [where] clients can choose to mask names and photos on the resumes they’re presented with, so they’re making blind decisions," says Donner. The company attracts jobseekers through a mix of techniques, including online ads, blog posts, and appearances at industry events, and only shares their resume information with companies they agree to connect with, he says. That helps attract candidates who might not want to actively participate on more traditional job search boards but are interested in exploring their options, he says. Machine learning can also help companies efficiently find potential candidates amid resumes they already have on file when new positions open up, says Steve Goodman, cofounder and CEO of San Francisco-based Restless Bandit. The company specializes in what it calls "talent rediscovery," resurfacing applicants to its clients' previous job postings that could be promising for new positions. To suggest potential candidates for a position, it looks at application records and digital hiring system data indicating how various previous applicants to similar roles have fared, learning over time which resumes to highlight for which openings. "We learn the hiring patterns of the company," Goodman says. In the future, the company will likely incorporate more data about how successful candidates fare at their new jobs, including information pulled from human resources systems tracking how candidates progress up company ladders. Restless Bandit also can already fetch publicly available data from the internet about job candidates, so companies can keep their files up to date as they consider them for new positions. "One of the things we do for companies is, we actually go out on the open web," says Goodman. "We try to find that person, and we try to enrich that resume with the latest data." [Photo: Flickr user National Library of Ireland] A Replacement For The "Gut Feeling"? What machine learning systems can’t, at present, do is eliminate the need for job interviews, he says. They can’t evaluate applicants’ body language and conversational skills, or estimate how they’ll fit into a given team’s existing culture, meaning there’s still a definite need for humans in the hiring process. "We can tell you the 15 people to interview, or the 20 people to interview," he says. "We can’t tell you who to hire." Still, some companies are even developing tools that use machine learning to evaluate job candidates’ personality traits and aptitudes for a job. Ideally, artificial intelligence can help companies move beyond basic personality quizzes that critics have long said can be easily gamed by applicants able to guess the "right answers" for a given job. Cognisess, based in Bath, England, offers about 40 different game-like assessments through its software platform, measuring factors like working memory, empathy, and ability to divide attention among multiple tasks. Based on scores of existing successful workers, the platform develops profiles of who would be well-suited to a particular position and indicates how candidates measure up, says cofounder and CEO Chris Butt. Cognisess Since the optimal results on the various tests vary from position to position, it’s difficult for applicants to rig performance, he says. "You don’t know what a good match looks like as the candidate," he says. In general, applying artificial intelligence to hiring may mean a shift away from intuitive decisions and toward more data-driven processes, says Dan Ryan, principal at Ryan Search and Consulting and a member of the Society for Human Resource Management’s talent acquisition panel. "Part of the problem with the employment, and also with the sourcing process, is there is still a reliance on gut decisions versus data-driven decisions," he says. "If you could actually have data that shows using the data-driven approach could produce better results versus using the gut feeling, that’s where the results will come." Never miss a story.

Companies whose CEO's are expected to attend the meeting of the president's business advisory panel include JPMorgan Chase & Co , General Motors Co , Blackstone Group LP , IBM Corp , Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Walt Disney Co , two officials briefed on the meeting said on Wednesday. Trump's executive order suspending the U.S. refugee program for 120 days and putting a three-month ban on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries has prompted protests and legal challenges in the United States, and has drawn criticism from several leading U.S. companies. Among those critics, Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick wrote in an email to employees Saturday that "the ban will impact many innocent people - an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump's first business advisory group meeting." It was not clear if all 19 members of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum would attend Friday's meeting. Other members include the chief executives of Tesla Motors Inc , Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Boeing Co . Tesla founder Elon Musk said this week that the travel order should be modified and he would seek a consensus among members of the advisory council. Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields have also criticized the travel measure.. GM has declined to take a position. Trump ordered the restrictions on Jan. 27, saying they were aimed at protecting Americans from the threat of terrorist attacks. The business forum is chaired by Stephen A. Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of Blackstone. Trump is a wealthy New York real estate developer and his transition team announced the group in December, saying "some of America's most highly respected and successful business leaders, will be called upon to meet with the president frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge as the President implements his economic agenda." The White House did not immediately comment Wednesday on the meeting. Trump has held numerous meeting with chief executives since taking office on Jan. 20, including leaders of major automakers, manufacturers, aerospace and pharmaceutical companies. Among the companies that have been most critical of the immigration orders are Netflix Inc , Apple Inc , and Amazon.com Inc , but none of these are represented in the business forum. Apple CEO Tim Cook told the Wall Street Journal the company is considering a legal challenge to the immigration order.

Companies whose chief executives are expected to attend the meeting of the president's business advisory panel include JPMorgan Chase & Co, General Motors Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp, Uber Technologies Inc and Walt Disney Co, two officials briefed on the meeting said on Wednesday. Activists are already pressuring the CEOs to raise concerns about the travel restrictions at the meeting, which comes at the end of another turbulent week for the Trump administration. Trump's order last Friday, barring travel into the United States by people from seven Muslim-majority countries, touched off public protests and stirred unease among employees at many big US companies. CEOs have been faced with difficult choices to either criticize Trump's move at a time when they are trying to win White House support on tax and trade policies, or remain silent and take heat from consumers and employees dismayed by the order. The Trump administration says the travel ban is aimed at strengthening national security. Backlash over the measure knocked the wind out of the post-inaugural stock market rally, although major indexes rebounded on Wednesday. Trump's executive order put a 120-day halt on the US refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Along with protests it has prompted legal challenges in the United States and drawn criticism from several leading US companies. Among those critics, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wrote in an email to employees Saturday that "the ban will impact many innocent people - an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump's first business advisory group meeting." Trump will kick off the two-hour meeting with an address lasting 10-15 minutes and will be followed by Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire founder of private equity group Blackstone, who chairs the panel and assembled it at Trump's request. Four topics will be discussed -- regulatory relief, women in the work force, tax and trade, and infrastructure -- with two to three people talking briefly about each subject to help shape "how the administration should be thinking," according to a person familiar with the matter. Investors said the CEOs would be mindful of Trump's penchant for rebuking companies publicly. "Given recent history, being called out publicly is something that the CEOs in that room and other CEOs will absolutely be mindful to avoid," said Jim Russell, vice president at Bahl & Gaynor Inc, which oversees $17 billion and owns shares in several of the companies attending Friday's meeting. "I'm sure they will pick their fights carefully and articulate them carefully." It was not clear if all 19 members of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum would attend Friday's meeting. Other members include the CEOs of Tesla Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Boeing Co. Tesla founder Elon Musk said this week that the travel order should be modified and he would seek a consensus among members of the advisory council. Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and CEO Mark Fields have also criticized the travel measure . GM has declined to take a position. On Wednesday, a group of religious investors, human rights groups other activists urged members of the business advisory panel to speak out against the travel restrictions at the meeting with Trump. In a joint letter to the corporate leaders, the group said Trump's order "undermines respect for human rights and the lives of workers and their families in the US and beyond, and disrupts economic activity and company operations." The letter was signed by dozens of people, including representatives of firms focused on socially-responsible investing like Calvert Research and Management and Domini Impact Investments. Others included representatives of the International Corporate Accountability Roundtable, the Institute for Human Rights and Business and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. Companies that have been most critical of Trump's immigration orders include Netflix Inc, Apple Inc , and Amazon.com Inc, none of which form part of the business advisory panel.

Companies whose chief executives are expected to attend the meeting of the president's business advisory panel include JPMorgan Chase & Co , General Motors Co , Blackstone Group LP , IBM Corp , Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Walt Disney Co , two officials briefed on the meeting said on Wednesday.

Backlash over the measure knocked the wind out of the post-inaugural stock market rally, although major indexes rebounded on Wednesday. Trump's executive order put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Along with protests it has prompted legal challenges in the United States and drawn criticism from several leading U.S. companies. Among those critics, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wrote in an email to employees Saturday that "the ban will impact many innocent people - an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump's first business advisory group meeting." Trump will kick off the two-hour meeting with an address lasting 10-15 minutes and will be followed by Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire founder of private equity group Blackstone , who chairs the panel and assembled it at Trump's request.

Tesla founder Elon Musk said this week that the travel order should be modified and he would seek a consensus among members of the advisory council. Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and CEO Mark Fields have also criticized the travel measure. GM has declined to take a position. On Wednesday, a group of religious investors, human rights groups other activists urged members of the business advisory panel to speak out against the travel restrictions at the meeting with Trump. In a joint letter to the corporate leaders, the group said Trump's order "undermines respect for human rights and the lives of workers and their families in the U.S. and beyond, and disrupts economic activity and company operations."

Share story By STACY COWLEY The New York Times After an eight-year run, a troubled government effort to prevent foreclosures and keep struggling borrowers in their homes came to an end last month. What happens next will be a Trump-era experiment in how financial-services companies behave when the regulatory fetters are loosened. The expired Obama-era program — known as HAMP, the Home Affordable Modification Program — was widely criticized for its poor execution. Participation was voluntary for banks, and many that opted in did so unenthusiastically. (At one bank, “the floor of the room in which the bank dumped the voluminous unopened HAMP applications actually buckled under the packages’ sheer weight,” according to a scathing oversight report.)

Consumer advocates were also not thrilled; many thought the program did not go far enough to help troubled homeowners or hold accountable the banks that contributed to their predicaments. But Republican-led Washington has no intention of replacing it. So now it will be entirely up to the private sector to address a lingering social ill that was brought on by the financial crisis. Banks and mortgage lenders say they are ready to step in with their own foreclosure-prevention programs, modeled on what they learned from the Obama administration’s effort. Armed with years of new data, financial companies say they now know how to make loan-modification programs successful, for both borrowers — who want to protect their homes — and lenders, who want to limit their losses on delinquent loans headed for default. “There’s tremendous public good in having an industrywide approach,” said Justin Wiseman, the director of loan-administration policy at the Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group. “No one wants things to revert to what we had before.” Still, housing advocates are skeptical, and for good reason: The mortgage industry was largely responsible for HAMP’s shortcomings (as well as for creating the need for the program in the first place). The business has long been littered with errors, confusion and outright abuses. President Obama unveiled HAMP with fanfare in 2009 as the mortgage crisis peaked. More than 7 percent of the nation’s home loans were seriously delinquent or in foreclosure. “This will enable as many as 3 to 4 million homeowners to modify the terms of their mortgages to avoid foreclosure,” Obama said at the time. But the program fell far short of the administration’s goals. Banks and servicers routinely flouted the rules by rejecting eligible homeowners, processing applications at a snail’s pace and tossing people out even when they made their modified payments on time, according to audit reports from the program’s watchdog, the office of the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Around 70 percent of those who applied for loan modifications were turned down. In the end, some 1.6 million homeowners had their loans permanently modified — less than half the number the program was intended to help. Meanwhile, nearly 14 million homes went into foreclosure, according to ATTOM Data Solutions, which tracks foreclosure filings. At the end of last month, HAMP expired. It was always intended to be a limited-time program. And the mortgage industry, and even some consumer advocates, say now is the right time for the government to step away. The housing market has stabilized. The rate of delinquencies and foreclosures is at its lowest point since 2007 and continues to decline, and home prices have risen in many places. New lending rules have eliminated many of the practices that got homeowners and lenders in trouble, like no-documentation loans and mortgages with low teaser rates. But even in a stronger market, there will always be some homeowners in trouble because of a job loss, illness or other setback. Before 2009, few banks had programs in place to restructure loans. Through HAMP and other experiments, lenders say, they have learned much about how to make such efforts work. “Payment reduction, more than anything else, matters the most in making a modification successful,” said Wiseman of the Mortgage Bankers Association. “It sounds like the most obvious thing in the world, but it took us six years of data and research to get there.” The trade group convened a task force last year to develop a framework for future modifications. The proposal they came up with looks a lot like HAMP, with one key difference: its monthly payment target. The government’s program focused on housing debt as a percentage of a homeowner’s total income. Its goal was to set a borrower’s monthly mortgage costs at 31 percent or less of their earnings. The industry’s recommended new system instead emphasizes payment reduction. It targets a drop of at least 20 percent in the homeowner’s monthly bill through a series of steps that include interest-rate reductions, adding years to the life of the loan, and principal forbearance or forgiveness. Two of the nation’s largest mortgage holders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, adopted that end goal — a 20 percent payment reduction — for their new foreclosure-prevention program, which will take effect in October. (Both have other modification programs in place until then.) A number of major banks are also on board. JPMorgan Chase will adopt the “core constructs” of the mortgage banking group’s proposal. “I think there’s a broad consensus across the industry that standardization and scalability helps everyone,” said Erik Schmitt, JPMorgan Chase’s executive director of mortgage lending, who was co-chairman of the banking association’s task force. For lenders, getting a delinquent borrower paying again on a modified mortgage is often (but not always) cheaper than foreclosing on the home and selling it. But that is not necessarily true for mortgage servicers. which collect payments each month and are sometimes independent from the loan’s underlying owner. Chasing down late payments, and tacking on fees for them, can be lucrative. Regulators have penalized companies again and again, levying billions of dollars in fines on lenders and servicers accused of illegal and abusive tactics. Just last week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined two Citigroup subsidiaries nearly $29 million for “giving the runaround” to borrowers seeking payment relief. (Citigroup said in a written statement that it was “pleased to resolve these matters.”) That has left consumer advocates wary about whether, in the absence of a government program like HAMP, industry players can be trusted. Homeowners like Justina Osorio, a 40-year-old single mother in Columbus, Ohio, who is fighting to save her house, have a lot riding on the answer. Osorio bought her home in 1999 for around $110,000, and she and her husband raised four children there. But in 2014 the couple separated, and Osorio, who was unemployed at the time, fell behind on her $790 monthly payment. She and her children, now ages 7 to 23, feared they would become homeless. A worker at the local food bank referred Osorio to Homes on the Hill, a housing counseling agency. The group started helping her with a HAMP application in January 2016. In late December, it was finally approved, making Osorio one of the program’s final participants. Based on the monthly income of her sons — one is a cook, and two are in landscaping and construction — the family’s new monthly bill is $736. If Osorio makes three trial payments on time, her arrears will be folded into a new loan. Her housing counselor, Daniel Ruggiero, said HAMP was far from perfect, but that the modification process was typically even slower and more obstacle filled at lenders that did not participate in the voluntary program. He is leery of what comes next. “My biggest concern is whether servicers will keep following guidelines, and not just throw all this out the window and go back to the mess it was before,” Ruggiero said. “I imagine two or three will do it really well, others will muddle through, and some will simply go back to, ‘We’re not doing modifications.’” STACY COWLEY Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

Companies whose chief executives are expected to attend the meeting of the president's business advisory panel include JPMorgan Chase & Co, General Motors Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp, Uber Technologies Inc and Walt Disney Co, two officials briefed on the meeting said on Wednesday. Activists are already pressuring the CEOs to raise concerns about the travel restrictions at the meeting, which comes at the end of another turbulent week for the Trump administration. Trump's order last Friday, barring travel into the United States by people from seven Muslim-majority countries, touched off public protests and stirred unease among employees at many big U.S. companies. CEOs have been faced with difficult choices to either criticize Trump's move at a time when they are trying to win White House support on tax and trade policies, or remain silent and take heat from consumers and employees dismayed by the order. The Trump administration says the travel ban is aimed at strengthening national security. Backlash over the measure knocked the wind out of the post-inaugural stock market rally, although major indexes rebounded on Wednesday. Trump's executive order put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Along with protests it has prompted legal challenges in the United States and drawn criticism from several leading U.S. companies. Among those critics, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wrote in an email to employees Saturday that "the ban will impact many innocent people - an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump's first business advisory group meeting." Trump will kick off the two-hour meeting with an address lasting 10-15 minutes and will be followed by Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire founder of private equity group Blackstone, who chairs the panel and assembled it at Trump's request. Four topics will be discussed -- regulatory relief, women in the work force, tax and trade, and infrastructure -- with two to three people talking briefly about each subject to help shape "how the administration should be thinking," according to a person familiar with the matter. Investors said the CEOs would be mindful of Trump's penchant for rebuking companies publicly. "Given recent history, being called out publicly is something that the CEOs in that room and other CEOs will absolutely be mindful to avoid," said Jim Russell, vice president at Bahl & Gaynor Inc, which oversees $17 billion and owns shares in several of the companies attending Friday's meeting. "I'm sure they will pick their fights carefully and articulate them carefully." It was not clear if all 19 members of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum would attend Friday's meeting. Other members include the CEOs of Tesla Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Boeing Co. Tesla founder Elon Musk said this week that the travel order should be modified and he would seek a consensus among members of the advisory council. Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and CEO Mark Fields have also criticized the travel measure . GM has declined to take a position. On Wednesday, a group of religious investors, human rights groups other activists urged members of the business advisory panel to speak out against the travel restrictions at the meeting with Trump. In a joint letter to the corporate leaders, the group said Trump's order "undermines respect for human rights and the lives of workers and their families in the U.S. and beyond, and disrupts economic activity and company operations." The letter was signed by dozens of people, including representatives of firms focused on socially-responsible investing like Calvert Research and Management and Domini Impact Investments. Others included representatives of the International Corporate Accountability Roundtable, the Institute for Human Rights and Business and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. Companies that have been most critical of Trump's immigration orders include Netflix Inc, Apple Inc , and Amazon.com Inc, none of which form part of the business advisory panel.

Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,” Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order “and its issues for our community” and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,” he wrote in a note to employees. “Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.” The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump “understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation’s economy stronger.” The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. Musk said he would attend the meeting. “In tomorrow’s meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy,” he said in a tweet on Thursday. Kalanick’s departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. “There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley,” said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. “They (the Trump administration) clearly don’t value the economic activity generated by tech.” Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump’s travel limits. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have opposed Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general.

Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,” Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order “and its issues for our community” and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,” he wrote in a note to employees. “Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive will attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned-board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Motors chief executive Elon Musk, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. The departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. “There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley,” said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. “They (the Trump administration) clearly don’t value the economic activity generated by tech.” Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump’s travel limits. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have opposed Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Main Menu Your Mutual Funds May Have Bets On Super Bowl Advertisers 3 February 2017Military News Shutterstock photo As you sit back on Sunday to enjoy the Super Bowl, the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons are not the only teams you could have a rooting interest in. Through mutual funds in which you are a shareholder, you may have a financial stake in the annual sports and advertising extravaganza. More than 10,000 mutual funds hold shares in at least six companies that are running ads during the game in NRG Stadium in Houston, which is expected to be watched by more than 100 million viewers. The ranks of those funds include some of the biggest names in the industry. That puts the odds in your favor that a slice of your portfolio may gain value, depending on the impact of ads during the National Football League’s championship game. The odds go up that your portfolio will be impacted when the pool of mutual funds is expanded to account for ads before and after the game as well. Advertisers range from the very familiar such as Budweiser beer, whose parent company is Anheuser Busch InBev ( BUD ), and carmaker Mercedes-Benz, owned by Daimler ( DDAIF ), to lesser-known enterprise software company Wix.com ( WIX ). IBD’S TAKE: IBD reported Thursday that German automaker Daimler said that its fourth-quarter net profit rose 18%, but the firm offered only modest guidance for future earnings as it gets ready to spend on new models and advanced technologies such as autonomous driving. Mutual funds owning a piece of advertisers in the big game include $104 billion Fidelity Contrafund ( FCNTX ), $82.2 billion American Funds Investment Company of America ( AIVSX ), $40.9 billion MFS Value (MEIAX), $16.7 billion T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX), $13.1 billion JPMorgan U.S. Equity (JUEAX), $12 billion Franklin Growth (FKGRX) and $8.5 billion Hartford Capital Appreciation (ITHAX). Other funds with players in the ad contest: $7.5 billion MFS Total Return (MSFRX), $6.8 billion Vanguard Total International Stock Index (VGTSX), $5.7 billion ClearBridge Large Cap Growth (SBLGX), $4.8 billion Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Value (GCMAX), $4.6 billion AMG Yacktman Focused (YAFFX) and $3.3 billion Alger Capital Appreciation (ALARX). Those funds are among the stock owners in six publicly traded companies that are slated, according to superbowlcommercials.co, to advertise on television during the Super Bowl: Budweiser, Intel (INTC), Mercedes-Benz, Mountain Dew (PEP), Victoria’s Secret (LB) and Wix.com. Altogether, 10,898 mutual funds held stakes in those six companies or their corporate parents as of Dec. 31. Their positions in the six amounted to 2.49 billion shares. Mutual funds held just 1.3% of total shares in Budweiser owner Anheuser Busch InBev. Mutual funds owned 40.7% of Wix.com, an Israeli company that offers customers a web development platform. Mutual funds held 39.1% of the shares in Victoria’s Secret parent L Brands, 34.8% of Intel, 31.7% of Mountain Dew parent PepsiCo and 26.6% of Mercedes driver Daimler’s ADRs.

The brokerage house has upgraded the stock to buy from sell and raised target price to Rs 661 from Rs 438. Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 1 Comments Moneycontrol Bureau Cummins India With retaining underperform rating on Cummins and target price of Rs 687, Bank of America Merrill Lynch says it sees moderate growth in exports in the medium-term and de-rating is likely as growth expectations continue to reset. Third quarter earnings beat was driven by surprise in exports & domestic sales. It feels industrials will lead domestics & aid distribution sales. Phillip Capital has maintained neutral rating on the stock, with increased target price at Rs 990 (from Rs 955 earlier). The brokerage house feels current valuation leaves limited room for upside and revival in domestic growth seems priced into current valuations. Margin expansion in Q3 was mainly due to operating leverage benefits and gross margin was largely flat YoY due to an unfavourable sales mix. Morgan Stanley is underweight on Cummins with a target for the stock at Rs 647. Uncertainty persists in export markets, it believes. Emkay has upgraded FY17/18 earnings per share by 4.4 percent & 8.5 percent while advising accumulate rating on the stock, with increased target price by 8.2 percent to Rs 1,065. Glenmark Pharma JPMorgan has neutral rating on Glenmark with a target price of Rs 915 as it feels improving US growth trajectory and emerging market recovery priced into valuations. The brokerage house says it continues to like long-term business potential and newsflow on innovation R&D pipeline could be a positive trigger but delay in US approvals is a downside risk to estimates. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has reiterated its buy call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,100 as it feels strong growth and balance sheet clean-up are major re-rating triggers. Q3 earnings beat was led by higher than expected sales of gZetia in US. US business now is in a strong growth phase. Other segments are in line and operating leverage boosted margin, the brokerage house says. Macquarie has an outperform rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,350. Valuations look attractive, with stock trading at 14x FY18 EPS, the brokerage house feels. Marico With having a neutral call on the stock and target price of Rs 265, JPMorgan says Q3 earnings were in-line, led by margins and revenue performance was subdued. Sun TV Network CLSA says special court verdict on former Telecom Minister Dayanidhi Maran and his brother & head of the company Kalanidhi Maran, in Aircel-Maxis case, ended long-standing legal overhang on the company. The brokerage house has upgraded the stock to buy from sell and raised target price to Rs 661 from Rs 438. Company's advertising revenue has been weak but TV ratings have improved. CLSA expects advertising revenue CAGR of 12 percent over decline & recently improved TV ratings. Rerating is pegged on advertising growth, but lower legal, policy issues are key positives, the brokerage house says. With maintaining buy rating with revised target price at Rs 750, ICICI Securities says the court ruling will trigger rerating. The company will be a major beneficiary of speeding up digitisation in the state, it believes. Emkay has retained its buy call on Sun TV Network with a target price of Rs 850. It raised target PE multiple to 26x and says valuation to FY19 EPS implies 54 percent upside. With legal overhang behind, Emkay believes re-rating in the stock is imminent. The brokerage house says resolution of phase III digitisation and growth in DTH are key upside risks while it expects cable TV & DTH subscription revenue to grow at 12 percent CAGR FY16-19.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Elon Musk is taking his travel ban objections directly to Trump by Jethro Mullen   @CNNTech February 2, 2017: 10:34 PM ET Ford CEO: 'We don't support' Trump's travel ban Elon Musk says he will raise objections to President Trump's controversial immigration order at a meeting at the White House on Friday. The Tesla (TSLA) chief defended his participation in Trump's business advisory council just hours after Uber CEO Travis Kalanick announced he was pulling out of it. "Advisory councils simply provide advice and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the Administration," Musk said in a statement posted on Twitter late Thursday. "I understand the perspective of those who object to my attending this meeting," he said. "But I believe at this time that engaging on critical issues will on balance serve the greater good." Related: Uber CEO drops out of Trump's business advisory council Musk said that he and others would "express our objections" to Trump's travel ban that affects all refugees as well as people from seven Muslim-majority countries -- and "offer suggestions for changes to the policy." The meeting Friday is the first for the economic advisory council, which included 19 business leaders before Kalanick dropped out. "Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that," Kalanick said in a memo to employees. Related: Companies and executives speak out on Trump's travel ban Other high-profile members of the council, which is officially called the Strategic and Policy Forum, include Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Mary Barra of General Motors (GM) and Jim McNerney of Boeing (BA). Musk, who's also the CEO of SpaceX, said he's taking part in order to make his case for his main goals, which are "to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy and to help make humanity a multi-planet civilization." The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country's challenges— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2017 He has previously voiced criticism of Trump's travel ban, calling it "not the best way to address the country's challenges." "Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US," he tweeted over the weekend. "They've done right, not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected." Related: Elon Musk's surprising secret weapon: Trump? Days before Trump won the election, Musk said the Republican nominee was "not the right guy." But the Tesla chief has shown a willingness to engage in dialog with Trump and his team, joining the business council and visiting Trump Tower before the inauguration.

The online ride-hailing service Uber. Picture: Reinart Toerien/EWN Donald Trump Uber Technologies Inc US travel ban American Muslims Trump immigration Uber CEO quits Email Print Tweet Share Reuters | 6 hours ago SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON – Uber Technologies Inc. Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick quit President Donald Trump’s business advisory group on Thursday amid mounting pressure from activists and employees who oppose the administration’s immigration policies. Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,” Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order “and its issues for our community” and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,” he wrote in a note to employees. “Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the US is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.” The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump “understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation’s economy stronger.” The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc. CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. Musk said he would attend the meeting. “In tomorrow’s meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy,” he said in a tweet on Thursday. Kalanick’s departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. “There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley,” said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. “They (the Trump administration) clearly don’t value the economic activity generated by tech.” Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump’s travel limits. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have opposed Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. Amazon and Expedia Inc. have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general.

"Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that," Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order "and its issues for our community" and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. "There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America," he wrote in a note to employees. "Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants." The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump "understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation's economy stronger." The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. Musk said he would attend the meeting. "In tomorrow's meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy," he said in a tweet on Thursday. Kalanick's departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. "There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley," said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. "They (the Trump administration) clearly don't value the economic activity generated by tech." Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump's travel limits. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have opposed Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general.

The CEO of the ride hailing service had been under mounting pressure from activists who oppose the administration’s immigration policies. Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,” Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order “and its issues for our community” and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,” he wrote in a note to employees. “Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the US is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors said its chief executive will attend, while Walt Disney said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Motors chief executive Elon Musk, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. The departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. “There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley,” said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. “They [the Trump administration] clearly don’t value the economic activity generated by tech.” Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump’s travel limits. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Apple and Amazon.com have opposed Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general.

The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,” he wrote in a note to employees. “Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the US is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.” The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump “understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation’s economy stronger.” The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned-board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Motors chief executive Elon Musk, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. The departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. “There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley,” said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. “They (the Trump administration) clearly don’t value the economic activity generated by tech.” Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump’s travel limits. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have opposed Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general.

Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. "Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that," Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order "and its issues for our community" and told the president he would not join the economic council.

"In tomorrow's meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy," he said in a tweet on Thursday.

PHOTO: AFP [LONDON] Prime Minister Theresa May is making plans for emergency laws to protect the UK economy in case Brexit negotiations break down without a free-trade deal, as concerns grow that she'll fail to achieve the sweeping agreement she wants. In its 75-page plan for Brexit, Mrs May's government said on Thursday that while it was expecting to find common ground with the 27 other members of the European Union, it will prepare contingency measures to avert economic chaos if the discussions collapsed. "The government is clear that no deal for the UK is better than a bad deal for the UK ," according to the 'white paper' document on leaving the EU. "In any eventuality we will ensure that our economic and other functions can continue, including by passing legislation as necessary to mitigate the effects of failing to reach a deal." Failure to secure access to the single market for banks and other financial services companies would also risk "market fragmentation'' and the withdrawal of services for UK and European businesses, it added. Brexit Secretary David Davis vowed to try to avoid a "cliff edge" scenario. SEE ALSO: May depicts herself in Malta as a leader who understands Trump Mrs May's preparations emerged in her government's first written blueprint for "an ambitious and comprehensive free-trade agreement" with the EU after Brexit. They suggest she's keen to avoid repeating the mistake of her predecessor, David Cameron, who was faulted for not having a plan for losing last year's EU referendum, leaving the UK unprepared for the Brexit talks when he did. Bitter Failure Lawmakers and analysts including former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne have warned thaet Mrs May is unlikely to prsuade the EU to give her the free-trade deal she's aiming for given her ambitions in other areas such as immigration. They worry talks will turn bitter and the UK and EU end up making a clean break. "The administration is misjudging both the political and practical scale of the task ahead as it seeks to replicate much of the status quo in a new agreement with the EU," said Malcolm Barr, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co in London. "We see increasing grounds for concern that the plan as constituted cannot be credibly delivered." Although Mrs May's government has been bullish in predicting it can land a trade deal before it leaves the EU in two years, such a timeframe would be unprecedented especially as a pact between the UK and EU would likely to have to include services as well as goods. EU officials have also said they want to settle the divorce first before debating a new relationship. Global businesses based in the UK "may choose to vote with their feet" rather than waiting to see what deal the premier can deliver, Mr Barr said. Forced upon her by lawmakers including some from Mrs May's own Conservative party, the white paper provides the basis for the next round of discussions as Parliament inches towards handing the premier the power to start Brexit talks by March 31. The Article 50 law will be debated again next week after it won support of a majority in the House of Commons. Some fellow Tories said on Thursday they want Mrs May to promise them a binding vote on the draft Brexit deal before it is too late to be changed. "We can't predict what is going to happen in two years and I don't want to sign a blank check,'' Neil Carmichael, a Conservative member of Parliament, said by telephone. "What we need is the reassurance from the government that Parliament will be properly involved and will be given a meaningful say at the end of this process." The main opposition Labour party is likely to try to force a vote on giving legislators a binding say over the pact, while some others in the House of Commons may seek faster guarantees that EU citizens currently living in the UK will be allowed to stay. Mrs May only has a working majority of 16. The document itself contained little new information. Sections of it were copied word-for-word from May's speech in London last month, in which she announced she wanted to take the UK out of the EU single market, regain control over migration and lawmaking, and strike a new customs agreement with the bloc. Reforms to migration will require legislation and may be pushed back until after a lengthy transitional period lasting several years, the document suggested.

REUTERS/Shu ZhangMore By Heather Somerville and David Shepardson SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick quit President Donald Trump's business advisory group on Thursday amid mounting pressure from activists and employees who oppose the administration's immigration policies. Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. "Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that," Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order "and its issues for our community" and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. "There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America," he wrote in a note to employees. "Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants." The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump "understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation's economy stronger." The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. Musk said he would attend the meeting. "In tomorrow's meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy," he said in a tweet on Thursday. Kalanick's departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. "There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley," said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. "They (the Trump administration) clearly don't value the economic activity generated by tech." Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump's travel limits. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have opposed Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general.
