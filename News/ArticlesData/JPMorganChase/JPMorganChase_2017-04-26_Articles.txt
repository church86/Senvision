College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: These 4 Banks Paid $33 Billion in Taxes Over the Past Year If Trump succeeds at lowering the corporate tax rate to 15%, as he's vowed to do, these four banks would see massive boosts to their bottom lines. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Apr 26, 2017 at 2:44PM Bank stocks have been surging again over the past few days, as the outcome of the presidential election in France, as well as Donald Trump's vow to lower the corporate tax rate, is buoying investor sentiment toward the sector. Most recently, Trump reiterated his support earlier this week for lowering the corporate income tax rate from a high of 35% down to only 15%. Given that taxes impact a bank's net income in the same way operating expenses do, a substantial drop in the top rate as envisioned by Trump would translate into a meaningful increase in most banks' bottom lines. That said, some banks stand to benefit more than others. At the top of the list are JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. These are the nation's four biggest banks, with assets ranging from $1.8 trillion in Citigroup's case up to $2.6 trillion at JPMorgan Chase. Not surprisingly, these banks also outearn their peers, with net incomes over the trailing 12 months ranging from $15 billion to $26 billion. Those aren't just big numbers in the bank industry, either. Aside from Apple, no other company on the S&P 500 generated more earnings than JPMorgan Chase did over the past year. And Wells Fargo and Bank of America aren't far behind, ranking fourth and sixth, respectively, on the large-cap stock index. Image source: Getty Images. But there's a downside to massive profitability: corporate income taxes. All told, these four banks paid $33 billion in taxes since this time last year. That's a lot of mullah that, under Trump's tax proposal, could be redirected toward dividends and stock buybacks. Wells Fargo would see the biggest benefit. According to data from YCharts.com, the California-based bank would see its annual tax liability drop by $4.8 billion if it was taxed at 15% as opposed to the 30% effective tax rate it paid over the last 12 months. JPMorgan Chase would come in second, realizing a $4.3 billion benefit. And Bank of America and Citigroup round out the top four; they would save around $3.2 billion each. Bank Income Tax Paid (ttm) Savings Under a 15% Tax Rate (ttm) Wells Fargo $9.57 billion $4.82 billion JPMorgan Chase $9.64 billion $4.34 billion Bank of America $7.11 billion $3.24 billion Citigroup $6.44 billion $3.22 billion ttm = trailing 12 months. Data source: YCharts.com. There's no getting around the fact that this would be good news for these banks, as well as their shareholders. At the same time, however, the expectation that the corporate income tax rate will in fact fall already appears to be priced into these banks' stock. This helps to explain why their shares are up between 18% and 44% since the beginning of November. To put that in perspective, the S&P 500 is up 13% over the same stretch, while the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks, has climbed 24%. The net result is that, if Trump's tax plans don't come to fruition, which doesn't seem entirely unlikely given the impact of the cuts on the federal deficit, these four bank stocks and others could be in for a correction.

Construction crews this week topped out the buildings for JPMorgan Chase's new 1 million-square-foot campus. The 50-acre project is being built on the south side of State Highway 121 just west of the Dallas North Tollway. Liberty Mutual's new Legacy West towers in Plano are topping out Construction on Chase's buildings — which will house almost 6,000 people — is scheduled to be completed late this year. "Our new campus will make it easier for our employees to provide outstanding service and solutions to clients around the world," Steve Hemperly, managing director, consumer and community banking, JPMorgan Chase, said in a statement. "It will also reduce the company's real estate operating costs in the DFW market, savings we'll reinvest in our strategic campuses to provide the facilities, work environment, and accommodations our employees need and deserve." Chase will be consolidating workers now located in Farmers Branch, Dallas and Lewisville into the new project, which was designed by architect HKS. Beck Group is the general contractor. The project includes training and conference space, a food court, dining area and coffee shop, health and wellness center and childcare facility. There will be a 2-story flagship Chase bank branch at the corner of Communications Parkway and Legacy Drive. Chase joins Toyota, FedEx Office and Liberty Mutual Insurance as anchor business residents in Legacy West. Down to the wire, developers racing to finish Plano's Legacy West "JPMorgan Chase is an incredibly important piece of the equation at Legacy West," said KDC president Toby Grove. "This is the initial phase of a project that helps round out the corporate-anchored portion of Legacy West that we believe will help Chase achieve their goal of providing a collaborative, engaged, and interactive campus for its employees in an amenity-rich setting." The Chase campus will open late this year.

 JPMorgan is looking to set up a big office in a surprising destination Marcin Goclowski and Anjuli Davies, Reuters Apr. 26, 2017, 2:01 PM 3,084 facebook linkedin twitter email print Shutterstock WARSAW/LONDON - US bank JPMorgan Chase is zooming in on Warsaw as a destination for its new back office operations center which could eventually employ several thousand people supporting the bank's European and Asian business, sources said. As Britain prepares to leave the European Union, and banks and other financial firms look to shift jobs from London's financial center, Poland has set its sights on mid-tier work where salaries may not be astronomical but jobs are numerous. A delegation from JPMorgan visited Warsaw last month, the sources said, to look for real estate that could house the new center, which could become of the largest of its kind in Poland. "The focus is definitely Warsaw," said one source familiar with the matter, speaking anonymously as discussions are not public. JPMorgan has also visited Poland's western city of Wroclaw and Hungary's capital Budapest as possible contenders, the source added. "There were serious talks last month. It looks like they are close to picking Poland but never say never until deal is signed," another source said. Plans to create the center were not connected to Britain decision to exit the EU, the first source said. JPMorgan declined to comment on its plans. Poland, the EU's largest eastern economy, has already established itself as a major offshoring site for banks. The country has a population of 38 million and a relatively high-skilled and inexpensive workforce - average wages are roughly three times lower than in neighboring Germany. Goldman Sachs already has 300 people working in the Polish capital and is seeking 200 people more, while Credit Suisse employs several thousand people in Warsaw and Wroclaw. UBS has also based large IT and back office administrative operations in the country. The estimates of financial services jobs moved from all Western countries to Poland range from 35,000 to 45,000, with Britain's decision to exit the EU seen accelerating the process. A third source familiar with the matter said Warsaw was likely to emerge as the winner. "JP Morgan wants to hire 2,500 people and only Warsaw has a job market which is deep enough to bear with such an investment," the source said. Another Warsaw-based real estate source that although there was not enough prime real estate to accommodate several thousand employees right now, it could become available over the next year or so. JPMorgan would likely start with a few dozen people on the ground in the Polish capital by the end of year if plans are finalized, the first source said. Read the original article on Reuters.

As Britain prepares to leave the EU, and banks and other financial firms look to shift jobs from London’s financial center, Poland has set its sights on mid-tier work where salaries might not be astronomical, but jobs are numerous. The sources said that a delegation from JPMorgan visited Warsaw last month to look for real estate that could house the new center. “The focus is definitely Warsaw,” one source familiar with the matter said speaking on condition of anonymity. JPMorgan has also visited the Polish city of Wroclaw and Hungary’s capital, Budapest, as possible contenders, the source added. Poland has already established itself as a major offshoring site for banks. Goldman Sachs already has 300 people working in Warsaw, while Credit Suisse employs several thousand people in the Polish capital and Wroclaw. This story has been viewed 1594 times.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print SCOOP: NBC could move studio from Nebraska Ave. -- NEW STRATEGY: TRUMP to meet one-on-one with lawmakers -- Playbook goes to San Francisco -- ROBIN SPROUL to Javelin -- B’DAY: Melania Trump is 47 By ANNA PALMER (anna@politico.com; @apalmerdc) and JAKE SHERMAN (sherman@politico.com; @JakeSherman) with DANIEL LIPPMAN (daniel@politico.com; @dlippman) 04/26/17 06:45 AM EDT Driving the Day NEWS -- NBC LOOKING AT STUDIO SPACE AWAY FROM NEBRASKA AVE. -- FROM HADAS GOLD and JAKE SHERMAN -- NBC News is exploring new studio space outside of its historic Washington bureau on Nebraska Avenue, potentially moving the bureau, or at least part of it, to another space likely closer Capitol Hill. NBC’s Washington bureau, which shares the space with local NBC affiliate WRC, has been located in upper Northwest near American University since 1958. A spokesperson says the network is ‘exploring options’ but that ‘no decisions have been made yet.’ There’s been some buzz that NBC and MSNBC would move much of its programming to 400 North Capitol Street, just blocks from the Capitol. Greta van Susteren’s MSNBC show is broadcasting from a newly redone studio at 400 N Cap. Story Continued Below “MSNBC’s Washington presence continues to broadcast regularly from various downtown locations, like the Chamber of Commerce rooftop and 400 N. Cap studios, to offer a better visual experience for viewers and to better secure newsmaking guests -- this has been the case since Election Day,” the spokesperson said. **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh A NEW DYNAMIC -- WHAT TO LOOK FOR -- President Donald Trump will begin meeting with members of Congress one on one instead of in large groups. People close to him believe it will be a much more effective way to pin lawmakers down. This could be critical as the White House looks to revive the health care debate and take on tax reform. … SPEAKING OF TAX REFORM -- Yes, President Donald Trump is releasing his outlines for tax reform today. But let’s be honest: what he is releasing today will not bear much resemblance to anything that might pass in the coming year. We were up on Capitol Hill and worked our White House sources yesterday, and they all see this not as a line in the sand or as a serious proposal, but as an opportunity to get the conversation started. No, Congress won’t be able to lower corporate and passthrough tax rates to 15 percent. The professionals in the White House realize this -- and also realize that they’re beginning to irk Capitol Hill committees by releasing this. Without some corresponding way of paying for such low rates, these rates would blow a massive hole in the deficit. But it reflects a White House itching for action. (That explains their push for a health care vote this week.) And insiders say unlike health care reform, Trump is more personally invested in making sure something happens on tax reform. -- NYT’s JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS, ALAN RAPPEPORT, KATE KELLY and RACHEL ABRAMS: “The package would ... increase the standard deduction for individuals, providing a modest cut for middle-income people and simplifying the process of filing tax returns, according to people briefed on its details. That proposal is opposed by home builders and real estate agents, who fear it would diminish the importance of the mortgage interest deduction. And it is likely to necessitate eliminating or curbing other popular deductions, a politically risky pursuit.” http://nyti.ms/2ovoLcC -- WSJ’s MIKE BENDER and RICH RUBIN: “[M]r. Trump may have trouble complying with the congressional procedure known as reconciliation, which allows a Republican party-line vote in the Senate, but which requires bills to avoid increasing budget deficits outside the 10-year budget window. On income-tax rates for individuals, Mr. Trump has said he wants to reduce the number of brackets, but his advisers are still debating where to set the rates. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is said to prefer a top rate of 37%, the people said. That’s below today’s top rate of 39.6% but above the 33% rate that Mr. Trump proposed during the campaign. That new top rate wouldn’t apply to pass-through income, which would get the special 15% rate. “Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said Tuesday that he hadn’t heard from the White House on its tax plan. That’s a mistake, he said. ‘You make it partisan only, and you don’t get both sides invested in it, people saw what a debacle you had on the first round of health policy,’ Mr. Wyden said. ‘You can win by reconciliation, if you just decide to hardball your way through it, but the track record shows it’s not sustainable and it’s not successful.’” http://on.wsj.com/2q5Uz7V FROM 30K FEET -- “Instead of launching tax reform, Trump could ground it,” by Ben White and Nancy Cook: “President Donald Trump on Wednesday will release a plan to radically overhaul the American tax code that many Republicans say is unrealistic and could end up hurting the chances of getting anything done on the issue, long one of the party’s top priorities. Driven by a president eager to show momentum heading into the close of his first 100 days in office, the hastily written plan could wind up alienating critical Hill Republicans while offering little or nothing to entice Democrats. It could also be widely dismissed by outside observers as an over-hyped rehash of promises the president already made during the campaign “‘So far at least, the contours of this are starting to look a lot like what happened with Trump and Congress on health care,’ said Lanhee Chen, a top adviser to Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign and now a professor at Stanford. ‘On health care you had irreconcilable differences on the scope of government. And in the same way here, whether or not you pay for a tax cut is a fundamental difference Republicans have. And what we could see Wednesday is that there isn’t even as much middle ground on taxes as there was on health care.’” http://politi.co/2qdltqC AHEAD OF TODAY’S W.H. MEETING WITH THE SENATE -- “U.S. sets up missile defense in S. Korea as North shows power,” by AP’s Foster Klug in Seoul, South Korea: “In a defiant bit of timing, South Korea announced Wednesday that key parts of a contentious U.S. missile defense system have been installed a day after rival North Korea showed off its military power. The South’s trumpeting of progress in setting up the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, comes as high-powered U.S. military assets converge on the Korean Peninsula and as a combative North Korea signals possible nuclear and missile testing. … The moves to set up THAAD within this year have angered not only North Korea, but also China, the country that the Trump administration hopes to work with to rid the North of nuclear weapons. China, which has grown increasingly frustrated with its ally Pyongyang, and Russia see the system’s powerful radars as a security threat.” http://apne.ws/2oL7Yyh -- “Trump’s ‘Armada’ Sent to Deter Kim Can’t Knock Down His Missiles,” by Bloomberg’s Tony Capaccio: “The U.S. Navy flotilla sailing toward the Korean peninsula to deter Kim Jong Un’s regime lacks a key capability: It can’t shoot down ballistic missiles. The USS Carl Vinson and the aircraft carrier’s accompanying destroyers and cruiser are expected to arrive in waters near the peninsula this week, carrying a full complement of weaponry, including scores of Tomahawk cruise and anti-ship missiles, radar-jamming aircraft and non-stealthy ‘Super Hornet’ jets built by Boeing Co. That firepower brings a lot to any fight, but the Navy’s lack of ballistic missile defense capability on the scene means the Trump administration’s high-profile show of force has a significant gap as it warns North Korea against another missile test and pressures it to back down from its nuclear program.” https://bloom.bg/2q4iSjL ****** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: “A critical and deliberate part of our strategy is strengthening the underlying organizations and systems that are needed to empower communities to deliver and sustain change,” notes JPMorgan Chase Head of Corporate Responsibility, Peter Scher. Learn more from this approach in the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Responsibility Report http://politi.co/2ouiWI5 ****** UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU’RE SEEING ON HEALTH CARE -- As we’ve been laying out, there has been progress behind the scenes on the health-care bill that went up in flames a few weeks ago. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) negotiated a package -- mostly with the White House -- over recess. Now, House conservatives say they’ve done their duty, and the GOP leadership needs to bring moderates around. Of course, the House leadership disagrees, and says nearly the entire conservative caucus needs to support the health care bill for it to have a chance. Moderate, meanwhile, remain on the sidelines. See Kyle Cheney, Rachael Bade and Katie Jennings’ piece http://politi.co/2q6htfl -- THE BLAME GAME: Members of the HFC feel like they shoulder too much blame. So watch this week as they try highlight that moderates are not coming around to support the bill. -- WAPO's BOB COSTA and PAIGE WINFIELD CUNNINGHAM on the state of play. http://wapo.st/2oIR7v6 SHUTDOWN WATCH -- DIVISION NOT JUST AMONG GOP -- “Pelosi and Hoyer at odds over budget negotiations,” by Heather Caygle: “A disagreement between House Democratic leaders over Obamacare subsidies spilled into the open Tuesday, threatening to undermine their negotiating position as they hash out a deal with Republicans to fund the government. Democratic negotiators, led by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), are demanding the final funding bill include language to provide permanent Obamacare subsidies to help cover costs for low-income enrollees and keep insurance markets afloat. But House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), No. 2 behind Pelosi, publicly dismissed that idea Tuesday, saying the fix would be nice to have in the funding bill but should not be a requirement for supporting the legislation and should not be used as a partisan bargaining chip.” http://politi.co/2p34BVM THIS SEEMS IMPORTANT -- FOGGY BOTTOM WATCH -- “Rex Tillerson Spurns Africa In Botched Meeting with African Union Chief,” by Foreign Policy’s Robbie Gramer: “Secretary of State Rex Tillerson invited the chairperson of the African Union to Washington for a meeting, then backed out on him at the last minute, infuriating African diplomats, several sources tell Foreign Policy. Tillerson invited African Union … Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki to Washington the week of April 17, after Faki ended meetings at the United Nations in New York. Several sources close to the matter say Faki scheduled his trip to Washington on April 19 and 20 while waiting for the details to be sorted out. But then Tillerson’s office went radio silent for several days, and left the head of the 55-nation bloc in the lurch and fuming.” http://atfp.co/2pkosAj HAPPENING TODAY -- The White House is hosting a regional TV and radio tour as part of its 100-day media blitz. White House officials tell us it will include more than 105 individual interviews with senior staff and cabinet secretaries.

Sixty-one percent of registered voters say funding a wall along the nation’s southern border is ‘not important enough to prompt a shutdown.’ A plurality of those polled say fighting for increased funding for defense and homeland security would be worth risking a shutdown. The POLITICO/Morning Consult poll was conducted April 20-24 among 2,032 registered voters, and carries a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points. “There does appear to be widespread awareness that federal funding expires Friday, with 54 percent saying they have heard some or a lot about a possible government shutdown. And 76 percent say a government shutdown would concern them.” http://politi.co/2p3pS1z MORE INTERESTING DATA POINTS FOR YOU TO CHEW OVER… -- W.H.

Trump’s clearest major accomplishment is also the purest example of this trend: The appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court was a masterpiece of insider politics, steered by the longtime master of Washington conservative judicial politics Leonard Leo and guided through the Senate by the most Washington of Washington strategists, Ron Bonjean. “The nomination process was as slick as virtually everything else Trump touched was messy: Well-researched and coordinated, with an array of conservative groups feeding and sparring with the media and with Democrats. It was characterized by aggression and spin, but not overt lying or massive bumbles. And while it was hardly a rogue operation — Bonjean is close to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer — it was like an alternate universe from the chaos reporters are accustomed to coming out of Pennsylvania Avenue. Crucially, Trump, after a few wild tweets, stayed out of it. And, in just 66 days, it worked for an administration that has not had any major legislative successes with its Republican Congress outside of reversing Obama-era regulations. The lesson: The swamp is winning.” http://bzfd.it/2pyyq1V WHAT IVANKA AND JARED ARE READING -- “State Department Memo Boosts Case to Stay in Paris Climate Pact,” by Bloomberg’s Jennifer A. Dlouhy and Nick Wadhams: “An internal State Department memo says the Paris climate accord imposes few obligations on the U.S., bolstering the case for Trump administration officials who want to stay in the deal. The document, marked as a draft, makes no explicit recommendation about whether the U.S. should remain part of the pact. It circulated ahead of a scheduled meeting of top administration officials Thursday to discuss whether President Donald Trump should fulfill his campaign pledge to exit the deal. ... Under terms of the agreement, the U.S. couldn’t formally exit until 2019. It faces no specific reporting requirements until 2021.” https://bloom.bg/2q4lP3G NOBODY HOME -- “Slow pace of Trump nominations leaves Cabinet agencies ‘stuck’ in staffing limbo,” by WaPo’s Lisa Rein: “Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who has publicly expressed frustration with the process, has routinely peppered the White House Personnel Office for updates and called Trump directly to press for faster action on filling vacant jobs at the Interior Department, said two people familiar with his contacts ... Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price aired his dismay at a recent breakfast meeting with his former congressional colleagues. ‘He’s very frustrated,’ said a Republican House member who was there. ‘He felt it was much more difficult to operate the department and provide the leadership level that you need to provide.’ Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has also become impatient, said a Republican lobbyist who is close to her. Chao has tapped an outside consultant to help her identify candidates for top jobs and shepherd them through the White House nomination process.” http://wapo.st/2q45gF3 -- “Trump administration moving to replace fired U.S. attorneys,” by Josh Dawsey and Josh Gerstein: “The White House has struck tentative agreements with more than a dozen senators on picks to fill U.S. attorney positions left vacant since early March, according to officials at the White House and on Capitol Hill. White House chief counsel Don McGahn has spent much of the past three weeks meeting with senators and their staff, the officials say. The administration hopes to announce some of the appointments in the next three weeks, according to three people familiar with their thinking.” http://politi.co/2qdqtvp ****** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Research shows that thriving neighborhoods are key for any city’s long-term economic success.

Dlouhy: “President Donald Trump will open the door to new oil and natural gas drilling in Pacific waters off the coast of California with a directive Friday that sets up a certain clash with environmentalists. Trump will order the Interior Department to review locations for offshore oil and gas exploration and consider selling drilling rights in territory that former President Barack Obama put off limits ... That includes U.S. Pacific waters, as well as Arctic and Atlantic acreage left out of the five-year schedule of lease sales issued by Obama in November.” https://bloom.bg/2ov2dJ4 FUTURECAST -- “With Secret Airship, Sergey Brin Also Wants to Fly,” by Bloomberg’s Ashlee Vance: “Larry Page has his flying cars.

While giant corporations have for decades and on a bipartisan basis exerted far too much influence over government decision-making, we’ve never seen anything like the Trump administration. The key officials in the federal government, starting with the president himself, come from Big Business; the administration openly seeks guidance and direction from giant corporations and corporate CEOs on policymaking; and the Trump administration is rushing to deliver subsidies, tax breaks and deregulatory gifts to the giant corporations to which the administration apparently owes its primary allegiance. A day-by-day review of the administration’s first 100 days in office shows that virtually every day there has been a new, extraordinary grant of power to corporate interests and/or another development in Donald Trump’s get-rich-quick-scheme known as the American presidency. America has never seen anything like this. The corporate capture began at the same moment as the Trump presidency. Corporations that have pending business before the president — AT&T, Bank of America, Boeing, Chevron, Deloitte, JPMorgan Chase and United Parcel Service – were among the top funders of the inauguration and surrounding festivities. Giant companies and billionaires heaped more than $100 million on the festivities. New President Trump immediately signaled his intent to deliver on the corporate wish list by signing two executive orders, one designed to start the process of destroying the Affordable Care Act and another freezing all regulatory activity for 90 days. It’s been downhill since then. President Trump has assembled what is probably the least qualified and certainly most corporate cabinet of all time. By way of reminder, this list includes: the former CEO of Exxon Mobil (Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State); a slew of former Goldman Sachs executives, so much so that the factions fighting for control of the administration each hail from Goldman Sachs (chief strategist Steve Bannon and top economic advisor Gary Cohn); a banker known as the Foreclosure King to run the Department of Treasury (Steven Mnuchin), an Amway heiress and Republican megadonor (Betsy DeVos); and a former state attorney general who allowed the fossil fuel industry to draft letters on attorney general letterhead on multiple occasions (Scott Pruitt, Environmental Protection Agency). Having a corporate cabinet has apparently not satisfied Trump’s yen to hang out with the corporate elite. Trump started his first full weekday in office with a breakfast meeting with CEOs of a dozen corporations, and the meetings continue at a staggering pace. Trump is meeting with more than two CEOS every day, on average. These extraordinary gatherings, which have the explicit purpose of providing a way for Big Business to shape the administration’s policies, are supplemented by the president’s more casual interactions with corporate leaders at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., where the membership fee is now $200,000. Many of the gatherings reflect the administration’s interest in giving special consideration to the views of specific corporate sectors, such as airlines, health insurance corporations, pharmaceutical corporations, and the automotive industry. One of every five of the corporate executives who met with the Trump administration within the first 100 days represented the banking or financial sector. It’s not just meetings and personnel. The Trump administration is off to a roaring start on delivering the goodies to Big Business. It has taken care of its Dirty Energy friends. By executive order, Trump overturned Obama measures to block the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines. A few days later, the Army Corps of Engineers granted Energy Transfer Partners the final permit it needs to complete the Dakota Access Pipeline. It has also put in place measures to speed approval of other pipelines and fossil fuel projects, and is expected in the coming days to announce measures to upend the Environmental Protection Agency. In March, Trump announced a review – plainly aimed to be a roll back – of auto fuel efficiency standards. Just a few years ago, a U.S. government bailout saved the Big Three automakers from utter collapse. The modest reciprocity the government demanded was industry agreement to higher fuel efficiency standards – its most important move to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. Now the auto industry and the Trump administration are colluding to abrogate the deal. Consumers will be swindled in the process; the fuel economy rules that Trump is reversing were projected to save Americans up to $5,700 for every car they purchase, and $8,200 for every truck. Trump has issued an executive order aimed at undoing President Obama’s Clean Power Plan – his signature effort to reduce climate pollution from coal powered plants; the administration is debating pulling the United States out of the Paris climate agreement; and administration officials have banned the use of the term “climate change.” EPA Chief Scott Pruitt and his minions are delivering a host of other gifts to polluters, such as inaugural $1 million donor Dow, notably including a refusal to ban a brain-damaging pesticide. The administration is taking care of its Wall Street friends (meaning those who remain outside the administration). Trump has signed executive orders aimed at unraveling the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law (“We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank,” the president told JPMorgan Chase’s CEO Jamie Dimon and other CEOs in January) and repealing an Obama administration Labor Department rule requiring financial advisors to give advice based on their customers’ best interests. The Labor Department rule, if adopted, will save consumers $17 billion a year in rip-off fees and bad advice. Contemplated changes in Dodd-Frank rules, the Wall Street Journal reports, will enable the six biggest banks to return $100 billion of reserves to shareholders. A staggering gift to the shareholders – at the cost of making the financial system far, far more unstable, insecure and prone to another 2008-style meltdown. Although its prospects are dim, Trump proposed a cruel, sadistic and military-industrial-complex-fawning budget, featuring $54 billion in increased spending on weapons and war, with gouging cuts to spending on everything from environmental protection to Meals on Wheels. Trump strongly backed the American Health Care Act (Obamacare repeal), and is now angling for it to be revived with slight modifications – which would make it still worse. To pay for a $350 billion tax cut for the super rich and large corporations, the bill would deny health care coverage to 24 million people by 2026. In addition to mass financial hardship, that denial of coverage would have meant that every year millions would suffer needlessly from treatable ailments and tens of thousands would die from preventable illness. Cutting off Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood would have denied provision of care to millions of low-income women. And the bill’s financing structure would have weakened Medicare’s finances, imperiling still more Americans. Happily, bombast aside, odds appear slim of successfully bringing this proposal back from the dead. Perhaps most consequentially, the administration has commenced its full-fledged assault on health, safety, environmental, worker, consumer, financial security, civil rights and other regulatory protections. Deregulatory measures may well be Trump’s signature achievement – both of the first 100 days and the entire presidency. What does it mean to deregulate? It means lifting restraints on corporate misconduct, and signaling to big companies that in pursuit of profit they are free to rip off, price gouge, poison and endanger Americans and our planet. In February, Trump signed a deregulatory executive order that directs federal agencies to repeal two federal regulations for every new rule they issue, and requires that any cost to industry of new rules be offset by savings from repealed rules. In this crazy scheme, regulators are not permitted to consider the benefits of rules. No one thinking sensibly about how to set rules for health, safety, the environment and the economy would ever adopt this approach – unless their only goal was to confer enormous benefits on Big Business. That is indeed the goal here. (With the Natural Resources Defense Council and Communication Workers of America, Public Citizen has sued President Trump and the administration to have this executive order overturned.) Trump has eagerly signed into law a series of deregulatory measures to undo Obama administration achievements, using an obscure legislative vehicle known as the Congressional Review Act. Industries that have collectively spent more than $1 billion on lobbying and campaign contributions have seen their investments pay off many times over. Trump has gleefully signed measures making it easier for coal companies to pollute streams and rivers; authorizing Big Oil to hide payments to developing country governments; erasing obligations for government contractors to ensure the safety and health of their employees; and making it possible for cable and Internet providers to collect and sell our most personal information. It’s hard to imagine there’s anyone in the United States, not connected to Comcast, Verizon or another telecom company, who favors giving the telecoms the right to traffic in our personal data. Leaving aside confirmations, these Congressional Review Act regulatory repeals are, by far, the most significant legislative action during Trump’s term. The corporate cronies heading or nominated to lead key regulatory agencies guarantee that deregulation will be a consistent and overriding theme of the administration. Trump’s pick for Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton, if confirmed will assume office with unprecedented conflicts and zero demonstrated commitment to protecting investors. Scott Gottlieb, the nominee for Food and Drug Administration commissioner, has deep ties to the pharmaceutical industry and aims to roll back drug and device safety standards. President Trump and his new Federal Communication Commission Chair Ajit Pai are intent on repealing the agency’s Net Neutrality rule, which is designed to protect a free and open Internet by preventing broadband providers from favoring their own or discriminating against others’ content. The rule protects consumers from excessive tolls that could significantly impact their pocketbook, a diminished Internet that would degrade their user experience and, most importantly, from broadband provider censorship or undue influence over what they can see and access. Meanwhile, Trump’s top regulatory advisor, the financial mogul Carl Icahn, is leveraging his role to push for very specific regulatory changes that would advantage his companies. The value of his oil refining companies has jumped by more than half a billion dollars in anticipation that Trump will deliver a revision to ethanol rules that Icahn is seeking. Icahn’s conflicts are jaw-dropping, but it all comes from the top. President Trump has resisted calls to divest himself of his business empire, giving him unprecedented conflicts of interest and ensuring that this administration will go down as the most corrupt in history. Foreign policy conflicts are already manifest: Does Trump congratulate Turkish President Erdogan on his consolidation of authoritarian power because of Trump’s business interests in Turkey? Does Rex Tillerson’s refusal to condemn human rights violations in the Philippines follow from Trump’s real estate ventures in that country? What’s the correlation between warming relations with China and China’s approval of trademark requests from Trump and Ivanka Trump? So too are domestic priorities distorted: Trump has ordered a repeal of an important Clean Water Rule opposed by golf courses. Policies at the Labor Department and National Labor Relations Board will directly impact his companies. The Chamber of Commerce is clamoring for legislation to destroy class actions – the kind of lawsuits filed by the ripped off students at “Trump University.” And, as we look forward past the first hundred days, the dominant legislative debate will focus on tax policy. Donald Trump is an admitted exploiter of tax loopholes; and although he refused to make his tax returns public, he has bragged that he pays the lowest rate possible. What are the chances that he is going to support tax reform measures that would hurt his personal business empire? What are the chances this administration’s conflicts will be resolved? What are the chances that policy making will be advanced in the interest of Americans rather than giant corporations? None, none and none – unless We the People mobilize in sufficient numbers to force a change.

Perceived as the riskiest currency on the planet until Sunday’s French election, the euro is suddenly everyone’s favorite. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects the euro to gain almost 4 percent after the first round of the vote delivered all that investors hoped for. Pacific Investment Management Co. has a “more constructive” view on the currency and Nomura Holdings Inc. has recommended buying it. BlackRock Inc. and JPMorgan Asset Management favor European shares amid reduced political risk, while BlueBay Asset Management has already added to holdings. Investors are more bullish on European assets as risks of a victory for anti-euro presidential candidate Marine Le Pen recede, reducing the odds of a political upset similar to Brexit and Donald Trump’s victory. French polls, which got the first-round results right, now see centrist Emmanuel Macron becoming president. The rising optimism contrasts with option prices before the April 23 vote, which were the most bearish for the euro than any other currency.

Sign Up “We see short-term political risk in Europe receding,” Thomas Kressin, Munich-based portfolio manager at Pimco, which manages $1.5 trillion of assets, said in an interview. “We consider the euro to be cheap. Investors will be back to look at the euro from a valuation basis. We see the fundamental fair value of the currency closer to $1.25 in the long term.” Pimco declined to comment on its positions. The euro rallied 1.3 percent after the French presidential election as of 4:40 p.m. in London on Wednesday, touching a five-month high of $1.0951. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares has gained 2.8 percent in the same period. The yield spread between French 10-year securities and German bunds narrowed to 47 basis points from as high as 84 basis points in February. “The French election is already a first step toward a more stable political environment in Europe,” said Vincent Juvyns, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset, which oversees $1.8 trillion globally. “I am, from a fundamental and economic perspective, enthusiastic about Europe.” The fund is neutral at the moment on Europe but would look to increase exposure in coming weeks, he added. ‘Done Deal’ The cost of two-week options to buy the common currency against the dollar has surged, relative to contracts for selling, to minus 125 basis points from minus 386 basis points before the April 23 vote. The so-called risk-reversal rate was the most bearish for the euro among global currencies on April 21. Goldman Sachs and UBS AG both expect the shared currency to extend its advance toward $1.13. “The market has acknowledged that the polls were accurate in France,” Isabelle Vic-Philippe, Paris-based fund manager at Amundi Asset Management, said in emailed comments. “So the second round seems to be a done deal and Macron has a high probability of becoming the next French president.” Risks Linger Still, some caution is warranted. “The probability of a Le Pen presidency has decreased but is not yet null,” said Marc de-Muizon, a London-based economist at Deutsche Bank AG. “The risks of a possible new scandal, a strong debate performance by the National Front leader or complacency from the electorate should still be monitored.” And just as France concerns ease, another political risk looms on the horizon. Italian elections, likely in early 2018, will be “the next pressure point,” Goldman strategist Silvia Ardagna wrote in a client note. Amundi Asset bought “some” bonds after France’s election, according to Vic-Philippe, while Credit Agricole SA said in a note to clients that Asian accounts and central banks are buying French assets again, according to London-based strategist Afsaneh Mastouri. “It makes sense to have a positive view on risk assets in the euro zone,” said Mark Dowding, a London-based fund manager at BlueBay Asset, which manages $55.5 billion and has overweight positions on the region’s corporate, financial and sovereign debt. “We feel some more conservative investors will wait until after the second round of the vote, but that markets will rally in anticipation of a Macron win.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The economists cut their view from 0.6 percent on Wednesday, after reviewing annual revisions to retail sales data — reflecting a potentially worrisome trend of consumer weakening also seen in softer auto sales and retail sales data recently. Andrew Kelly | Reuters People carry shopping bags outside Macy's Herald Square in New York. CNBC/Moody's Analytics Rapid Update, based on a survey of economists, shows average growth forecasts for the first quarter at 1.2 percent, as of Tuesday. Economists also saw growth tracking at an average 1 percent, based on actual data releases so far. First quarter GDP data will be released Friday. A Census Bureau report trimmed retail sales growth to 3.7 percent, from 4 percent. But the control retail sales, used to calculate GDP, fell from 4.1 percent to 3 percent, JPMorgan said. That figure excludes food services, auto dealers, gasoline stations and building materials outlets. "We now think that real consumption increased only 0.6 percent saar in 1Q [previously: 0.9 percent]," they wrote. In March, retail sales slipped by a surprise 0.2 percent, the second monthly decline. Economists mostly expect second quarter growth to pick up, and many blame first quarter weakness on a soft patch and weather. Meanwhile, UBS economists also reduced expectations for first quarter consumption to 0.5 percent, but they kept their GDP tracking estimate at 0.9 percent for first quarter. They noted Thursday's data on retail and wholesale inventories, merchandise trade and durables shipments could impact their first quarter GDP tracking estimate. Patti DommCNBC Markets Editor

The institutions say the money will not be used for coal-related projects, but campaigners say it will in effect free up other funds to go into expanding coal-fired power stations, making a nonsense of the pledges. Furthermore, the difficulty of making a profit from coal-fired electricity appears to play little or no role in lending decisions, reflecting the fact that Warsaw has set coal-burning targets for the utilities as a way to protect 80,000 jobs in Poland's coal mines. Public pressure in the West to stop funding the most polluting of fossil fuels was at its greatest around the time of the UN-sponsored Paris Agreement on climate change in December 2015, resulting in numerous pledges to quit coal. On the surface, this was a blow to the newly elected Law and Justice government's plans to support the building of new coal-fired power stations. But the government's commitment to its coal sector, which shows no sign of diminishing, has in effect reduced the risk of investing in it. The power company Energa, which is reviving a project to build a 1 GW coal-fired power plant in Ostroleka, northeast Poland, issued a 300 million euro ($324 million) eurobond in February, with the help of JP Morgan Chase and BNP Paribas. JP Morgan Chase said it had stated the bond could not be used for coal, while BNP Paribas did not respond to a request for comment. EIB-BACKED BONDS BNP Paribas has previously said it will no longer finance coal-fired power plants in high-income countries, and will only support coal in emerging economies on certain conditions. Asked if the borrowing would help to build the Ostroleka plant, which would power 200,000 apartments, Energa said it would be spent on "general corporate needs" and distribution.   It also said it was planning to issue hybrid -- debt and equity combined -- bonds, backed by the European Investment Bank. The CEE Bankwatch Network, a non-government body that monitors financial institutions' activities in central and eastern Europe, says there is no guarantee that Energa's bonds will not be used for coal-burning. "The EIB loan could eventually help the company finance its controversial new 1,000 MW coal-fired power plant in Ostroleka," Bankwatch said. It has written to the EIB asking it not to finance Energa unless the company shelves plans to build Ostroleka, which will burn up to 2 million tonnes of coal a year from the state-run mining firm PGG, Poland's biggest. But an EIB spokeswoman told Reuters the bonds had been approved by the bank's board of directors and should be signed off in the coming weeks. She said the financing was exclusively for the modernisation and extension of Energa's distribution network in 2017-2019. This is before the planned start of construction on the Ostroleka plant, which is due to come online in 2023. "BANKS HAVE THEIR GOALS" Several European banking sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was clear that lending to one part of an integrated utility could free up funds in another. "Banks agree to provide financing for energy groups only on condition that it will be spent on distribution networks or renewables. But this helps the energy companies to find money for the coal projects," one of the sources said. "The people working in banks have their goals, too. If they have an opportunity to win a big financing project, they often go for it, especially since there is plenty of money on the market that needs to be spent." Bartlomiej Kubicki, analyst with Societe Generale, said that, with current carbon emission permit prices, electricity would have to fetch 200 zlotys ($50.58) per megawatt hour for a coal-fuelled power plant to break even in Poland, well above the current power exchange price of around 160 zlotys ($41.22). But at a conference last month, Deputy Energy Minister Grzegorz Tobiszowski said: "We promised that we will make coal mining, which is and for years will remain the basis of Poland's energy, profitable, competitive and developing. We believe that Polish coal mining has the potential to become the basis for a modern Polish economy." To encourage utilities to invest in new coal-fuelled power stations, Poland has announced plans for a "capacity market", effectively a subsidy that rewards power producers not only for the electricity they generate, but for the capacity they hold. A draft law on the plan is expected to be ready around June, although it could run into opposition from the European Union. "BLACK PR" PGE, Poland's biggest power company and owner of the world's biggest lignite-coal-fuelled power plant in Belchatow, has a 34 billion zloty ($8.7 billion) investment plan, which includes the construction of a 1.8 GW coal power plant in Opole by 2019. The firm, whose operations also include power distribution, secured a large amount of funding just before the Paris Agreement was signed, in the form of two bonds program worth 2 billion euros and 5 billion zlotys ($1.3 billion) in 2014 and September 2015 respectively. But even since Paris, PGE spokesman Maciej Szczepaniuk said that, "despite the intensive black PR, we have not observed a deterioration in our cooperation with banks". PGE and the state-dominated gas company PGNiG were among state-run companies that last year helped to bail out PGG, the coal miner. PGNiG chief financial executive Michal Pietrzyk said the move "did not have a negative impact on our relations with banks". However, there are some signs that foreign investors cannot always be won over. The utility firm Tauron, admittedly Poland's most indebted energy firm and the one with the oldest assets, says it has begun to find financing difficult. "Whenever we approach a financial institution, the first question is about coal," said its chief financial officer, Marek Wadowski. He said the company had turned to environment-linked "green bonds" to finance wind farms and distribution links. "Our aim is to improve our image outside Poland, as we realise we are not positively perceived."   Copyright Reuters, 2017  Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Mail Print the author Shoaib Ur Rehman Siddiqui Previous World's mushrooming cities pose big vaccination challenges: UNICEF Next Mexico retail sales rise by most in 3-1/2 years in Feb Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

By Teresa Rivas Updated April 26, 2017 9:20 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Investors have been pouring money into bond funds like the  iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT),  iShares JPMorgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF (EMB), and  iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) this year, even if these fixed income ETFs aren't perfect. Illustration: Getty Images/iStockphoto However, it's not just individual investors who are eager for bond funds: Institutional investors are also clamoring to take advantage of the diversity and fast trading that bond ETFs offer, according to The Wall Street Journal's Gunjan Banerji. Bonds may not have traditionally been an investment that you would want to buy and sell quickly, but that's changing. From the report: U.S. fixed-income has gone from being a “sleepy” haven market to one in which investors have found themselves caught off guard in recent years, says Sameer Samana, global quantitative and technical strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute . Last year alone, Treasurys had a wild ride as a summer rally was followed by the biggest quarterly selloff in more than two decades. Investors may feel the need to diversify portfolios quickly as central banks globally are more active, Mr. Samana says. Also, market participants are gearing up for rising interest rates this year. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates in March for the third time since the financial crisis, and it has penciled in two more increases this year, followed by three in 2018. With volatility showing no signs of slowing down, bond ETFs will probably continue to look more attractive to more investors, large and small, that want to react quickly to market changes. But of course that means that there may be more movement than bond investors are used to, or comfortable with, especially when it comes to leveraged or inverse products that magnify big swings. That said, bond ETFs may be one area where active management can claw back some ground from indexing, as history shows that actively managed bond mutual funds and ETFs have beaten their passive peers in the past decade.

As Britain prepares to leave the European Union, and banks and other financial firms look to shift jobs from London's financial centre, Poland has set its sights on mid-tier work where salaries may not be astronomical but jobs are numerous. A delegation from JPMorgan visited Warsaw last month, the sources said, to look for real estate that could house the new centre, which could become of the largest of its kind in Poland. "The focus is definitely Warsaw," said one source familiar with the matter, speaking anonymously as discussions are not public. JPMorgan has also visited Poland's western city of Wroclaw and Hungary's capital Budapest as possible contenders, the source added. "There were serious talks last month. It looks like they are close to picking Poland but never say never until deal is signed," another source said. Plans to create the centre were not connected to Britain decision to exit the EU, the first source said. JPMorgan declined to comment on its plans. Poland, the EU's largest eastern economy, has already established itself as a major offshoring site for banks. The country has a population of 38 million and a relatively high-skilled and inexpensive workforce - average wages are roughly three times lower than in neighbouring Germany. Goldman Sachs already has 300 people working in the Polish capital and is seeking 200 people more, while Credit Suisse employs several thousand people in Warsaw and Wroclaw. UBS has also based large IT and back office administrative operations in the country. The estimates of financial services jobs moved from all Western countries to Poland range from 35,000 to 45,000, with Britain's decision to exit the EU seen accelerating the process. A third source familiar with the matter said Warsaw was likely to emerge as the winner. "JP Morgan wants to hire 2,500 people and only Warsaw has a job market which is deep enough to bear with such an investment," the source said. Another Warsaw-based real estate source that although there was not enough prime real estate to accommodate several thousand employees right now, it could become available over the next year or so. JPMorgan would likely start with a few dozen people on the ground in the Polish capital by the end of year if plans are finalised, the first source said.

Their move comes after the Supreme Court, the UK's highest court, ruled last month that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had not identified former JPMorgan executive Achilles Macris when it fined the U.S. bank over the "London Whale" trading scandal in 2013. Former Deutsche Bank trader Christian Bittar, ex Barclays trader Philippe Moryoussef and traders Richard Usher, formerly at JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, once at Citigroup, and Chris Ashton, also once at Barclays, are among those to withdraw their cases, a London court clerk said. Lawyers for the men declined to comment or did not immediately respond, while the FCA also declined to comment on Wednesday. Last month's landmark ruling overturned a previous Court of Appeal decision that Macris had been identifiable and denied his "third party rights" to contest regulatory findings before they are published and see evidence on which they are based. FCA penalty notices against banks it has investigated often refer to individuals as "Trader A" or "Manager B" to illustrate alleged misconduct, while protecting their anonymity. But the traders had argued that although they had not been named, details and statements made by the FCA in the penalty notices made them identifiable, prejudicing their rights. Defence lawyers have said that a regulatory policy of publicly criticising unnamed individuals in speedy corporate settlements means people who later face investigation can feel they have been tainted by an unfair or unbalanced process.

As Britain prepares to leave the European Union, and banks and other financial firms look to shift jobs from London's financial centre, Poland has set its sights on mid-tier work where salaries may not be astronomical but jobs are numerous. A delegation from JPMorgan visited Warsaw last month, the sources said, to look for real estate that could house the new centre, which could become of the largest of its kind in Poland. "The focus is definitely Warsaw," said one source familiar with the matter, speaking anonymously as discussions are not public. JPMorgan has also visited Poland's western city of Wroclaw and Hungary's capital Budapest as possible contenders, the source added. "There were serious talks last month. It looks like they are close to picking Poland but never say never until deal is signed," another source said. Plans to create the centre were not connected to Britain decision to exit the EU, the first source said. JPMorgan declined to comment on its plans. Poland, the EU's largest eastern economy, has already established itself as a major offshoring site for banks. The country has a population of 38 million and a relatively high-skilled and inexpensive workforce - average wages are roughly three times lower than in neighbouring Germany. Goldman Sachs already has 300 people working in the Polish capital and is seeking 200 people more, while Credit Suisse employs several thousand people in Warsaw and Wroclaw. UBS has also based large IT and back office administrative operations in the country. The estimates of financial services jobs moved from all Western countries to Poland range from 35,000 to 45,000, with Britain's decision to exit the EU seen accelerating the process. A third source familiar with the matter said Warsaw was likely to emerge as the winner. "JP Morgan wants to hire 2,500 people and only Warsaw has a job market which is deep enough to bear with such an investment," the source said. Another Warsaw-based real estate source that although there was not enough prime real estate to accommodate several thousand employees right now, it could become available over the next year or so. JPMorgan would likely start with a few dozen people on the ground in the Polish capital by the end of year if plans are finalised, the first source said.

The institutions say the money will not be used for coal-related projects, but campaigners say it will in effect free up other funds to go into expanding coal-fired power stations, making a nonsense of the pledges. Furthermore, the difficulty of making a profit from coal-fired electricity appears to play little or no role in lending decisions, reflecting the fact that Warsaw has set coal-burning targets for the utilities as a way to protect 80,000 jobs in Poland´s coal mines. Public pressure in the West to stop funding the most polluting of fossil fuels was at its greatest around the time of the U.N.-sponsored Paris Agreement on climate change in December 2015, resulting in numerous pledges to quit coal. On the surface, this was a blow to the newly elected Law and Justice government's plans to support the building of new coal-fired power stations. But the government's commitment to its coal sector, which shows no sign of diminishing, has in effect reduced the risk of investing in it. The power company Energa, which is reviving a project to build a 1 GW coal-fired power plant in Ostroleka, northeast Poland, issued a 300 million euro ($324 million) eurobond in February, with the help of JP Morgan Chase and BNP Paribas. JP Morgan Chase said it had stated the bond could not be used for coal, while BNP Paribas did not respond to a request for comment. EIB-BACKED BONDS BNP Paribas has previously said it will no longer finance coal-fired power plants in high-income countries, and will only support coal in emerging economies on certain conditions. Asked if the borrowing would help to build the Ostroleka plant, which would power 200,000 apartments, Energa said it would be spent on "general corporate needs" and distribution. It also said it was planning to issue hybrid -- debt and equity combined -- bonds, backed by the European Investment Bank. The CEE Bankwatch Network, a non-government body that monitors financial institutions' activities in central and eastern Europe, says there is no guarantee that Energa's bonds will not be used for coal-burning. "The EIB loan could eventually help the company finance its controversial new 1,000 MW coal-fired power plant in Ostroleka," Bankwatch said. It has written to the EIB asking it not to finance Energa unless the company shelves plans to build Ostroleka, which will burn up to 2 million tonnes of coal a year from the state-run mining firm PGG, Poland's biggest. But an EIB spokeswoman told Reuters the bonds had been approved by the bank's board of directors and should be signed off in the coming weeks. She said the financing was exclusively for the modernisation and extension of Energa's distribution network in 2017-2019. This is before the planned start of construction on the Ostroleka plant, which is due to come online in 2023. "BANKS HAVE THEIR GOALS" Several European banking sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was clear that lending to one part of an integrated utility could free up funds in another. "Banks agree to provide financing for energy groups only on condition that it will be spent on distribution networks or renewables. But this helps the energy companies to find money for the coal projects," one of the sources said. "The people working in banks have their goals, too. If they have an opportunity to win a big financing project, they often go for it, especially since there is plenty of money on the market that needs to be spent." And the economics of coal appear to play only a secondary role for the banks. Bartlomiej Kubicki, analyst with Societe Generale, said that, with current carbon emission permit prices, electricity would have to fetch 200 zlotys ($50.58) per megawatt hour for a coal-fuelled power plant to break even in Poland, well above the current power exchange price of around 160 zlotys ($41.22). But at a conference last month, Deputy Energy Minister Grzegorz Tobiszowski said: "We promised that we will make coal mining, which is and for years will remain the basis of Poland's energy, profitable, competitive and developing. We believe that Polish coal mining has the potential to become the basis for a modern Polish economy." To encourage utilities to invest in new coal-fuelled power stations, Poland has announced plans for a "capacity market", effectively a subsidy that rewards power producers not only for the electricity they generate, but for the capacity they hold. A draft law on the plan is expected to be ready around June, although it could run into opposition from the European Union. "BLACK PR" PGE, Poland´s biggest power company and owner of the world's biggest lignite-coal-fuelled power plant in Belchatow, has a 34 billion zloty ($8.7 billion) investment plan, which includes the construction of a 1.8 GW coal power plant in Opole by 2019. The firm, whose operations also include power distribution, secured a large amount of funding just before the Paris Agreement was signed, in the form of two bonds program worth 2 billion euros and 5 billion zlotys ($1.3 billion) in 2014 and September 2015 respectively. But even since Paris, PGE spokesman Maciej Szczepaniuk said that, "despite the intensive black PR, we have not observed a deterioration in our cooperation with banks". PGE and the state-dominated gas company PGNiG were among state-run companies that last year helped to bail out PGG, the coal miner. PGNiG chief financial executive Michal Pietrzyk said the move "did not have a negative impact on our relations with banks". However, there are some signs that foreign investors cannot always be won over. The utility firm Tauron, admittedly Poland's most indebted energy firm and the one with the oldest assets, says it has begun to find financing difficult. "Whenever we approach a financial institution, the first question is about coal," said its chief financial officer, Marek Wadowski. He said the company had turned to environment-linked "green bonds" to finance wind farms and distribution links. "Our aim is to improve our image outside Poland, as we realise we are not positively perceived."

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: When Big Banks Go Bad: The 9 Largest Bank Settlements of All Time Over the past decade, big banks have shelled out record settlements for wrongdoings. Here's why. Matthew Cochrane (CMFCochrane) Apr 26, 2017 at 6:03AM Image source: Getty Images Last summer, Gallup conducted a poll that revealed Americans' faith in key institutions continued "to lag below historical averages." While the confidence of the American public in a number of institutions, including organized religion, the military, and government entities, had dropped significantly in the last decade, no institution has fallen further than banks. In June 2006, the same poll showed that 49% of Americans had "a great deal" or "quite a lot" of confidence in the nation's financial institutions. By last year, only 27% answered the same, a stunning drop of 22 percentage points. That's not to suggest this lack of faith in our nation's banks isn't deserved. Over the past decade banks have shelled out record amounts in fines and settlements after wronging their account holders in a variety of ways. Here is a countdown of the nine largest bank settlements in history. Not coincidently, all were paid out in the past decade. Image source: Getty Images. 9. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM): $5.29 billion In February 2012, 49 states and the federal government reached an agreement, in what is now known as the National Mortgage Settlement, with the five largest banks in the country, including JPMorgan Chase. The settlement was the second largest civil suit settlement in U.S. history, only losing out to the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement of 1988. The five banks agreed to pay out a total of $26 billion in fines; $5.29 billion of which came from JPMorgan Chase. One of the primary offenses the banks were accused of was participating in the practice of robo-signing. While this term meant different things to different banks, the end result was the same: Documents were being signed and notarized prior to the financial crisis without any verification procedures in place for what was being attested to. Something tells me this won't be the last bank that makes this list from this particular settlement. Image source: Getty Images. 8. Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS): $5.3 billion Before he left office, President Obama's administration made a major push to resolve the final investigations persisting from the great recession. One of these final settlements was with Credit Suisse, which agreed to fork over $5.3 billion to finally resolve the investigations stemming from the selling of toxic debt prior to the financial crisis. About $2.48 billion of the settlement will be paid as a civil penalty and $2.1 billion will go toward consumer relief. Many Wall St. banks lined their pockets with Americans' money during the financial crisis. Image source: Getty Images. 7. Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC): $5.35 billion Wells Fargo's contribution to the $26 billion National Mortgage Settlement was just a shade more than JPMorgan's (see #9). Besides robo-signing, the banks in the settlement were accused of cutting corners on and even losing important mortgage paperwork. Every single state and the District of Columbia, with the exception of Oklahoma, participated in the lawsuit. Will this be the last bank to make this list from this same settlement? Doubtful. Image source: Pixabay. 6. Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB): $7.2 billion In December 2016, Deutsche Bank agreed to cough up $7.2 billion for selling toxic assets in the lead up to the housing crash. As of last September, Deutsche Bank had set aside about $6.2 billion for legal costs. Not all of this will be paid as a fine to the U.S. Department of Justice, however, since about $4.1 billion will be directed toward loan modifications and consumer relief spread out over the next five years. Will this massive fine cripple Germany's largest bank? Not likely. After the settlement was announced, Deutsche Bank announced in a memo to employees that it did not expect the news to affect the bank's credit rating or its operations in the U.S. At least one portfolio manager was bullish on the news, calling the hit to Deutsche Bank's capital "modest".

Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC): $8.5 billion In 2008, Bank of America acquired Countrywide, the largest home lender in the United States prior to the financial crisis. In 2011, Bank of America agreed to shell out more than $8.5 billion to finally absolve Countrywide's sins in selling $174 billion worth of subprime mortgage-backed assets. Ouch! Most banks made this list for wrongs committed during the financial crisis. Not BNP Saribas. This bank violated U.S. sanctions against several countries. Image source: Getty Images. 4. BNP Paribas SA (NASDAQOTH:BNPQY): $8.9 billion See, not all the banks made this list for misdeeds committed prior to the financial crisis. In 2015, this huge French bank pled guilty to violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act. Essentially the bank had violated the sanctions in place against Cuba, Iran, and Sudan from 2004 to 2012. To avoid U.S. authorities' suspicions it omitted information in wire transfers as funds from the sanctioned countries entered the U.S. financial system. Many Americans lost fortunes during the financial crisis. Image source: Getty Images. 3. Bank of America: $11.8 billion Bank of America paid out the most money from the 2012 National Mortgage Settlement -- a whopping $11.8 billion. Approximately $1 billion of this settlement was paid to the Federal Housing Authority to address charges that Bank of America's subsidiary, Countrywide Financial, conned the agency. Besides this additional fine, Bank of America's principal mortgage deductions came in at $100,000 per mortgage while the other banks' same reductions only averaged $20,000. Besides fines and principal reductions, much of the settlement went toward offering homeowners refinancing options. Image source: Getty Images. 2. JP Morgan Chase: $13 billion In October 2013, JP Morgan reached this massive settlement with federal regulators. So, what exactly did JPMorgan do to deserve this? Well, it basically bought Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual at fire sale prices during the depths of the recession. Unfortunately for JPMorgan, it also took on all existing and future legal obligations of these two banks when it did so. Both Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual were heavily involved in bundling and reselling subprime mortgage securities to investors in the run-up to the financial crisis and, indeed, this is what practically caused the crisis. Two of the biggest investors in these securities were none other than Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Many believed bank executives should have gone to jail for their role in the financial crisis. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Bank of America: $16.65 billion Who deserves the No. 1 spot more than Bank of America? This settlement marks its third entry in the top five and dwarfs all others on this list. The enormous penalty was the largest settlement in United States history between a corporation and the U.S. government. The payment was levied against Bank of America for packaging mortgage-backed securities that were not nearly as financially sound as investors were led to believe. Many of these subprime mortgages were sold by Countrywide and Merrill Lynch before the two companies were acquired by Bank of America. As for the settlement itself, $5 billion of it was a penalty under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA). Another $7 billion was directed to relieve U.S. homeowners and borrowers victimized by the bank's misdeeds. At the time of the agreement, Attorney General Eric holder stated: "This historic resolution-the largest such settlement on record-goes far beyond 'the cost of doing business.' Under the terms of this settlement, the bank has agreed to pay $7 billion in relief to struggling homeowners, borrowers and communities affected by the bank's conduct. This is appropriate given the size and scope of the wrongdoing at issue." Matthew Cochrane has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman How Much Would Trump’s Tax Cuts Help Bank of America? One of the reasons bank stocks have surged since the presidential election is that investors expect the current administration to follow through on Trump’s campaign vow to lower the top corporate tax rate from 35% to as low as 15%. But while all banks would benefit from this, as would all other profitable companies, few would gain as much as Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) . The nation’s second-biggest bank by assets paid $7.3 billion in income taxes last year. Only five companies on the S&P 500 paid more than that, with two of those also happening to be banks — JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo . Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. Why do banks pay so much in taxes compared to other companies? The simple answer is that they earn more money. Apple is the only company in the country that earns more than JPMorgan Chase . Wells Fargo and Bank of America aren’t far behind. Their net incomes over the past 12 months rank them fourth and sixth on the S&P 500, respectively. Unlike most other leading blue-chip companies, banks use an enormous amount of leverage , typically holding $10 worth of assets for every $1 in shareholders’ equity. This allows banks to scale up their profits relative to other types of companies. Every $1 in shareholders’ equity at Apple, for instance, translates into a comparatively modest $2.50 worth of assets. Cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35% down to 15% would therefore be a boon for Bank of America. It would have reduced the North Carolina-based bank’s tax liability in 2016 by nearly half, or 48%, leaving $3.5 billion in additional net income to hit the bank’s bottom line. That would make a huge difference, boosting Bank of America’s net income by 19%, or approximately $0.35 per share. Bank of America’s headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. Image source: Getty Images. The challenge for investors right now, however, is that much of this already appears to be priced into Bank of America’s stock. This explains why its shares are up 44% since the beginning of November. To put that in perspective, the S&P 500 is up only 13% over the same stretch, while the KBW Bank Index has climbed 24% — the latter tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo. If Trump’s tax plans don’t come to fruition — and that could very well be the case, given the impact of the cuts on the federal deficit — bank stocks could be in for a correction. It’s too early to say if that will happen, but investors in bank stocks should keep it in the back of their minds. 10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump's team boasted Wednesday that its tax-cut plan would lighten Americans' financial burdens, ignite economic growth and vastly simplify tax filing. Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump's plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don't pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That's because Trump would apply the corporate rate to "pass through"businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What's more, some privately held large companies including Trump's own real estate empire are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here's a closer look at Trump's proposal and its likely impact: Who benefits? It's hard to say because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren't ready Wednesday to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. Tax experts said far more details were needed to determine how average Americans would be affected. "The impact on Joe Taxpayer is unknown," said Marc Gerson, vice chair of the tax department of law firm Miller & Chevalier in Washington. "There's not enough specificity. It's hard for taxpayers to determine where they'll come out." Cohn asserted that the plan would cut taxes "especially for low and middle-income families."It purports to do so in part by doubling the standard deduction, which is used by taxpayers who don't itemise their tax deductions. At the same time, the Trump plan would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting some of the richest taxpayers. And that's on top of shrinking the corporate tax rate that many affluent individuals could likely capitalise on. Why cut corporate taxes? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending on equipment from computers to factories and machinery. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Economic growth has been stuck at about 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 percent, a pace it hasn't touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among advanced economies. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which both reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. Who'd benefit from the corporate rate cut? Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit because they're structured as pass-throughs, which derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 percent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 percent, those taxpayers could enjoy an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But the richest windfalls would flow to the wealthy lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners. Nearly 75 percent of pass-through income flows to the 10 percent wealthiest taxpayers, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "It would tremendously help high earners," says Brian Thompson, a certified public accountant in Chicago. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback eliminated state taxes on pass-throughs, which turned out to be a boon for Bill Self, the coach of the University of Kansas' men's basketball team. He had previously set up his own company, according to state media reports. As a result, he paid little state income tax despite earning nearly $3 million a year. Many people, particularly wealthy Americans, could set up companies and reclassify their paychecks as "business income" and have it taxed at 15 percent, experts say. In Kansas, the number of pass-through businesses jumped to more than double the level the state expected, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That cost the state revenue without spurring more job creation. Mnuchin said the Treasury would issue rules to prevent wealthy people from capitalising on the lower rate. But many experts are sceptical. "Good luck with that," said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury official under President Barack Obama. "The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses." How else would big businesses benefit? The administration is also proposing to tax only corporate income earned in the United States. This is known as a "territorial" system. It would replace the current worldwide system, under which corporations pay tax on income earned in the U.S. and overseas. Yet companies can avoid the tax if they keep their foreign earnings overseas. Many businesses have kept hundreds of billions of dollars outside the United States. Mnuchin said Trump's plan would encourage corporations to return the money to the United States and invest it in plants and equipment. Some analysts counter that corporations might instead use the money to pay dividends to shareholders. What about the deficit and growth? The government's budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion over 10 years. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well, he contended. But the Trump team offered few details on which deductions would be dropped a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries of those deductions. And most economists don't accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would reduce government revenue by $2 trillion over 10 years. That would require growth to accelerate nearly a full percentage point, to 2.8 percent a year, from its current level. Yet Cole forecasts that growth would increase only 0.4 percent annually. Other economists say that if the cuts balloon the deficit, the resulting jump in government borrowing would swell interest rates and make it harder for businesses and households to borrow and spend. Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says such a "crowding out" effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy. So will the economy benefit at all? Most economists forecast that a modest tax-cut package smaller than Trump's is far more likely to become law. With the deficit rising by less, a smaller cut could raise growth to 2.5 per cent a year, from its roughly 2 per cent pace now, Harris said. If Trump's proposals became law, depending on the details, growth could accelerate more quickly, Harris added. But the Federal Reserve would likely counter such acceleration with more short-term rate hikes, to forestall rapid inflation. And that move, in turn, would likely slow the economy.

President Donald Trump proposed dramatic cuts in the taxes paid by corporations big and small Wednesday in an overhaul his administration says will spur economic growth and bring jobs and prosperity to America's middle class. AP featured Trump tax cut: Huge, vague and likely mild boost for economy By CHRISTOPHER S. RUGABER AP Economics Writer 2 hrs ago 0 Richard Drew Associated Press | Richard Drew WASHINGTON President Donald Trump's team boasted Wednesday that its tax-cut plan would lighten Americans' financial burdens, ignite economic growth and vastly simplify tax filing.

Most economists forecast that a modest tax-cut package — smaller than Trump’s — is far more likely to become law. With the deficit rising by less, a smaller cut could raise growth to 2.5 percent a year, from its roughly 2 percent pace now, Harris said. If Trump’s proposals became law, depending on the details, growth could accelerate more quickly, Harris added. But the Federal Reserve would likely counter such acceleration with more short-term rate hikes, to forestall rapid inflation. And that move, in turn, would likely slow the economy. ___ Joseph Pisani and Paul Harloff in New York contributed to this report. ___ Contact Chris Rugaber on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber Related Topics All News Business News Government News Leave A Comment Home » The Associated Press » Government News » Why Trump tax cut… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Today in History 1984: Reagan visits China Fed Photo of the Day Nevada Air National Guard trains with US Forest Service for airborne firefighting Top Stories Your pay and benefits during a government shutdown, explained Top Story 2 days until CR ends: What happens to defense workers if the government shuts down?

Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump’s plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don’t pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That’s because Trump would apply the corporate rate to “pass through” businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What’s more, some privately held large companies — including Trump’s own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here’s a closer look at Trump’s proposal and its likely impact: Who benefits? It’s hard to say precisely because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren’t ready to say at what levels these new rates would kick in. Cohn said the plan would cut taxes “especially for low and middle income families.” Trump wants to eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting many of the richest taxpayers. Why cut corporate taxes? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Growth has been stuck at about 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 percent, a pace it hasn’t touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among advanced economies. The Obama administration proposed cutting it to 28 percent. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which both reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. “Simplifying the tax code as well as getting the rate to a point of being able to compete on a global scale is certainly something that we support,” an executive at Boeing said on a conference call earlier Wednesday. Who’d benefit from the corporate rate cut? Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit because they are structured as pass-throughs, an ungainly moniker that derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 percent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 percent, those taxpayers would receive an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But the richest windfalls would flow to the wealthy — lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners. Nearly 75 percent of pass-through income flows to the 10 percent wealthiest taxpayers, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback eliminated state taxes on pass-throughs, which turned out to be a boon for Bill Self, the coach of the University of Kansas’ men’s basketball team. He had previously set up his own company, according to state media reports. As a result, he paid little state income tax, despite earning nearly $3 million a year. Many people, particularly wealthy Americans, could set up companies and reclassify their paychecks as “business income” and have it taxed at the 15 percent rate, tax experts say. In Kansas, the number of pass-through businesses more than doubled the level the state expected, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That cost the state revenue without spurring more job creation. Mnuchin said the Treasury would issue rules to prevent wealthy people from capitalizing on the lower rate. “Good luck with that,” said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury official under President Barack Obama. “The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses.” How else would big businesses benefit? The administration is also proposing to tax only corporate income earned in the United States. This is known as a “territorial” system. It would replace the current worldwide system, under which corporations pay tax on income earned in the U.S. and overseas. Yet companies can avoid the tax if they keep their foreign earnings overseas. That’s led many businesses to keep hundreds of billions of dollars outside the U.S. Mnuchin said Trump’s plan would encourage corporations to return the money to the U.S. and invest it in plants and equipment. Yet some analysts argue that corporations might instead use the money to pay dividends to shareholders. What about the deficit and growth? The government’s budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster economic growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well. But the Trump team offered no details on which deductions would be dropped — a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries. And most economists don’t accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would lower government revenue by $2 trillion over 10 years. That would require growth to accelerate nearly a full percentage point, to 2.8 percent a year, from its current level. Yet Cole forecasts that growth would increase only 0.4 of a percentage point annually. Other economists say that if the cuts balloon the deficit, the jump in government borrowing would swell interest rates and make it harder for businesses and households to borrow and spend. Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says such a “crowding out” effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy.

Of the hundreds of startups who will apply, nine winners will be selected and receive a combined investment of $2 million. This year, FinLab is seeking startups who are focused on improving American’s financial health. According to a recent CFSI study, they found that 57 percent of households were struggling with their financial health, and that underserved Americans spent $141 billion in fees and interest to meet their financial needs. That is a lot of money these consumers will never see again, and FinLab plans to incubate and accelerate nine startups who are dedicated to solving a component of this issue. With only hours left until the application deadline, FinLab will be looking for fintech companies, tech startups, and innovative non-profits. To date, they have already brought in 16 traditional startups and two nonprofits in their initial cohorts, with $4.5 million invested among them. Beyond their goal of financial health this year, the startups they will specifically be looking for companies developing financial solutions for minorities, the differently-abled, seniors, and low-income women. “Technology can help us reach overlooked populations with more affordable and convenient financial products and services that can promote financial health,” said Colleen Briggs, the Executive Director of Community Innovation at JPMorgan Chase to BusinessWire. “But to unlock this potential, we want to see more innovators who understand these communities and are designing solutions that meet their needs and preferences.” Each selected company will receive $250,000 in capital, plus resources such as corporate partnerships, mentoring, peer learning, and networking. Of the two completed cohorts, the companies have raised a combined $120 million since joining FinLab, and have amassed more than one million users. The deadline to apply for this round is Thursday, April 27 at midnight.

Rugaber AP Economics Writer Trump tax cut: Huge, vague and likely mild boost for economy Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, right, joined by National Economic Director Gary Cohn, center, and White House press secretary Sean Spicer speaks in the briefing room of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, April 26, 2017. President Donald Trump is proposing dramatically reducing the taxes paid by corporations big and small in an overhaul his administration says will spur economic growth and bring jobs and prosperity to the middle class. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s team boasted Wednesday that its tax-cut plan would lighten Americans’ financial burdens, ignite economic growth and vastly simplify tax filing. Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump’s plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don’t pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That’s because Trump would apply the corporate rate to “pass through” businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What’s more, some privately held large companies — including Trump’s own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here’s a closer look at Trump’s proposal and its likely impact: ___ WHO BENEFITS? It’s hard to say because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren’t ready Wednesday to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. Tax experts said far more details were needed to determine how average Americans would be affected. “The impact on Joe Taxpayer is unknown,” said Marc Gerson, vice chair of the tax department of law firm Miller & Chevalier in Washington. “There’s not enough specificity. It’s hard for taxpayers to determine where they’ll come out.” Cohn asserted that the plan would cut taxes “especially for low and middle income families.” It purports to do so in part by doubling the standard deduction, which is used by taxpayers who don’t itemize their tax deductions. At the same time, the Trump plan would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting some of the richest taxpayers. And that’s on top of shrinking the corporate tax rate that many affluent individuals could likely capitalize on. ___ WHY CUT CORPORATE TAXES? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending on equipment — from computers to factories and machinery. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Economic growth has been stuck at about 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 percent, a pace it hasn’t touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among advanced economies. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which both reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. ___ WHO’D BENEFIT FROM THE CORPORATE RATE CUT? Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit because they’re structured as pass-throughs, which derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 percent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 percent, those taxpayers could enjoy an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But the richest windfalls would flow to the wealthy — lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners. Nearly 75 percent of pass-through income flows to the 10 percent wealthiest taxpayers, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “It would tremendously help high earners,” says Brian Thompson, a certified public accountant in Chicago. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback eliminated state taxes on pass-throughs, which turned out to be a boon for Bill Self, the coach of the University of Kansas’ men’s basketball team. He had previously set up his own company, according to state media reports. As a result, he paid little state income tax despite earning nearly $3 million a year. Many people, particularly wealthy Americans, could set up companies and reclassify their paychecks as “business income” and have it taxed at 15 percent, experts say. In Kansas, the number of pass-through businesses jumped to more than double the level the state expected, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That cost the state revenue without spurring more job creation. Mnuchin said the Treasury would issue rules to prevent wealthy people from capitalizing on the lower rate. But many experts are skeptical. “Good luck with that,” said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury official under President Barack Obama. “The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses.” ___ HOW ELSE WOULD BIG BUSINESSES BENEFIT? The administration is also proposing to tax only corporate income earned in the United States. This is known as a “territorial” system. It would replace the current worldwide system, under which corporations pay tax on income earned in the U.S. and overseas. Yet companies can avoid the tax if they keep their foreign earnings overseas. Many businesses have kept hundreds of billions of dollars outside the United States. Mnuchin said Trump’s plan would encourage corporations to return the money to the United States and invest it in plants and equipment. Some analysts counter that corporations might instead use the money to pay dividends to shareholders. ___ WHAT ABOUT THE DEFICIT AND GROWTH? The government’s budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion over 10 years. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well, he contended. But the Trump team offered few details on which deductions would be dropped — a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries of those deductions. And most economists don’t accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would reduce government revenue by $2 trillion over 10 years. That would require growth to accelerate nearly a full percentage point, to 2.8 percent a year, from its current level. Yet Cole forecasts that growth would increase only 0.4 percent annually. Other economists say that if the cuts balloon the deficit, the resulting jump in government borrowing would swell interest rates and make it harder for businesses and households to borrow and spend. Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says such a “crowding out” effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy. ___ SO WILL THE ECONOMY BENEFIT AT ALL? Most economists forecast that a modest tax-cut package — smaller than Trump’s — is far more likely to become law. With the deficit rising by less, a smaller cut could raise growth to 2.5 percent a year, from its roughly 2 percent pace now, Harris said. If Trump’s proposals became law, depending on the details, growth could accelerate more quickly, Harris added. But the Federal Reserve would likely counter such acceleration with more short-term rate hikes, to forestall rapid inflation. And that move, in turn, would likely slow the economy. ___ Joseph Pisani and Paul Harloff in New York contributed to this report.

Quotes in the article Comcast Corp CMCSA ▲ 38.79 +0.30 +0.78% Intel Corp INTC ▲ 36.93 +0.06 +0.16% Alphabet Inc GOOGL ▲ 881.00 +6.00 +0.69% UnipolSai SPA US ▼ 2.10 -0.02 -1.04% AdChoices There's a rush of earnings Thursday morning, including Union Pacific (UNP), Bristol-Myers Squibb, Ford, American Airlines (AAL), Comcast, (CMCSA) Dow Chemical, Raytheon (RTN) and Deutsche Bank, to name a few. But some of the tech names that have led the market's gains report after the closing bell and could be big catalysts into Friday's trading. That includes Amazon.com (AMZN), up 21 percent year to date, and Alphabet (GOOGL), which has risen 12 percent. Microsoft, (MSFT) Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) also report after the close. There are risks to that scenario, including the fact that Congress still needs to pass a resolution to keep the government funded by Friday, though it is expected to happen. There are also wild cards, like the worrisome tensions with North Korea. Another factor that markets are warily watching is the string of softening data reports. Thursday data includes March durable goods orders, weekly jobless claims and advanced economic indicators, all at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists have been cutting forecasts for first-quarter GDP, expected Friday, but are hopeful the second quarter will bounce back. JPMorgan lowered its forecast to 0.4 percent for the first quarter on Wednesday. Stocks slid into the close Wednesday, in a sell-the-news move after President Donald Trump's much anticipated tax plan. The proposal contained a juicy corporate tax cut but was viewed as short on details and likely to be seriously modified. Nonetheless, it is an opening round in what is expected to be months of horse trading on taxes. "People are somewhat optimistic, but they wanted more detail," said Doron Barness, head of global equities trading at Oppenheimer. He said what the market is really focusing on are the nearby highs, like 2,400 on the S&P 500. (.SPX) That index closed Wednesday at 2,387, down 1 point. The Nasdaq was just under its high, set Tuesday, closing at 6,025, and the Dow (.DJI) was off 21 at 20,975. The Russell 2000 (.RUT) closed at a new all-time high of 1,419. "We've had some soft economic data, but people are ignoring that. You have North Korea stuff going on. People are ignoring that. Those are the kind of things that could bring the market down if more economic data comes out that's weaker and there's something geopolitical. But absent that, I don't see how the market doesn't go higher. People are not going to sell this market," said Barness. Earnings power As of Thursday, half the S&P 500 will have reported earnings, and so far profits are expected to be up about 11.8 percent from last year's first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. The companies that have reported so far, saw profits rise an average of 14.4 percent and beat expectations 77 percent of the time. "Obviously, it's all been about earnings, and obviously large-cap earnings have been coming in quite strong, and that's giving people a lot of optimism. You have the VIX (.VIX) back under 11 so it's risk-on," said Steve DeSanctis, Jefferies equity strategist. The VIX is the CBOE's Volatility Index, a measure of market fear since it is calculated based on the puts and calls on the S&P 500. It was at the low level of 10.85 on Wednesday, up 0.8 percent. Barness said if the S&P does get close to 2,400, it could hover there for a while. "What usually happens is we'll toy with this level, back and forth," he said. "If we go through, it's going to have velocity." He said that would force short covering, meaning traders who have short positions would have to buy as the prices go up. "There's a lot of euphoria going around. I hate to be the skunk at the garden party, but I'm just a bit more skeptical here. We've had a pretty big move in three days," said DeSanctis. Econorama Bond yields, which move inversely to price, also slid Wednesday amid concerns that the tax plan could widen the federal budget deficit, which would ultimately make yields rise. In late trading, the 10-year yield (US10Y) drifted to 2.30 percent, an important technical area that the market had held above for months — until last week. "Who is going to be right? The bond market is telling you there's sluggish growth ahead, and the stock market is not telling you that," said DeSanctis. UBS economists on Wednesday said they were sticking with their view that first-quarter growth is tracking at 0.9 percent, after government retail sales revisions showed a weaker-than-expected consumer in the first quarter.

President Donald Trump is proposing dramatically reducing the taxes paid by corporations big and small in an overhaul his administration says will spur economic growth and bring jobs and prosperity to the middle class. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) Washington • President Donald Trump's team boasted Wednesday that its tax-cut plan would light Americans' financial burdens, ignite economic growth and vastly simplify tax filing. Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump's plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don't pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That's because Trump would apply the corporate rate to "pass through" businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What's more, some privately held large companies — including Trump's own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here's a closer look at Trump's proposal and its likely impact: ——— WHO BENEFITS? It's hard to say precisely because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren't ready to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. Cohn said the plan would cut taxes "especially for low and middle income families." Yet Trump's campaign proposals were skewed to the wealthiest Americans, and it's likely that his new proposal, once fleshed out, could be as well. Trump wants to eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting many of the richest taxpayers. ——— WHY CUT CORPORATE TAXES? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending on equipment — from computers to factories and machinery. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Growth has been stuck at about 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 percent, a pace it hasn't touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among the advanced economies. The Obama administration had proposed cutting it to 28 percent. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which both reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. "Simplifying the tax code as well as getting the rate to a point of being able to compete on a global scale is certainly something that we support," an executive at Boeing said on a conference call about the company's earnings earlier Wednesday. » Next page... 2 3 Single page   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY 2 photos VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Monson: The Jazz's secret to winning isn't what you might think it is State probe of University of Utah operations likely after Huntsman Cancer Institute upheaval Trump orders review of national monuments, says Bears Ears 'should never have happened' Kragthorpe: Game 6 will be the hardest one yet for Jazz BYU football: Sitake effect?

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's team boasted Wednesday that its tax-cut plan would lighten Americans' financial burdens, ignite economic growth and vastly simplify tax filing. Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump's plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don't pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That's because Trump would apply the corporate rate to "pass through" businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What's more, some privately held large companies — including Trump's own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here's a closer look at Trump's proposal and its likely impact: ___ WHO BENEFITS? It's hard to say because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren't ready Wednesday to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. Tax experts said far more details were needed to determine how average Americans would be affected. "The impact on Joe Taxpayer is unknown," said Marc Gerson, vice chair of the tax department of law firm Miller & Chevalier in Washington. "There's not enough specificity. It's hard for taxpayers to determine where they'll come out." Cohn asserted that the plan would cut taxes "especially for low and middle income families." It purports to do so in part by doubling the standard deduction, which is used by taxpayers who don't itemize their tax deductions. At the same time, the Trump plan would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting some of the richest taxpayers. And that's on top of shrinking the corporate tax rate that many affluent individuals could likely capitalize on. ___ WHY CUT CORPORATE TAXES? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending on equipment — from computers to factories and machinery. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Economic growth has been stuck at about 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 percent, a pace it hasn't touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among advanced economies. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which both reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. ___ WHO'D BENEFIT FROM THE CORPORATE RATE CUT? Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit because they're structured as pass-throughs, which derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 percent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 percent, those taxpayers could enjoy an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But the richest windfalls would flow to the wealthy — lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners. Nearly 75 percent of pass-through income flows to the 10 percent wealthiest taxpayers, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "It would tremendously help high earners," says Brian Thompson, a certified public accountant in Chicago. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback eliminated state taxes on pass-throughs, which turned out to be a boon for Bill Self, the coach of the University of Kansas' men's basketball team. He had previously set up his own company, according to state media reports. As a result, he paid little state income tax despite earning nearly $3 million a year. Many people, particularly wealthy Americans, could set up companies and reclassify their paychecks as "business income" and have it taxed at 15 percent, experts say. In Kansas, the number of pass-through businesses jumped to more than double the level the state expected, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That cost the state revenue without spurring more job creation. Mnuchin said the Treasury would issue rules to prevent wealthy people from capitalizing on the lower rate. But many experts are skeptical. "Good luck with that," said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury official under President Barack Obama. "The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses." ___ HOW ELSE WOULD BIG BUSINESSES BENEFIT? The administration is also proposing to tax only corporate income earned in the United States. This is known as a "territorial" system. It would replace the current worldwide system, under which corporations pay tax on income earned in the U.S. and overseas. Yet companies can avoid the tax if they keep their foreign earnings overseas. Many businesses have kept hundreds of billions of dollars outside the United States.

The government's budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion over 10 years. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well, he contended. But the Trump team offered few details on which deductions would be dropped — a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries of those deductions. And most economists don't accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would reduce government revenue by $2 trillion over 10 years. That would require growth to accelerate nearly a full percentage point, to 2.8 percent a year, from its current level. Yet Cole forecasts that growth would increase only 0.4 percent annually. Other economists say that if the cuts balloon the deficit, the resulting jump in government borrowing would swell interest rates and make it harder for businesses and households to borrow and spend. Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says such a "crowding out" effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy. ___ SO WILL THE ECONOMY BENEFIT AT ALL? Most economists forecast that a modest tax-cut package — smaller than Trump's — is far more likely to become law. With the deficit rising by less, a smaller cut could raise growth to 2.5 percent a year, from its roughly 2 percent pace now, Harris said. If Trump's proposals became law, depending on the details, growth could accelerate more quickly, Harris added. But the Federal Reserve would likely counter such acceleration with more short-term rate hikes, to forestall rapid inflation. And that move, in turn, would likely slow the economy. ___ Joseph Pisani and Paul Harloff in New York contributed to this report. ___ Contact Chris Rugaber on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Rugaber, Associated Press Published 7:01 p.m. ET April 26, 2017 | Updated 8 hours ago President Donald Trump (Photo: Carolyn Kaster / AP) 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Washington — President Donald Trump’s team boasted Wednesday that its tax-cut plan would light Americans’ financial burdens, ignite economic growth and vastly simplify tax filing. Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump’s plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don’t pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That’s because Trump would apply the corporate rate to “pass through” businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What’s more, some privately held large companies — including Trump’s own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here’s a closer look at Trump’s proposal and its likely impact: Who benefits? It’s hard to say precisely because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren’t ready to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. Cohn said the plan would cut taxes “especially for low and middle income families.” Yet Trump’s campaign proposals were skewed to the wealthiest Americans, and it’s likely that his new proposal, once fleshed out, could be as well. Trump wants to eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting many of the richest taxpayers. Why cut corporate taxes? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending on equipment — from computers to factories and machinery. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Growth has been stuck at about 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 percent, a pace it hasn’t touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among the advanced economies. The Obama administration had proposed cutting it to 28 percent. What about the deficit, growth? The government’s budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, experts say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster economic growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well, he contended. But the Trump team offered no details on which deductions would be dropped — a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries of those deductions. And most economists don’t accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

There are risks to that scenario, including the fact that Congress still needs to pass a resolution to keep the government funded by Friday Patti Domm | @pattidomm 8 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Brendan McDermid | Reuters Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on November 18, 2016. Thursday's blast of high-profile earnings, including big tech bellwethers, could help set the stage for new stock market highs in the very near future. There's a rush of earnings Thursday morning, including Union Pacific, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Ford, American Airlines, Comcast, Dow Chemical, Raytheon and Deutsche Bank, to name a few. But some of the tech names that have led the market's gains report after the closing bell and could be big catalysts into Friday's trading. That includes Amazon.com, up 21 percent year to date, and Alphabet, which has risen 12 percent. Microsoft, Intel and Starbucks also report after the close. There are risks to that scenario, including the fact that Congress still needs to pass a resolution to keep the government funded by Friday, though it is expected to happen. There are also wild cards, like the worrisome tensions with North Korea. Another factor that markets are warily watching is the string of softening data reports. Thursday data includes March durable goods orders, weekly jobless claims and advanced economic indicators, all at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists have been cutting forecasts for first-quarter GDP, expected Friday, but are hopeful the second quarter will bounce back. JPMorgan lowered its forecast to 0.4 percent for the first quarter on Wednesday. Stocks slid into the close Wednesday, in a sell-the-news move after President Donald Trump's much anticipated tax plan. The proposal contained a juicy corporate tax cut but was viewed as short on details and likely to be seriously modified. Nonetheless, it is an opening round in what is expected to be months of horse trading on taxes. "People are somewhat optimistic, but they wanted more detail," said Doron Barness, head of global equities trading at Oppenheimer. He said what the market is really focusing on are the nearby highs, like 2,400 on the S&P 500. That index closed Wednesday at 2,387, down 1 point. The Nasdaq was just under its high, set Tuesday, closing at 6,025, and the Dow was off 21 at 20,975. The Russell 2000 closed at a new all-time high of 1,419. "We've had some soft economic data, but people are ignoring that. You have North Korea stuff going on. People are ignoring that. Those are the kind of things that could bring the market down if more economic data comes out that's weaker and there's something geopolitical. But absent that, I don't see how the market doesn't go higher. People are not going to sell this market," said Barness. Earnings power As of Thursday, half the S&P 500 will have reported earnings, and so far profits are expected to be up about 11.8 percent from last year's first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. The companies that have reported so far, saw profits rise an average of 14.4 percent and beat expectations 77 percent of the time. "Obviously, it's all been about earnings, and obviously large-cap earnings have been coming in quite strong, and that's giving people a lot of optimism. You have the VIX back under 11 so it's risk-on," said Steve DeSanctis, Jefferies equity strategist. The VIX is the CBOE's Volatility Index, a measure of market fear since it is calculated based on the puts and calls on the S&P 500. It was at the low level of 10.85 on Wednesday, up 0.8 percent. Barness said if the S&P does get close to 2,400, it could hover there for a while. "What usually happens is we'll toy with this level, back and forth," he said. "If we go through, it's going to have velocity." He said that would force short covering, meaning traders who have short positions would have to buy as the prices go up. "There's a lot of euphoria going around. I hate to be the skunk at the garden party, but I'm just a bit more skeptical here. We've had a pretty big move in three days," said DeSanctis. Econorama Bond yields, which move inversely to price, also slid Wednesday amid concerns that the tax plan could widen the federal budget deficit, which would ultimately make yields rise. In late trading, the 10-year yield drifted to 2.30 percent, an important technical area that the market had held above for months — until last week. "Who is going to be right? The bond market is telling you there's sluggish growth ahead, and the stock market is not telling you that," said DeSanctis. UBS economists on Wednesday said they were sticking with their view that first-quarter growth is tracking at 0.9 percent, after government retail sales revisions showed a weaker-than-expected consumer in the first quarter. But they did note that Thursday's data on retail and wholesale inventories and the advanced merchandise trade, as well as durables could influence their forecast for GDP ahead of Friday's report.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's team boasted Wednesday that its tax-cut plan would lighten Americans' financial burdens, ignite economic growth and vastly simplify tax filing. Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump's plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 per cent to 35 per cent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 per cent all the way to 15 per cent, a boon to most companies even though many don't pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 per cent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 per cent corporate rate. That's because Trump would apply the corporate rate to "pass through" businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What's more, some privately held large companies — including Trump's own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here's a closer look at Trump's proposal and its likely impact: ___ WHO BENEFITS? It's hard to say because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 per cent, 25 per cent and 35 per cent. But Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren't ready Wednesday to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. Taxe experts said far more details were needed to determine how average Americans would be affected. "The impact on Joe Taxpayer is unknown," said Marc Gerson, vice chair of the tax department of law firm Miller & Chevalier in Washington. "There's not enough specificity. It's hard for taxpayers to determine where they'll come out." Cohn asserted that the plan would cut taxes "especially for low and middle income families." It purports to do so in part by doubling the standard deduction, which is used by taxpayers who don't itemize their tax deductions. At the same time, the Trump plan would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting some of the richest taxpayers. And that's on top of shrinking the corporate tax rate that many affluent individuals could likely capitalize on. ___ WHY CUT CORPORATE TAXES? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending on equipment — from computers to factories and machinery. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Economic growth has been stuck at about 2 per cent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 per cent, a pace it hasn't touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among advanced economies. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which both reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. ___ WHO'D BENEFIT FROM THE CORPORATE RATE CUT? Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit because they're structured as pass-throughs, which derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 per cent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 per cent, those taxpayers could enjoy an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But the richest windfalls would flow to the wealthy — lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners. Nearly 75 per cent of pass-through income flows to the 10 per cent wealthiest taxpayers, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "It would tremendously help high earners," says Brian Thompson, a certified public accountant in Chicago. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback eliminated state taxes on pass-throughs, which turned out to be a boon for Bill Self, the coach of the University of Kansas' men's basketball team. He had previously set up his own company, according to state media reports. As a result, he paid little state income tax despite earning nearly $3 million a year. Many people, particularly wealthy Americans, could set up companies and reclassify their paychecks as "business income" and have it taxed at 15 per cent, experts say. In Kansas, the number of pass-through businesses jumped to more than double the level the state expected, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That cost the state revenue without spurring more job creation. Mnuchin said the Treasury would issue rules to prevent wealthy people from capitalizing on the lower rate. But many experts are skeptical. "Good luck with that," said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury official under President Barack Obama. "The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses." ___ HOW ELSE WOULD BIG BUSINESSES BENEFIT? The administration is also proposing to tax only corporate income earned in the United States. This is known as a "territorial" system. It would replace the current worldwide system, under which corporations pay tax on income earned in the U.S. and overseas. Yet companies can avoid the tax if they keep their foreign earnings overseas. Many businesses have kept hundreds of billions of dollars outside the United States. Mnuchin said Trump's plan would encourage corporations to return the money to the United States and invest it in plants and equipment. Some analysts counter that corporations might instead use the money to pay dividends to shareholders. ___ WHAT ABOUT THE DEFICIT AND GROWTH? The government's budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion over 10 years. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well, he contended. But the Trump team offered few details on which deductions would be dropped — a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries of those deductions. And most economists don't accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would reduce government revenue by $2 trillion over 10 years. That would require growth to accelerate nearly a full percentage point, to 2.8 per cent a year, from its current level. Yet Cole forecasts that growth would increase only 0.4 per cent annually. Other economists say that if the cuts balloon the deficit, the resulting jump in government borrowing would swell interest rates and make it harder for businesses and households to borrow and spend. Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says such a "crowding out" effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy. ___ SO WILL THE ECONOMY BENEFIT AT ALL? Most economists forecast that a modest tax-cut package — smaller than Trump's — is far more likely to become law. With the deficit rising by less, a smaller cut could raise growth to 2.5 per cent a year, from its roughly 2 per cent pace now, Harris said. If Trump's proposals became law, depending on the details, growth could accelerate more quickly, Harris added. But the Federal Reserve would likely counter such acceleration with more short-term rate hikes, to forestall rapid inflation. And that move, in turn, would likely slow the economy. ___ Joseph Pisani and Paul Harloff in New York contributed to this report. ___ Contact Chris Rugaber on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *       Specialists on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watch Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, Wednesday, April 26, 2017.

RUGABER WASHINGTON President Donald Trump's team boasted Wednesday that its tax-cut plan would lighten Americans' financial burdens, ignite economic growth and vastly simplify tax filing. Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump's plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don't pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That's because Trump would apply the corporate rate to "pass through" businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What's more, some privately held large companies — including Trump's own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here's a closer look at Trump's proposal and its likely impact: WHO BENEFITS? It's hard to say precisely because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren't ready to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. Cohn said the plan would cut taxes "especially for low and middle income families." Yet Trump's campaign proposals were skewed to the wealthiest Americans, and it's likely that his new proposal, once fleshed out, could be as well. Trump wants to eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting many of the richest taxpayers. WHY CUT CORPORATE TAXES? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending on equipment — from computers to factories and machinery. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Growth has been stuck at about 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 percent, a pace it hasn't touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among the advanced economies. The Obama administration had proposed cutting it to 28 percent. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which both reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. "Simplifying the tax code as well as getting the rate to a point of being able to compete on a global scale is certainly something that we support," an executive at Boeing said on a conference call about the company's earnings earlier Wednesday. WHO'D BENEFIT FROM THE CORPORATE RATE CUT? Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit because they are structured as pass-throughs, an ungainly moniker that derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 percent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 percent, those taxpayers would receive an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But the richest windfalls would flow to the wealthy — lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners. Nearly 75 percent of pass-through income flows to the 10 percent wealthiest taxpayers, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback eliminated state taxes on pass-throughs, which turned out to be a boon for Bill Self, the coach of the University of Kansas' men's basketball team. He had previously set up his own company, according to state media reports. As a result, he paid little state income tax, despite earning nearly $3 million a year. Many people, particularly wealthy Americans, could set up companies and reclassify their paychecks as "business income" and have it taxed at the 15 percent rate, tax experts say. In Kansas the number of pass-through businesses jumped to more than double the level the state expected, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That cost the state revenue without spurring more job creation. Mnuchin said the Treasury would issue rules to prevent wealthy people from capitalizing on the lower rate. But many experts are skeptical. "Good luck with that," said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury official under President Barack Obama. "The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses." HOW ELSE WOULD BIG BUSINESSES BENEFIT? The administration is also proposing to tax only corporate income earned in the United States. This is known as a "territorial" system. It would replace the current worldwide system, under which corporations pay tax on income earned in the U.S. and overseas. Yet companies can avoid the tax if they keep their foreign earnings overseas. That's led many businesses to keep hundreds of billions of dollars outside the United States. Mnuchin said Trump's plan would encourage corporations to return the money to the United States and invest it in plants and equipment. Yet some analysts argue that corporations might instead use the money to pay dividends to shareholders. WHAT ABOUT THE DEFICIT AND GROWTH? The government's budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster economic growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well, he contended. But the Trump team offered no details on which deductions would be dropped — a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries of those deductions. And most economists don't accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would lower government revenue by $2 trillion over 10 years. That would require growth to accelerate nearly a full percentage point, to 2.8 percent a year, from its current level. Yet Cole forecasts that growth would increase only 0.4 percent-percentage point? annually. Other economists say that if the cuts balloon the deficit, the jump in government borrowing would swell interest rates and make it harder for businesses and households to borrow and spend. Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says such a "crowding out" effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy. SO WILL THE ECONOMY BENEFIT AT ALL? Most economists forecast that a modest tax cut package — smaller than Trump's — is far more likely to become law. With the deficit rising by less, a smaller cut could raise growth to 2.5 percent a year, from its roughly 2 percent pace now, Harris said. If Trump's proposals became law, depending on the details, growth could accelerate more quickly, Harris added. But the Federal Reserve would likely counter that with more short-term rate hikes, to forestall rapid inflation. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Kamata Hakensha View More Sort by Oldest Latest Popular 5 Comments Login to comment Northernlife Today 09:01 am JST What a sham... 2 ( +2 / -0 ) fxgai Today 12:49 pm JST how it would be paid for. This is backwards. Tax is what the government takes away from taxpayers. So Government taking less away does not need to be "paid for". The related issue is that, if government continues to spend like crazy, as well as leaving tax payers with their own money to spend, save and invest, the government will rack up debts. How to resolve the problem of financial deficits due to government expenditure exceeding revenues clearly has two components - expenditures as well as revenues. Reducing revenues doesn't mean you need to pay for reducing revenues, it means you need to reduce expenditures. People being able to spend more, and government spending less, is a great combination. People typically spend their own money much better than they spend other people's money. The Trump plan has the revenues side in place here. One warranted criticism is that he has failed to define how he will reduce expenditures. If growth doesn't pick up enough to cover it, then he needs to clarify on this point. most experts suggest that it would add little to growth  These are the same experts that have overseen pathetic levels of economic growth so far this century. It's time to listen to some "alternative experts" now methinks. potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. If person A pay 10K in tax and person B pays 10MM in tax, the maximum tax cut that person A can get is 10K. But giving person A the 10K tax cut obviously results in person B getting a bigger one, since person B pays 10MM in tax, not 10K. It's only possible to cut taxes to the extent that taxes are currently paid in the first place. And it's already the wealthy who pay the most by far. Unless there are two completely different sets of rules for different people, this is the only way it can be. Trump's proposal and its likely impact The predictive stock markets rocketed to all-time highs post Trump's election, on the assumption of such a tax cut being enacted. That's a real impact that is evident to all. (And Trump getting elected was supposed to be a disaster) WHO'D BENEFIT FROM THE CORPORATE RATE CUT? The article neglected to mention one large beneficiary group - everyone. Think people who have a pension plan - the stock market at all-time highs thanks to the tax cut plan (and eventual higher corporate post-tax profits) benefits all of those people, even before one considers the potential boost in business activities and hiring that will come with it. some analysts argue that corporations might instead use the money to pay dividends to shareholders. Shareholders (which includes pension funds) getting bigger dividends is hardly a disaster for the US. Is it better than the capital sits overseas contributing nothing to the US instead? Those dividends are ultimately more money to be re-invested into the economy somehow. And if the US has a better business environment than overseas then the money would be invested there. -1 ( +0 / -1 ) serendipitous1 Today 01:49 pm JST Gee, vital details missing from yet another amazing Trumpian idea.

It is absolutely astonishing. 1 ( +1 / -0 ) Strangerland Today 02:32 pm JST How can Trump supporters continue to blindly believe all the bs they are being fed? It's identity politics. They have tied their identity into his being president, so any criticism of his actions or policies would require them to attack their own identity, and have to admit that they chose the wrong horse. Some people who voted for him are already admitting it was a mistake, but these are generally the people who voted for him, but didn't tie their identity to it. For them, it's easier to leave and criticize, as they don't suffer any infliction to their identity as a result. For the people who tied their identity to the choice of him as a president, they will hold on desperately for a lot longer. 0 ( +0 / -0 ) Strangerland Today 03:44 pm JST Although we always knew it, the Republicans figure what's good for the goose is not good for the gander.

Tax experts said far more details were needed to determine how average Americans would be affected. "The impact on Joe Taxpayer is unknown," said Marc Gerson, vice chair of the tax department of law firm Miller & Chevalier in Washington. "There's not enough specificity. It's hard for taxpayers to determine where they'll come out." Cohn asserted that the plan would cut taxes "especially for low and middle income families." It purports to do so in part by doubling the standard deduction, which is used by taxpayers who don't itemize their tax deductions. At the same time, the Trump plan would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting some of the richest taxpayers. And that's on top of shrinking the corporate tax rate that many affluent individuals could likely capitalize on. ___ WHY CUT CORPORATE TAXES?

President Donald Trump is proposing dramatically reducing the taxes paid by corporations big and small in an overhaul his administration says will spur economic growth and bring jobs and prosperity to the middle class. (Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press) By Christopher S. Rugaber | AP By Christopher S. Rugaber | AP April 26 at 7:51 PM WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s team boasted Wednesday that its tax-cut plan would lighten Americans’ financial burdens, ignite economic growth and vastly simplify tax filing. Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump’s plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don’t pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That’s because Trump would apply the corporate rate to “pass through” businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What’s more, some privately held large companies — including Trump’s own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here’s a closer look at Trump’s proposal and its likely impact: ___ WHO BENEFITS? It’s hard to say because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren’t ready Wednesday to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. Tax experts said far more details were needed to determine how average Americans would be affected. “The impact on Joe Taxpayer is unknown,” said Marc Gerson, vice chair of the tax department of law firm Miller & Chevalier in Washington. “There’s not enough specificity. It’s hard for taxpayers to determine where they’ll come out.” Cohn asserted that the plan would cut taxes “especially for low and middle income families.” It purports to do so in part by doubling the standard deduction, which is used by taxpayers who don’t itemize their tax deductions. At the same time, the Trump plan would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting some of the richest taxpayers. And that’s on top of shrinking the corporate tax rate that many affluent individuals could likely capitalize on. ___ WHY CUT CORPORATE TAXES? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending on equipment — from computers to factories and machinery. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Economic growth has been stuck at about 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 percent, a pace it hasn’t touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among advanced economies. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which both reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. ___ WHO’D BENEFIT FROM THE CORPORATE RATE CUT? Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit because they’re structured as pass-throughs, which derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 percent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 percent, those taxpayers could enjoy an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But the richest windfalls would flow to the wealthy — lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners. Nearly 75 percent of pass-through income flows to the 10 percent wealthiest taxpayers, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “It would tremendously help high earners,” says Brian Thompson, a certified public accountant in Chicago. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback eliminated state taxes on pass-throughs, which turned out to be a boon for Bill Self, the coach of the University of Kansas’ men’s basketball team. He had previously set up his own company, according to state media reports. As a result, he paid little state income tax despite earning nearly $3 million a year. Many people, particularly wealthy Americans, could set up companies and reclassify their paychecks as “business income” and have it taxed at 15 percent, experts say. In Kansas, the number of pass-through businesses jumped to more than double the level the state expected, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That cost the state revenue without spurring more job creation. Mnuchin said the Treasury would issue rules to prevent wealthy people from capitalizing on the lower rate. But many experts are skeptical. “Good luck with that,” said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury official under President Barack Obama. “The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses.” ___ HOW ELSE WOULD BIG BUSINESSES BENEFIT? The administration is also proposing to tax only corporate income earned in the United States. This is known as a “territorial” system. It would replace the current worldwide system, under which corporations pay tax on income earned in the U.S. and overseas. Yet companies can avoid the tax if they keep their foreign earnings overseas. Many businesses have kept hundreds of billions of dollars outside the United States. Mnuchin said Trump’s plan would encourage corporations to return the money to the United States and invest it in plants and equipment. Some analysts counter that corporations might instead use the money to pay dividends to shareholders. ___ WHAT ABOUT THE DEFICIT AND GROWTH? The government’s budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion over 10 years. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well, he contended. But the Trump team offered few details on which deductions would be dropped — a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries of those deductions. And most economists don’t accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would reduce government revenue by $2 trillion over 10 years. That would require growth to accelerate nearly a full percentage point, to 2.8 percent a year, from its current level. Yet Cole forecasts that growth would increase only 0.4 percent annually. Other economists say that if the cuts balloon the deficit, the resulting jump in government borrowing would swell interest rates and make it harder for businesses and households to borrow and spend. Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says such a “crowding out” effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy. ___ SO WILL THE ECONOMY BENEFIT AT ALL? Most economists forecast that a modest tax-cut package — smaller than Trump’s — is far more likely to become law. With the deficit rising by less, a smaller cut could raise growth to 2.5 percent a year, from its roughly 2 percent pace now, Harris said. If Trump’s proposals became law, depending on the details, growth could accelerate more quickly, Harris added. But the Federal Reserve would likely counter such acceleration with more short-term rate hikes, to forestall rapid inflation. And that move, in turn, would likely slow the economy. ___ Joseph Pisani and Paul Harloff in New York contributed to this report. ___ Contact Chris Rugaber on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's team boasted Wednesday that its tax-cut plan would lighten Americans' financial burdens, ignite economic growth and vastly simplify tax filing. Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump's plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don't pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That's because Trump would apply the corporate rate to "pass through" businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What's more, some privately held large companies — including Trump's own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here's a closer look at Trump's proposal and its likely impact: ___ WHO BENEFITS? It's hard to say because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren't ready Wednesday to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. Tax experts said far more details were needed to determine how average Americans would be affected. "The impact on Joe Taxpayer is unknown," said Marc Gerson, vice chair of the tax department of law firm Miller & Chevalier in Washington. "There's not enough specificity. It's hard for taxpayers to determine where they'll come out." Cohn asserted that the plan would cut taxes "especially for low and middle income families." It purports to do so in part by doubling the standard deduction, which is used by taxpayers who don't itemize their tax deductions. At the same time, the Trump plan would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting some of the richest taxpayers. And that's on top of shrinking the corporate tax rate that many affluent individuals could likely capitalize on. ___ WHY CUT CORPORATE TAXES? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending on equipment — from computers to factories and machinery. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Economic growth has been stuck at about 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 percent, a pace it hasn't touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among advanced economies. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which both reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. ___ WHO'D BENEFIT FROM THE CORPORATE RATE CUT? Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit because they're structured as pass-throughs, which derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 percent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 percent, those taxpayers could enjoy an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But the richest windfalls would flow to the wealthy — lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners. Nearly 75 percent of pass-through income flows to the 10 percent wealthiest taxpayers, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "It would tremendously help high earners," says Brian Thompson, a certified public accountant in Chicago. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback eliminated state taxes on pass-throughs, which turned out to be a boon for Bill Self, the coach of the University of Kansas' men's basketball team. He had previously set up his own company, according to state media reports. As a result, he paid little state income tax despite earning nearly $3 million a year. Many people, particularly wealthy Americans, could set up companies and reclassify their paychecks as "business income" and have it taxed at 15 percent, experts say. In Kansas, the number of pass-through businesses jumped to more than double the level the state expected, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That cost the state revenue without spurring more job creation. Mnuchin said the Treasury would issue rules to prevent wealthy people from capitalizing on the lower rate. But many experts are skeptical. "Good luck with that," said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury official under President Barack Obama. "The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses." ___ HOW ELSE WOULD BIG BUSINESSES BENEFIT? The administration is also proposing to tax only corporate income earned in the United States. This is known as a "territorial" system. It would replace the current worldwide system, under which corporations pay tax on income earned in the U.S. and overseas. Yet companies can avoid the tax if they keep their foreign earnings overseas. Many businesses have kept hundreds of billions of dollars outside the United States. Mnuchin said Trump's plan would encourage corporations to return the money to the United States and invest it in plants and equipment. Some analysts counter that corporations might instead use the money to pay dividends to shareholders. ___ WHAT ABOUT THE DEFICIT AND GROWTH? The government's budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion over 10 years. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well, he contended. But the Trump team offered few details on which deductions would be dropped — a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries of those deductions. And most economists don't accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would reduce government revenue by $2 trillion over 10 years. That would require growth to accelerate nearly a full percentage point, to 2.8 percent a year, from its current level. Yet Cole forecasts that growth would increase only 0.4 percent annually. Other economists say that if the cuts balloon the deficit, the resulting jump in government borrowing would swell interest rates and make it harder for businesses and households to borrow and spend. Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says such a "crowding out" effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy. ___ SO WILL THE ECONOMY BENEFIT AT ALL? Most economists forecast that a modest tax-cut package — smaller than Trump's — is far more likely to become law. With the deficit rising by less, a smaller cut could raise growth to 2.5 percent a year, from its roughly 2 percent pace now, Harris said. If Trump's proposals became law, depending on the details, growth could accelerate more quickly, Harris added. But the Federal Reserve would likely counter such acceleration with more short-term rate hikes, to forestall rapid inflation. And that move, in turn, would likely slow the economy. ___ Joseph Pisani and Paul Harloff in New York contributed to this report. ___ Contact Chris Rugaber on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber Copyright 2017 by The Associated Press.

Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says such a “crowding out” effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy. ___ SO WILL THE ECONOMY BENEFIT AT ALL? Most economists forecast that a modest tax-cut package — smaller than Trump’s — is far more likely to become law. With the deficit rising by less, a smaller cut could raise growth to 2.5 percent a year, from its roughly 2 percent pace now, Harris said. If Trump’s proposals became law, depending on the details, growth could accelerate more quickly, Harris added. But the Federal Reserve would likely counter such acceleration with more short-term rate hikes, to forestall rapid inflation. And that move, in turn, would likely slow the economy. ___ Joseph Pisani and Paul Harloff in New York contributed to this report. ___ Contact Chris Rugaber on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber CHRISTOPHER S.

RUGABER April 26, 2017 7:47 pm 7 min read Share WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s team boasted Wednesday that its tax-cut plan would lighten Americans’ financial burdens, ignite economic growth and vastly simplify tax filing. Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump’s plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don’t pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That’s because Trump would apply the corporate rate to “pass through” businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. White House ends hiring freeze, mandates workforce, mission restructuring Advertisement What’s more, some privately held large companies — including Trump’s own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here’s a closer look at Trump’s proposal and its likely impact: ___ WHO BENEFITS? It’s hard to say because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren’t ready Wednesday to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. Tax experts said far more details were needed to determine how average Americans would be affected. What it would take to create real hiring reform “The impact on Joe Taxpayer is unknown,” said Marc Gerson, vice chair of the tax department of law firm Miller & Chevalier in Washington. “There’s not enough specificity. It’s hard for taxpayers to determine where they’ll come out.” Cohn asserted that the plan would cut taxes “especially for low and middle income families.” It purports to do so in part by doubling the standard deduction, which is used by taxpayers who don’t itemize their tax deductions. At the same time, the Trump plan would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting some of the richest taxpayers. And that’s on top of shrinking the corporate tax rate that many affluent individuals could likely capitalize on. ___ WHY CUT CORPORATE TAXES? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending on equipment — from computers to factories and machinery. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Economic growth has been stuck at about 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 percent, a pace it hasn’t touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among advanced economies. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which both reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. ___ WHO’D BENEFIT FROM THE CORPORATE RATE CUT? Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit because they’re structured as pass-throughs, which derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 percent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 percent, those taxpayers could enjoy an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But the richest windfalls would flow to the wealthy — lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners. Nearly 75 percent of pass-through income flows to the 10 percent wealthiest taxpayers, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “It would tremendously help high earners,” says Brian Thompson, a certified public accountant in Chicago. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback eliminated state taxes on pass-throughs, which turned out to be a boon for Bill Self, the coach of the University of Kansas’ men’s basketball team. He had previously set up his own company, according to state media reports. As a result, he paid little state income tax despite earning nearly $3 million a year. Many people, particularly wealthy Americans, could set up companies and reclassify their paychecks as “business income” and have it taxed at 15 percent, experts say. In Kansas, the number of pass-through businesses jumped to more than double the level the state expected, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That cost the state revenue without spurring more job creation. Mnuchin said the Treasury would issue rules to prevent wealthy people from capitalizing on the lower rate. But many experts are skeptical. “Good luck with that,” said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury official under President Barack Obama. “The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses.” ___ HOW ELSE WOULD BIG BUSINESSES BENEFIT? The administration is also proposing to tax only corporate income earned in the United States. This is known as a “territorial” system. It would replace the current worldwide system, under which corporations pay tax on income earned in the U.S. and overseas. Yet companies can avoid the tax if they keep their foreign earnings overseas. Many businesses have kept hundreds of billions of dollars outside the United States. Mnuchin said Trump’s plan would encourage corporations to return the money to the United States and invest it in plants and equipment. Some analysts counter that corporations might instead use the money to pay dividends to shareholders. ___ WHAT ABOUT THE DEFICIT AND GROWTH? The government’s budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion over 10 years. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well, he contended. But the Trump team offered few details on which deductions would be dropped — a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries of those deductions. And most economists don’t accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would reduce government revenue by $2 trillion over 10 years. That would require growth to accelerate nearly a full percentage point, to 2.8 percent a year, from its current level. Yet Cole forecasts that growth would increase only 0.4 percent annually. Other economists say that if the cuts balloon the deficit, the resulting jump in government borrowing would swell interest rates and make it harder for businesses and households to borrow and spend. Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says such a “crowding out” effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy. ___ SO WILL THE ECONOMY BENEFIT AT ALL? Most economists forecast that a modest tax-cut package — smaller than Trump’s — is far more likely to become law. With the deficit rising by less, a smaller cut could raise growth to 2.5 percent a year, from its roughly 2 percent pace now, Harris said. If Trump’s proposals became law, depending on the details, growth could accelerate more quickly, Harris added. But the Federal Reserve would likely counter such acceleration with more short-term rate hikes, to forestall rapid inflation. And that move, in turn, would likely slow the economy. ___ Joseph Pisani and Paul Harloff in New York contributed to this report. ___ Contact Chris Rugaber on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber Related Topics All News Business News Government News Leave A Comment Home » The Associated Press » Government News » Trump tax cut: Huge,… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Today in History 1984: Reagan visits China Fed Photo of the Day Nevada Air National Guard trains with US Forest Service for airborne firefighting Top Stories Your pay and benefits during a government shutdown, explained Top Story 2 days until CR ends: What happens to defense workers if the government shuts down?

By Allan Grody, opinion contributor - 04/26/17 01:40 PM EDT 5   © Getty Images The use of the term "too-big-to-fail" (TBTF) found its way into the lexicon of finance after the global financial crisis of 2007-2009. At its core, the issue of TBTF is whether the financial system can survive the failure of a large, globally-interconnected financial institution. The issue of TBTF continues to be redefined and argued: Which financial institutions should be so identified, and have current regulations resolved the problems of the financial crisis?  The TBTF business model proved faulty, but not because it was wrong to be big, global and diversified. These financial institutions were simply following the lead and servicing needs of their global clients. It proved faulty because the capability for seeing into these financial behemoths was missing. ADVERTISEMENT Regulators needed a blueprint and a plan to fix long overdue data standards, legacy systems, risk-data aggregation issues and infrastructure problems. Without these improvements, TBTF CEOs and their regulators could not — and still cannot — see risk exposures building up in a single TBTF institution nor across multiply interconnected ones.   With these improvements, TBTF institutions and their regulators will be better able to determine and monitor their risk. They can then be rewarded with less capital, not more.  Recently, Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Fed and former head of the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in his Too Big to Fail Speech at the Economic Club of New York said the problem is still with us. The solution? TBTF institutions need more capital. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase writing in his recent chairman and CEO letter to shareholders said the opposite — we have more than enough capital. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, in a speech at the Institute of International Finance’s Washington Policy Summit, said we still have more to do in solving the TBTF problem. Richard Fischer, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, in an interview on CNBC, opined on the usefulness of the Dodd-Frank remedies required of TBTF institutions, like living-wills and bankruptcy resolution plans, that have yet to be tested.  The issue of TBTF has revolved around whether more capital (the equivalent of saving more for a rainy day) will support the systemic impact of another financial crisis. Sadly, as we learned, capital was then and is still now a measure with which to count down to failure. Even with mandates for more capital, higher-quality capital and more-liquid capital, capital will be depleted as before. More capital will buy a bit more time, not the time needed to successfully unwind a TBTF financial institution nor even a modestly-sized, globally-interconnected one. As we learned from the last financial crisis, no amount of capital would have prevented the withdrawal of business from those thought to be "weak" institutions in what amounted to a classic bank-run panic. Regulators knew little of the risks that fast-deteriorating conditions would have on these institutions. Neither did accountants, lawyers, consultants, investment bankers, credit agencies and others who were entrusted with due diligence. Nor did external auditors who signed off on these firms’ books and records.  Why were regulators, who were mandated to oversee these financial institutions, not able to see the risks they were taking? After the financial crisis, it became widely recognized that the computer-coded numbers that underpin risk and transaction-processing systems and that represent the identity of counterparties and financial products (the equivalent of tax and vehicle identification numbers) were not standardized. Many codes existed for the same entity or product, making aggregation and valuation of risk positions in financial products of a single client technically cumbersome and untimely.   In addition, risk data could not be aggregated in any timely manner across the many businesses of global financial companies individually, nor across the many globally-connected financial institutions. Regulators could not see the risk exposure that any one financial institution had within the interconnected global financial system. This inconvenient truth was revealed by what was found in the digitized records of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. Those who looked into the books and records of Lehman — regulators, forensic accountants, bankruptcy lawyers, creditors and counterparties — observed a disparate deluge of data and a huge swamp of risk and no way of aggregating nor valuing what they found. There was no consistency in automated records, neither identifying nor distinguishing Lehman as a trading partner or servicer to other financial institutions. There was no mechanism to aggregate Lehman’s products and businesses into a total view of Lehman’s own risk nor the risk others had with Lehman. It wasn’t just Lehman; it was a fundamental flaw in the infrastructure of the global financial system — no universal, digitized identification of financial market participants; their hierarchies of business ownership; the products they own; the monies they owe; the collateral they had pledged and how that is all aggregated to calculate the risks they are exposed to. Why, after a half-century of automation, were these still best practices? It was primarily due to a culture of performance tied directly to incentive compensation. This drove the self-interests of silo-organized business managers, an organizational structure prevalent in the management of behemoth financial enterprises. This further incentivized front office revenue-generating automation while leaving back- and middle-office processes to languish in underfunded, risk-prone and costly legacy applications. The result was hastily conceived point-in-time unintegrated technology implementations that supported the creation of each business unit’s own business function on its own non-standard data sets. This resulted in inelegant, costly and risk-prone mapping processes for accommodating enterprise-wide aggregated risk measures.  Diverse data sets also existed across the entire global financial supply chain. Trying to aggregate risk across these supply chain participants has also created costly and risk-prone interconnection problems. When we couple the organizational complexity of thousands of legal entities comprising a TBTF financial institution with the underlying complexity of generations of silo-built legacy systems, we can begin to understand the enormity of the task of dismantling global financial conglomerates. Too little is still known about how these giants were assembled and how they interoperate, leading many to ponder how they could be broken up through a living will process. A living will requires the drafter to have a full inventory of assets and liabilities and organizational components. In addition, it must contain an inventory of internal systems and interconnections, as well as external entanglements with all outside facilities operators and infrastructure organizations. Without such a technology blueprint for breaking up these financial behemoths, regulators may inadvertently pull the wrong brick or tug the wrong pipe and topple the whole edifice.  We need something more than additional capital and the living wills that regulators have demanded as a roadmap in order to dismantle a failing TBTF institution. Contemplating the death of a financial institution through a living will should be replaced with a reengineering plan to create risk transparency and allow TBTF financial institutions to survive in perpetuity.   Allan Grody is the president of Financial InterGroup Advisors and an Editorial Board member of the Journal of Risk Management in Financial Institutions.

Fears over geopolitical issues, weakening expectations for earnings and the economy, and doubts on tax reform have all put investors on edge. The CBOE Volatility Index (INDEX:CBOE) VIX volatility index, also known as the “Fear Gauge,” jumped 29% to 15.9 over the first two weeks of April to reach its highest point this year. A total of 527 companies cut their dividend payments at the height of the financial crisis in 2009 and only the most stalwart dividend-payers survived. Even bellwether names like General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Dow Chemical Co (NYSE:DOW), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) cut their payments to investors. Protecting your portfolio from falling stock prices and dividend cuts today means finding companies with sustainable dividends from strong cash flows and a best-of-breed brand. When looking for sustainable dividend stocks, I use four fundamental factors to find the companies with the commitment and cash flow to keep putting money in my pocket. Seeking Sustainable Dividends Against Market Stress First-quarter earnings are slowly starting to come in and the results are a mixed bag. The S&P 500 closed flat last week as investors started to question high valuations. The bears may finally get their market correction if companies can’t beat expectations and provide positive guidance for the rest of the year. On the economic side, Morningstar‘s chief economist Bob Johnson believes the first quarter is set to disappoint and that the rest of the year could face hurdles. Retail sales and industrial production for March were a surprise disappointment and showed the economy may be weakening into the second quarter. The GDP Now estimate of economic growth by the Atlanta Fed started the year at 2.3% before hitting a high of 2.5% in February, but is now estimating growth of just 0.5% for the first quarter. Against the potential for a correction in the stock market or worse, investors need to start thinking about sustainability in the dividend payments for their picks. Finding companies with sustainable dividends comes down to a handful of fundamental factors such as cash flow, debt coverage, the payout ratio, and management’s commitment to the dividend. 10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every Year First, I look for companies with at least three consecutive years of increasing cash flow from operations. Companies can raise cash from financing or by selling long-term investments but that’s not a sustainable source of cash. I want to see strong cash generation directly from the business. Runaway debt can crush a dividend faster than anything, especially in industries where the growth model is to acquire other companies and run up huge long-term liabilities. Watch the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio closely to make sure your dividend-payer is making more than enough money to service its debt obligations. I want to know that management is committed to returning cash to shareholders and there’s no better way to measure this than the 5-year dividend growth rate. On strong economic growth over the last five years, I want to see companies increasing their dividends by 10% or more on an annualized basis. Finally, if a company gets into trouble and income drops significantly, the dividend could be the first to go. Watch for companies that pay out less than half their income in dividends to make sure your dividend picks have a sizeable financial cushion.

Rachel Jacoby ZoldanApr 26, 2017 1:05PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestMario Tama/Getty Images America's largest student loan company, Navient, is officially the most complained about financial company in America, according to new information from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In the past year alone, reports issued about Navient rose a whopping 813% year over year, with complaints specifically spiking in January after the CFPB said it was suing the student loan service for misleading borrowers and bungling students' payments, according to BuzzFeed. What's crazy is that a student loan service (in this case, the artist formerly known as Sallie Mae) had far more complaints than any other financial service including credit reporting companies — like Equifax, Experian, and Transunion — along with major banks like Capital One, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase. You'd think that student loan services would encourage students to learn and aide them with their education, not scare students off from it — or ruin their chances of financial success for getting an education they rightfully deserve. And since Navient oversees about $300 billion in student loans owed by 12 million borrowers, that means there are a lot of unhappy students to which the government is in now in accordance with. Racking up over 1,400 complaints from November to January, the CFPB found some serious grievances with Navient, including the purposeful recommendation for struggling borrowers to make short-term payment solutions, which ultimately resulted in higher payments, rather than programs on an income-based sliding scale over various periods of time. Which entirely defeats the idea of something literally called "student aid." Earlier this month, newly minted Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, ordered the Education Department to roll black a slew of Obama administration efforts organized to streamline Navient and federal student loan options. This, of course, leaves us nervous for the future of not only student loans, but our education as well.

Economy Federal Reserve Capitol Report Economic Report Columns Darrell Delamaide Irwin Kellner Rex Nutting Tools Economic Calendar Real Estate Location Scouts realtor.com My MarketWatch Watchlist Alerts Games Log In Home Industries Investing/Securities A big chunk of the Dow’s gains have come from earnings By Tomi Kilgore Published: Apr 26, 2017 7:13 a.m. ET Share Half the Dow components have reported results, with those stocks contributing about a third of the Dow’s gains littleny / Shutterstock.com Earnings are doing the heavy lifting for the Dow industrials By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor Investors can thank earnings, as much as they can anything else, for the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s rally over the last couple of weeks. The surge this week in the Dow DJIA, -0.10% which posted the first back-to-back 200+-point gains since the two days following the U.S. election, is being attributed by many to the reduced risk of euro dissolution in the wake of French election results and hopes for corporate tax cuts and a budget deal. But there is a lot more to it than that. Since April 13, when J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.19%  kicked off first-quarter earnings reporting season before the market opened, 15 of the Dow’s 30 components have reported results through Tuesday morning, with 11 beating earnings expectations, according to FactSet. That 73% beat rate is above the 5-year average of 68% for S&P 500 index SPX, -0.05%  companies, FactSet said. More important, the shares of the Dow companies that have revealed results have gained a combined total of $20.69 in price since the reports were released through Tuesday, with 10 winners rising a combined $35.87 and five losers falling $15.01. The combined price gains added about 142 points to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index. That would represent about 35% of the Dow’s 404-point gain since earnings season started. Most of those earnings-related gains have come on Tuesday alone. The stocks of the five Dow companies that reported results added a combined 128 points to the Dow’s price, or more than half of the Dow’s 232-point rally. The biggest contributors were shares of Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +0.23% which added 52 points, and McDonald’s Corp. MCD, -0.61% which added about 51 points. Some Dow members scheduled to report earnings later this week include United Technologies Corp. UTX, +1.14% Boeing Co. BA, -0.98%  and Procter & Gamble Co. PG, -2.51%  on Wednesday; Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.13% Intel Corp. INTC, +0.16%  and Pfizer Inc. PFE, +0.27%  on Thursday; and Chevron Corp. CVX, -0.61%  and Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, -0.40%  on Friday. “To maintain current valuations, earnings are becoming more critical in order to validate the expanding [price-to-earnings] multiples,” said Tom Stringfellow, chief investment officer at Frost Investment Advisors, in a note to clients. “Happily we are seeing some positive movements on the earnings front, as estimates produced at the beginning of the quarter are beginning to push higher.” The following shows how the stocks of all the reporting Dow companies have performed since the results were released, and how they affected the Dow’s price (the calculations of price contributions may not add up exactly because of rounding): Company (ticker) Report date Price change since report Affect on Dow’s price J.P.

All but one of 39 economists in a Bloomberg survey predicted the BOJ will leave its stimulus measures unchanged at the two-day gathering. That leaves investors to focus on the quarterly economic outlook, at a time of mixed economic data and elevated tensions between North Korea and the U.S. The BOJ may lower its inflation forecast for the fiscal year that started this month, people familiar with discussions at the central bank told Bloomberg. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. said the central bank will probably upgrade its growth outlook and downgrade its price forecasts. The European Central Bank will conclude its policy meeting hours after the BOJ’s. Any clearer sign of tightening from ECB President Mario Draghi following the first round of voting in the French election could weaken the yen after BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he expects the BOJ to keep policy very accommodative for some time. The BOJ will release its policy statement and outlook report at the end of the meeting, typically between noon and 1 p.m. in Tokyo. Kuroda will hold a press briefing at 3:30 p.m. Outlook Report Kuroda told Bloomberg in an interview last week that the Japanese economy is stronger than expected just a few months ago, increasing the speculation that the BOJ will upgrade its growth projections. Yet inflation hasn’t improved much, he acknowledged. Exports and production have strengthened recently. The central bank currently sees Japan’s economy as continuing a moderate recovery trend, predicting growth of 1.5 percent for this fiscal year. The current BOJ inflation forecast calls for the 2 percent target to be reached somewhere around the fiscal year starting in April 2018, a projection almost all economists see as too optimistic. Nobuyasu Atago, a former BOJ director in the price statistics division, said the central bank could remove the time frame for achieving its price goal at the current meeting to send a signal that they have become more realistic. Kazuo Momma, a former BOJ chief economist, said the price outlook is a very important and the BOJ’s overly ambitious inflation forecast makes it difficult to know what policy makers are really thinking. "Fixing it sooner is better," he said. Bond Purchases Bond traders are tracking a growing divergence between the central bank’s stated target for annual bond holdings and the amount it actually buys, which has been falling. Naomi Muguruma of Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Securities, the one economist to forecast a policy change at this meeting, in the form of a tightening, predicted the BOJ will remove the language on increasing bond holdings at annual pace of about 80 trillion yen ($718 billion) from its policy statement. BNP Paribas SA sees a 50 percent chance the reference to the target will be removed, with buying to slow to 70 trillion yen annually toward the middle of the year. If the target is removed or lowered, investors would likely take it as policy tightening, which would strengthen the yen against the dollar. Kuroda’s Briefing Kuroda is likely to be asked why Japan’s inflation isn’t stronger given the economic recovery is the most stable years. That divergence could make it harder for him to defend his views on the price target. After four years of unprecedented monetary stimulus, inflation has only recently moved out of negative territory and now sits around 0 percent. With the prospect of continued stimulus, some lawmakers are calling the BOJ to explain how it might exit its current policy framework. Kuroda may be pressed to address this question at the media briefing. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The company needs to make its factories more efficient as it girds for a slowing aerospace market. Advertisement Boeing Co.’s sales slumped as jet deliveries fell to the lowest in three years, ahead of the impending debut of a new version of the company’s best-selling plane. Revenue dropped 7.3% to $21 billion in the first quarter, about $200 million less than analysts had estimated. Weak sales overshadowed a surprise gain in free cash flow as the manufacturer kept costs in check and started to reap a long-awaited payoff from the 787 Dreamliner. The report spotlighted Boeing’s need to make its factories more efficient as it girds for a slowing aerospace market. While the Chicago-based manufacturer raised its forecast for 2017 earnings because of improved tax expectations, it didn’t boost the cash outlook -- a crucial number for investors as aircraft orders fade late in a sales cycle that began more than a decade ago. “The stock has been a high flier for a while,” George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said on April 26. “People clearly had high expectations and this was a middling report.” The shares fell 1.2% to $181.23 at 10:09 a.m. in New York, the second-biggest drop among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Boeing rose 18% this year through April 25. Popular Now Five Elements to Include in a Compelling Business Case GE Digital's Secret Weapon The Internet of Things (IoT): Opportunities for Smarter Supply Chains Commercial Margins Boeing had indicated the quarter would be the weakest of the year. Even so, the company posted the lowest profit margin for its commercial jetliner business since the first quarter of 2011 after excluding accounting charges, Seth Seifman, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a note to clients. While Boeing’s earnings were better than analysts predicted, most of the gain was driven by taxes and not operations, he said. The commercial airplane business posted an operating profit of $1.22 billion, an 18% gain from a year earlier, as services sales helped soften the impact from seven fewer jetliner deliveries. Boeing delivered 169 commercial jets, the fewest since the first quarter of 2014, as it began to stockpile 737 Max jets ahead of the initial delivery of the upgraded narrow-body next month. The 8.5% operating margin for the unit was well below the mid-double-digits goal that Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg has set for late decade. “Commercial profits were a little lighter than I would’ve expected,” said Howard Rubel, managing director at Jefferies. The defense business’s profit fell 10 percent to $737 million, as the company’s space business spent to develop satellites and a capsule to haul humans to space. The division’s operating margin rose to 11.3 percent from 10.3 percent. The second-largest U.S. defense contractor is poised to enjoy gains as the U.S. Navy orders F/A-18 Super Hornets to fill a gap created by late deliveries of Lockheed Martin Corp.’s F-35C fighter. New 737 Boeing plans to cut output of the 777, long its second-largest source of profit, for a second time later this year. The 787 Dreamliner should help dull some of the pain and Boeing will also gain as initial deliveries start next month for the 737 Max, the newest member of its most profitable jet family, Ferguson said. Deferred production costs for the 787 fell $316 million to $27 billion from the previous quarter. The balance of deferred costs has started to shrink with each 787 that rolls out of Boeing’s factories. It represents the money the company sank into inventory and manpower after the Dreamliner entered the market three years late following a series of production and supply-chain breakdowns. Boeing has promised a steep improvement in cash and savings from the Dreamliner as it refines the plane’s manufacturing process, builds more higher-margin models like the 787-9 and no longer has to compensate customers for late deliveries. The marquee aircraft, with a frame made of spun carbon-fiber, emerged as a money maker for Boeing last year after a decade of losses. Cash Flow First-quarter free cash flow of $1.63 billion contrasted with the average analyst estimate that the planemaker would consume $137 million during what’s typically the company’s slowest period. Earnings adjusted for pension expenses were $2.01 a share, the company said Wednesday in statement. That compared to the $1.91 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The per-share results also gained a boost from Boeing itself, which has been a major purchaser of its own stock in recent years. The manufacturer acquired 14.9 million shares for $2.5 billion during the quarter. It also paid $868 million in dividends, 30% more than a year ago. For the full year, the company forecast adjusted earnings of $9.20 to $9.40 a share, up from a previous estimate of $9.10 to $9.30, mainly because of a reduction in the expected tax rate. “With something for both bulls and bears to point to in this print, we’d expect shares to struggle to hang on to recent gains in early trading,” Carter Copeland, analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a report on April 26.

This is an upgraded Amazon Store Card specifically for Amazon Prime members. This isn’t exactly an Amazon cash back credit card, because the credit only hits your statement, but it is an interesting option that savvy shoppers will want to pay attention to. With the right budgeting and planning this offers an option for users to save 5% on an iPad, new Android tablet, most Android phones, MacBooks, Windows notebooks and tablets, HDTVs, the PS4, Xbox One, major appliances, DVDs and books to name a few things. Many of these items also qualify for the special Amazon Store Card financing options for 5, 12 or 24 months. What you need to know about the Amazon Store Card for Prime Members. The Amazon Store Card for Prime Members is issued through Synchrony Bank, the same bank that handles the mainAmazon.com Store Card. There are some negative reviews from users who did not understand the payment terms with the special financing options, so make sure you pay attention to the details. Here are seven important details you need to know about the new Amazon Prime Store Card. 5% Back on Amazon Purchases The biggest reason this new Amazon Store Card is a tempting option for Amazon Prime members is that you can score 5% back every day. For comparison the Amazon Rewards Visa only offers 3% back at Amazon, but there is a bigger sign up bonus and you can use the Amazon Rewards Visa by Chase at other stores. Unlike the Chase Freedom card that only offers 5% back on Amazon purchases in the last several months of the year, this works every day. No Interest on Major Purchases for 6, 12 or 24 Months For users who don’t want to get the 5% cash back on a purchase it is possible to use the promotional financing. As long as you pay off the purchase before the 6, 12 or 24 month period there is no interest on the purchase, but if you don’t pay it off on time you need to pay interest on the whole purchase from the date of the purchase. This will stack of the 25.99% interest rate on your card for the last 6, 12 or 24 months. If you use this, it may be best to only make one major purchase at a time. What Qualifies for Special Financing Offers Here’s what you can get special financing on. Amazon offers a handy list of things that qualify for the special Amazon Store Card financing deals. The 24-month special financing offers on Amazon are only good on HDTVs and Autodesk software. The 12-month and 6-month special financing options are valid on any order above $599 or $149 respectively. That means you can add almost anything to your cart to hit this level and use the promotional financing. When you check out you can choose 5% back or the financing offer, but beware that Amazon may set a default for you or set this card to a default payment option as part of the checkout process, so be sure to verify that your payment options are right for the next purchase you make. No Annual Fee, But $99 Amazon Prime Required There is no annual fee for the Amazon Store Card, but that doesn’t mean that it is free to use. You need to be an Amazon Prime member to use this special Amazon Prime Store Card. Amazon Prime is $99 a year and it includes free two day shipping, $3.99 one day shipping options, unlimited access to music, movies and TV shows. Users also get free Amazon Cloud Drive storage with unlimited photo storage and can read free books through the Kindle First and Kindle Owners’ Lending Library. $40 Sign Up Bonus When you apply and are approved for the Amazon Prime Store Card you get a $40 Amazon account credit. This is small compared to some of the other bonus sign up options, but it is almost like getting Amazon Prime for half off for one year. This is on top of the 5% back bonus and financing offers, so you don’t have to choose between this offer and the others — but you only get it once. Only Purchases at Amazon.com The new Amazon Store Card for Prime Members only works at Amazon. The Amazon Store Card and Amazon Prime Store Card are only good for purchases at Amazon. You cannot use this to make purchases at the gas station, McDonald’s and any other store. This is fine as long as you know what you are signing up for and plan to use it accordingly, but if you want one you can use at other locations there are other cards to look at. Compare to Other Credit Cards Before you jump in and sign up for the Amazon Store Card and Amazon Prime Store Card you should look at other options. The Amazon.com Rewards Visa Card offers a $70 sign up option, 3% back at Amazon, 2% back at gas stations, restaurants and drugstores as well as 1% cash back on other purchases. This card also offers drastically lower interest rate options starting at 14.24% — but without any special financing options. There is also a Chase Freedom card that includes 5% cash back on Amazon purchases from October through December only. 11 Responses 04/16/2015 Austin Powers Reply When comparing other cards, your math doesn’t add up Josh. 05/24/2015 Ninja Reply Great article, very informative. Hopefully you’ll be able to answer this question: I applied for this card after being approved for the Amazon Visa. I was denied but I thought that it was because I forgot to add my suffix to my application details, however, I was denied again, for the second time within 5 minutes. So my question is; did they do a hard or soft pull to my credit and did it happen twice? Thanks for your time! 07/29/2015 Francia Reply Is only for USA? 08/04/2015 Hannah Reply I like the 5% but I only use this card for items that I know I won’t have issues with, like dog food. I would never use it to buy electronics or other important items bc using a major cc gives you an extra year warranty so getting an extra 2% isn’t worth losing a free year warranty. 10/30/2015 RJ Reply I have the amazon store card with a very healthy CL and im grateful because i purchase a lot from amazon even though i have the ebay mastercard with a higher CL amazon’s zero interest for 6 months is great. i bought a brand new laptop and as a prime member got it the next day and since it was new i got a one year manf. warranty directly from HP im wondering if i should wait till i pay off the purchase first before switching because im not sure if i will lose the financing for the 5% cash back does anyone know ? 01/15/2016 Bonita J sianis Reply I have been trying to cancel my amazon prime card, I want to keep my amazon.com card. It said on your page that you can cancel at any time. Well I have chatted and called everyone and no one will cancel thisw card. 07/22/2016 Atheena Reply The truth about this card. 1.) They choose what to pay off Randomly. I sent in a larger than normal payment to pay off my non promotional balances (what I owe that is not on payment plans – the base debt). There was plenty left over to pay off my upcoming August thru October promotional balances (each time you order something on a promotion each item incurs a separate promotional plan. IF you buy 4 items each over 149 on one order instead of getting on that is financed for 6 months you get 4 that are each financed for 6 months. This seems harmless and ok find out the *computer pays off your upcoming promotional balances RANDOMLY* This is what the assistant said to me. 2.) IF you ask them to pay it off off in order of sale date they have to file a ticket which will take 2 to 3 statement cycles to show up AND it will not show up on your statement till then. Since your accounts are aging out and you have to pay off the interest in those times which are as stated in item 3 below. YOU have no way to see they actually paid off the items OR if they add the interest you did not pay during these times. 3.) Statements do not show your separate balances. On your statement they DO NOT provide you with simple broken down totals, a.) your non-promotional balance. b.) They do not give you a balance to pay off they next total for upcoming months. They expect you to do the simple math that quote the assistant “Even a human can do it” Sure I can do it… but why???? Why should I have to? There is a level of standards generally accepted in the USA. These have dropped. IF You need this card and stuck getting it… BEWARE the people behind this are people who are doing a very high class SCAM!!! Anyone who tricks you out of money or sets you up to give them more money than is fair is a SCAM. IF I had been able to add a photo I have one of my statement to prove what I have said here. 02/10/2017 Terry Weaver Reply Amazon Prime store card is not for me! I am having statement mailed to me to pay bill! These terms are confusing, as I do not pay bills thru e-mail. How do I cancel AmazonPrime store card? Last digits 7633 I will pay bill when received in mail. Thank You! 02/18/2017 Under cabinet radio.tech Reply It’s awesome to pay a visit this site and reading the views of all colleagues concerning this piece of writing, while I am also zealous of getting familiarity. 03/29/2017 Kay Latona Reply 1. When I read the information about the Amazon.com store card, I see “eligible purchases.” What are they? 2. I think I recall reading, when I signed up, that .eligible purchases were those both “sold by” and “fulfilled by” Amazon.com. Is that the case? 1. What does “fulfilled by” mean? 04/26/2017 Doug Stivers Reply Do the math people. If it says to pay it off in 6 months, figure out what the payments are for 5 months and do it. If it says to pay it off in 12 months, figure out what the payments are for 11 months and do it. I do it this way every time. It’s really not hard to keep track of individual purchases and figure out what the monthly payment should be. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Hackers have been able to steal credit card and personal information from major companies like JPMorgan and Home Depot. As a result, cybersecurity has become more necessary, and instead of developing a dedicated department within a company, most opt to hire a third-party cybersecurity firm. What is interesting here is that many investors think cybersecurity is the next area in technology that needs real consolidation. The April 13 short interest data have been compared with the previous figures, and short interest in most of the selected cybersecurity stocks increased. FireEye Inc. (NASDAQ: FEYE) saw its short interest decrease to 33.75 million shares from the previous reading of 33.94 million. Shares were last seen at $12.66, in a 52-week trading range of $10.35 to $18.73. The short interest at CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ: CYBR) increased to 1.64 million shares from the previous level of 1.44. Shares were trading at $52.76, within a 52-week range of $38.20 to $59.28. Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.’s (NASDAQ: CHKP) short interest decreased to 6.44 million shares from with the previous reading of 6.55 million. Shares were trading at $105.36, in a 52-week range of $74.34 to $105.73. The number of Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE: PANW) shares short rose to 7.58 million, compared with the previous level of 7.04 million. Shares were trading at $110.40, within a 52-week range of $107.31 to $165.69. Fortinet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: FTNT) short interest increased to 6.15 million shares from its previous reading of 5.86 million. Shares were trading at $40.27, in a 52-week trading range of $28.51 to $40.64.

Photographer: Travis Dove/Bloomberg Boeing Co. surprised analysts by generating cash rather than burning it and reporting a first quarter profit that blew past estimates. Neither impressed investors. They focused instead on a disappointing 7.3 percent drop in revenue as the planemaker delivered the fewest jets since 2014. The quality of the earnings was another concern as Boeing’s profit benefited from a low tax rate, even as the commercial airplane business showed signs of strain. The report spotlighted Boeing’s need to make its factories more efficient as the company navigates a difficult aerospace market. While the Chicago-based manufacturer raised its forecast for 2017 earnings because of improved tax expectations, it didn’t boost the cash outlook -- a concern for investors as aircraft orders fade late in a sales cycle that began more than a decade ago. “It’s not a bad report, it’s just not a blockbuster,” George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said Wednesday. “The stock has been rolling and people clearly had high expectations.” The shares dipped 1 percent to $181.71 at the close in New York, the second-biggest drop among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Boeing has advanced 17 percent this year. Commercial Margins Boeing had indicated the quarter would be the weakest of the year. Even so, the company posted the lowest profit margin for its commercial jetliner business since the first quarter of 2011 after excluding accounting charges, Seth Seifman, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a note to clients. While Boeing’s earnings were better than analysts predicted, most of the gain was driven by taxes and not operations, he said. The commercial airplane business posted an operating profit of $1.22 billion, an 18 percent gain from a year earlier, as services sales helped soften the impact from seven fewer jetliner deliveries. Boeing delivered 169 commercial jets as it stockpiled 737 Max jets ahead of the initial delivery of the upgraded narrow-body next month. The 8.5 percent operating margin for the unit was well below the mid-double-digits goal that Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg has set for late decade. The results were dinged by $120 million in costs to prepare the first KC-46 aerial tankers for delivery to the U.S. Air Force early next year, Greg Smith, Boeing’s chief financial officer and chief strategist, told analysts during a conference call. The defense business’s profit fell 10 percent to $737 million, as the company’s space business spent to develop satellites and a capsule to haul humans to space. The division’s operating margin rose to 11.3 percent from 10.3 percent. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Boeing, the world’s largest aerospace company, continues to seek new ways to improve profitability in a highly competitive and uncertain environment, Muilenburg said. The measures include investing in new sources of growth such as the proposed 737 Max 10 jet and a constellation of small satellites. Boeing is also bringing outsourced work back in-house, and closely managing a workforce that has shrunk by more than 27,000 people since the end of 2012. “Some of the tough affordability actions we’ve had to take have been necessary so we can continue to fuel our R&D and our innovation machine for the future,” Muilenburg said. New 737 Boeing plans to cut output of the 777, long its second-largest source of profit, for a second time later this year. The 787 Dreamliner should help dull some of the pain and Boeing will also gain as initial deliveries start next month for the 737 Max, the newest member of its most profitable jet family, Ferguson said. Deferred production costs for the 787 fell $316 million to $27 billion from the previous quarter. The balance shrank by about $8.8 million for each 787 that rolled out of Boeing’s factories in the quarter, said Douglas Harned, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. The deferred costs represents the money the company sank into inventory and manpower after the Dreamliner entered the market three years late following a series of production and supply-chain breakdowns. The marquee aircraft, with a frame made of spun carbon-fiber, emerged as a money maker for Boeing last year after a decade of losses. Boeing has promised a steep improvement in cash and savings from the Dreamliner as it refines the plane’s manufacturing process, builds more higher-margin models like the 787-9 and no longer has to compensate customers for late deliveries. Cash Flow First-quarter free cash flow of $1.63 billion contrasted with the average analyst estimate that the planemaker would consume $137 million during what’s typically the company’s slowest period. Earnings adjusted for pension expenses were $2.01 a share, the company said Wednesday in statement. That compared to the $1.91 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The per-share results also gained a boost from Boeing itself, which has been a major purchaser of its own stock in recent years. The manufacturer acquired 14.9 million shares for $2.5 billion during the quarter. It also paid $868 million in dividends, 30 percent more than a year ago. “We view this as a good start to the year for Boeing, particularly cash flow,” Robert Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, said Wednesday. “Although this year looks to be on track, beyond 2017 we think there remains the usual concerns about potential weakening in the aerospace cycle.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

DESCRIPTION: NEW YORK, April 26, 2017 /3BL Media/– JPMorgan Chase & Co. today released its annual Corporate Responsibility report, highlighting the firm’s model for impact, which combines business and philanthropic resources to drive inclusive economic growth. The report features JPMorgan Chase’s $100 million investment in Detroit’s economic recovery, the firm’s most comprehensive initiative to date, as a proof of concept for how the firm’s model can effectively make a meaningful impact in communities around the world. “The same attributes that drive business success — innovation, ingenuity and the ability to efficiently marshal human and financial capital — also offer tremendous promise to help solve pressing societal challenges,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase. “The private sector has not only a moral obligation but also a deeply vested interest in delivering on this potential for public good. Why? Because businesses flourish when the communities they operate in succeed.” Specifically, the Corporate Responsibility report reviews how the firm has reimagined its approach to corporate responsibility over the past five years. Along with deploying approximately $250 million globally in 2016, JPMorgan Chase is leveraging its worldwide presence, talent and resources to invest in four universal drivers of inclusive economic growth: jobs and skills, small business expansion, neighborhood revitalization and financial health. These initiatives are helping people move up the economic ladder by arming workers with the skills for today’s well-paying jobs; building capital bridges for underserved entrepreneurs; spreading prosperity to neighborhoods outside the urban core; and unlocking financial innovation to help struggling consumers. The firm’s $100 million investment in Detroit aligns with corporate responsibility’s key initiatives and deploys firmwide skills, expertise, data, relationships and resources to make a positive contribution toward the city’s comeback. While helping to revitalize the city, this effort has also yielded lessons that are instructive for how to solve challenges and create economic opportunity in other cities around the globe. “Creating greater economic opportunity must be a responsibility and an imperative for all of us,” said Peter Scher, Chairman of the Greater Washington, DC region and Head of Corporate Responsibility, JPMorgan Chase. “While financial capital is important in helping advance this cause, money alone does not solve complex societal challenges. A critical and deliberate part of our comprehensive strategy is strengthening the underlying organizations and systems that are needed to empower communities to deliver and sustain change.” In addition to Detroit, the report reviews how the firm is putting its corporate responsibility model into action around the world. It features perspectives from notable leaders such as Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, former U.S. Senator Mel Martinez, former President of Entertainment at Telemundo Nely Galan, Beverly Johnson and Lebron James, among others.   The initiatives highlighted in the report are building the capacity of nonprofits in Detroit through the firm’s Detroit Service Corps; using actionable data from the JPMorgan Chase Institute to inform small business efforts in Detroit; preparing the next generation of workers in Denver and New Orleans; bridging the skills gap through data in South Africa; creating greater inclusive growth in East London; expanding capital to underserved small businesses in Texas; creating prosperous neighborhoods in Atlanta, Chicago, Miami and New York; and boosting the financial health of families around the world.

Plus investors were waiting for the first-quarter earnings reporting season to begin. Judging by the most shorted stocks traded on the Nasdaq, short sellers seemed comfortable overall. Moves in those shorted stocks were mostly positive between the March 31 and April 13 settlement dates. AMD saw one of the most notable gains, while short interest in rival Intel shrank marginally. But it was BlackBerry that led the trend, with double-digit percentage growth in the number of shares short in those two weeks. However, it just missed making the top six. Note that still only three Nasdaq stocks had more than 100 million shares short, as of the middle of this month. However, two of them remain very far ahead of the pack. Sirius XM The more than 266.00 million Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: SIRI) shares short by mid-April was more than 1% higher than on the previous settlement date. That was only the second period so far this year in which the number of shares short grew, and it was 17.2% of the total float. At the most recent average daily volume, it would take more than 13 days to cover all short positions. JPMorgan downgraded Sirius, but that was after the short interest period. The stock ended the first two weeks of the month less than 1% lower, while the Nasdaq retreated almost 2% between the settlement dates. After hitting a 52-week high of $5.53 last month, the stock closed om Tuesday at $5.20 a share. The 52-week low of $3.74 was seen last summer. Frontier Communications After pulled back almost 8% in the previous period, the number of shares short in Frontier Communications Corp. (NASDAQ: FTR) rose around 2% to almost 257.30 million as of the most recent settlement date. That was 22.1% of the telecom’s float, as well as the 16th consecutive period with more than 200 million shares short. The daily average volume dropped sharply, and the days to cover jumped from around three to about seven. Concerns about whether Frontier can maintain its dividend have held the stock back recently. The share price was down more than 9% by the middle of this month. The stock has fallen further since then, and it hit a 52-week low of $1.84 last week. The 52-week high of $5.70 was seen about a year ago. The shares closed most recently at $1.96 apiece. AMD By the middle of April, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) had almost 119.42 million shares short. That was a gain of more than 7% from the total on the previous settlement date, and it represented 14.4% of the company’s float. Note that short interest has grown in seven of the past nine periods. And it still would take less than two days to cover all short positions. During the period, Goldman Sachs predicted the stock would underperform, and the April 13 share price was more than 15% lower than on the previous settlement date. The stock has reclaimed some of that ground since and closed at $13.49 on Tuesday, about 19% higher year to date. Shares have changed hands at between $3.18 and $15.55 in the past year. 24/7 Wall St. The 6 Most Shorted NYSE Stocks Pages: 1/2 « The 6 Most Shorted NYSE Stocks Short Interest in Ford Surges 11 Million Shares » Read more: Investing, featured, short interest, Apple Inc.

For Matthew Chamberlain, who was named LME chief executive officer last week, the weapon of choice is less warlike: a discussion paper. The 58-page report, published on Monday, is Chamberlain’s first attempt to address a sharp decline in volumes, the biggest challenge facing the 140-year-old home of global base-metals trading. Matthew Chamberlain Source: LME “Falling volumes are probably the driver for understanding that we have to look at these issues,” Chamberlain said in an interview at the LME’s London office. “Putting out a discussion paper is not as macho as just coming out and saying I’m going to do XYZ. On the other hand, it really forces you to understand how your market operates and articulate your own view.” The move comes after a bruising year of confrontation between the exchange and its core community, and the departure of previous CEO Garry Jones, who resigned in January. The brokers, banks and traders who are the LME’s main users have complained that the exchange’s move to increase trading fees in 2015 helped cause the decline in volumes. LME volumes fell 7.7 percent across all contracts in 2016, while average daily trading in copper at CME Group Inc. jumped 27 percent. Trading also moved to over-the-counter market, with banks and brokers such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Marex Spectron Group Ltd. building popular OTC platforms to serve members frustrated by rising LME costs. "Most people just want the exchange to regain its prominence,” said Simon Van Den Born, global head of metals at Marex Spectron in London. Chamberlain’s discussion paper contains few policy prescriptions, but makes clear that the LME, bought by Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. for $2.2 billion in 2012, isn’t prepared to stand by while its market share is whittled away by competitors. The LME’s paper outlines options for transitioning away from three-month forward contracts – a relic from the 1800s when ships needed three months to haul copper from Chile to the U.K. – to a more standardized contract. Most other commodity exchanges, including CME and the Shanghai bourse, offer futures with settlement on a set day each month, a structure generally preferred by financial investors. Calculating an implied price for a set date – the third Wednesday of each month – would be the option that “causes the least disruption to those who want to remain with the traditional model,” Chamberlain said. It would require a “non-trivial investment” in the millions of dollars by the LME, he added. The paper took aim at the OTC market, which boomed after the LME increased fees. It outlined plans to cut fees on so-called “carry trades,” a strategy used by traders to move positions from one date to another, as part of an effort to increase overall volumes. It also responded to proposals – most notably by financial technology firm Autilla Inc., which partnered with former LME CEO Martin Abbott – to set up competing exchanges to capture OTC metals trades. “Our prices in our view are our intellectual property,” Chamberlain said. “We wouldn’t expect to see competing platforms using those prices without a business relationship with us.” While Chamberlain insists that parent HKEx has “not set any thresholds or trigger points,” the discussion paper hints at stronger action. If the consultative approach fails and it’s apparent that the LME’s current structure is “giving rise to a material loss of business to competitor venues or the OTC market,” it will prepare a contingency plan, the report said. The exchange expects to publish results of the paper in autumn. Michael Overlander, CEO of Sucden Financial Ltd., a LME broker, said some trading activity that had migrated away would be hard to recover, but welcomed the exchange’s move. “Maybe the barn door has well and truly been left open, but I still think there are a few animals left in the stables,” he said.

Real estate developers in Chicago have launched an artists-in-residence contest that will grant the winner one year of free rent in exchange for teaching and design services at its apartment buildings, according to Mansion Global. These are among today’s must reads from around the commercial real estate industry. Elaine Misonzhnik, Diana Bell | Apr 14, 2017   NAIOP report: Commercial real estate supported 6 million U.S. jobs last year “How important is the commercial real estate industry to the U.S. economy? How about 6 million jobs and more than $800 billion worth of importance? The NAIOP Research Foundation recently published its annual study on the economic impact of the commercial real estate business. Researchers found that the development, construction and ongoing operations of new commercial real estate in the United States supported 6.25 million jobs and contributed $861 billion to the U.S. GDP last year. Those numbers are impressive, but they’re not surprising considering the busy year commercial real estate developers had in 2016. According to the NAIOP report, developers built 410 million square feet of office, retail, warehouse and industrial buildings last year. These buildings have the capacity to house 1 million new workers with a total estimated payroll of $57.6 billion. ‘The importance of commercial development to the U.S. economy is well established, and the industry’s growth is critical to creating new jobs, improving infrastructure, and creating places to work, shop and play,’ said Thomas Bisacquino, NAIOP president and chief executive officer, in a written statement.” (REJournals) Real-Estate Developers Offer Artists Free Rent to Up Cool Quotient “In February, Magellan Development Group in Chicago announced artist-in-residence contests at two new rental buildings, the SoBro in Nashville and Exhibit on Superior in Chicago. The SoBro is close to downtown in a city known for live music, while Exhibit is located in River North, a neighborhood famous for galleries. The contests, advertised on flyers in coffee shops and bars as well as through local music schools, asked musicians to upload one-minute videos by late March in Chicago and by early April in Nashville. About 30 musicians applied to each contest; the developers will select three to six semifinalists. Later this month, each building will host a live contest a la “America’s Got Talent” where residents will vote for whom they want to become their “artist in residence.” The winner will get a year of free rent in either a studio or small one bedroom, valued at roughly $1,850 a month at the SoBro and $2,200 a month at the Exhibit. Future Magellan buildings might include chefs, painters, sculptors or personal trainers, who, like the SoBro and Exhibit winners, will be required to perform and offer classes or services to residents, said Jim Losik, national marketing director for Magellan. New buildings typically have vacancies in the first year, so the amenity is essentially free for the developer, Mr. Losik said.” (Mansion Global) Jamie Dimon says fixing mortgage industry would boost lending by $300 billion a year “J.P. Morgan Chase on Thursday reported earnings and revenue that beat expectations, with trading and investment banking revenues contributing the most during the quarter. But the company’s CEO used his annual letter to push for a different business line, one which has fizzled in recent years. “It is no surprise the financial crisis, which was caused in part by poor mortgage lending practices and which caused so much pain for American families and businesses, led to new regulations and enhanced supervision,” Jamie Dimon wrote. ‘We needed to create a safer and better functioning mortgage industry. However, our housing sector has been unusually slow to recover, and that may be partly due to restrictions in mortgage credit.’ Dimon then devoted about 1,400 words to a discussion about the regulations put in place since the subprime crisis. An overly onerous regulatory burden, he argued, has reduced mortgage lending by about $300 billion annually — or the equivalent of about 3 million home loans since the crisis.” (MarketWatch) Lessons on empire-building from real estate developer Rick Caruso “Billionaire real estate developer Rick Caruso learned about entrepreneurship and money at an early age. His father, Henry Caruso, founded Dollar Rent A Car in 1966, building it up into one of the largest U.S. car rental companies while teaching his family some important finance lessons that stuck. ‘Even though we never grew up feeling poor, we always grew up with a great sense of the importance of money and hard work,’ Caruso said. His privately held company, Caruso Affiliated, owns some of the highest-grossing retail centers in the world. Caruso, 58, has also been an active civic leader and philanthropist in Los Angeles, where he grew up and is based. He is a former president of the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners and was a commissioner on the Department of Water and Power.” (Reuters) The Long View: Can logistics deliver? “Commercial real estate investment may be heading for a downturn in 2017, but there is one exception: logistic warehouse properties. “It’s hard not to be enthusiastic about logistics,” the Blackstone Group’s real estate head Jonathan Gray said at a conference last week. Blackstone is one of the suitors vying for the $13 billion warehouse real estate investment trust Global Logistic Properties, competing with private equity firm Warburg Pincus and several Chinese institutions. On Monday, Chinese conglomerate HNA Holdings offered $1 billion for the Singapore logistics firm CWT Group. Meanwhile, by the end of 2016, the average sales price per square foot for New Jersey industrial properties (which are heavily made up of logistics facilities) rose to $71.67, the highest level since 2009, according to CBRE. In other words: we are dealing with a logistics investment boom.” (The Real Deal) Real-Estate Developers Offer Artists Free Rent to Up Cool Quotient “In February, Magellan Development Group in Chicago announced artist-in-residence contests at two new rental buildings, the SoBro in Nashville and Exhibit on Superior in Chicago.

The contests, advertised on flyers in coffee shops and bars as well as through local music schools, asked musicians to upload one-minute videos by late March in Chicago and by early April in Nashville. About 30 musicians applied to each contest; the developers will select three to six semifinalists. Later this month, each building will host a live contest a la “America’s Got Talent” where residents will vote for whom they want to become their “artist in residence.” The winner will get a year of free rent in either a studio or small one bedroom, valued at roughly $1,850 a month at the SoBro and $2,200 a month at the Exhibit. Future Magellan buildings might include chefs, painters, sculptors or personal trainers, who, like the SoBro and Exhibit winners, will be required to perform and offer classes or services to residents, said Jim Losik, national marketing director for Magellan. New buildings typically have vacancies in the first year, so the amenity is essentially free for the developer, Mr. Losik said.” (Mansion Global) New housing developments are urbanizing Long Island “When Brooklynites David and Natalie Resto move into their new two-bedroom townhouse this month, they’ll have spiffy extras — like a swimming pool with a sun deck — minutes away by foot. They’ll also be able to walk to public transportation and a CrossFit gym. Believe it: The Restos are moving to the ’burbs. Their just-purchased two-story home is part of Country Pointe Huntington, a multi-family development on Long Island’s North Shore located about an hour’s drive from their Brooklyn rental. The couple was primarily lured by better pricing, quieter surroundings and the fact that — like when you’re renting in the city — pretty much everything is taken care of.” (New York Post) Newly designed co-living apartments in D.C. bring sophistication to group housing “You might expect 25-year-olds in Washington to live with multiple roommates to afford to live in this high-cost city. But the visual of millennials hanging out in a crumbling group house on a stained couch leaking its stuffing is about to be shattered. Newly designed co-living apartments bring sophistication and privacy to the group living experience. For example, instead of a moldy bathroom used by decades of transient residents, each roommate at the Oslo in Shaw in Northwest has a private bathroom with a sleek glass-enclosed shower and a private bedroom with a walk-in closet. “When we saw that this place is brand-new and we could each have our own bedroom and bathroom, we grabbed it, especially since it was the last available apartment here,” says Garrett Lance, who has lived at the Oslo with his roommates James Arnold, Justin Griffis and Andrew Krentz for two years. All are 25.” (Washington Post) Wanhua Picks Louisiana for $1.1B Manufacturing Facility “Wanhua Chemical Group will develop a $1.12 billion chemical-manufacturing complex in Louisiana, with the selection of a specific site to occur later this year, the company announced Monday. The plant is intended to produce methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). Immediate access to supplies of natural gas and other feedstocks, and deepwater transportation via the Mississippi River, were among the factors that drew Wanhua to Louisiana. “Wanhua Chemical carefully executed its long-term MDI strategy and selected Louisiana as the best place in the world for its investment in this fast-growing category of chemicals,” Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Don Pierson said in a prepared statement. The Wanhua project reportedly will be the second-largest direct investment in Louisiana by a Chinese company, after a $1.85 billion methanol complex under development by Yuhuang Chemical in St. James Parish.” (Commercial Property Executive) Denver industrial real estate market “very competitive” for tenants displaced by upcoming development “Businesses occupying about 2 million square feet of industrial real estate in Denver are going to be displaced as a result of the widening of Interstate 70, the $1.1 billion National Western Center project and ongoing gentrification in and around the River North Art District, a CBRE broker said Wednesday. And those businesses are finding themselves at the mercy of an increasingly competitive market in their search to find a new home: Asking lease rates for industrial space, already near record highs, continued to climb across the metro area in the first quarter of 2017, the 28th consecutive quarter of positive leasing activity in the market, according to a report from the commercial real estate firm CBRE.” (Denver Post)   0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

By Caroline Simon 04/26/17 12:58am Penn students rarely bat an eye when they see clusters of their suit-clad peers rushing off to Huntsman Hall, clutching leather-bound folders. On this campus, companies like McKinsey & Company and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are household names. Career Services emails, campus flyers and advertisements in The Daily Pennsylvanian are populated by prestigious banks and consulting firms. It is commonly understood that Penn students, more than their peers at similar institutions, flock to careers in finance and consulting after graduation. Nearly half of 2016 Penn graduates who took full-time jobs worked in those two industries, with 25 percent in finance and 17 percent in consulting. Meanwhile, only a quarter of 2016 Harvard University graduates entered these two industries — 14 percent accepted full-time offers in “financial services,” while another 11 percent went into consulting. Yale University, Princeton University and Cornell University each had a little over a quarter of their 2016 graduates accept full-time offers in the two sectors. While large paychecks — which can often climb into six digits and beyond — are enticing aspects of finance and consulting, they are not all that draw Penn students to join these industries. Often, there is something else at play: prestige. “You have seen the pyramid narrow as you moved along. You went to high school, you did well in high school, you got into a very competitive, selective university, you’ve done well here,” Patricia Rose, director of Career Services said. “Do you want to become a tool and die maker in Illinois? That might be a terrific opportunity, but you probably want to go to an employer that has made it known that they are prestigious and selective.” Top-ranked investment banks and consulting firms are known for accepting large classes of recent college graduates from each year. In 2016, Goldman Sachs hired 29 new employees from Penn, Boston Consulting Group hired 28, JPMorgan Chase hired 26 and Deloitte hired 23. All of these companies ranked among the top 10 employers for Penn students last year. Top Employers Create your own infographics Over time, technology companies have also joined the ranks of firms known for hiring large numbers of Penn students — Google hired 28 of the 2016 graduates last year. While tech has ballooned in prominence, Rose said investment banking has also grown more popular over the last few decades, and consulting is always a popular option as well. The camaraderie fostered by large numbers of young, elite people working side by side is something that Penn students actively seek in their first jobs, Rose explained. “Students at Penn like to be with folks like themselves, and by that, I mean other students who are part of a curated group,” she said. “They’re really smart, [and] they’ve been selected.” It’s not just Penn students seeking the companies — the companies seek Penn students by coming to campus and establishing their presence in the recruiting process. Having companies on campus appeals to Penn students, Rose said, because they don’t have to reach out to employers themselves and they can often secure offers early in the year. “Students are very busy,” Rose said. “And if you have people available on campus and you’re getting emails saying, ‘Come meet with us,’ you’ll check it out.” Wharton senior Mario Del Cueto, who serves as an advisor to younger Wharton students, acknowledged the prominence of investment banking and consulting in the Wharton community, in particular. “Part of the reason why these are so well-known is because those are the things that get repeated again in club meetings and even in the classroom,” he said. Careers in finance, he said, are easy for Wharton students to imagine because their finance courses often involve working on the same kinds of models, for example, that they would work on in a potential summer internship. “That correlation is easier to draw,” he said. Alexandra Michel, a Graduate School of Education professor who received a doctorate from the Wharton School and used to work at Goldman Sachs, sees the decision to enter a prestigious, high-paying job after college as the obvious next step after what is often an elite upbringing. Average Salary Create your own infographics “There is a whole life experience that predisposes children to be more successful, and get into these more successful schools, and get drawn into careers that feel like their childhood and feel like the elite trajectory that they have been on throughout their childhood,” Michel said. Many students sign job offers at investment banks or consulting firms with the implicit understanding that they will only work there for two or three years before moving on to another job or a graduate degree. Rose said the short-term commitment appeals to Penn students, many of whom may plan on switching jobs or going back to school in their twenties. “If you had a company who came to this campus as they do to, say, big Midwestern state universities, and they say, ‘You can come to work for us at Caterpillar Tractor and you can make a career here.’ Well, who wants to think about 30, 40 years at one place?” Rose said. “Not our students.” But these prestigious jobs come at a price. Many companies require their analysts to work over 100 hours a week and be constantly available, a lifestyle Michel sees as a major health risk. “There’s this disconnect between these elite individuals who have everything that society can offer, and who are pampered by their firms, but who, nevertheless, are working under really difficult conditions,” Michel said. “And society has zero empathy for that.” Michel cited a list of issues that can arise from overworking, ranging from cardiovascular disease to depression to relationship problems. Recently, the dangers of these jobs have been illuminated by a string of tragedies. In 2015, Sarvshreshth Gupta, a first-year analyst at Goldman Sachs who was also a 2014 Penn graduate, died by suicide. Two years before that, a 21-year-old investment banking intern at Bank of America Merrill Lynch died after having an epileptic seizure in the shower following 72 straight hours of work without sleep. Though investment banking and consulting dominate Penn students’ perceptions of commonly chosen careers, Wharton advisors said they actively try to make sure the students they advise are aware of other options. Wharton senior and advisor Anushree Gupta, said her organization, Wharton Women, tries to make sure members are aware of options to work for other industries. “We really tried to broaden the spectrum of industries people were exposed to and make sure they didn’t just hear about banking and consulting,” she said. “We tried to make sure that no one felt pressured, and didn’t feel like the only thing that was talked about were those two industries.” All comments eligible for publication in Daily Pennsylvanian, Inc. publications.

Wall Street banks typically pay much less than the official 35 percent corporate tax rate. And yet after attacking Hillary Clinton for her ties to Wall Street, President Donald Trump is pushing reforms that would make it even easier for big banks to rig the tax rules and skip out on paying their fair share. Nine of the largest and most profitable U.S. banks paid an average federal tax rate of only 18.6 percent between 2008 and 2015, according to a new paper co-published by the Institute for Policy Studies and several tax and Wall Street reform groups. By using various loopholes, these banks avoided paying about $80 billion that could’ve gone towards urgent public needs, like fixing our crumbling infrastructure and expanding pre-K programs. Under Trump’s plan, tax-dodging banks would pay even less. The official rate would drop to 15 percent, and they’d still benefit from loopholes that would let them pay even lower rates. One of the biggest loopholes allows U.S. banks and other large corporations to use “creative accounting” to shift profits earned in the United States to foreign nations with low or no corporate taxes. Corporations still owe U.S. taxes on these profits, but they can put off paying them indefinitely. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just send Uncle Sam an IOU every year? Tax-dodging game Financial firms are particularly good at this offshore tax-dodging game. The six largest U.S. banks (Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo) have set up more than 2,300 subsidiaries in tax havens like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. In 2016, they were holding nearly $150 billion in profits offshore. Trump’s tax plan would slash the rate on those offshore profits to just 10 percent, saving the banks an estimated $25 billion. When these tax discounts on offshore profits have been tried in the past, they didn’t help bring back U.S. jobs. Instead of doling out new tax breaks to Wall Street, lawmakers should be working to make sure these profitable firms pay their fair share. After all, these are the guys who drove our economy off a cliff with their recklessness and greed in 2008. After the crash, taxpayers put them on a path back to profitability with massive bailouts. Where is all that money going today? While much of the country continues to struggle with widespread unemployment, losing their homes, and skinny budgets, Wall Street’s high profits are once again driving sky-high pay for executives. One practical way to generate much-needed revenue from Wall Street would be through a tax on short-term speculation. Working families pay sales taxes when they buy essentials like gas and shoes. But when Wall Street traders buy millions of dollars in stocks or derivatives and sell them a split second later, they don’t pay any tax at all. A tiny fee at rates of a few pennies per $100 of trading of stocks, bonds, and derivatives would raise massive revenue while discouraging the short-term speculation that produces no real economic value and makes markets less stable. Lawmakers should also consider using tax policy to discourage banks from taking on dangerous levels of debt. Reckless, excessive borrowing among so-called “too big to fail” banks was one of the key causes of the financial crisis. A small tax on big bank liabilities could raise significant money while preventing future bailouts.

After a three-hour annual meeting replete with shareholder outbursts and one unscheduled break to remove an angry investor, the San Francisco company announced voting tallies that showed the toll of the aggressive sales practices last fall that cost Wells Fargo $185 million in fines. Most striking, the bank's nonexecutive chairman, Stephen Sanger, garnered only 56% of shareholders' support, far below the 95% or more that most directors usually get with little fanfare. The head of the bank's risk committee, Enrique Hernandez, fared even worse, getting a 53% vote. In all, nine directors got votes of less than 75%. None of the board's longer-serving directors could muster more than 80% of the vote. "The outcome is a wake-up call that directors at U.S. companies may no longer glide through a crisis without taking individual hits in reputation," said Stephen Davis, associate director of Harvard Law School's Programs on Corporate Governance and Institutional Investors. "Institutional investors are staffing up for regular, tougher scrutiny of directors." Mr. Sanger, a former General Mills chief executive who spearheaded the board's response to last year's fake-account scandal, said Tuesday that shareholders "sent the entire board a clear message of dissatisfaction." Even so, neither Wells Fargo nor the board said there would be any immediate changes in the wake of the vote. Instead, Mr. Sanger reiterated what the bank has told some large shareholders privately: that six directors will step down from the board within the next four years when they hit the mandatory retirement age of 72 years old. Mr. Sanger, who turned 71 this month, added that the board is "urgently looking" to add new talent beyond the two directors who joined the board in February. Those two directors, along with CEO Timothy Sloan, who joined the board last year, received 99% majorities from shareholders on Tuesday. Bank investors have increasingly sent tough messages through the ballot box. In 2015, Bank of America Corp. Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan survived a vote that would have stripped him of one of those two roles at the Charlotte, N.C., bank. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Chairman and CEO James Dimon survived a similar vote after the "London whale" trading loss, but two of the New York bank's directors left the board after they garnered vote tallies of less than 60% in 2013. In 2012, Citigroup Inc. shareholders rejected a board-approved compensation plan for its senior executives, including CEO Vikram Pandit, who left later that year. In 2009, Bank of America shareholders voted to split the chairman and CEO positions in a narrow vote that essentially stripped Kenneth Lewis of his duties as chairman. He left the bank a few months later. For Wells Fargo, while the unanimous re-election of directors is a relief for the bank the fact that a majority of directors received less than three-quarters support suggests that Wells Fargo's board may face continuing pressure to make more changes. The breadth and scale of shareholders' limited support, especially with no alternative board candidates, is "very rare," said Sandeep Dahiya, an associate professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. Over the past 10 years, only 22 directors a year, on average, out of nearly 40,000 directors at S&P 500 companies received less than 60% of the vote for re-election, according to ISS Analytics, the data arm of proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. Focus on the board election built earlier this month, when ISS recommended that shareholders vote against re-electing 12 Wells Fargo directors who served while the sales practice issues occurred. Some large shareholders thought the board was slow to react to the sales-practices problems, though they have cited improvements in the board's response more recently. Though Wells Fargo's board has been active over the past several months in seeking shareholder feedback, issuing detailed results of an independent investigation over the sales practices and clawing back about $183 million in pay from executives, Mr. Dahiya said more actions may be necessary. He said in the coming months it is possible some board members may voluntarily depart as typically the more dissatisfied shareholders are, the more likely directors are to leave. The bank and board declined to comment beyond an earlier press release Tuesday. Tensions flared at the bank's meeting, held at a golf resort's conference center in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Among the roughly 300 shareholders attending, four shareholders spoke out of turn, yelling at the board or management to voice complaints. The first shareholder outburst prompted Mr. Sanger to halt the meeting for several minutes while the investor was removed from the room. The investor, Bruce Marks, a housing advocate and activist, had requested that each director speak to what they knew about the sales-practice issues, which resulted in about 5,300 employees being fired over a five-year period. When Messrs. Sloan and Sanger told Mr. Marks he was out of order, Mr. Marks responded that "Wells Fargo has been out of order for years." The meeting restarted a few minutes later, with Mr. Sanger saying Mr. Marks had been removed. Before Mr. Sanger read the vote tallies at the end of the meeting, former and current bank employees and customers came to a microphone, sometimes fighting back tears. Some discussed health problems and stress they say were brought about by the bank's aggressive sales culture. Others recalled decisions by the bank to foreclose their home. Mr. Sloan in most of these cases directed the speakers to follow up with Wells Fargo officials after the meeting. One former employee apologized to customers for the bank's aggressive sales tactics, and said that they were why she left the company. Mr. Sloan, in response, asked her to "consider coming back," adding that the bank has rehired more than 1,000 employees who had left because they didn't feel comfortable with the sales practices. A bank spokesman said most of those rehires, since September, are within the retail banking unit but declined to comment further. Still, "investors want change," said New York City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer, whose office oversees New York City's pension funds and voted against 10 Wells Fargo directors. "These wrongs need to be made right."

Reuters/Siu Chiu By Sumeet Chatterjee and Donny Kwok HONG KONG, April 24 (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc has been formally mandated as an adviser on the initial public offering of Saudi Arabia's national oil giant Aramco , expected to be the world's largest ever IPO, HSBC's chief executive said on Monday. Europe's biggest bank joins peers including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley on the deal, which is expected to raise some $100 billion and is the centrepiece of the Saudi government's ambitious strategy to diversify away from oil. HSBC's Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver announced the bank's appointment on the deal at a shareholders' meeting in Hong Kong, confirming a Reuters report in February that the bank was close to being mandated on the hottest investment banking ticket in the world. Gulliver also said HSBC is confident it can maintain dividend payouts in the foreseeable future and expects to exceed risk-weighted asset and cost-saving targets. Advertisement Despite earnings pressure, HSBC has retained its dividend payout ratio at a higher level in the last few years, at a time when some of its peers, including Standard Chartered , withheld dividend payments for 2016. The bank may have to move "some thousand roles" from Britain to Paris depending on how the country's Brexit negotiations with the European Union unfold, chairman Douglas Flint added, reiterating the bank's previous estimates of staff moves. HSBC last month named AIA Group boss Mark Tucker as the new chairman of its board, replacing veteran Flint, whose departure will end one of the longest-serving management partnerships at a major global bank. CEO Gulliver is also due to leave in 2018, and one of the main tasks facing Tucker immediately after taking over the new role in October will be selecting a new chief executive for Europe's biggest bank.

The brokerage noted that it has taken a neutral outlook on the stocks of Macau-based gaming operators. A report from JP Morgan analysts DS Kim and Sean Zhuang states that the “positive surprise in the gross gaming revenue could stall soon as the cyclical tailwind from last year’s China macro drop waning or even rolling over.” The country’s macro drop included liquidity easing, property rally and commodity price hikes amongst other factors. “As the sector runs out of positive catalysts, we think investors will focus more on the individual operator’s execution and resulting earnings revision potential, making stock calls increasingly more important,” the team noted. On a report issued on Friday, banking group Morgan Stanley noted that this year’s second-quarter results might be a good entry point for investors interested in a long-term position in Macau gaming stocks.  “Macau has underperformed the Hang Seng Index in every second quarter since 2012 – except for 2013 – and we believe the same could happen in the second quarter of 2017,” wrote analysts Praveen Choudhary, Alex Poon and Thomas Allen, referring to the main index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, as cited in a GGRAsia report. According to the group, they are expecting a “high valuation, a seasonally weak quarter, and a peak in China’s PPI [producer price index] to be near-term risks, adding, “in the medium term, we remain constructive thanks to infrastructure.” Wells Fargo Securities LLC analysts Cameron McKnight and Robert Shore said in a Sunday memo on Macau, and referring to mainland China economic policy: “VIP growth is roaring back on the heels of last year’s economic stimulus – but we think this could stall once the effect of the stimulus and the Chinese housing bubble wears off – as it did in 2013-14.” Furthermore, credit debt watcher Fitch Ratings raised its forecast on Macau’s VIP and mass market 2017 growth to 12 percent.

Analysing the bank’s Q4 results, it said that the numbers were ahead of its estimates and the asset quality was positive. The global research firm said that the bank’s Q4 earnings were ahead of estimates and the asset quality was positive. The guidance on cost by the lender also implied peaking of pressures. Apart from these, other positives, according to Citi, included growth acceleration, CASA and fee gains. Going forward, it expects the bank’s returns to normalize with its credit costs. Reiterating its buy call on the stock with a target of Rs 600 from Rs 549, Bank of America Merrill Lynch termed its Q4 results as a positive surprise and saw better outlook ahead. It has raised earnings estimates by over 2 percent for FY18 to factor in lower credit costs. The global financial firm also forecast earnings growth of 72 percent and 56 percent for FY18 and FY19. Elaborating on the bank’s financials, BofAML said that it had delivered stronger topline owing partly due to interest reversals. On the asset quality front, it highlighted management commentary to extinguish watchlist of bad loans in FY18. A cement account upgrade or downgrade has resulted in standard asset provision of Rs 400 crore, it said. CLSA expected a stability in earnings from FY18 onwards and believed that better results should drive better return on equity (RoE). With that in mind, the brokerage firm retained an outperform rating with an increase in target price to Rs 570 from Rs 550. Moreover, the normalisation in slippages was a positive and this would lead to easing of credit costs and NPLs from FY18, CLSA said. Deutsche Bank has retained a hold rating on the stock with an increase in target to Rs 540 from Rs 520. It expected overall net interest margins (NIMs) to moderate and saw growth remaining soft at over 12 percent. The research firm also cut FY17 earnings per share by 10 percent and 9 percent for FY18-19 and expects 10 percent and 12 percent FY18 and FY19 return on equity (RoE). The key upside risk to the stock lies in strong recoveries, while higher than expected slippages remain a key downside risk. Nomura has retained a buy rating on the stock with an unchanged target price of Rs 550. Dissecting the bank’s Q4 performance, it said that the net profit was broadly in line with estimates, while net interest income beat was driven by one-offs. It said that the credit cost band was higher than the expectation of 185 basis points. Simultaneously, the March quarter performance has set a base for margin and credit costs going forward and believes that higher credit costs in FY18 should be transitory. JPMorgan remains overweight on the stock with an increased target price of Rs 570 from Rs 550 as it saw value in the stock as well as turn in tide on earnings and asset quality. The bank’s net profit was in line with the estimates, but provisions were a surprise due to lumpy hits, it said. The global brokerage firm also cut estimates by 18 percent and 10 percent for FY17 and FY18. This cut in earnings is driven by negative guidance of the management on margin and credit cost. It has assumed slippage of Rs 15,400 crore, which broadly equals non-NPL outstanding. Kotak Securities has downgraded the stock from reduce to add and reduced target price to Rs 525 as the it termed the Q4 as another weak quarter due to high provisioning for bad loans. Gross NPLs for the bank were stable, but slippages from watchlist remained high, it added. The brokerage firm also sees RoEs to be subdued for the current fiscal, while a decline of over 40 bps is expected in margin yields over medium term. The loan growth was expected to be above 13-14 percent CAGR in FY18-20. IDFC Securities sees downside risks to EPS for FY18 if the management’s comments are considered on loan growth. The brokerage firm built in higher loan growth of 18 percent going by the traction in Q4. It has also cut earnings estimates for FY18 to factor in lower margins along with lower loan growth forecast to 18 percent. L&TCredit Suisse has reiterated an outperform rating on the stock with a target of Rs 1,850. The research firm believes that the recent flurry of orders has boosted the company’s confidence. Moreover, private sector clients see L&T as a reliable partner in terms of quality and delivery. The key risks to the stock are margin erosion on delays and absence of investment cycle. tags #(L&T #Axis Bank #Stocks Views Related news Business Buy HDIL, JSW Energy, IDFC Bank: CA Rudramurthy BV Apr 27, 2017 12:28 PM Business Buy YES Bank, Apollo Hospitals, Indian Bank: Ashwani Gujral Apr 27, 2017 12:22 PM Business Buy SRF, Can Fin Homes, PVR; expect Rs 1000 in Tata Sponge: Ashwani Gujral Apr 27, 2017 12:01 PM Business Buy Apollo Hospitals, JSW Energy, Reliance Capital: Mitessh Thakkar Apr 27, 2017 11:53 AM Business Buy Balkrishna Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharat Forge: Rajat Bose Apr 27, 2017 11:48 AM Business Buy UPL, Tata Chemicals, TVS Motor Company: Manoj Murlidharan Apr 27, 2017 11:10 AM Business Buy Kotak Mahindra Bank, Allcargo Logistics, Tata Motors, HUL: Sudarshan Sukhani Apr 27, 2017 10:41 AM Business Buy BEML, Motherson Sumi Systems; short United Spirits, Ajanta Pharma: Sukhani Apr 27, 2017 10:35 AM Business Axis Bank Q4: Worst of NPA woes behind, but take-off could be a few quarters away Apr 27, 2017 10:03 AM News Most Popular Top News Stay with winners! 100 stocks which rose to lifetime high in April gave up to 127% return Hindustan Zinc posts 42% rise in Q4 profit at Rs 3,057 cr, margin expands 940 bps Vijay Mallya gifted $40 million to his children, funnelled Rs 3200 crore overseas: ED’s dossier EC to get 30,000 new VVPAT machines by July for Guj, HP polls Market Live: Sensex holds 30000 amid consolidation; Midcap outperforms; ITC drags Don’t mess with the bulls! 75 stocks hit lifetime highs along with Sensex & Nifty Axis Bank Q4: Worst of NPA woes behind, but take-off could be a few quarters away Delhi MCD Election Results 2017: BJP sweeps all 3 corporations - as it happened see more Video of the day Cautious on market for near term, but growth should improve in 2-3 years: BofAML's Sanjay Mookim Portfolio Markets Watchlist Live TV Show Currencies Commodities Fixed Income Personal Finance Mutual Fund Stock Market India IPO Global Market Budget 2017 BSE Sensex Forum News Business Markets Stocks Economy Mutual Funds Personal Finance IPO Startups Stocks: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | Others Mutual Funds: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z Visit the App Store to see all our apps: Tools Retirement Planning EMI Calculator SIP Calculator SIP Planner Useful Links Budget 2016 Live Sensex Public Sector Banks Best Portfolio Manager Small Savings Schemes Bonds Specials Master Your Money Game Changers Travelcafe SME Special Investment Watch PowerYourTrade MoneyBhai Focus Grow My Money GE Step Ahead SME Step Up Feedback & Info feedback@moneycontrol.com About us | Contact Us | Feedback | Disclaimer | Privacy Statement | Terms of Use | Careers | Financial Terms (Glossary) | Sitemap | RSS Feed Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Monika Donimirska Global Trade Finance Market to Grow at a CAGR Of 3.29% Over The Period by 2019 About Trade Finance, Trade finance is provided by banks to various trading companies for cross-border transactions. It drives the growth of a country’s GDP. When a country produces goods or services, it exports some of those goods and services to other countries. However, there is a time lag between the production and delivery time, which leads to a certain degree of uncertainty about whether the parties involved will honour their part of the transaction. Hence, the importing country appoints a bank to issue a financial instrument that promises to make the payment to the exporting country upon the successful delivery of the consignment.

Here's what we know from the document: Bigger cut for middle class The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren't ready to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. According to the new document, households would be able to avoid taxes on their first $25,200 in income for a married couple (the figure for individual taxpayers would be half that), but on top of that, there could be additional exemptions depending on the size of the household. Trump wants to eliminate all individual tax deductions except for those that relate to mortgage interest and charitable giving. Those are two of the most popular provisions. However, these could become unnecessary to most taxpayers because of the much higher standard deduction. A bigger tax cut for the rich The plan would reduce the top rate on individual income tax — now 39.6 percent for income over $472,000 for a married couple — to 35 percent. Trump would repeal the estate tax, which is levied on the inheritances of the wealthy. The richest 10 percent of taxpayers are projected to pay 90 percent of estate taxes this year, said the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Trump would also repeal a 3.8 percent fee that applies to investment income over $250,000 for a couple as part of President Barack Obama's health care reforms, essentially cutting the top federal capital gains rate to 20 percent. Most economists believe that reducing the rate on corporate income to 15 percent would mainly benefit those who own stock in those corporations, who tend to be richer. The Tax Policy Center forecast that 51 percent of the benefits from that plan would eventually accrue to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers. The plan would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which makes it harder for very rich individuals to game the system and pay less tax. But it can be an aggravating tax for the well-to-do. (It cost Trump an additional $31 million in federal income taxes in 2005.) A boon for businesses The plan would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, a boon to most companies. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, JPMorgan said. Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit because they're structured as pass-throughs, which derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 percent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 percent, those taxpayers could enjoy an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners might be able to pay that 15 percent rate on their earnings instead of an individual income rate. People who already receive their income through investment vehicles wouldn't have to change anything for a windfall. Nearly 75 percent of pass-through income flows to the 10 percent wealthiest taxpayers, said the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. What about deficit, growth? The government's budget deficit could explode under the plan, economists said. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion over 10 years. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well, he said. But most economists don't accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would reduce government revenue by $2 trillion over 10 years. Other economists said that if the cuts balloon the deficit, the resulting jump in government borrowing would swell interest rates and make it harder for businesses and households to borrow and spend. Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said that such a "crowding out" effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy. news services View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(AMZN) Stock on Top View All Posts Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) delivered a strong earnings report April 18 with revenues, net income, noninterest income, and book value per share all up impressively year over year. CEO Brian Moynihan was singing the bank’s praises in its press release accompanying earnings. And yet … BAC stock is up less than 4% in the days since. If Bank of America is making all the right moves, why aren’t investors more excited about its results? Heck, BofA shares gained more from the French election news (along with the rest of the banks) than from its home-run earnings. This is especially baffling given that many think BAC stock is still undervalued versus its peers despite a nearly 60% gain over the past year. What gives? BAC Stock Is Undervalued (But Does It Matter)? “Despite the huge run in BAC stock, it still looks cheap compared to other too-big-too-fail American banks. At this point, excluding one-off costs, BAC is trading at a 15x price-to-earnings ratio, compared to a 21x peer median across the industry,” InvestorPlace contributor Ian Bezek wrote recently. “Perhaps more impressively, the bank is at 1.2x tangible book value, compared to 1.6x for U.S. banks as a whole and almost 2x for the largest capitalization ones in the United States.” OK. Let’s assume that Bezek is spot-on. You could buy BAC stock and still capture some gains over the next six to 12 months. However, I wouldn’t recommend it be your only bank stock given there are better proxies for the U.S. banking industry, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). Not to mention the bull market is in its ninth year — a feat accomplished only one other time between October 1990 and March 2000. Do you remember how that one ended? Not well. If you want to buy BAC stock, don’t. Buy these two stocks instead. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) Bezek’s argument for buying BAC stock includes the fact Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett is likely to exercise the company’s warrant to buy 700 million shares of BAC stock for $5 billion ($7.14 per share). The option came with his 2011 preferred share investment of $5 billion. Interestingly, while Buffett is up on Bank of America, he seems down on Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) selling as many as 9.1 million shares of the beleaguered bank. Berkshire Hathaway is a great stock. It offers diversification, large amounts of cash, a strong track record of performance and a partnership with 3G Capital that could turn out to be Buffett’s best move yet when all is said and done. Buying BAC stock indirectly in this manner is the wiser course of action at this point in the bull market. Discretion is the better part of valor. A Bank-Related ETF With Berkshire Hathaway, you cover off your desire to own BAC stock. It’s possible, however, that you are also bullish on banks in general. If that’s the case, it makes sense also to buy an ETF that owns Bank of America as well as other financial institutions. Which one should you buy? I’d factor in three things: BofA’s weighting (high as possible), expense ratio (low as possible), and the number of holdings in ETF (few as possible to avoid diworsification); listed in order of importance. That makes this choice an easy one. I’d go with the PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio (NASDAQ:KBWB). It’s five years old, has $808 million in net assets, charges 0.35% annually, owns just 24 stocks, and most importantly, a BAC weighting of 8.02% — the fund’s third-largest holding behind JPM and Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C). Bottom Line  There’s a lot to like about BAC, but I believe you’re smarter to follow this two-pronged approach to owning its stock at this stage of the game than going it alone. Always protect your capital. This achieves that and then some. As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Investors also questioned that the proposal was feasible. “The plan that has been announced today is very aggressive, and unlikely to pass as is,” Alan Gayle, a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, told Bloomberg. “I haven’t heard of anyone on the street that has been adjusting earnings estimates based on the likelihood we’ll get tax reform. This remains an unknown and it’s not being factored into the market yet.” In 2.32pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17 percent, as did the Nasdaq Composite Index. In 2.18pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.22 percent. Earlier in the day, the Nasdaq touched a record high 6,040.90 The Dow rose as gains in shares of Verizon and those of United Technologies, recently up 1.8 percent and 1.4 percent respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of Boeing, down 2 percent and 1.1. percent respectively. United Technologies posted quarterly results that surpassed expectations, while Procter & Gamble and Boeing each failed to meet the mark with their latest earnings. PepsiCo shares fell, trading 0.5 percent weaker as of 1.34pm in New York, amid concern about the company's margins even as it posted earnings that beat analysts' expectations. “We achieved solid revenue growth in the first quarter underpinned by global volume growth and positive net price realisation, despite challenging food and beverage industry trading conditions in North America and continued volatility in a number of developing and emerging markets,” PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi said in a statement. Even so, gross margin contracted 45 basis points in the first quarter, the company said. “The quality of the quarter was disappointing,” Andrea Teixeira, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said in a research note, Bloomberg reported. “Organic revenue, gross margin and operating margin all came in weaker than we anticipated.” Meanwhile, Canadian and Mexican stocks slid after Politico reported that the Trump administration is considering an executive order on withdrawing the US from NAFTA. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso also declined. A draft order has been submitted for the final stages of review and could be unveiled late this week or early next week, Politico reported, citing two White House officials. The effort, which still could change in the coming days as more officials weigh in, would indicate the administration’s intent to withdraw from the sweeping pact by triggering the timeline set forth in the deal, according to Politico. "It is a clear indication that they [in the White House] are wanting changes but we will have to see what emerges," Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, told Reuters. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.5 percent increase from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index advanced 0.1 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.2 percent, as did France’s CAC40 Index.

Investors also questioned that the proposal was feasible. “The plan that has been announced today is very aggressive, and unlikely to pass as is,” Alan Gayle, a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, told Bloomberg. “I haven’t heard of anyone on the street that has been adjusting earnings estimates based on the likelihood we’ll get tax reform. This remains an unknown and it’s not being factored into the market yet.” In 2.32pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17 percent, as did the Nasdaq Composite Index. In 2.18pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.22 percent. Earlier in the day, the Nasdaq touched a record high 6,040.90 The Dow rose as gains in shares of Verizon and those of United Technologies, recently up 1.8 percent and 1.4 percent respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of Boeing, down 2 percent and 1.1. percent respectively. United Technologies posted quarterly results that surpassed expectations, while Procter & Gamble and Boeing each failed to meet the mark with their latest earnings. PepsiCo shares fell, trading 0.5 percent weaker as of 1.34pm in New York, amid concern about the company’s margins even as it posted earnings that beat analysts’ expectations. “We achieved solid revenue growth in the first quarter underpinned by global volume growth and positive net price realisation, despite challenging food and beverage industry trading conditions in North America and continued volatility in a number of developing and emerging markets,” PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi said in a statement. Even so, gross margin contracted 45 basis points in the first quarter, the company said. “The quality of the quarter was disappointing,” Andrea Teixeira, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said in a research note, Bloomberg reported. “Organic revenue, gross margin and operating margin all came in weaker than we anticipated.” Meanwhile, Canadian and Mexican stocks slid after Politico reported that the Trump administration is considering an executive order on withdrawing the US from NAFTA. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso also declined. A draft order has been submitted for the final stages of review and could be unveiled late this week or early next week, Politico reported, citing two White House officials. The effort, which still could change in the coming days as more officials weigh in, would indicate the administration’s intent to withdraw from the sweeping pact by triggering the timeline set forth in the deal, according to Politico. “It is a clear indication that they [in the White House] are wanting changes but we will have to see what emerges,” Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, told Reuters. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.5 percent increase from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index advanced 0.1 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.2 percent, as did France’s CAC40 Index.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman What Do Mutual Fund Chiefs At Gathering See: Doom Or Revival? Shutterstock photo This year’s mutual fund industry conference has a lot on its plate as presenters and attendees grapple with an investor rush to lower-cost products and the tectonic shift that’s caused in asset management. Mutual fund portfolio managers, fund directors, compliance officers, industry operations specialists, lawyers, vendors and service providers from around the world will hash out the issues at the 59th annual General Membership Meeting ( GMM ) of the Investment Company Institute ( ICI ), happening May 3-5 at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel in Washington, D.C. ICI President and CEO Paul Schott Stevens expects this year’s attendance to hit 1,300. James McNamara, president and CEO of Goldman Sachs Mutual Funds and this year’s GMM chair, will deliver opening remarks. Retired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, co-founder of the McChrystal Group, is scheduled to talk with Stevens about leadership and public policy priorities during a Wednesday session. Jeff Immelt, CEO of General Electric ( GE ), is slated to talk with Stevens about such issues as transformative technology in today’s economy. The industry bubbles with competition between active and passive funds, between mutual funds and ETFs , with many fund complexes operating all types of funds. Stevens says the GMM is neutral ground where all approaches are welcome. „We don’t pick and choose winners,” Stevens said in advance of the gathering. „It’s the market and investors who do that. And many public policy issues are the same for both types of funds.” Shundrawn Thomas, executive vice president and head of the funds and managed accounts group at Northern Trust Management, is due to moderate a panel titled „Facing the Future: Fresh Perspectives.” Panel members will discuss priorities and concerns of the asset management industry. Scheduled panelists are Thomas Jones, head of strategic relations, intermediary distribution at Columbia Threadneedle Investments; Heather Lord, senior vice president, head of strategy and innovation for Capital Group; and Sean Tuffy, senior vice president, investment services at Brown Brothers Harriman. Before the conference, Thomas told IBD that he expects to ask panelists how fund firms – both mutual funds and ETFs – are dealing with the price compression brought on by the rise of ETFs. „If you are a provider of predominantly actively managed mutual funds, what does that mean?” he asked. „Does it mean you have to expand your business model to offer more passive solutions? Or operate more efficiently and offer what you already do at a lower price?” Asked whether smaller firms, especially those that offer few, if any, passive mutual funds and ETFs, are in danger of being driven out of the marketplace, Thomas said, „There will continue to be organizations, even if they are boutique-like, that deliver active (funds) well. Firms like that can continue to have success and even thrive against firms (whose products) have a less-clear focus and less-effective execution. „To me,” he continued, „it’s about how much value you offer to clients, and how effectively you communicate with them. If you are middling in terms of ability to offer value and demonstrate it, I think those firms regardless of size will struggle in the foreseeable future.” Stuart Parker, president of Prudential Financial ‚s ( PRU ) PGIM Investments, is scheduled to be moderator of „The Future of Investment Advice” panel, whose participants will discuss trends that could affect the delivery of investment advice. The panelist lineup is Eli Broverman, president and co-founder of robo-advisory firm Betterment; Kelly Coffey, CEO of J.P. Morgan Private Bank; and Ben Huneke, managing director and head of investment solutions at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Parker told IBD before the conference that, among many topics, he hopes to orchestrate a discussion of how his panelists’ firms expect to use robo-advisors as well as active and passive strategies to address their clients’ varied but sometimes overlapping needs. „We’re looking to understand the whole convergence between technology-based and human advice,” Parker said. „I’m expecting to hear that there are more similarities than differences (among their market) segments in their strategies for providing advice to clients.” Technically, the GMM consists of four conferences. In addition to the general membership meeting, the ICI’s operations and technology conference will convene. So will the mutual fund compliance program conference and the independent directors council’s fund directors workshop. The GMM offers representatives of the mutual fund and ETF industry a chance to discuss current trends and issues affecting money managers. The three-day program includes panel discussions. It also features speeches, featuring industry leaders, business strategists, authors and political commentators. In total, the conference will consist of 33 panels and sessions, featuring 80 speakers.

(SMIC) on Wednesday unveiled a leadership revamp that entrusts the group’s future growth to professional managers. SMIC announced on Wednesday the appointment of its longtime chief finance officer Jose Sio as the new chair, taking over the post long held by 93-year-old patriarch Henry Sy Sr. who founded the group in 1958. The conglomerate created the new position of chair emeritus for the patriarch. ADVERTISEMENT The group also announced the appointment of Frederic DyBuncio as new SMIC president, taking over the post held by Harley Sy who will remain as executive director of the SMIC board. Sy’s eldest children, Teresita Sy-Coson and Henry Sy Jr., will remain as vice chairs of the conglomerate. In an interview after SMIC’s stockholders meeting, Sy-Coson said Sio had been with the group for a long time,  knew the conglomerate very well and was in a good position to take over the post vacated by her  father. Phenomenal growth Cora Guidote, SMIC investor relations chief, told a press briefing that Sio was “highly instrumental in supporting the phenomenal growth of SM and its subsidiaries. He instilled strict financial discipline across all businesses that later helped the company achieve optimal results even as the whole group maintained a sound and stable financial position.” Sio said the appointments were an indication that the Sy family was keen on professionalizing the organization in preparation for the future. He added that the group was also preparing the third-generation Sys for leadership positions. With this leadership transition, Sio said “the mandate from the Sy family was to make it (SMIC) grow, increase shareholder value and be happy.” Henry Sy Sr., who attended the stockholders meeting with wife Felicidad, was also given a special citation and a standing ovation during the meeting. ADVERTISEMENT Sio was executive vice president and chief finance officer of SMIC for a long time. He holds a master’s degree in business administration from New York University, is a certified public accountant and  former senior partner at Sycip Gorres Velayo & Co. before joining the SM group in 1990. He was voted CFO of the Year in 2009 by the Financial Executives of the Philippines. He was also awarded as best CFO (Philippines) in various years by several Hong Kong-based business publications. A wealth of experience DyBuncio brings with him a wealth of experience in banking where he spent over 20 years with JP Morgan Chase and its predecessor companies. He was assigned to various places such as New York, Seoul, Bangkok and Hong Kong and held various executive positions where he gained substantial professional experience in the areas of credit, relationship management and origination, investment banking, capital markets and general management. Sio said SMIC would likely post a single-digit growth in net profit this year.  Last year, the conglomerate eked out P31.2 billion in net profit, up by 8.1 percent from the previous year. DyBuncio said that while property, banking and retailing would continue to be the core businesses of SMIC, the group would continue to look at other opportunities that complement other parts of the group. Sio said energy and infrastructure businesses would be among the new businesses that the group would look at. Sio said SMIC would look at growth opportunities beyond the Philippines and China where SMIC has property businesses, but noted that every new venture would be studied carefully given the volatile geopolitical conditions in the United States under President Donald Trump as well as tensions in the Korean peninsula.

Print Story X Print Story Business April 26, 2017 Share Advertisement Briefs   SECP’s VOSS portal gets functional By our correspondent ISLAMABAD: The modified Virtual One-Stop Shop (VOSS) portal for integrated company and tax registration with the Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) has become functional, a statement said on Tuesday. The SECP assumed the ownership of the VOSS project in September 2016, and 446 companies registered under eServices were allotted national tax numbers between March 6, 2017 and April 4, 2017, on the basis of data provided by the SECP to FBR through VOSS. The VOSS is aimed at reducing the turnaround time for business start-ups, facilitating investors, and enhancing coordination of activities among the regulatory authorities by enabling mutual sharing of information through a unified web portal. The project was launched on the basis of recommendations made in the World Bank Starting a Business Report, which highlighted the need for a unified registration process for major government agencies in Pakistan. Earlier, after facing various technical issues in the VOSS software, the SECP modified the VOSS portal for resolution of the issues, and developed the web-services for utilisation by FBR and EOBI in November 2016.   Emirates awarded News Desk KARACHI: Emirates’ focus on meeting and exceeding customer expectations both in the air and on the ground were recognised with four accolades at the          Business Traveller Middle East 2017 Awards, a statement said on Tuesday. At a ceremony attended by key travel industry executives, Emirates was crowned “Best Airline Worldwide”. It was also named “Airline with the Best First Class”, “Airline with the Best First Class Lounge” and “Best Frequent Flyer Programme”, it added. Adel Al Redha, Emirates’ Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, said: “Our customers are at the heart of our brand. In every step of the customer’s journey, we thoroughly and regularly examine the product to achieve a high level of customer care.”   UnionPay, Summit Bank sign deal By our correspondent KARACHI: UnionPay International has signed an agreement with the Summit Bank to issue payment cards in an effort to support the trade, economic cooperation and personnel exchanges between China and Pakistan, a statement said on Tuesday. “With the implementation of the Belt and Road Strategy and the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, UnionPay has made remarkable progress in Pakistan,” UnionPay International CEO said at the agreement signing ceremony. Through this cooperation with UnionPay International, the Summit Bank will change more than half of its cards in circulation into UnionPay chip cards, and will also issue new cards on a large scale, it added. The cards to be issued are all global payment cards that can be used in UnionPay’s global network while support online payment, it said.   Citi gets licence to operate in S Arabia DUBAI: Citigroup has obtained a licence to conduct capital markets business in Saudi Arabia, a move that will allow the U.S. bank to return to the kingdom to offer banking services after an absence of almost 13 years. The business, which will be branded Citigroup Saudi Arabia, will provide a full range of investment banking services including debt and equity capital markets operations, according to a Citi statement. The licence comes as the Gulf country seeks to diversify its funding resources away from oil revenues under its National Transformation Plan. "Saudi Arabia has embarked on a profound economic transformation journey and we are excited and committed to contributing to this endeavour," said Jim Cowles, Citi’s CEO for Europe Middle East and AfricaCiti, which had formally applied for a licence, is not the only international bank seeking to expand in Saudi Arabia. Global lenders such as Credit Suisse are also exploring the possibility of obtaining banking licences as a number of investment opportunities open up in the kingdom. The most notable is the government´s plan to list up to 5 percent of oil giant Saudi Aramco in an initial public share offering that could raise as much as $100 billion. Citi exited Saudi Arabia in 2004, when it sold a 20 percent stake in Samba Financial Group. In 2015, it obtained permission from the Saudi regulator to invest directly in the country´s stock market. On April 17, the bank appointed Carmen Haddad as head of the bank´s Saudi Arabia business, with the mandate to lead the bank´s strategy and business development in the kingdom. There are over a dozen licensed foreign bank branches in Saudi Arabia, including Deutsche Bank , BNP Paribas , JPMorgan Chase and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, according to the Saudi central bank´s website.         Novartis Q1 profit slips ZURICH: Novartis´s first-quarter core net income fell 4 percent, it said on Tuesday, as the Swiss drugmaker´s spending to kick start sales at its eyecare unit Alcon and for its heart failure drug Entresto weighed on earnings. Core net income fell to $2.69 billion, Novartis said, beating the $2.67 billion average estimate of analysts in a Reuters poll. Sales fell 1 percent to $11.54 billion, compared to the $11.6 billion average estimate in the poll. The company confirmed its 2017 outlook, with core operating income expected to be broadly in line with last year or to decline at a low-single-digit rate. Chief Executive Joe Jimenez has called 2017 another transition year for the Basel-based drugmaker as it spends on Alcon to arrest a sales slump and on slow-starting Entresto, while absorbing falling revenue from its patent-expired cancer drug Gleevec.   Toshiba to start taking bids in June TOKYO: Japan´s Toshiba Corp will start taking bids for Landis+Gyr, its Swiss smart meter unit, as early as June, Kyodo news agency reported on Tuesday. Hitachi Ltd and other Japanese firms are seen as possible bidders for the unit, Kyodo said, without citing sources. Reuters last month reported that Toshiba had hired UBS to explore a sale or an initial public offering of the business, potentially valued at over $2 billion. Toshiba is targeting buyout groups such as Carlyle, Cinven, Advent, Blackstone, Bain, Onex , Triton, CD&R and even former owner KKR, a person close to the matter said. A Toshiba spokesman did not have an immediate comment on the report.   S Korea GDP growth to bounce sharply SEOUL: South Korea´s economic growth likely accelerated at a sharper pace in the first three months of the year than the previous quarter as exports and capital investment tracked a recovery in the global economy. The local economy is expected to have expanded by a median 0.7 percent over January-March in seasonally adjusted terms from the previous quarter, according to a Reuters poll. On a yearly basis, respondents predicted a median 2.6 percent rise. While North Korean provocations, a diplomatic spat with China and ongoing corporate restructuring present downside risks to the economy, a new president, to be elected May 9, is likely to boost government spending, which should be supportive of growth this year.

Photo / Getty Images Wall Street gave up some of its earlier gains after the US administration's unveiling of tax cut plans fell short on details. Investors also questioned that the proposal was feasible. "The plan that has been announced today is very aggressive, and unlikely to pass as is," Alan Gayle, a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, told Bloomberg. "I haven't heard of anyone on the street that has been adjusting earnings estimates based on the likelihood we'll get tax reform. This remains an unknown and it's not being factored into the market yet." In 2.32pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17 per cent, as did the Nasdaq Composite Index. In 2.18pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index increased 0.22 per cent. Earlier in the day, the Nasdaq touched a record high 6,040.90. The Dow rose as gains in shares of Verizon and those of United Technologies, recently up 1.8 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of Boeing, down 2 per cent and 1.1per cent respectively. United Technologies posted quarterly results that surpassed expectations, while Procter & Gamble and Boeing each failed to meet the mark with their latest earnings. PepsiCo shares fell, trading 0.5 per cent weaker as of 1.34pm in New York, amid concern about the company's margins even as it posted earnings that beat analysts' expectations. "We achieved solid revenue growth in the first quarter underpinned by global volume growth and positive net price realisation, despite challenging food and beverage industry trading conditions in North America and continued volatility in a number of developing and emerging markets," PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi said in a statement. Even so, gross margin contracted 45 basis points in the first quarter, the company said. "The quality of the quarter was disappointing," Andrea Teixeira, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said in a research note, Bloomberg reported. "Organic revenue, gross margin and operating margin all came in weaker than we anticipated." Meanwhile, Canadian and Mexican stocks slid after Politico reported that the Trump administration is considering an executive order on withdrawing the US from NAFTA. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso also declined. A draft order has been submitted for the final stages of review and could be unveiled late this week or early next week, Politico reported, citing two White House officials. The effort, which still could change in the coming days as more officials weigh in, would indicate the administration's intent to withdraw from the sweeping pact by triggering the timeline set forth in the deal, according to Politico. "It is a clear indication that they [in the White House] are wanting changes but we will have to see what emerges," Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, told Reuters. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.5 per cent increase from the previous close.

Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Name * Email * Website seven  +   =  fourteen There's a major discrepancy over the value of Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company, and that could have a big effect on the Saudi Aramco IPO price. Since Saudi Aramco first announced it was preparing for an IPO in January 2016, the company and other analysts have valued it at over $2 trillion dollars. Even if the Saudi Aramco IPO only offers 5% of the company to the public, the $100 billion value would still be the biggest IPO of all time. But this week (April 25), officials are questioning the accuracy of the massive Saudi Aramco valuation. In fact, Saudi officials now say the $2 trillion Aramco IPO valuation could be off by more than $500 billion. That's even after Saudi Arabia slashed the tax rate for Aramco from 85% to 50% to make it more attractive for investors. $500 billion is a staggering miscalculation. And it's another sign the Aramco IPO has a long way to go before the public will be buying any of its shares. We won't know the exact Saudi Aramco IPO price per share until the company is completely ready to go public. But the company's massive valuation continues to keep investors' attention, and it's also one of the main reasons investors should be cautious about the Aramco IPO… What Will the Saudi Aramco IPO Price Be? The biggest IPO of all time was China-based Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA) in 2014. BABA's market capitalization hit $25 billion at the time of its IPO. At a valuation of $2 trillion, Saudi Aramco's IPO of 5% could be worth $100 billion, four times the size of Alibaba's. Even if Saudi officials are correct that the company is only worth $1.5 trillion, a 5% stake will still triple Alibaba's record. And Aramco's size wouldn't just be impressive for an IPO, its potential $1.5 trillion market cap could be so large it towers over established competitors. The combined market cap of its Big Oil rivals like BP Plc. (NYSE ADR: BP), Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX), Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (NYSE ADR: RDS.A), and Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) right now is just $887.97 billion. Trending Now: Tar Sands in Canada Are on the Verge of an Explosive Comeback The staggering numbers for the Saudi Aramco IPO will dominate headlines, but the reason the company is potentially worth so much is its unrivaled access to oil. As the national oil company of Saudi Arabia, Aramco controls all of the country's oil reserves. That means Aramco has 267 billion barrels of oil, or 20% of the entire world's oil reserves, under its control. Big Oil companies like Exxon and Shell might be huge, integrated oil companies, but they have to compete with every other company for access to oil reserves in places like the United States and Canada. This simply isn't a problem for Aramco. But while the company's unique setup makes it so valuable, it also makes the Saudi Arabian oil company's IPO a complicated process. And it's something prospective investors need to pay careful attention to… Where Will Saudi Aramco Stock Be Listed? The current design of Aramco is creating a lot of hurdles for the company ahead of its IPO, and the stock exchange the company lists on will have a big impact on its value. Aramco is still deciding which stock exchange to sell its shares on, but the company isn't in a rush to decide. The Aramco IPO date was originally set for 2018, but it's now being pushed back to 2019. And that's still tentative. But the company is making progress. Just Released: These "Second Salary" Plays Could Make You and Your Grandkids Rich The Saudi Aramco IPO advisor was chosen in February when the company announced a boutique investment bank, Moelis & Co. (NYSE: MC), would handle the IPO. And in March, Aramco chose the banks that would handle the underwriting for the IPO. The Saudi Aramco IPO underwriters are Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), and HSBC Holdings Plc. (NYSE ADR: HSBC). These announcements made news not only because they show the company is getting serious about the IPO, but big-name Wall Street firms have swarmed the Saudi oil company in hopes of collecting a share of an estimated $1 billion in fees. That doesn't include the potential for future business with the oil giant. But the next step in the process will be choosing which stock exchange will hold the Saudi Aramco IPO. And that will Aramco's biggest decision. While Aramco will list some shares in the Saudi Arabian stock exchange, it's planning to list the biggest part on a global stock exchange. The Saudi oil company is shopping between exchanges in New York, London, and Hong Kong. In fact, earlier this month UK Prime Minister Theresa May visited Saudi Arabia to lobby for the oil company to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. While listing shares of Aramco on a major, global stock exchange like the NYSE or LSE will expand the reach and impact of the Aramco IPO, these Western stock exchanges come with rules the company can't meet right now. That's just one of the biggest obstacles ahead of the Saudi Aramco IPO. And there may be an even bigger hurdle for the company to clear… The Biggest Obstacle Ahead for the Saudi Aramco IPO Join the conversation.

(SMIC) is ramping up portfolio investments in infrastructure and energy, after announcing a leadership revamp that saw nonmembers of the Sy family take top management positions to lead the conglomerate’s next stage of growth. SMIC on Wednesday named long-time chief financial officer Jose T. Sio, the trusted lieutenant of founder Henry Sy, Sr., as chairman of the board, saying the CFO of 26 years was “highly instrumental in supporting the phenomenal growth of SM and its subsidiaries.” The 93-year-old Mr. Sy, the country’s richest man, was appointed as chairman emeritus. The company also named banker Frederic C. DyBuncio as president, replacing Harley T. Sy, who will remain as executive director of the board. “The mandate from the Sy family is to make the company grow,” Mr. Sio said at a press briefing after SMIC’s annual stockholders’ meeting on Wednesday. To fulfill its mandate, Mr. Sio announced plans to expand beyond its core businesses of property, banking and retail and increase the group’s presence in infrastructure and energy to take advantage of opportunities amid the Philippine economy’s continued expansion. “Infrastructure and energy are the industries that can complement our three core businesses,” he said, adding investments in these areas will not just be in equity but also in financing. “Our banks, both BDO and Chinabank, are looking on financing a portion of these industries,” he added. SM has submitted unsolicited proposals to the government to develop a $50-billion airport in Sangley in partnership with Solar group’s All-Asia Resources and Reclamation Corp. and to construct a P25-billion elevated tollway linking SM Mall of Asia in Pasay City to Sta. Mesa, Manila through a joint venture with Ayala Corp. While the Philippine economy continues to be the “darling” of Southeast Asia, thanks to remittances from overseas Filipino workers and its robust business process outsourcing sector, Mr. Sio said this is not sustainable. “We look at where SM is going in the next five years, where the Philippine economy is going...That should not be a long-term policy of the government, OFWs have their cost, social cost to country,” he said. The BPO industry is also facing challenges from new technologies, as well as US President Donald J. Trump’s protectionist policies. Mr. DyBuncio, who joined the company in 2011 to lead its portfolio investment division, said SMIC still plans to keep property, retail, and banking as its three core businesses. “We look for opportunities as they come out of the market, businesses that will be good for the group. But the core will still be the core, looking forward,” said Mr. DyBuncio, who has over 20 years banking experience with JP Morgan Chase. “Each of those companies under those groups are really on their own rights are already of size and have very strong consumer relations as well,” he added. SMIC’s portfolio now includes Belle Corp., Atlas Mining, CityMall Commercial Centers, Inc., Philippines Urban Living Solutions, Inc., the Net buildings and most recently, the 2GO Group, Inc. With SMIC entering the logistics business via its 2GO investment, the company is also preparing to foray into e-commerce. Mr. Sio said the company is prepared for e-commerce, but the market and the infrastructure are not yet ready. “As the economic growth gets pushed to the provinces, logistics is needed to go nationwide. As consumer power increases, we deliver more growth to the products,” Mr. DyBuncio said. REORGANIZATION The key organizational changes leaves SMIC’s senior management team without a member of the founding Sy family. Aside from Harley T. Sy as executive director of the board, siblings Teresita T. Sy-Coson and Henry T. Sy, Jr. remain as vice-chairpersons. “It is an indication that the family would like to professionalize the management of the SM group in preparation for the future,” Mr. Sio said. He also noted that the group is now preparing the third generation of Sys for the next phase of expansion. “They are more or less immersed with the SM group. We are preparing for them to take positions in the near future.” Shares in SMIC went up P4 or 0.55% to close at P731 apiece on Wednesday. -- Arra B.

Goldman Sachs Group and Citigroup are considering choosing Frankfurt as their EU base, people with knowledge of the situation said in January. Part of Frankfurt’s appeal is that it’s the cheapest major financial center in the European Union to live and work, according to property broker Savills Plc. The combined annual cost of renting an apartment and the per-employee office space expense totaled just under 30 000 euros ($33 000) in the German city, less than half that of Paris. “There won’t be enough for everyone,” said Juergen Schmid, who leads Savills’ property-investment business in Frankfurt. “That will in turn increase the demand for offices in less attractive locations, and the rent that can be charged for them.” Frankfurt is among European cities that include Dublin and Madrid that are jockeying for position as banks consider where to establish a base on the continent.

London could lose 10 000 banking jobs and 20 000 financial-services positions as clients move assets out of the UK after Brexit, according to the Bruegel think tank. Other estimates range from 4 000 to 232 000 jobs. In Frankfurt, many prospective tenants from the financial-services industry are looking for large, well-designed buildings in prime locations, Ape said. Benjamin Remy, who’s responsible for Savills’ office-leasing business in Frankfurt, has also seen a pick-up in demand. “Some large banks have actually reserved some office space already,” said Stephan Braeuning, head of office letting at Colliers International Group's Frankfurt branch. “Nothing’s been signed yet, though.” Bloomberg Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 Hawks arrest suspected coup plotter with 'target list' 2 Nelson Mandela Bay coalition in shreds 3 Disabled KZN woman barred from boarding flight 4 Cape Town's perfect storm in pictures 5 SA considers strategic grain reserve Advertisement X BUSINESS REPORT About us Contact us Feedback Follow us on INSIDE BUSINESS REPORT Companies Economy Energy Markets Entrepreneurs Technology Careers International Opinion Financial tools EXPLORE IOL News Politics Business Report Personal Finance Sport Entertainment Lifestyle Motoring Travel BUSINESS REPORT WEEKLY Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

"Bet on yourself," he says. Jessica Dickler | @jdickler 16 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Getty Images LeBron James #23 of the Cleveland Cavaliers. LeBron James is experiencing enormous wealth. And, as with many professional athletes, it first came on very suddenly — and at the tender age of 18. "Being a first-generational money maker in a household is a scary thing," James said. Today James, now 32, is one of basketball's most celebrated athletes and also its highest paid. When the NBA superstar returned to the Cleveland Cavaliers, he signed a deal for three years and $100 million, earning $31 million for the 2016-17 season. He will make $33 million for 2017-18, the highest single-season salary in the league's history, according to published reports. James, who has had his share of lucrative endorsement deals from McDonald's to Coca-Cola, says he has learned about creating partnerships with brands such as Blaze Pizza and Nike. Additionally, he has enjoyed doing something on his own — "That's a really cool thing," James said — even when it meant walking away from other multimillion-dollar opportunities. show chapters LeBron James' Nike endorsement deal could be worth $1B    Wednesday, 18 May 2016 | 7:35 AM ET | 00:31 "Bet on yourself," he said in a conversation with his business manager Maverick Carter in an episode of "Kneading Dough," a new series by JPMorgan Chase and digital media company Uninterrupted. (James and Carter launched Uninterrupted in 2014.) The small forward said he has learned to increasingly take the long view when it comes to basketball and business. "I know there will more time of my life spent off the floor than on the floor," he said. "I still have to live life beyond the hardwood." Still, even now, old money habits die hard, James explained. "If there's one thing I still do, I would never pull my money out in front of somebody," he said. "You would never know how much money I got in my pocket — that comes from me being from the bottom." The four-time league Most Valuable Player shared the lessons he learned, how he picked his deals and what will come after basketball in the second episode of the "Kneading Dough" series. The first episode featured Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors. For other young players, "plan out what you want your life to look like once the merry-go-round stops," advised Marc Minker, who has worked with professional athletes and is the lead managing director at CBIZ MHM, a New York-based national accounting and professional services firm.

Idaho Business Health Nation World Elections Photos Business GOP bid to gut Dodd-Frank renews debate over breaking up banks Wed., April 26, 2017, 7:54 a.m. By Elizabeth Dexheimer Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS The roll-out of legislation this week that would rip up much of the Dodd-Frank Act marks a pivotal moment for Republicans’ efforts to overhaul post-crisis financial rules. It’s also an opportunity for Democrats to push an agenda that GOP lawmakers and finance executives are less keen to talk about: Breaking up Wall Street megabanks. The Republican bill, drafted by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, has a lot that banks like. It would repeal the Volcker Rule, which restricts lenders from making speculative bets unless they use clients’ money. And it would reduce the frequency of burdensome exams that determine whether banks can pay shareholder dividends. But some Democrats have started strategizing on ways to leverage Hensarling’s bill to force Republicans to take a stand on controversial issues. That includes bringing back some version of the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression era-law kept investment banking and consumer lending separate for more than six decades until it was scrapped in 1999. A handful of lawmakers blame the repeal for contributing to the 2008 meltdown, an argument that Wall Street flatly rejects. “A total breakup of the banks is my goal, but I’m not averse to making compromises,” said Rep. Mike Capuano, a Massachusetts Democrat who is considering proposing a Glass-Steagall amendment to Hensarling’s legislation. “Any progress we can make toward the concept of separation is better than what we have.” Capuano and others who want to see banks shrunk have been emboldened by recent statements from Trump administration officials, including White House economic adviser Gary Cohn. Earlier this month, the former top executive at Goldman Sachs said he would support some version of Glass-Steagall being brought back. The prospect of a politically-divided Congress passing any major financial services bill, particularly one that would force banks to dramatically rethink their business models, is a longshot. Still, having to register a vote on dismantling giant lenders presents risks for individual lawmakers, especially those who rely on political contributions from the finance industry. While Republicans included a reinstatement of Glass-Steagall in the platform they approved during their national convention in July, it hasn’t been a key of the party’s agenda on Capitol Hill this year. “Anything that gets Republican members on the record about where they stand is meaningful,” said Joe Valenti, director of consumer finance at the Center of American Progress, a progressive think tank. “It could be useful to see whether this is just rhetoric or whether there could be actual, serious debate on a proposal.” Getting drawn into a fight over Glass-Steagall is something firms like JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America would like to avoid, as the issue illustrates the threat of President Donald Trump’s conflicting economic messages. While Trump has pledged to ease financial regulations that he says are crippling growth, he got elected in part due to his populist anti-Wall Street rhetoric on the campaign trail. The House Financial Services Committee will hold a hearing on Hensarling’s bill this week with a panel vote on the legislation planned for next week, giving Democrats a chance to offer amendments. Brian Gardner, a financial policy analyst at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, says a bigger threat to banks will emerge on Glass-Steagall if the Senate takes up a financial rules overhaul. “It’s mostly a diversion at this time,” Gardner said in an interview. “But it could be a much bigger risk in the Senate where Democrats have an outsized influence and could decide to hold other financial measures hostage until they get a vote on Glass-Steagall.” It was during a private meeting with senators that Cohn offered his Glass-Steagall endorsement, people who heard his comments have said. When asked to elaborate, Cohn said he’s backed a clear separation between investment banking and consumer lending for years, adding that there are cultural differences between the two business lines, said the people who asked not to be named because the meeting was private. His comments flustered bankers and their lobbyists, many of whom placed frantic calls to the White House and congressional offices seeking more details. Part of the frustration banks have is confusion over what policy makers mean when they promote a separation of investment and commercial banking. The phrase “21st century Glass-Steagall” was first coined by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a staunch liberal. But it has since been adopted by Trump and members of his administration. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the Financial Times last week that one approach for implementing a modern version of Glass-Steagall could be walling off units of banks, instead of breaking them up. “Anytime I hear this term 21st Century Glass-Steagall, I ask what it is, and I have yet to have anybody really tell me,” Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat said during an April 13 earnings call with investors and analysts. “I have yet to have anybody really explain to me what value there is.” This week’s hearing on Hensarling’s bill, dubbed the Financial Choice Act, may not provide Corbat or other bank CEOs much clarity. And even if an amendment was added that brings back Glass-Steagall, the legislation still isn’t likely to win support from many Democrats. “I just can’t vote for this bill, it’s just so bad,” said Rep. Brad Sherman, a California Democrat. “This isn’t the Financial Choice, it’s the wrong choice.” Published: April 26, 2017, 7:54 a.m.  Tags: banking, business, Dodd-Frank, economy, politics, stocks Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

The company’s shares, which had risen 9.1% this year, were off 1% in premarket trading on Wednesday. PepsiCo and other processed-food makers are investing heavily to meet consumers’ increasing preference for healthier snacks such as unsweetened tea and baked chips. The company has said it now gets more than 45% of its net revenue from what it called “guilt-free” products - beverages that have fewer than 70 calories per 12 ounces and snacks that have lower amounts of salt and saturated fat. These include snacks such as Baked Lays, Quaker Breakfast Flats and new versions of Mirinda and 7UP, which have 30% less sugar. Organic revenue rose 2.1% in the first quarter ended March 25, while total revenue rose 1.6% to $12.05 billion, the second quarter of rising sales after eight quarters of decline. Revenue from PepsiCo’s North America beverage business, the company’s biggest, rose 2.3% to $4.46 billion. However, some analysts were cautious. “The quality of the quarter was disappointing as organic revenue, gross margin, and operating margin all came in weaker than we anticipated,” J.P. Morgan Securities analysts wrote in a note. Net income attributable to PepsiCo rose to $1.32 billion, or 91 cents per share, in the quarter, from $931 million, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier. The year-earlier period included a $373 million charge related to the company’s transaction with Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding Corp. Excluding items, the company earned 94 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 92 cents per share on revenue of $11.98 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Rival Coca-Cola Co on Tuesday reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly profit on higher costs of franchising its bottling operations and announced job cuts to boost savings. Earlier this month, PepsiCo was forced to pull a commercial featuring model Kendall Jenner after the ad prompted outrage and ridicule from those who said it trivialized rights protests and public unrest in the United States.

Morgan EM Local Currency Bond ETF (EMLC) NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–VanEck is lowering the expense ratio for its VanEck Vectors® J.P. Morgan EM Local Currency Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: EMLC®), (the “Fund”), it was announced today. As of April 26, 2017, the expense cap for EMLC will be reduced from 0.47% to 0.44%1. The Fund seeks to track the J.P. Morgan GBI-EM Global Core Index, which is comprised of bonds issued by emerging markets governments and denominated in the local currency of the issuer. EMLC has attracted approximately $1.8 billion of inflows since January 2016 and, as of March 31, 2017, had over $3.0 billion in assets under management. VanEck regularly evaluates fund expenses to identify opportunities to lower shareholder costs. The reduction in EMLC’s expense cap allows investors to benefit from the economies of scale that have resulted from the significant asset growth over the past year. “Investor interest in emerging markets bonds has continued this year due to their attractive yield potential and the stabilization and improvement in many emerging markets economies, which in the case of bonds denominated in local currencies may provide investors with the opportunity to benefit from currency appreciation,” said Fran Rodilosso, Head of Fixed Income ETF Portfolio Management and Portfolio Manager for the Fund. In addition to EMLC, VanEck manages a broad suite of emerging markets bond ETFs including VanEck Vectors® Emerging Markets High Yield Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: HYEM®), VanEck Vectors® EM Investment Grade + BB Rated USD Sovereign Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: IGEM®), VanEck Vectors® Emerging Markets Aggregate Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: EMAG®) and VanEck Vectors® ChinaAMC China Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: CBON®).

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Bonds News | Wed Apr 26, 2017 | 8:04am EDT UPDATE 1-Indonesia re-appoints HSBC as primary bond dealer after local integration (Adds comment from fin ministry official, background) By Eveline Danubrata and Hidayat Setiaji JAKARTA, April 26 Indonesia's finance ministry said on Wednesday it had re-appointed HSBC as a primary dealer of government bonds following the bank's move to be locally incorporated. The appointment of PT Bank HSBC Indonesia was effective on April 17, the ministry said in an emailed statement. Last week, HSBC's branch in Indonesia was integrated with a local entity previously known as PT Bank Ekonomi Raharja, in a move that the bank said will expand its offerings and network in the country. (bit.ly/2oIVyWC) The new entity still fulfills the condition of being a primary bond dealer after the integration, Loto Srinaita Ginting, director of government bonds at the finance ministry, told Reuters by phone. A primary dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov. 25. There has been a growing push in Indonesia for foreign banks to be locally incorporated. Some parliamentarians have said the move is necessary to ring-fence capital in Indonesia, particularly if there is a financial crisis. Indonesia dropped JPMorgan as a primary bond dealer after the U.S. bank in November published a research report on the country that was considered negative by the government. The finance ministry in January announced new rules requiring all primary bond dealers to "safeguard" their partnership with the government and avoid conflicts of interest.

Not anymore. On the campaign trail, he slammed Wall Street for “getting away with murder.” He vowed to break up the big banks and force the finance guys to pay higher taxes. His final campaign ad showed ominous photos of the New York Stock Exchange and the CEO of Goldman Sachs and proclaimed it was time to put an end to the political and business elites that have “bled our country dry.” That message resonated deeply with voters who have watched Wall Street bonuses and stock prices come roaring back after the financial crisis while middle class wages have stagnated. But President Trump has done a rapid U-turn on big banks in his first 100 days. He’s embracing Wall Street now, not shunning it. He’s stacked his cabinet with Wall Street types (especially from Goldman Sachs). And instead of talking about breaking up banks, he’s focused on rolling back a lot of regulations on them. “The Goldman Sachs faction in the White House has won,” says Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments. “This is starting to look like a fairly typical center-right administration, with a strong pro-business tilt.” Trump has danced away from the populism he campaigned on and into the arms Wall Street. It’s arguably the greatest shift of the early days of his presidency, and it’s having a substantial impact on economic policy. How Trump has pivoted toward Wall St. Just look at his inner circle. Three of his top advisers — Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and chief strategist Steve Bannon — have worked at investment bank Goldman Sachs. (There are even more Goldman alums in the second rung of key positions). On top of that, private equity king Stephen Schwarzman, who sits atop Blackstone Group, runs Trump’s business advisory council and has emerged as a key voice in the president’s ear. The Wall Street influence is evident already in Trump’s policy flip flops. He’s dialed back massively on the protectionist trade talk, especially on China. Trump campaigned on ripping up trade agreements like NAFTA and labeling China a currency manipulator (a fancy word for a cheater) on “Day One” in office. None of that happened. Now he says China isn’t so bad on trade, and his administration is studying how to tweak (not totally rip up) trade deals. “What we’ve learned from Trump is his initial comments are outlandish, but they generally don’t happen,” says Randy Frederick, managing director of trading at Schwab. He’s even started saying nice things about Janet Yellen, the head of the Federal Reserve, whom he blasted on the campaign trail for rigging the economy to make Obama look better. Trump is ready to help banks Trump relishes praise, and investors have cheered his pro-Wall Street shift by sending the stock market to record highs. It’s been dubbed the “Trump rally.” The Dow and S&P 500 have jumped over 10% since he won the election, a fact the president likes to tout on Twitter and in his speeches (it’s even mentioned on the White House website). It’s been easier to get a “win” in Wall Street’s eyes than it has from Congress or presidential approval polls (Trump has the lowest approval rating at this stage of any modern president in US history). “He is moderating because the wheels in Washington turn way slower than he wants, even with a big club,” says Frederick. Instead of bashing banks, Trump is now pushing hard to scale back the Dodd-Frank law that was put in place after the financial crisis to prevent bad behavior from financial firms. He recently said he’ll “do a big number” on the law. It’s exactly what top Wall Street CEOs like JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon have been advocating for years. The fact that it’s been a first 100-day priority is telling since it wasn’t part of his “Contract with the American Voter” that he put out before the election. Then there’s the regulation — known as the fiduciary rule — that was supposed to take effect this spring to help protect middle class retirement accounts. The Trump administration has put it on hold, a major win for some Wall Street firms. Watch what happens with taxes Wall Street is getting what it wants on trade and regulation from Trump. There’s just one big item outstanding: Taxes. The White House is unveiling more details on Trump’s tax reform plan Wednesday. “This is going to be the biggest tax cut and the largest tax reform in our history,” Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said Wednesday morning, although details are still being worked out. Many GOP economists and business leaders are urging Trump to move quickly on cutting taxes for businesses, even if that means holding off on tax cuts for individuals and families. The expectation is that Trump will push for the corporate tax rate to fall sharply from a top rate of 35% to just 15%. It’s a dramatic shift from Trump’s rhetoric on the campaign trail when he told voters, “Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us. We’re going to tax Wall Street.” Bankers and investors appear to have strong advocates in the White House for their interests. It will be telling just how far the White House is willing to go on tax cuts for the middle class and small businesses. As top adviser Cohn said last week acknowledged last week, “The right lens to judge us against is: Do we grow the economy? Do we put more people to work? Do we get them better jobs?” The U.S. just lost a trade battle with Mexico Twitter stock surges on surprise user growth Related Posts This man helped turn China into an economic power Our first look into Google’s big, secret, risky bets Trump model to take immigration case to U.S. government CEO takes 90% pay cut to give workers huge raise Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

However, European politics are still a concern and it is too early for the central bank to consider raising rates, analysts told CNBC. "There is no denying that the French election result (with the tail risk of a 2nd round between Mélenchon and Le Pen now out of the window) has given renewed impetus to speculation that the ECB might dial back quantitative easing earlier than planned, or might hike rates sooner than markets had been pricing in," Elwin de Groot, senior market economist at Rabobank told CNBC via email. "Having said that, I believe it is still early days," he added. The European Central Bank is meeting Thursday but expectations are that it will not announce any policy changes. The first round of the French election is over but the country has yet to make a final decision between the centrist Emmanuel Macron and the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. "Even assuming Macron secures his victory in the second round, it is also important that he will garner sufficient support in parliament," de Groot noted, in relation to the upcoming parliamentary vote. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING, said the ECB is "highly unlikely" to do anything in between the first and second rounds of the French election. "The timing of this week's ECB meeting could have been hardly more unfortunate. Even though the economic data since the March meeting has supported the view of brightening economic prospects, slowly paving the way for a very gentle exit from the current ultra-loose monetary policy, this week's meeting simply comes too early for any change," he said. Even as the political landscape becomes a lot clearer and economic data strengthens, analysts don't expect too much from President Mario Draghi when he addresses the press, but there may be small changes in the language he uses. "It is possible that the ECB will remove the language stating that the risks "remain tilted to the downside" and we would expect the commentary to remain relatively upbeat on the growth outlook given the improving business and consumer confidence surveys," Mike Bell, Global Market Strategist, JPMorgan Asset Management. If this proves to be the case, there could be renewed comments from Germany criticizing the ECB's loose monetary stance. Several central bank and finance ministry officials have complained that the ECB's stimulus is hurting banks' balance sheets. But Axel Weber, UBS chairman, said during an interview with CNBC in Washington that the ECB has to look at the 19 euro economies and not only to those that are performing the best. show chapters Don’t see fiscal policy being a major solution in Europe: Weber    Sunday, 23 Apr 2017 | 12:21 PM ET | 04:03 "Some euro economies have recovered from the crisis at a faster pace than others, which has been the case of Germany. However, the ECB's mandate is to look at the European average," Weber said. "I think it's unlikely the majority of the governing council is going to share (the German) view and therefore I don't think the ECB will change anything in its policies this year," Weber added.

Now he embraces it Posted: Wednesday, April 26, 2017 3:02 AM EDT Updated: Wednesday, April 26, 2017 9:33 AM EDT By Heather Long NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Donald Trump used to hate Wall Street. Not anymore. On the campaign trail, he slammed Wall Street for "getting away with murder." He vowed to break up the big banks and force the finance guys to pay higher taxes. His final campaign ad showed ominous photos of the New York Stock Exchange and the CEO of Goldman Sachs and proclaimed it was time to put an end to the political and business elites that have "bled our country dry." That message resonated deeply with voters who have watched Wall Street bonuses and stock prices come roaring back after the financial crisis while middle class wages have stagnated. But President Trump has done a rapid U-turn on big banks in his first 100 days. He's embracing Wall Street now, not shunning it. He's stacked his cabinet with Wall Street types (especially from Goldman Sachs). And instead of talking about breaking up banks, he's focused on rolling back a lot of regulations on them. "The Goldman Sachs faction in the White House has won," says Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments. "This is starting to look like a fairly typical center-right administration, with a strong pro-business tilt." Trump has danced away from the populism he campaigned on and into the arms Wall Street. It's arguably the greatest shift of the early days of his presidency, and it's having a substantial impact on economic policy. How Trump has pivoted toward Wall St. Just look at his inner circle. Three of his top advisers -- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and chief strategist Steve Bannon -- have worked at investment bank Goldman Sachs. (There are even more Goldman alums in the second rung of key positions). On top of that, private equity king Stephen Schwarzman, who sits atop Blackstone Group, runs Trump's business advisory council and has emerged as a key voice in the president's ear. The Wall Street influence is evident already in Trump's policy flip flops. He's dialed back massively on the protectionist trade talk, especially on China. Trump campaigned on ripping up trade agreements like NAFTA and labeling China a currency manipulator (a fancy word for a cheater) on "Day One" in office. None of that happened. Now he says China isn't so bad on trade, and his administration is studying how to tweak (not totally rip up) trade deals. "What we've learned from Trump is his initial comments are outlandish, but they generally don't happen," says Randy Frederick, managing director of trading at Schwab. He's even started saying nice things about Janet Yellen, the head of the Federal Reserve, whom he blasted on the campaign trail for rigging the economy to make Obama look better. Trump is ready to help banks Trump relishes praise, and investors have cheered his pro-Wall Street shift by sending the stock market to record highs. It's been dubbed the "Trump rally." The Dow and S&P 500 have jumped over 10% since he won the election, a fact the president likes to tout on Twitter and in his speeches (it's even mentioned on the White House website). It's been easier to get a "win" in Wall Street's eyes than it has from Congress or presidential approval polls (Trump has the lowest approval rating at this stage of any modern president in US history). "He is moderating because the wheels in Washington turn way slower than he wants, even with a big club," says Frederick. Instead of bashing banks, Trump is now pushing hard to scale back the Dodd-Frank law that was put in place after the financial crisis to prevent bad behavior from financial firms. He recently said he'll "do a number" on the law. It's exactly what top Wall Street CEOs like JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon have been advocating for years. The fact that it's been a first 100-day priority is telling since it wasn't part of his "Contract with the American Voter" that he put out before the election. Then there's the regulation -- known as the fiduciary rule -- that was supposed to take effect this spring to help protect middle class retirement accounts. The Trump administration has put it on hold, a major win for some Wall Street firms. Watch what happens with taxes Wall Street is getting what it wants on trade and regulation from Trump. There's just one big item outstanding: Taxes. Trump is about to unveil more details on his tax reform plan. Many GOP economists and business leaders are urging Trump to move quickly on cutting taxes for businesses, even if that means holding off on tax cuts for individuals and families. The expectation is that Trump will push for the corporate tax rate to fall dramatically from a top rate of 35% to just 15%. It's a dramatic shift from Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail when he told voters, "Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us. We're going to tax Wall Street." Bankers and investors appear to have strong advocates in the White House for their interests. It will be telling just how far the White House is willing to go on tax cuts for the middle class and small businesses. As top adviser Cohn said last week acknowledged last week, "The right lens to judge us against is: Do we grow the economy? Do we put more people to work? Do we get them better jobs?"

(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co's directors face an unusual and difficult task after shareholders rebuffed most of them: reformulating the board in a way that satisfies investors without causing more chaos. Chairman Stephen Sanger said no directors will step down immediately, even after a dozen fell short of a traditional threshold of shareholder confidence at the bank's dramatic annual meeting on Tuesday. But sources said some directors nearing a mandatory retirement age may speed up plans to leave, as the board begins a gradual turnover. The results were uniformly described as devastating: only three directors received solid support and four, including Sanger, squeaked by with just 53 to 57 percent of votes cast, according to the bank's preliminary tally. Some investors who voted against directors told Reuters their intention was not to get them ousted immediately, but to signal dissatisfaction with the bank's response to a scandal involving thousands of employees creating as many as 2.1 million unauthorised customer accounts. Even so, several shareholder elections experts called the vote tally unprecedented, especially at a company the size of Wells Fargo, and predicted it would spur change. "These numbers are more than not good, they're reflective of an overwhelming rejection of the directors," said Columbia Law School professor Robert Jackson, who studies corporate governance. Jackson expects at least a few directors step down in a month or two, much like two directors left JPMorgan Chase & Co after winning narrow majorities in 2013. He expects Sanger to be replaced by a colleague who garnered more support. "When 44 percent of investors don't like your work, then the question of whether he will step down isn't 'if' but 'when,'" Jackson said. There are not many examples that compare to Wells Fargo's situation. After the 2008 financial crisis, the boards of Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc were refashioned under the eye of federal regulators who wanted more directors with banking experience. But those changes came with checks and balances from the U.S. government. Typically, the board's governance and nominating committee would handle director changes. But only one director on that committee received a vote of high confidence, potentially putting members in the awkward position of picking their own replacements. Six of Wells Fargo's directors will reach a mandatory retirement age in the next four years, including Sanger, who turns 72 next year. A person familiar with board discussions said some of those retirements are likely to happen sooner. The three directors in good stead with shareholders all joined the board in recent months, indicating investors may welcome new additions with the right expertise. Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended shareholders vote against the dozen who received tepid support. Kevin McManus, vice president at Egan-Jones Proxy Services, said directors should not be caught off guard by the outcome of Tuesday's vote. "They might not be able to leave at once," he said, but "hopefully they've already planned for this possibility."

Almost twenty years ago, Sony’s profits were boosted by the launch of the original PlayStation followed by hit software including Metal Gear Solid, according to Bloomberg’s latest report. Preliminary operating profit for the fiscal year through March 2017 was 19 percent higher than company projections, amounting to 285 billion yen ($2.6 billion). Net income was also expected to be twice the previous forecast, totaling 73 billion yen. As a result, JP Morgan Chase & Co. improved Sony’s stock rating while analysts from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. among many others believe that the company can achieve an operating profit of 500 billion yen. This is the second year in a row that Sony’s profits have topped $2 billion and also happens to be longest streak of it since 2001. On April 28, the company is expected to release forecasts for the fiscal year that began this month.
