Investing for income in the current environment: JPMorgan Income Builder Fund By Michael Schoenhaut, Lead Portfolio Manager for JPMorgan Income Builder Fund, and Christina Jiang, Client Portfolio Manager, at J.P. Morgan Asset Management February 7, 2017 In today’s challenging markets, Michael Schoenhaut and Christina Jiang explain how a focus on sourcing the best income opportunities, while closely managing risk, can reap benefits for investors. What does today’s market environment mean for income investors? Income remains a challenge. Monetary policy over recent years has been driving down rates globally for asset classes such as traditional fixed income. However, this “lower for longer” dynamic has begun to shift in more recent months. While the prospect of higher rates is positive for yield-starved income investors, against this backdrop the price of fixed income and many yield-oriented equity sectors tend to suffer. This changes the challenge for income investors primarily from finding yield to managing the balance of risk, yield, and total return. In this environment, active management is more crucial than ever. What are the most important economic themes being reflected in the portfolio at the moment? Overall, we continue to see an improving global growth picture. The US remains the driver of global economic growth, and if we see significant policy stimulus from the new Trump administration, we believe growth will likely pick up. In Europe, the economic recovery continues, but concerns over negative interest rates and upcoming elections and referendums are on the horizon. Emerging markets had a strong run this year until the US election result. Although a more hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) and a stronger US dollar could be headwinds for the asset class next year, we believe that the impact of these could be dampened by the improved earnings outlook for emerging markets and a pickup in growth globally. Given the expected uptick in growth and recent move in rates, global equities look increasingly attractive. Where are you currently finding attractive opportunities? Despite the potential for continued rising rates, fixed income remains an important allocation in both an income and multi-asset portfolio. In our search for attractive risk-adjusted yield opportunities in today’s environment, we continue to like the credit markets, specifically high yield and other opportunistic allocations such as preferred equity. With regards to high yield, we are comfortable with the credits that we own and anticipate that default rates over the next 12 months will be lower than their long-term average. We also view the risk of recession in the near term to be quite low. High yield still has a healthy spread over US Treasuries, which can absorb some of the impact of rising rates. This is particularly attractive because we are also hedging some of the duration exposure at the portfolio level by shorting five-year US Treasury futures, which allows us to access the asset class while mitigating the downside effect from rising rates. Government bonds and core fixed income offer very little protection against rising rates, which is why our fixed income exposure is much more focused on credit. How has the portfolio’s positioning evolved in the equity space? In the summer of 2015, we began reducing our equity exposure from near an all-time high of 46% to 32% in more recent months. At the time, we believed global growth would be low but still positive, and therefore preferred the carry of high yield and other credit assets to equities, given their reliance on stronger earnings growth. This helped the portfolio as our credit allocations outperformed equities in the first half of the year. Following the US election and the recent rate rise, we have started to add to equities. Given stronger earnings potential with the prospect of fiscal stimulus in the US and a reflationary theme across the world, we remain positive. However, while some of our peers have focused on bond proxy sectors for equity income, we remain diversified in our equity sector allocation. This is important because while bond proxies significantly outperformed other equity sectors on the back of falling rates in the first half of the year, this has reversed in the second half. Through both of these periods, our portfolio maintained relatively steady, positive performance.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Feb 6, 2017 at 11:41AM The entrance to "The Corner," the one-time headquarters of JPMorgan Chase. Image source: Getty (Thinkstock/iStock). I recently wrote about how JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) became the biggest bank in America in the wake of the financial crisis. Not only is it a compelling story, but embedded in it are critical lessons that investors in bank stocks would be wise to internalize if the extraordinary uncertainty pulsing through the markets right now continues. Yet, even though we all know that JPMorgan Chase is enormous (it has a $2.5 trillion balance sheet!), the fact of the matter is that it's even bigger than it appears. That's because it not only oversees its own balance sheet, it also administers a vast quantity of assets for others. It's true that JPMorgan Chase is a bank. And as a bank, it focuses on collecting deposits and making loans as well as investing excess cash into fixed-income securities such as government bonds and federally insured mortgage-backed securities, the latter of which -- loans and securities -- account for the majority of its $2.5 trillion worth of assets. But this isn't the only business JPMorgan Chase engages in. As a universal bank, it also operates what may be the largest investment bank in the country -- combined, that is, with its commercial banking operations. Its investment bank helps companies go public, assists institutional investors in the purchase and sale of securities for their own portfolios, and advises companies on mergers and acquisitions. There's something else that its investment bank does as well. Something that isn't as well known to many ordinary investors. Namely, it serves as a custodian for complex securities owned by hedge funds, insurance companies, university endowments, and other types of large investors. Data source: JPMorgan Chase. Chart by author. Mortgage-backed securities serve as a case in point. When most banks underwrite mortgages, they don't keep those loans on their balance sheet. They instead package the mortgages together and sell them as a security to large investors looking to profit from the interest payments on the underlying loans. The catch is that these securities need an entity to administer them -- to collect and distribute the interest payments, as well as to ensure that the owners' contractual rights are enforced. That's where a bank like JPMorgan Chase comes in. It's here in turn where JPMorgan Chase's true economic might is captured. As of the end of last year, it reported a staggering $20.5 trillion worth of so-called assets under custody. Add that to $1.8 trillion worth of assets under management -- assets in mutual funds, for instance, that are run by the New York-based bank -- and it becomes clear that JPMorgan Chase oversees significantly more capital than its massive $2.5 trillion balance sheet would otherwise lead one to believe.

(Reuters/Stephen Lam) Share Written by Alison Griswold Obsession Getting There November 15, 2016 We may have already reached peak “sharing” economy. Average monthly earnings on “labor” platforms such as Uber, which use technology to match workers (like drivers) to people who need a service (like riders), peaked in June 2014, according to new data from the JPMorgan Chase Institute, the research arm of JPMorgan Chase. On “capital” platforms such as Airbnb, which help people rent out assets like a car or spare room, the share of US adults participating has declined from the previous year. On both types of online platforms, wages are growing more slowly as is overall participation. And retention is awful: 52% of people working for labor platforms quit within a year, and 56% of those on capital platforms vacate in the first 12 months. Participation in the “sharing” or “gig” economy was once touted as the future of work in America. But the new data from the JPMorgan Chase Institute suggests that isn’t the case. Instead, wages for workers have gotten worse as many of these companies—Uber and Lyft, to pick two examples—have cut pay rates to make prices more attractive to consumers. And the jobs themselves appear to have served as stop-gap measures for people who were unemployed or had fallen on hard times during and after the recession. As the US economy has improved—with six years of unbroken job growth and even an uptick in wages—a greater share of those gig participants are finding better jobs. So they’ve stopped or cut down on their Uber and related gig work. “It doesn’t look like [gig work] is becoming more lucrative for people,” says Fiona Greig, co-author on the JPMorgan Chase Institute report. “As the labor force strengthens in general, more and more people have better options.” Jobs on these online platforms were always tenuous. “Labor” companies like Uber, Lyft, and TaskRabbit have made a practice of hiring their workers as independent contractors rather than employees. The setup means workers get more flexibility—setting your own schedule is a big talking point—but don’t get benefits such as health care, a guaranteed minimum wage, and other protections offered by full-time employment in America. Previous work from the JPMorgan Chase Institute found that the people working for companies such as Uber were typically doing so to offset shortfalls in their monthly earnings. The poorer those workers were, the more they also depended on their gig income. People in more stable financial situations, however, are more likely to quit gig work altogether. According to the JPMorgan Chase Institute, 56% of people employed somewhere other than an online labor platform drop out within 12 months. For those whose only work is on online labor platforms, that figure falls to 37%. Similarly, people with higher incomes are more likely to cease working for companies like Uber. None of this is great news for investors or managers of sharing economy startups. The retention figures should alarm startups that spent heavily to build up legions of independent contractors, then struggled to keep those people sticking around. In early 2015, a paper from influential labor economist Alan Krueger found that only about 55% of Uber drivers remained active one year after starting. That metric appears to be getting worse, not better. Most Popular Three signals that Donald Trump isn’t going to renegotiate NAFTA Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

 There's a hot new posting for Wall Street bankers Matt Turner Feb. 7, 2017, 9:50 AM 5,869 facebook linkedin twitter email print Guy D'Alema/FX Wall Street dealmakers used to be sent to Hong Kong or London to win new business. Now they're being sent to places like Seattle, Denver, and Atlanta. JPMorgan just hired Brennan Spry as head of corporate client banking and specialized industries in the South, for example. Spry previously worked in Barclays' investment banking division. Spry will be based in Atlanta, overseeing a team of bankers in the region who provide services to large companies with more than $500 million in annual revenues. In addition, the bank has hired Nina Sprinkle to the corporate client banking team in Atlanta as a senior banker responsible for serving companies in Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. She previously worked in syndicated and leveraged finance at SunTrust and Bank of America. Matt Tugwell has also joined as a senior banker focused on the Carolinas. He was most recently at Bank of America in the leveraged finance group. JPMorgan isn't the only bank hiring staff for or moving staff to regional centers in the US. The potential rewards are significant: Middle-market companies in the US and Canada paid $8.2 billion in deal fees in 2015, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch presentation. That's more than the fees netted in most of Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America combined. "This is a key focus for us as we have developed the other areas of our investment bank," Christian Meissner, the head of global corporate and investment banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told Business Insider last year. "Relatively speaking, this represents a greater opportunity than some traditional avenues of growth." NOW WATCH: The best and worst months to rent an apartment in major US cities Loading video...

 What's important is how investors respond to a wave of volatility Samantha Azzarello, J.P. Morgan Asset Management Feb. 7, 2017, 4:34 PM 1,586 facebook linkedin twitter email print Professional surfer Greg Long drops into a wave at the Jaws Surf Break aka Pe'ahi on December 6, 2015 in Haiku, Hawaii. Darryl Oumi/Getty Images for TAG Heuer A market without volatility would be unnatural, like an ocean without waves. The free market, is constantly churning. For some investors, market-moving waves can be exciting, providing a buying opportunity for mispriced securities. For other investors, the waves might feel violent; but truthfully, for long-term investors, market volatility should be irrelevant. The degree of market volatility varies from small ripples, to rolling waves, to a financial crisis sized tsunami. While all volatility feels uncomfortable in the near term, the important question for long-term investors is how to respond to it. Grab an oar! Here is what you will need to do… As a long-term investor you’ll need to do less than you think. Your diversified portfolio was built to feel steady in rough seas. 1. Remember that volatility is normal. Volatility in the market is normal, and feeling uneasy about a lower portfolio value is normal too. Exhibit 2 depicts the number of 5% pullbacks experienced each year. The chart reminds us that even in years with outstanding equity returns, there are rolling waves of volatility in the market. Historical analysis shows that pullbacks of 5% have occurred about once a quarter, and pullbacks of 10% are likely to occur once per year. Large pullbacks greater than 20% tend to occur just once per market cycle. A savvy investor will recognize the high frequency of equity market volatility, and will determine the source of the volatility before reacting to it. JPMorgan Asset Management 2. Do not jump ship at the bottom: Markets tend to rebound after bouts of volatility. Focusing on the long-term trends of the market rather than the short-term gyrations should give investors the confidence to ride the waves of volatility. When examining historic equity market data, we see a trend of rebounds following equity market pullbacks. That means that investors who jump ship after a big wave may have broken the cardinal rule of investing by “selling low.” Exhibit 3 shows the largest intra-year decline and the calendar year return every year since 1980. Despite an average intra-year drop of 14.2%, the market ended the year higher than it began it 76% of the time. That is why it is important for investors to ride the wave of volatility through its full cycle. JPMorgan Asset Management Frequent pullbacks in the market can be unsettling, and can encourage market timing, but investors should not jump ship. Being fully invested is particularly important when there is market volatility, because the best and the worst days in the market tend to be clustered together. If you were lucky enough to miss the worst days, you also were likely to have missed the best days. Examining your quarterly statement, it is difficult to synthesize the portfolio impact of missing the best days in the market. However, Exhibit 4 shows that missing these days has a real impact on investment performance. A fully invested portfolio would have returned nearly double one that missed the 10 best days in the market. Additionally, as the majority of the best days occur within two weeks of the 10 worst days in the market, it is likely that investors who sold equity because of seasickness after a bad day often also missed a big rebound. JPMorgan Asset Management 3. Focus on the destination: Investors with a long time horizon experience less volatile returns. While volatility can cause major deviations in the near term for equity markets, investors should focus on their destination. Examining rolling returns for equities in Exhibit 5 shows that, while historic annual returns have varied from -38% to +47% in a single year, rolling annualized returns, over a 20-year period, have been positive for the past 60 years. JPMorgan Asset Management 4. Batten down the hatches with diversification. We live in a headline-driven world, where media often impacts equity prices in the near term. But your portfolio should not be a dinghy tossed and turned by market churn; it is possible to gain portfolio stability through diversification. While equities tend to perform better with economic growth and moderate levels of inflation, rate sensitive fixed income is important to portfolios when economic growth falters. Although we have a positive outlook on U.S. equities in the coming year, other developed market equities can give your portfolio both exposure to risk factors outside the U.S. economy and to faster-growing emerging market economies that may help boost portfolio returns. Small cap stocks provide a pro-cyclical tilt to a portfolio compared to large cap stocks, though they can also be more sensitive to growth scares. Exhibit 6 illustrates how diversification has improved the risk/return profile of an asset allocation portfolio relative to equities over the past 20 years. This means investors in a diversified asset allocation portfolio cruised past market volatility feeling the fewest waves possible. A key to achieving more portfolio stability is to batten down the hatches with diversification before a storm hits. JPMorgan Asset Management Navigating volatility Though it is impossible to predict the future, expecting market volatility in the coming years is a safe bet. Just as the last 20 years have favored the diversified investor, we expect the next 20 years to do the same.

 Trump said people 'can't borrow money' because of Dodd-Frank — here's why he's wrong Bob Bryan Feb. 7, 2017, 10:59 PM 6,733 facebook linkedin twitter email print US President Donald Trump shakes hands with JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon Kevin Lamarque/Reuters President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order directing the US Treasury department to revise and update the Dodd-Frank regulation that oversees the county's financial institutions. Trump said in a meeting with business leaders earlier on Friday that there are "so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses, and they can't borrow money." Essentially, Trump is arguing that Dodd-Frank has dampened growth by restricting bank's ability to give out loans to businesses and consumers. Looking at the actual lending data, however, it is clear that debt accumulation and lending for businesses has been strong since the end of the financial crisis. According to the Federal Reserve's weekly H.8 report on bank lending, commercial and industrial loans given out by banks — the main avenue for business-related loans — have grown from the prior year every month since April 2011. Additionally, the total amount of C&I loans on bank balance sheets crossed its pre-recession record in February of 2014. Andy Kiersz/Business Insider; Data from FRED Small businesses have also seen a steady, albeit slower, rate of loan growth. The US Small Business Administration found in its most recent update on small business lending that lending from traditional banking institutions to small businesses has steadily increased since 2013. "The growth rates for both small loans and other business lending (large domestic business loans exceeding $ 1 million and loans to non-U.S. addresses) have been uneven since 2010," said the most recent report from the SBA. "Other business loans recovered much earlier than small business loans and continued to stay positive. The recovery for small business lending has been relatively slow but steady, and moved into positive territory in the last quarter of 2013." Additionally, the Fed's Senior Loan Officer Survey has indicated that loan standards, while tightening in recent months, have been exceptionally loose overall for the last five years. Lotfi Karoui, credit strategist at Goldman Sachs, looked at these standards to compare them with previous cycles in a note to clients on Tuesday, and found that for the most part lending standards and loan growth are in their normal ranges. "Many investors worry that easy monetary policy has fueled looser lending standards in this cycle vs. previous ones," said Karoui. "To what extent has this been the case, what areas of the credit complex have seen lending standards ease the most post-crisis, and how much of a threat do these areas pose to the broader economy?" In fact, Karoui's note pushes back on the biggest fear of bearish strategists: There has been too much lending and debt build up at businesses rather than too little. "First, current lending standards for corporations and households do not appear to be unusually aggressive, at least in aggregate," said the note. To be fair, certain classes of loans still have tighter standards, particularly residential mortgage lending. This, however, may be due to a combination of factors — regulation being one element — and is unsurprising given the contribution of mortgage lending to the prior crisis. Additionally, on the other end, looser lending standards for things like cars, student loans, and commercial real estate have allowed for a credit boom in non-mortgage loans, according to Goldman. "For consumer credit, including credit card debt, auto loans, student loans and personal loans, there has been a 29% increase since the second quarter of 2009, a faster pace relative to the 2000s (14%) but slower than the 1990s and the 1980s experience," wrote Karoui. Karoui also noted that the growth in corporate debt has been faster than during the pre-recession business cycle and on par with the debt build up of the 1990s. Thus, loans for consumers and businesses have been growing at a typical pace. This isn't to say that there haven't been higher regulatory burdens for banks and lenders — Dodd-Frank does force banks to retain higher levels of capital — but to repeal the law on the pretense that it has unduly restricted lending does not take a full measure of the facts.

 Here's why US banks are sharing data with fintechs BI Intelligence Feb. 7, 2017, 12:44 PM 1,190 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also THE US FINTECH REGULATION REPORT: How the US regulatory environment is holding back the fintech industry UK's Open Banking hits a snag Fintech could be bigger than ATMs, PayPal, and Bitcoin combined This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Fintech Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. The open banking movement is gathering momentum on Wall Street. Last month, JPMorgan Chase reached a data sharing agreement with Intuit, a tech company that uses data aggregation to power its services, which include Quickbooks, an accounting solution for small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and Mint.com, a personal finance management app. Now, Wells Fargo has followed suit by striking a similar deal with Intuit, Finextra reported on Friday. Wells Fargo customers will be able to share their account data with Intuit's services through the bank's open application programming interface (API) — without entering online banking details — from the second half of 2017. There are several reasons why major banks are opening up access to customer data: Customer reassurance. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo were among several major banks to have temporarily blocked third parties' access to their data in 2015, prompting a CFPB inquiry into data sharing and protests from customers and fintechs. Moreover, Wells Fargo has recently been embroiled in an account-faking scandal. The decision to make it easier for clients to access and share their data with third parties suggests that these banks are trying to rebuild trust and loyalty. Leveraging fintechs' technology. Big banks are waking up to the fact that they can leverage third parties' existing products for their own customer bases through partnerships and agreements, thereby expanding their suite of consumer-facing products at lower cost than innovating in-house. This also allows incumbents to dedicate their research and development budgets to their back-end operations, which are more likely to require bespoke work and internal development. Cross-selling opportunities. Intuit's solutions include accounting and personal finance management tools, both of which are highly complementary to banks' credit products. For example, an individual using Mint.com might realize, based on the app's analysis of their spending patterns, that they are in need of a loan. The bank can then step in and offer the individual its suite of credit offerings, which the third party cannot provide, thereby providing a cross-selling opportunity for the incumbent. It seems likely that other major banks will begin to open up their data to third parties. As more banks proactively open up to the third-party fintechs, players that delay in following suit risk being at a competitive disadvantage and displeasing their customers. The growing impetus of the data sharing movement suggests that, even without data sharing requirements written into law, banks will have to start making their customer data accessible if they are to stay ahead of the curve. As legacy banks continue to work with fintechs, it's becoming increasingly clear that we’ve entered the most profound era of change for financial services companies since the 1970s brought us index mutual funds, discount brokers and ATMs. No firm is immune from the coming disruption and every company must have a strategy to harness the powerful advantages of the new fintech revolution. The battle already underway will create surprising winners and stunned losers among some of the most powerful names in the financial world: The most contentious conflicts (and partnerships) will be between startups that are completely reengineering decades-old practices, traditional power players who are furiously trying to adapt with their own innovations, and total disruption of established technology & processes: Traditional Retail Banks vs. Online-Only Banks: Traditional retail banks provide a valuable service, but online-only banks can offer many of the same services with higher rates and lower fees  Traditional Lenders vs. Peer-to-Peer Marketplaces: P2P lending marketplaces are growing much faster than traditional lenders—only time will tell if the banks strategy of creating their own small loan networks will be successful  Traditional Asset Managers vs. Robo Advisors: Robo advisors like Betterment offer lower fees, lower minimums and solid returns to investors, but the much larger traditional asset managers are creating their own robo-products while providing the kind of handholding that high net worth clients are willing to pay handsomely for. As you can see, this very fluid environment is creating winners and losers before your eyes…and it’s also creating the potential for new cost savings or growth opportunities for both you and your company. After months of researching and reporting this important trend, Sarah Kocianski, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has put together an essential report on the fintech ecosystem that explains the new landscape, identifies the ripest areas for disruption, and highlights the some of the most exciting new companies. These new players have the potential to become the next Visa, Paypal or Charles Schwab because they have the potential to transform important areas of the financial services industry like: Retail banking  Lending and Financing  Payments and Transfers  Wealth and Asset Management  Markets and Exchanges  Insurance  Blockchain Transactions  If you work in any of these sectors, it’s important for you to understand how the fintech revolution will change your business and possibly even your career. And if you’re employed in any part of the digital economy, you’ll want to know how you can exploit these new technologies to make your employer more efficient, flexible and profitable. Among the big picture insights you'll get from The Fintech Ecosystem Report: Measuring the effects of technology on the entire financial services industry: Fintech investment continues to grow. After landing at $19 billion in total in 2015, global fintech funding had already reached $15 billion by mid-August 2016. The areas of fintech attracting media and investor attention are changing. Insurtech, robo advisors, and digital-only banks are only a few of the segments making waves. B2B fintechs are also playing an increasingly prominent role in the ecosystem.  It's not all good news for fintechs. Major hurdles, including customer acquisition and profitability, remain. As a result, many are becoming more willing to enter partnerships and adjust their business models.  Incumbents are enacting strategies to ensure they remain relevant. Many financial firms have woken up to the threat posed by fintechs and are implementing innovation strategies to stave off disruption. The majority of these strategies involve some interaction with fintech firms.  The relationship between incumbents and fintechs continues to evolve. Fintechs are no longer viewed exclusively as a threat, nor can they be ignored. They are increasingly viewed as partners, but that narrative alone is too simple — in reality, a more nuanced connection is taking hold.  This exclusive report also: Assesses the state of the fintech industry.  Gives details on the drivers of its growth.  Explains which areas of fintech are gaining traction.  Outlines the range of current and potential models for fintech and incumbent interaction.  The Fintech Ecosystem Report: Measuring the effects of technology on the entire financial services industry is how you get the full story on the fintech revolution.

Sandy Springs moves to demolish condemned house The city of Sandy Springs is moving to demolish a house that remains in disrepair four years after its condemnation amid ownership confusion, laying out a plan informally approved by a city judge Feb. 3. The city will immediately remove six “dangerous trees” and soon bring in an environmental engineer to figure out the demolition method and cost of 337 Hilderbrand Drive for later court approval, said City Attorney Wendell Willard at the Feb. 3 hearing. An attorney for JPMorgan Chase, the bank that disputes city contentions that it owns the house, said the bank is in the process of finding a new owner who could reimburse the city’s costs. The fire-damaged house at 337 Hilderbrand Drive lingers in disrepair nearly four years after it was condemned. (Photo John Ruch) “So we need to have the property demolished,” Willard told the court after listing various problems found in inspections since a previous court date in January. “There’s nothing there to be saved.” The pre-demolition inspections will likely take “several weeks,” he said. Attorneys for Chase and for former occupant Charles Farlow agreed to the plan, which will be formalized and signed by Chief Judge Donald Schaefer within the next few days. Mayor Rusty Paul sat in the courtroom audience during the Feb. 3 court hearing, as did Assistant City Manager Jim Tolbert and Steve Oppenheimer, who is president of the area’s Glenridge Hammond Neighborhood Association. “I just wanted to make sure it got done and got some resolution,” the mayor said of his reason for attending. Oppenheimer, who led a petition effort last fall to get renewed city action on the house, said he’s pleased there is finally a “clear path” for solving the property’s safety issues. Also attending was a neighbor of 337 Hilderbrand who recently had his roof and truck struck by falling limbs from decaying trees on the property. The neighbor has asked to remain anonymous. “It’s encouraging, this movement,” the neighbor said. “I’m just hesitant to get too excited given how much Chase has stalled this project.” “My concern is Chase slow-walking this because they know how many developers are buzzing around the neighborhood” and hope to get a higher selling price, he said. The Hilderbrand house is among thousands nationwide left in disrepair amid legal confusion and finger-pointing in the wake of the 2007-2008 mortgage crisis. It was condemned after a February 2013 fire that forced Farlow, who runs a Sandy Springs beauty salon, to move out and caused extensive damage he has said he couldn’t afford to repair. City records show that since that time, city inspectors have been foiled in attempts to hold anyone responsible for fixing the property. Farlow–whom the city once jailed over the property’s condition–previously said in an interview that the property already had a complicated legal situation following a dispute with Chase over mortgage payments, as he put the house in his mother’s name, filed bankruptcies and sought loan modifications. Meanwhile, Chase gave various and contradictory answers to inspectors about its responsibility for the property, according to city records, and maintains that the bank does not own the property, though county records say otherwise. Some confusion continued at the Feb. 3 hearing, where the case was on the court calendar twice under both Farlow’s and Chase’s names. Judge Schaefer finally called the case by saying, “That’s on JPMorgan Chase, Charles Farlow—and anyone else?” Doug Davis, an attorney for Farlow, claimed that Farlow “never owned this property. He just helped his mother.” She transferred the deed to Chase, he said. David Pernini, an attorney for Chase, did not directly addresses the bank’s denial that it owns the property. But he told the court that “we are in the process of getting a new titleholder of the property” and wants to make sure that any demolition costs are taken up by that new owner. “I’m fine with that,” Schaefer said. Following the recent neighborhood petition effort, the city returned to court in January and got an order allowing inspectors to enter the property and determine whether it’s a public safety hazard. With public safety issues, the city can take action with court approval regardless of who owns the property. Willard said the city estimates the tree removal will cost about $3,690 and the house demolition could cost as much as $30,000. The city will do that work itself and will seek reimbursement through a lien placed on the property, if the court later approves it. That lien would supersede any others except for tax liens, Willard said. The house has some serious structural problems, Willard told the court, including “beams…that are deteriorated.” “It is a danger,” Willard said in an interview minutes before the court hearing. “It is also what you might call an attractive nuisance,” he said, meaning it could draw trespassers, as Farlow and neighbors say is already happening. The house dates to 1942 and may require abatement of lead paint and asbestos prior to demolition, which is why the city needs the environmental engineer’s inspection. That abatement is why the city estimates a demolition cost about double the typical amount, Willard said.

These three stocks may soon oblige. Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Feb 7, 2017 at 7:04AM Image source: Getty Images. Dividend stocks can be the foundation of a great retirement portfolio. Not only do the payments put money in your pocket, which can help hedge against any dips in the stock market, but they're usually a sign of a financially sound company. Dividends also give investors a painless opportunity to reinvest in a stock, thus compounding gains over time. However, not all income stocks live up to their full potential. Using the payout ratio -- i.e., the percentage of profits a company returns to its shareholders as dividends -- we can get a good read on whether or not a company has room to increase its dividend. Payout ratios between 50% and 75% are ideal. Here are three income stocks with payout ratios currently below 50% that could potentially double their dividend payments. Gilead Sciences, Inc. We'll begin the week by taking a closer look at a biotech behemoth that's potentially guilty of being too good: Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD). Gilead Sciences' claim to fame is its hepatitis C product portfolio (Harvoni, Sovaldi, and Epclusa). Gilead was the first company to bring an effective once-daily cure to pharmacy shelves, and it's not really relinquished its market share since. Its issues of late stem from its need to provide larger gross-to-net discounts to insurers for Harvoni, the HCV drug designed to treat the most common type of hepatitis C, genotype 1, and its having already nabbed the low-hanging fruit in the HCV market within the U.S. Image source: Getty Images. However, don't think for a moment that declining EPS and revenue estimates are a reason to avoid Gilead. For starters, Gilead's HCV products still have a massive market opportunity to hit. Even with the low-hanging fruit in the U.S. out of the way, Gilead has ample opportunity to treat the estimated 180 million people worldwide infected with hepatitis C. Even though some of these people aren't in countries where Gilead would receive the best margins, it nonetheless represents a long runway of opportunity. Not to mention the fact that none of Gilead's peers have even come close to improving the treatment timeframe and supplanting Gilead's therapies. Gilead Sciences is also a mammoth in the HIV treatment space. The company has around a half-dozen oral HIV innovations under its belt, with Stribild and Genvoya being among the most impressive and fastest growing treatments. Combined, Gilead's HCV and HIV franchises, along with its smaller approved therapies, should allow it to generate $15 billion or more in annual free cash flow through the end of the decade. This gives Gilead more than enough capital to seek out acquisitions and boost its shareholder yield. Remember, the last time Gilead made a big acquisition it acquired Pharmasset's leading asset, which spawned its HCV line of drugs. Currently paying out $1.88 annually (a 2.6% dividend yield), but slated to earn in excess of $10.50 per share each year through 2019, Gilead is a strong candidate to double its payout to shareholders. Union Pacific Corporation Another attractive rebound candidate is railroad giant Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), which just finished up a challenging 2016. With commodity prices still challenged, Union Pacific found the sledding tough in most of its major freight categories. Coal freight revenue fell 6% in the fourth quarter, while chemicals were flat. The lone bright spot was agricultural products, where freight revenue rose 7%. Image source: Union Pacific. The good news is that a number of macroeconomic factors are looking up in 2017. For instance, consumer confidence is improving, which is great news for a cyclical logistics company like Union Pacific. Even more intriguing, energy prices are on the mend. Though higher energy prices boost its diesel fuel costs, they also have a positive impact on other commodity costs, as well as on Union Pacific's pricing power per carload. Despite its 2016 weakness, Union Pacific also managed to improve its operating ratio by 120 basis points to 62%. The key reason Union Pacific was able to improve its margin in the face of a weak commodity market was its stringent cost-cutting. As noted by my Foolish colleague Joe Tenebruso, Union Pacific reduced its locomotive count by 5%, while trimming its train, engine, and yard workforce by 7%. Having levers to pull is a nice thing for a cyclical logistics company when commodity prices can seemingly change at the flip of a switch. Considering that locomotives are a more fuel-efficient mode of transport than trucks as a function of total freight transported, it's unlikely that we're going to see freight transport by rail decline for any extended period of time. With Union Pacific currently paying out $2.42 annually (a 2.3% dividend yield), but on track for more than $8 in full-year EPS by 2020, a doubling of its dividend could be possible over the next five-to-10 years. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Sticking with the theme of gigantic companies, the last attractive income stock this week is money center bank JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). JPMorgan Chase has been hindered by a confluence of factors in recent years. For example, dovish monetary policy from the Federal Reserve has constrained its net interest margins, all while tougher regulations imposed from the Fed increased its expenses and reduced existing paths to profitability. As icing on the cake, the banking sector has been a pin cushion for fines since the Great Recession, most of which stem from its mortgage practices. Image source: Getty Images. On the plus side, these issues appear to be in the rearview mirror now. Though the Fed has only raised its benchmark federal funds rate twice over the past decade, it's firmly switched from a dovish to hawkish monetary policy. This lends hope that interest rates are going to head higher in the months and years to come. Higher interest rates help boost the net interest income banks generate from their variable loans. According to JPMorgan Chase's latest analysis, a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term lending rates would add $2.8 billion in additional net interest income, while a 200-basis-point increase in both would lead to $4.5 billion in additional interest income. For what it's worth, 200 basis points would be very close to the Fed's targeted rate of 3%. Also, JPMorgan Chase stands to benefit from the possibility of relaxed regulations in the banking industry under the Trump administration. If Trump holds to his word and removes a number of banking regulations, it would become substantially easier for JPMorgan Chase and its peers to return money to shareholders. Currently, JPMorgan Chase is paying out $1.92 annually (a 2.3% dividend yield), but Wall Street is looking for $7.47 in full-year EPS by 2018. This would appear to be a recipe for a higher payout ratio and a bigger dividend in JPMorgan's future. Sean Williams has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The lingering winter smog over large tracts of northern China, it seems, encouraged more to avoid not only the annual scrum in travelling to meet relatives, but exposing themselves any further to the worsening air quality, it said. The investment giant underlines it still maintains a cautious view for the airline sector this year, but it’s certainly hard to ignore the thumping 30 per cent rise in international revenue passenger kilometers growth (a measure of sales volume of passenger traffic) compared to a year ago, from late December to the first three weeks of January. “This demand pick-up was pretty unexpected as Chinese airlines have been busy cutting international capacity growth since October, due to industry overcapacity and the collapsing yield,” said JP Morgan’s Boyong Liu. International consultancy firm Mckinsey & Company has highlighted China’s tourism industry as an economic bright spot as people earn more and head overseas in greater numbers. Mckinsey predicts China’s middle class will likely account for 54 per cent of urban households and 56 per cent of urban private consumption by 2022, and as a dark cloud, literally, continues to hang over many parts of the country, more are being encouraging to seek a break from the hazardous murk, overseas, it says. This demand pick-up was pretty unexpected as Chinese airlines have been busy cutting international capacity growth since October, due to industry overcapacity and the collapsing yield Boyong Liu, JP Morgan In December, Ctrip.com, one of China’s largest online travel agents, estimated 150,000 travelled abroad with the sole intention of giving their lungs a rest, and predicts a one million to do so annually, creating a whole new “reason to travel”. New phrases to emerge from the gloom are “smog holidays”, being taken by “smog refugees”. On two particularly bad days, December 16 and 17, international travel bookings soared, according to JP Morgan’s Liu. But again, he cautions these travellers off in search of fresher surroundings are unlikely to help the overall industry stay robust through the year, as they are not a sustainable source of customers, for a sector which remains oversupplied, according to the report. “Capacity growth is expected to continue outpacing demand, particularly for international routes, and expect tourism yields to drop after the CNY peak,” Liu wrote. Liu does note there has been a nine per cent rebound in Chinese airlines’ share prices year-to-date, but still remains negative on earnings outlooks this year due to rising oil prices, a weaker yuan that is predicted to depreciate an additional four per cent this year. JP Morgan’s economics team says those negatives should shave around a quarter off domestic airline earnings. Similarly, CLSA analysts Rajani Khetan and Michael Luo, also offer an “Underweight” rating on the Chinese airline sector and recommend selling shares in three major Chinese airline companies: Air China, China Eastern Airlines, and China Southern Airlines. The two were optimistic about total international traffic growth for the three, but see likely weakness in some North Asian markets including Taiwan and South Korea due to political interventions. “We forecast Chinese airlines to see yield support from a better supply outlook in 2017,” said Khetan and Luo. “However, the negatives of higher fuel prices, the renminbi’s weakness and higher interest rates will comfortably offset any lift in yield.” This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Chinese carriers get a boost from ‘smog refugees’   Most Popular Viewed 1 China’s forex reserves drop below US$3 trillion 2 Why silence is golden for Chinese tycoons in 2017 3 Trump’s vision could set global trade back a century 4 The Chinese billionaire who rides the tiger can never get off 5 Amid slowdown, glimmers of hope for Singapore’s economy Shared 1 China’s forex reserves drop below US$3 trillion 2 Growing number of foreign firms shutting shop in China 3 Amid slowdown, glimmers of hope for Singapore’s economy 4 Why silence is golden for Chinese tycoons in 2017 5 Beijing seeks to enhance ‘soft power’ with climate U-turn Commented 1 Vice-chancellor does not deserve Hong Kong 2 CY slams Tsang over public housing plan 3 John Tsang pledges to reboot city’s political reform debate 4 John Tsang walking a fine line in trying to please all 5 Hong Kong food trucks see mixed sales after holiday stretch       You may also like China Why China’s communists struggle with succession planning 6 Feb 2017 - 12:47am 34 Tech companies have women in mind In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Business Amid slowdown, glimmers of hope for Singapore’s economy 6 Feb 2017 - 12:24pm 17 A leap into perfection Sponsored by: Jaeger-LeCoultre China Ivanka visit ‘shows China wants to forge ties with Trump’ 6 Feb 2017 - 11:35pm 10 Business Luck turns for Vietnam’s gamblers 7 Feb 2017 - 4:23pm Hong Kong Russian’s death-defying video sparks Hong Kong investigation 7 Feb 2017 - 5:45pm 19 Insight & Opinion End these miserly ways and put our money to better use 6 Feb 2017 - 10:01am 13 Hong Kong A brief history of Hong Kong’s triad gangs 6 Feb 2017 - 10:17am 10 Post Magazine Missing plane-crash gold on a Hong Kong hillside? 3 Feb 2017 - 12:53pm 7 Hong Kong The luxury hotel turned tycoon hideout away from prying mainland eyes 2 Feb 2017 - 5:27pm 16 Culture 41 years of photographing Hong Kong and China by David Wong 2 Feb 2017 - 5:21pm 1 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

In the wake of the immigration order, many global companies spoke out against the new policy in an effort to reassure employees. [See: 10 Things They Don't Tell You About Your First Job.] Below are responses from several industry giants, including tech leaders, across the globe, as well as some advice on how to navigate these changes in the workplace: -- In an email to staff, Apple's CEO Tim Cook expressed his opposition to the ban, stating, "It is not a policy we support," and quoting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: "We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat now." Cook noted that the immigration order is having a direct impact on Apple employees, stating, "Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them." -- Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos sent employees a memo that expressed the company's opposition to the ban and offered "full support" to people affected by it. Amazon's human resources department emailed employees last weekend to request that they avoid traveling internationally if the new restrictions might prevent them from re-entering the country. Amazon -- which reportedly has 49 employees born in countries affected by the travel ban -- has also joined a lawsuit against the ban. -- In an open letter to staff, Starbucks' CEO Howard Schultz announced that the coffee company not only condemns the president's order, but has plans to hire 10,000 people who are recognized by the United Nations as refugees. Schultz assured employees of Starbucks' commitment to address the order, noting that the company would "neither stand by, nor stand silent, as the uncertainty around the new Administration's actions grows with each passing day." [See: 10 Reasons to Quit Your Job Already.] -- Google ordered its employees overseas to return home immediately, while CEO Sundar Pichai wrote to employees: "It's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues. We've always made our view on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so." -- CEO Bill McDermott of SAP SE, the largest tech company in Europe, sent employees a letter of reassurance that emphasized the company's nondiscrimination policies. In the letter, McDermott wrote, "To all our nervous families wondering about your place in the world, we are always in your corner." -- A memo sent to JPMorgan staff from the company's operating committee stated that the Wall Street bank had "worked to reach out to all JPMorgan Chase employees on sponsored visas who are potentially impacted by the recent orders." The memo emphasized the company's "unwavering commitment" to its employees, including "a number of our outstanding employees -- all of whom have adhered to our country's immigration and employment processes -- who have come to the United States to serve our company, clients and communities." Business Insider reported that the company also set up a hotline for employees who could be affected by the travel ban. No matter where you work and whether your employer's leadership team made a specific announcement about their corporate response to the new immigration policy, there are steps you can take to begin to navigate these evolving changes in the workplace: Know who's affected by the ban. Global companies across diverse industries may be affected by the new immigration policy. Though the policy has generated some confusion, it has affected the ability of people -- including company employees with valid visas -- from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen to enter the U.S. This means some of your global colleagues may be impacted personally even if you aren't. [See: How to Follow Up on a Job Application Without Being Annoying.] Plan travel accordingly. If you're being sent on an international business trip, be aware of the new immigration policy, and be sure to plan global travel accordingly. While lawsuits like the one filed by Amazon mentioned above are in progress, it will take time to see what evolves, and there has already been much confusion about where green card holders, those with visas and dual citizens stand under the new policy. Human resources can provide more information about your company's travel policies and how they may be affected by the travel ban. Discuss issues or concerns with your boss or HR. If you're uncertain how the Trump administration's new policy might affect you or your work group, request additional information from your supervisor or your human resources team. While the situation is still unfolding, HR should be able to provide the best guidance internally on what the travel ban means for employees and the proper procedures to follow for those affected.

Revenue beat forecasts and the company also raised its quarterly dividend to 57 cents per share from 51 cents. Hasbro's results were helped by holiday season demand for its Disney Princess and "Frozen"-themed dolls. FedEx — The stock was upgraded to "outperform" from "market perform" at Raymond James, which has a price target of $210 compared to the current price of $188.21. Tyson Foods — The poultry, beef, and pork producer earned $1.59 per share for its latest quarter, above estimates of $1.26 a share. Revenue also beat Street forecasts. Tyson's earnings for the quarter were a record high, as was its operating margins. It also raised its full-year forecast above current consensus estimates. Newell Brands — The household products maker earned an adjusted 80 cents per share for its latest quarter, matching Street forecasts. Revenue was below forecasts, however. Newell raised its full-year outlook, as it benefits from increased sales, cost savings, and other factors. Tiffany — Tiffany announced that Chief Executive Officer Frederic Cumenal is stepping down. Cumenal is being replaced at the helm of the luxury goods retailer by chairman Michael Kowalski, who had preceded Cumenal as CEO. Walt Disney — Disney CEO Robert Iger may extend his term in that job for a third time, according to The Wall Street Journal. Iger is scheduled to retire in 16 months, but the paper notes there's no successor in sight following the departure of former chief operating officer Tom Staggs last year. Toyota — Toyota raised its full-year profit outlook by nearly 10 percent, with a weaker yen a major contributor to the automaker's improved outlook. Cost-cutting at Toyota is also helping its bottom line. JPMorgan Chase — JPMorgan received a license to underwrite corporate bonds in China, becoming the first U.S.-based bank to be granted such a license. Alphabet — Alphabet's Google unit has been ordered to turn over emails stored overseas, the opposite ruling seen in an earlier case involving Microsoft. Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft — The three are among the biggest tech names filing a legal brief opposing President Donald Trump's immigration ban, saying it inflicts "significant harm on American business." Amazon.com — Amazon is targeting a gradual rollout of what ultimately will be 2,000 grocery stores, according to the New York Post, with projected profit margins at 22 percent to 40 percent. Laboratory Corp. — The medical lab operator is in talks to acquire privately held contract researcher Pharmaceutical Product Development for more than $8 billion, according to a Reuters report. PPD was taken private in 2011 for $3.9 billion. CBS — CBS was upgraded to "overweight" from "neutral" at Atlantic Equities, which also increased its target price to $78 from $61. The firm points to benefits from the company's All Access service, improving content, and the idea that CBS could be an ideal merger and acquisition candidate. TrueCar — The stock was upgraded to "outperform" from "sector perform" at RBC Capital, which cites the car buying service's fundamentals and valuation, among other factors. General Electric — Germany's Siemens ran a successful test of 3D-printed gas turbine blades. That gave a slight boost to shares of GE in pre-market trading, with GE having bought two 3D printing firms in 2016 and putting its first 3D-printed aircraft component into service last year.

The license enables JPMorgan to underwrite debt financing instruments issued by non-financial entities, including commercial papers, medium-term notes and other instruments approved by regulators, it said. The license was granted by the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII), which oversees the Chinese interbank bond market, said a statement issued by JPMorgan. China is the third largest bond market in the world with 43.7 trillion yuan ($6.37 trillion) outstanding at the end of 2016 with the interbank bond market accounting for over 90 percent, according to China Central Depository & Clearing Co. In September last year, JPMorgan was granted a business license to operate a fully owned fund management business in China, allowing it to set up an office in Shanghai free-trade zone.

Zubi Advertising i By Chabeli Herrera cherrera@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Global advertising and communications firm GTB has acquired Coral Gables-based Zubi Advertising Services, GTB announced last week, in a strategic move to better cater to the Hispanic consumer. Zubi, founded in 1976 by Cuban-born Tere Zubizarreta, is a full-service agency that focuses on the Hispanic market. It counts Ford Motor Company, J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, and Dunkin’ Donuts among its clients. The agency also has offices in Los Angeles and Detroit, and employs about 120 people. Following Zubizarreta’s death in 2007, her children, Joe Zubi and Michelle Zubizarreta, now run the agency as chief operating officer and chief administrative officer, respectively. “This affiliation is part of our evolution to provide our clients with best-in-class resources and to work together to grow through new business opportunities,” said Joe Zubi of the acquisition in a statement. “Michelle and I are confident that the legacy of Tere Zubi will continue for decades to come.” Michigan-headquartered GTB was founded in 2007 and changed its name last year after combining three agencies that handled Ford business: Team Detroit, Blue Hive and Retail First. The agency is wholly owned by WPP, the world’s largest communications services group with offices in 113 countries.

REUTERS/Terray Sylvester    Giant Public Pension Calls Divesting From Dakota Pipeline An ‘Ineffective Strategy’ Chris White 3:22 PM 02/07/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5467040 Staff members at the largest retirement pension in the U.S. believe the fund should continue investing in the Dakota Access pipeline despite calls for the group to sell off assets associated with the contentious project. California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) staff said divesting stocks of companies connected to the so-called DAPL might give the perception the fund is fighting companies that cause global warming, but it also limits CalPERS ability to change corporate behavior through engagement. They were responding to Democrats calling on California to pass legislation compelling the $300 billion fund divest from all companies investing in the project. The bill would compel CalPERS to sell off shares in Dakota Access LLC and Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the 1,178-mile-long project. It would also have to sever relations with Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan Chase, among others. “There is considerable evidence that divesting is an ineffective strategy for achieving social or political goals, since the consequence is generally a mere transfer of ownership of divested assets from one investor to another,” staff said Monday in its recommendation. The CalPERS Investment Committee plans to meet Feb. 13 in to discuss the bill’s merits. Citi Group and TD Bank of Canada are also being pressured by anti-fracking activists and members of the Standing Rock Sioux to halt any and all monetary backing of the company responsible for constructing the DAPL. They believe the project, which is slated to run underneath the Lake Oahe, could trample the tribe’s sacred ground and poison its water supply. Opposition to the multi-billion pipeline ratcheted up recently after President Donald Trump signed a pair of executive orders in January approving the construction of the DAPL and Keystone XL. The Army Corps of Engineers, through the Obama administration, rejected the route Dakota was supposed to take across Lake Oahe. Democrats have targeted CalPERS in the past. Democratic Congressmen Ted Lieu and Mark DeSaulnier, for instance, sent a letter to the fund’s CEO Anne Stausboll in March 2016 suggesting the pension fund’s decision to invest in Exxon Mobil is “morally suspect.” The letter urged CalPERS to purge all of its assets in the oil company — if not for the climate, the lawmakers argue, then at least to put the pension fund in line with other major institutions choosing divestment. The fund is making the argument against those calling for divestment from DAPL that it made against Lieu and DeSaulnier: CalPERS will lose the “ability to influence companies if we divest.” CalPERS promised it would use an “aggressive” three-prong strategy against companies like Exxon and DAPL that includes “engagement, where we push for change at companies,” advocate companies make changes to better Earth’s climate, as well as integrate a company’s pro-climate decisions into the pension’s own investment decisions.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday that calls for a review of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law, which reshaped U.S. financial regulation after 2008-2009 crisis.  (Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP FILE PHOTO)   By Jennifer WellsBusiness Columnist Tues., Feb. 7, 2017 On the issue of financial regulation, Donald Trump sounds very much like he does on the NAFTA file. It’s a “disaster,” or “some aspects you could leave,” or a plan will be released that will come “close to a dismantling of Dodd-Frank,” or “we expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank.” Even after the president signed an executive order Friday directing a 120-day review of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act there’s no street consensus on how much of the act will get undone. Predictably, the president’s scant specifics are viewed through personal experience. So the fact that “friends of mine that have nice businesses . . . can’t borrow money, they just can’t get any money because the banks just won’t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations of Dodd-Frank” is a problem for the president. Trump was referring there to imposed higher capital standards. The act is a little more complicated than that. Passed by Congress six years ago, Dodd-Frank covers a vast landscape in its 848 pages, including swap markets, whistle blower protections, mortgage reform, anti-predatory lending and conflict minerals. It was Dodd-Frank’s push for transparency in the chain of minerals fuelling war in the Congo, and Canada’s inaction on the same issue, that prompted an on-the-ground Star investigation of artisanal miners near the Congo’s eastern border. So what we’re talking about here is legislation far more sweeping than that which affects Trump’s own “friends.” Article Continued Below But let’s stay on that point for a bit. When Trump referred to the banking woes of his pals, he was speaking at a gathering of his newly formed Strategy and Policy Forum, including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon (“There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie”) and Larry Fink, CEO of the supersized asset manager BlackStone (“Larry did a great job for me. He managed a lot of my money, and, I have to tell you, he got me great returns last year.”) What the putative populist has neglected to mention is that Dodd-Frank was of two-fold design: attempting to prevent another financial crisis by reining in the big banks and their risk-taking behaviour was one (who can forget the image of the collapsing Lehman Brothers in the fall of 2008). Protecting the little guy was the other. The part of the act that’s most vulnerable in Main Street terms is Title X — the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), referred to by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer as an “unconstitutional new agency that does not adequately protect consumers.” I have written about the bureau before, both for its clamping down on payday lenders and for the $100-million (U.S.) fine it levied against Wells Fargo for its “illegal practice of secretly opening unauthorized deposit and credit card accounts.” Remember, thousands of Wells Fargo employees were pushed to meet cross-selling sales targets and created phantom accounts to meet those goals. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren tore a strip off Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf before the Senate Banking Committee last September, saying that Stumpf should be both fired and criminally investigated. Stumpf was out the door a month later. Warren, zealous both in her advocacy for the little guy and her fight for rigorous financial industry regulation, was central to the bureau’s creation. In November, the bank disclosed that the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission were looking into its sales practices. It would be interesting to case study duped Wells Fargo clients to see how many voted for Trump in the belief that he would be the standard bearer for the average American once elected. To date the CFPB has collected $11.7 billion as a result of enforcement actions, and itemizes on its web page actions against misleading reverse mortgage advertising, pawnbrokers failing to disclose the true cost of loans, improper debt collection practices and on and on. As critics of the bureau point out, the Los Angeles Times first broke the story of the sales culture at Wells Fargo. Perhaps giving newspapers the power to take enforcement action and levy fines is the answer to the media’s financial challenges. That’s not going to happen. But a diligent free press and a well-armed consumer protection agency does make a potent force. The CFPB was a Republican target before Trump’s election. In October, the U.S. Court of Appeals declared the bureau’s single-director model unconstitutional, which could clear the way, if upheld, for Trump to remove Richard Cordray as head of the agency and introduce a commission model. Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chair of the Financial Services Committee, has been pushing to rename the bureau the Consumer Financial Opportunity Commission, with a mandate to protect not just consumers but markets. Undoubtedly, the president’s friends will like the sound of that. It’s the rest of us who won’t much like how it feels. jenwells@thestar.ca Read more about: Donald Trump Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    President Donald Trump's review of post-crisis banking rules could sound the death knell for new global standards now being finalized and rip apart a common approach to regulating international lenders, bankers and regulators said. Central banks and watchdogs around the world have spent the past eight years drawing up regulation aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, but there are fears that project could unravel after Trump said he wants the U.S. to row back on capital rules. Trump's order for a regulatory review to overcome what he sees as obstacles to lending came as banking watchdogs were trying to complete the final piece of global capital requirements, known as Basel III. Given that the United States wants to shrink the banking rule book, there are doubts over whether the Basel rules can make it over the finishing line next month if they don't have backing from the United States. Without support from the world's biggest capital market, other countries would be less willing to commit too. The core aim of the outstanding part of Basel III that regulators are working on - dubbed Basel IV by critical banks who worry about more stringent capital requirements - is to impose more consistency into how banks calculate the amount of capital they hold against risky assets like loans. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon said in the aftermath of the financial crisis that European rivals had been "a lot more aggressive" than American banks in calculating capital, meaning they were holding less. European policymakers have rejected that criticism, but their region's banks have been lobbying against the remaining Basel rules, saying they would force them to increase significantly the amount of capital they need to hold. If the United States fails to approve the completion of Basel III, the perceived problem that European banks get away with holding less capital than U.S. lenders may not be properly tackled, a source involved in the negotiations said. "It's in the interests of American banks to get this done," the source said. Others are less optimistic that a deal can now be done after Trump's intervention. "It's going to delay completing Basel III, and perhaps lead to it not being concluded," an adviser to banks said on condition of anonymity. "I do fear that Basel IV is doomed," a banking industry official added. There are headwinds from elsewhere, too. Patrick McHenry, Republican vice chairman of the House financial services committee, fired a warning shot at Federal Reserve Governor Janet Yellen about the Basel talks in a letter dated Jan. 31, ahead of Trump's executive order. The Fed must "cease" all attempts to negotiate binding standards "burdening American business" until the Trump Administration has had the opportunity to nominate officials that prioritize "America's best interests," McHenry said. While lawmakers often call on regulators to ease pressure on firms, regulators said Trump's intervention in banking rules gives more clout to McHenry's warning. The Basel Committee declined to comment.   GLOBAL COOPERATION Trump's decision to review existing, post-crisis banking rules has rung alarm bells among regulators outside the country. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, which regulates the euro zone's main lenders, said on Monday that easing banking rules could threaten financial stability. Draghi was chairman of the Group of 20 Economies' (G20) regulatory task force, the Financial Stability Board, which during the financial crisis was instrumental in building up a global approach to reinforcing banking standards. A former regulator said the United States would be scoring an own goal by withdrawing from multilateral bodies like Basel as it would no longer be shaping rules that impinge on U.S. banking competitiveness globally. "It's early days, but what we have seen in language and rhetoric from Washington is worrying," said David Wright, a former top EU official who was part of crisis-era efforts to create the global regulatory consensus. "If you break international consensus, you are effectively opening up a regulatory race and heaven knows where it will end," said Wright, now at Flint Global, which advises companies on regulatory matters. Wright was referring to what was seen in the run-up to the financial crisis, when countries like Britain resorted to a "light touch" approach to banks to make London a more attractive financial center. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU's financial services chief, said last week that international regulatory cooperation had been vital in tackling the financial crisis and must continue. Much will hinge on how much regulatory change Trump can actually push through. Former Democratic Congressman Barney Frank, who jointly sponsored the Dodd Frank Act that Trump wants to review, told the BBC last week he does not expect Congress to approve the wholesale rolling back of rules, but the Trump administration could pressure U.S. regulators to ease up on applying existing requirements. Anil Kashyap, a Bank of England policymaker, said last month that Trump's nomination for the powerful role of Fed Vice Chair in charge of banking supervision would shape the U.S. approach to international rule-making. It will have a "huge impact," a regulatory source added. The fear among global regulators is that multilateral bodies like the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board could be abandoned by the United States under Trump. Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri, chairman of Spain's Bankia, told Spanish television on Tuesday he would be concerned if Trump was questioning the usefulness of international banking rules. "It would worry me very much because I think it's very important, very relevant that there have been advances in the homogenization of regulation amongst developed countries," he said.    © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

A Wall Street sign hangs near the New York Stock Exchange in 2011. (Jin Lee / Associated Press) To the editor: I highly object to the headline, in that it mischaracterizes what’s actually happening. In truth, President Trump is planning to rescind protective measures for the nation’s consumers and the financial system. (“Trump orders review of Dodd-Frank financial regulations, suspends retirement advisor rule,” Feb. 3) For Trump to defer to JP Morgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon for advice on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act is like giving the fox the keys to the hen house. The idea that Trump’s business friends can’t get loans really means that we have been relieved from having to be responsible for their loan shortfalls.  I don’t appreciate this journalistic soft soaping of the executive branch’s self-serving intentions.  Sylvia Dohnal, Arcadia ..

He contends the rules are too strict and his friends have good businesses but cannot get loans.  If he would show us his tax returns, we could decide for ourselves if he took advantage of billions in loans before he took his corporations bankrupt. If he says he just took advantage of existing corporate laws, obviously those laws should remain strict — any relaxation is a further insult to our intelligence. Kevin H.

Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login Where will all the upside come from? Posted on February 7, 2017 by Nilus Mattive When it comes to money, I’m pretty conservative. And when it comes to investing, I’m downright paranoid. Yes, I’m willing to take risks. Occasionally, I’ll even take a big one if the payoff is really worth it. But overall, I believe in Warren Buffett’s first rule of investing — “Don’t lose money.” (This also happens to be his second rule of investing.) This is precisely why I’m not all that excited by stocks or bonds right now. Sure, we are starting four years under a business-friendly president. No doubt a Republican-controlled Congress will be wind in his sails, too. However, this is precisely why the S&P 500 has ALREADY had a very sharp post-election rally. And that’s just been the latest surge in a bull market that is already the second-oldest in history … As this bull market approaches its eighth year, can the good times continue? Most Wall Street prognosticators have answered in the affirmative. UBS analyst Julian Emanuel says the S&P 500 will hit 2,300 by year-end. JPMorgan’s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas has issued a similar target. Analysts from Citi and Deutsche Bank are even more bullish, calling for 2,325 and 2,350, respectively. While none of those predictions imply massive gains, they keep returns positive for 2017. Still, WHY should stocks continue to go higher? What fundamental developments haven’t yet been priced in? The S&P 500 is now trading at roughly 21 times last year’s earnings (though not all results are in yet, obviously). That’s about the highest level since 2002. If we’re about to see a new round of corporate earnings growth, this makes sense. However, I’m not clear where that growth is going to come from. I don’t believe it will come from infrastructure spending. I don’t believe it will come from a major new technological boom out of Silicon Valley. And I don’t believe it will come from surging demand in overseas markets that are struggling to stay afloat. I’m failing to see where it will come from at all. Therefore, I’d bet we’re closer to a top than a new basecamp when it comes to equities. No doubt I could be wrong, and I hope I am. But as I explained last month, I recently told my dad to take more than $54,000 in banked profits off the table … and for my Income Superstars newsletter, I am keeping my recommendations to tried-and-true investments that can survive market downdrafts and kick off dividends during periods of limited upside. Now, let’s look at bonds. We’ve already seen some air come out of fixed-income, which makes sense given a couple of interest-rate hikes. However, that cycle has probably just begun. Or at the very least, rates can’t reverse course very far. Do I want to lock in current bond yields for 10, 20 or 30 years? Not in a big way. Maybe for a small portion of a portfolio as a hedge and safety net. I would also continue to focus on more niche categories like GNMAs, TIPS, etc. It’s also worth reiterating that I don’t just see poor upside catalysts. I also see plenty of potential threats that most other investors seem to be ignoring. Misguided government policies are just one of those things. Look at what recently happened in India: Literally overnight, common forms of cash became illegal. People were forced to change their bills for new ones by a certain deadline. ATM withdrawals were restricted. Bank lines were long. And for many people living in a cash-based economy, chaos ensued. I’ve read accounts of rural citizens who couldn’t buy food at their markets, even one who died because there was no way to pay for needed healthcare. There are also less-extreme examples already playing out in more-industrialized areas. The European Union has banned 500-euro notes. Australia has a goal of becoming cash-free by 2022. Even in the United States, there has been plenty of talk about doing away with $100 bills. Speaking of Europe, we still have the very real possibility that the entire European Union will fall apart — which carries all sorts of implications to currencies, global trade and the entire financial system. We also can’t rule out the possibility of a new — and serious — geopolitical event. Saber-rattling from North Korea, increased tensions with China and other rumblings all bring some concerns in 2017 and beyond. While gold and silver don’t offer perfect protection against these possibilities, they offer more than most. That’s why I also think a small allocation to precious metals can make a lot of sense for many portfolios … even if these non-income-bearing investments are outside my usual realm of coverage. In short, I see relatively expensive investment valuations … few upside catalysts … and a lot of risk that isn’t priced in at all right now. But hey, maybe I’m just paranoid.

Almost a year into his tenure as chief executive officer of the U.K.’s largest private bank, Peter Flavel wants 30 percent of new clients to come from RBS. He’s already helped double internal referrals to 20 percent of new customers, Flavel said in an interview. “There’s enormous upside and potential for Coutts to work with the commercial bank” at RBS, Flavel, 56, said at the 325-year-old lender’s London headquarters. “While our greatest opportunity is our existing client base, the next opportunity is this relationship and collaboration.” Coutts is focusing on the U.K. market after RBS sold its international business as financial scandals in recent years underscored the risks of operating a global private bank. Switzerland’s financial regulator fined RBS 6.5 million Swiss francs ($6.5 million) earlier this month for violating money-laundering rules and illegally profiting from transactions associated with 1Malaysia Development Bhd. Flavel said the issue was handled by RBS and that he doesn’t deal with legacy issues. Crown Jewel A former CEO of Asia wealth management at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Flavel was brought in by RBS chief Ross McEwan in March with a mandate to pull Coutts into line after years of relative autonomy. Coutts rarely served the wealthy business owners that were already corporate clients of RBS, and former senior executives at the private bank had pushed for it to operate separately from RBS or even be sold, according to people familiar with the matter. “Some private banks try and run themselves separately from the universal bank,” said Flavel. “The way I look at it is that, if you’re running RBS, you would definitely want Coutts to be a part of the bank. It’s the jewel in the crown.” Read more: RBS’s efforts to boost Coutts profitability Coutts competes with domestic lenders offering private banking such as HSBC Holdings Plc and Barclays Plc, global firms including UBS Group AG and specialist money managers such as St. James’s Place Plc. It’s the largest firm offering full-service private banking from current accounts to loans and investments in Britain’s 1.3 trillion-pound ($1.6 trillion) wealth market. Coutts clients typically have at least 1 million pounds of assets to invest or seek to borrow a similar amount. The bank operates a separate IT platform from RBS and its  offices in central London, its home since 1904, has a pond with Japanese Koi carp in an ornate central atrium that belies RBS’s taxpayer ownership. The building, which the firm bought last year, has a special entrance reserved for the monarch. Revenue Increase RBS’s commercial bank, the largest in the U.K. with about 153 billion pounds of assets, could prove a rich source of potential customers, Flavel said. However, RBS is cutting back its investment bank, a business that typically helps attract customers seeking complex investments. RBS’s private-banking division, housing Coutts and its smaller Scottish counterpart Adam & Co., increased client assets under management to 16.6 billion pounds in September, from 13.5 billion pounds a year earlier, while lending rose from 11.1 billion pounds to 11.8 billion pounds. The unit increased revenue by 2 percent to 496 million pounds in the nine months through September from a year earlier, while costs excluding litigation and restructuring charges fell by 2 percent to 365 million pounds.

Although Flavel said he’ll maintain headcount at about 1,800 employees, he’ll cut administrative jobs as he looks to grow some parts of the business. The bank will invest more than 20 million pounds a year in digital and wealth operations for the next four years. RBS sold its international private banking business to Switzerland’s Union Bancaire Privee two years ago in a retreat from the global wealth market. The sale included businesses in Monaco, Singapore and Hong Kong and about 32 billion Swiss francs of assets under management. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

British firms target America after Brexit bruises the pound Silvia Amaro | @Silvia_Amaro Tuesday, 7 Feb 2017 | 8:57 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES Getty Images Two FTSE-listed companies have recently announced acquisitions in the U.S. and a third is reportedly in talks to do the same. These acquisitions are taking place despite a weaker pound, which means U.K. firms are currently paying a lot more to gain access to the United States. Analysts believe that the attractiveness of U.S. equities make such acquisitions a clever move in the medium to long term and news of further deals should be expected in the coming months. "The FTSE All-Share has a number of industry leading global companies. Some of these companies are looking to expand into new markets, or consolidate their position in existing markets. This is particularly pertinent for companies that want to boost their top-line growth," Callum Abbot, U.K. equity and fund manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC via email. "The U.S. equity market is attractive from this perspective as companies are exposed to the growing U.S. and global economies. The U.S. may be particularly attractive if the Trump administration follows through on its campaign policies including easy fiscal policy, corporate tax cuts and simplification of regulation," he added. So far, since the start of the year, the health goods producer Reckitt Benckiser agreed to buy baby food maker Mead Johnson Nutrition and British American Tobbaco is acquiring Reynolds American. Last week, news reports said that Sports Direct was in talks to acquire the U.S.-based retailer Eastern Outfitters. None of the companies above were available for comment. British American Tobacco said in an email to CNBC that the reasons for the purchase remain those outlined on January 17, when the deal was announced and did not want to make any further comment. At the time, the firm mentioned in a press release that the size of the U.S. market as well as a bigger exposure to high growth emerging markets were two of the main factors leading to the acquisition. "It is widely expected that monetary policy will tighten over the medium term, in fact, globally, bond yields have already started to rise. With this in mind, the window for taking on cheap debt is narrowing and so there is a time incentive to get deals done in the near term," Abbot from JP Morgan told CNBC. Tom Whelan, Hogan Lovells' global head of private equity, told CNBC over the phone that indeed there is room for further similar deals and "open to all sectors," but there is also interest from U.S. firms in the U.K. market. According to Whelan, companies decide on acquisitions always based on "strategic reasons". He added that fears over Trump's protectionism and border tax could be among such "strategic reasons". This is because, non-US-based companies could soon face further restrictions when buying a U.S. companies.

The gap between French and German 10-year borrowing costs widened to 78 basis points in early trades as nervous investors sought safety in low-risk German government bonds. Though the spread between the two narrowed as the session wore on, it remained near multi-year highs. Bets against French bonds had already risen dramatically in the wake of Donald Trump's surprise win in the U.S. election in November. These have intensified over the past two weeks as support for conservative challenger Francois Fillon has tumbled in the wake of a financial scandal. The former prime minister had been seen as a shoo-in for the Elysee palace before the scandal erupted, but opinion polls now show him crashing out in the first round. Fillon has lost ground to independent centrist Emmanuel Macron and, more alarmingly for investors, the anti-EU National Front leader Marine Le Pen. Le Pen promises to haul France out of the euro zone and hold a referendum on EU membership. But while Le Pen has long been expected to reach the spring election's second round, polls show her being soundly defeated in that runoff. As political uncertainty grows in France, the relationship between French and German bonds has weakened while that between French and lower-rated Italian debt has strengthened, suggesting French bonds are behaving more like peripheral peers. The correlation between daily changes in 10-year bond yields in France and Germany over a 60-day period is now lower than the equivalen correlation between French and Italian yields. The last time the correlations crossed over was early 2012 when Italian spreads widened and concerns over a euro breakup were on the rise, according to Thomson Reuters' IFR. "LE PEN CAN'T WIN" "The market is pricing in the tail risk of Le Pen winning the presidential elections," said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz. The phrase "tail risk" refers to an unlikely but potentially disruptive event. French Finance Minister Michel Sapin weighed in on Tuesday, saying some investors failed to understand France's electoral system and Le Pen would not win the election. "Those who, in good faith or by speculation, bet against France because they think Le Pen can win are not only wrong, but I'll be frank: they will lose a lot of money," he said. While his comments chimed voter surveys, Britain's Brexit vote and Donald Trump's U.S. election win revealed the depth of of anti-establishment feeling and highlighted the unreliability of opinion polls. BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, Richard Turnill, said in a note that he believed the risk priced into European markets around this year's French and German elections was overstated. Such sentiment helped push yields lower as the session wore on, with France's 10-year bond yield down 4 basis points on the day at 1.10 percent, and the gap to German equivalents narrowing to 73 bps. "There is always the conflict between fear and greed," said Commerzbank strategist David Schnautz. "I guess fear pushed the yields so high that some investors could not resist." The cost of insuring against volatility in the euro versus the dollar over the next three months rose to its highest in over a week on Tuesday as contracts took in the date of the final round of France's presidential vote. French stocks underperformed the pan-European STOXX 600 index, though traders ascribed this to a fall in banking shares after BNP Paribas shares reported sub-forecast fourth-quarter profits and its shares fell 4 percent. Doubts over a rescue package for Greece were also stoking concerns over the future stability of the euro zone. Greece's two-year bond yield topped 10 percent for the first time since June on growing worries over whether the European Union and the International Monetary Fund can reach an agreement over a third Greek bailout.

Two-thirds of U.S. non-profits working internationally experience banking problems, according to the survey commissioned by the Charity & Security Network and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (Survey: bit.ly/2kLTwqE) Fifteen percent of non-profits experienced those problems constantly or regularly. Smaller organizations were more likely to face banking barriers, the report found. Major western banks have pulled out of certain lines of business or parts of the world because they fear violating tighter U.S. regulations, a trend referred to as "de-risking." Those hit hardest include charities, money remittance services, and even entire regions. The most common problems charities face include delayed wire transfers, sometimes stretching into weeks, requests for more documentation, and higher fees, the survey found. Some non-profits see their accounts closed or banks refuse to open accounts for them in the first place. Non-profits are forced to use riskier ways to move money, including carrying cash, the report said. The Swasia Charity Foundation has had problems accessing banking services ever since it was founded in New Jersey in 2012 to provide aid to Syrians affected by the civil war, Rami Bitar, a board member, said in an interview. In 2014, Bank of America Corp blocked a transfer for about $35,000 because Swasia's treasurer mentioned the money was destined for an education program in a Syrian village. The bank asked for more information and in the end did not complete the transfer, Bitar said. The same year, JPMorgan Chase & Co gave the group two months' notice before it closed its account, Bitar said. "We did not inquire about why or whether they can do it or not," Bitar said. "We assumed the reason behind it is that we are a charity for the Syrian people and simply that was it." Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase declined to comment. Critics say the U.S. government is primarily concerned with stopping terrorist financing, an approach they argue drives transactions outside the formal financial system and makes it harder to track illicit activity. "They want the bad guys out and that's the only thing they're set up to do," said Scott Paul, senior humanitarian policy advisor at Oxfam America. A State Department official said the U.S. government's interests are served by charities being allowed to do their work, but that priority competes with that of protecting the global financial system from abuse. "It's not like there are great solutions that are leaping forward that are being ignored by anyone," said the official, on condition of anonymity. The Treasury Department declined to comment.

By Geof Wheelwright on February 7, 2017 Photo by Action Sports Photography / Shutterstock.com The Trump administration recently signaled it will move ahead with changes to U.S. financial regulations that could have a significant impact on American consumers, investors and borrowers. President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order called “Core Principles for Regulating the U.S. Financial System,” which he unveiled after a meeting with American business leaders including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty and Chairman and CEO of General Motors Mary Barra. Although not specifically named in the executive order, the president has said it will include a review of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a law passed in 2010 to help the nation recover from the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the subsequent Great Recession. Trump wants the review on his desk in 120 days. Targeting Dodd-Frank Last week, when announcing a planned cut in regulations for small businesses, Trump told a gathering of small-business leaders, “Dodd-Frank is a disaster. We’re going to be doing a big number on Dodd-Frank.”On Friday, he went on to say, “We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank, because, frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine that have nice businesses that can’t borrow money, they just can’t get any money because the banks just won’t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.” The new executive order is just one of a string of actions taken by both the new president and the Republican-controlled House and Senate in recent weeks to reduce oversight and regulation of the financial services industry and businesses. In addition, Republicans in the Senate have proposed the “Financial CHOICE Act” to roll back many of the financial services oversight rules put in place during President Barack Obama’s administration as it worked to help the economy recover from the financial crisis. Here’s are some of the key consumer protections that are likely targets for major change: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau In the administration’s crosshairs is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), established by the Dodd-Frank Act in July 2011. According to its website, the bureau’s mission is: [T]o make consumer financial markets work for consumers, responsible providers, and the economy as a whole. We protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices and take action against companies that break the law. We arm people with the information, steps, and tools that they need to make smart financial decisions. Among other initiatives, the bureau has fought to rein in payday lenders from taking advantage of borrowers, helped combat discrimination in lending and determine when credit card companies are misleading consumers about their reward programs. Now under consideration are these moves to defang the CFPB: Potential elimination of new federal CFPB rules on prepaid cards: Last week a group of Republican lawmakers introduced a joint resolution to “disapprove” of a new rule that would have required greater accountability from issuers of prepaid cards. The rule, designed to ensure that users of prepaid cards were provided with most of the same protections as users of traditional bank-issued debit cards (including disclosure of fees and a limit on consumer liability when cards are lost or stolen), was slated to take effect this fall but would not if the resolution passes. Structure of the CFPB (and likely its very survival): Last year, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling said in a speech that the CFPB needs a major overhaul and a different leadership structure. “The CFPB may arguably be the single most powerful and least accountable federal agency in the history of our nation,” he said. “The CFPB director — one man — has the unbridled and unprecedented power to unilaterally declare virtually any mortgage, credit card or bank account ‘unfair’ or ‘abusive’ at which point Americans can’t have it – even if they need it, want it, understand it and can afford it.” Courts have also weighed in on the structure of the CFPB and its constitutionality. White House press secretary Sean Spicer also declined to rule out elimination of the CFPB when asked a direct question about it last week. “I think we’ll have further updates on that (whether or not the CFPB will stay in place),” he said. “That’s an area that we need to work with Congress on.” Bank oversight The new administration’s drive to eliminate “red tape” affecting consumers, small businesses and corporations puts a couple of rules that beef up bank oversight at risk: Mortgage lending:  Loose lending practices contributed heavily to the subprime mortgage crisis and widespread foreclosures that sparked the financial crisis 10 years ago. If new rules introduced to help troubled borrowers are now treated the same way as the rules on prepaid cards (discussed above), and therefore end up not being implemented, homeowners may face fewer options to avoid foreclosure. One example of such a rule was introduced by the CFPB last year. It aims to help borrowers who apply for “loss mitigation” — a process whereby the holder of the loan (such as a bank or mortgage company) is supposed to work with a struggling borrower to try and find alternatives to foreclosure. The updated rules are designed to ensure that borrowers get that help — and if the rules aren’t implemented as planned, borrowers may not get it. Potential elimination of the Volcker Rule: This provision of Dodd-Frank prevents banks from making what could be perceived as risky investments with bank money. Critics of the rule have suggested it stifles “entrepreneurship” by banks, while supporters maintain that it ensures banks don’t make unwise investments and then ask the taxpayers to bail them out. More to come You can be sure that there are many more changes ahead, particularly as Trump receives and acts on the report he has requested in his recent executive order. The order lays out the following “core principles” for financial services reform: (a) empower Americans to make independent financial decisions and informed choices in the marketplace, save for retirement, and build individual wealth; (b) prevent taxpayer-funded bailouts; (c) foster economic growth and vibrant financial markets through more rigorous regulatory impact analysis that addresses systemic risk and market failures, such as moral hazard and information asymmetry; (d) enable American companies to be competitive with foreign firms in domestic and foreign markets; (e) advance American interests in international financial regulatory negotiations and meetings; (g) restore public accountability within federal financial regulatory agencies and rationalize the federal financial regulatory framework.

Central banks and watchdogs around the world have spent the past eight years drawing up regulation aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, but there are fears that project could unravel after Trump said he wants the U.S. to row back on capital rules. Trump's order for a regulatory review to overcome what he sees as obstacles to lending came as banking watchdogs were trying to complete the final piece of global capital requirements, known as Basel III. Given that the United States wants to shrink the banking rule book, there are doubts over whether the Basel rules can make it over the finishing line next month if they don't have backing from the United States. Without support from the world's biggest capital market, other countries would be less willing to commit too. The core aim of the outstanding part of Basel III that regulators are working on - dubbed Basel IV by critical banks who worry about more stringent capital requirements - is to impose more consistency into how banks calculate the amount of capital they hold against risky assets like loans. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon said in the aftermath of the financial crisis that European rivals had been "a lot more aggressive" than American banks in calculating capital, meaning they were holding less. European policymakers have rejected that criticism, but their region's banks have been lobbying against the remaining Basel rules, saying they would force them to increase significantly the amount of capital they need to hold. If the United States fails to approve the completion of Basel III, the perceived problem that European banks get away with holding less capital than U.S. lenders may not be properly tackled, a source involved in the negotiations said. "It's in the interests of American banks to get this done," the source said. Others are less optimistic that a deal can now be done after Trump's intervention. "It's going to delay completing Basel III, and perhaps lead to it not being concluded," an adviser to banks said on condition of anonymity. "I do fear that Basel IV is doomed," a banking industry official added. There are headwinds from elsewhere, too. Patrick McHenry, Republican vice chairman of the House financial services committee, fired a warning shot at Federal Reserve Governor Janet Yellen about the Basel talks in a letter dated Jan. 31, ahead of Trump's executive order. The Fed must "cease" all attempts to negotiate binding standards "burdening American business" until the Trump Administration has had the opportunity to nominate officials that prioritize "America's best interests", McHenry said. While lawmakers often call on regulators to ease pressure on firms, regulators said Trump's intervention in banking rules gives more clout to McHenry's warning. The Basel Committee declined to comment. GLOBAL COOPERATION Trump's decision to review existing, post-crisis banking rules has rung alarm bells among regulators outside the country. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, which regulates the euro zone's main lenders, said on Monday that easing banking rules could threaten financial stability. Draghi was chairman of the Group of 20 Economies' (G20) regulatory task force, the Financial Stability Board, which during the financial crisis was instrumental in building up a global approach to reinforcing banking standards. A former regulator said the United States would be scoring an own goal by withdrawing from multilateral bodies like Basel as it would no longer be shaping rules that impinge on U.S. banking competitiveness globally. "It's early days, but what we have seen in language and rhetoric from Washington is worrying," said David Wright, a former top EU official who was part of crisis-era efforts to create the global regulatory consensus. "If you break international consensus, you are effectively opening up a regulatory race and heaven knows where it will end," said Wright, now at Flint Global, which advises companies on regulatory matters. Wright was referring to what was seen in the run-up to the financial crisis, when countries like Britain resorted to a "light touch" approach to banks to make London a more attractive financial centre. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU's financial services chief, said last week that international regulatory cooperation had been vital in tackling the financial crisis and must continue. Much will hinge on how much regulatory change Trump can actually push through. Former Democratic Congressman Barney Frank, who jointly sponsored the Dodd Frank Act that Trump wants to review, told the BBC last week he does not expect Congress to approve the wholesale rolling back of rules, but the Trump administration could pressure U.S. regulators to ease up on applying existing requirements. Anil Kashyap, a Bank of England policymaker, said last month that Trump's nomination for the powerful role of Fed Vice Chair in charge of banking supervision would shape the U.S. approach to international rule-making. It will have a "huge impact", a regulatory source added. The fear among global regulators is that multilateral bodies like the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board could be abandoned by the United States under Trump. Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri, chairman of Spain's Bankia, told Spanish television on Tuesday he would be concerned if Trump was questioning the usefulness of international banking rules. "It would worry me very much because I think it's very important, very relevant that there have been advances in the homogenization of regulation amongst developed countries," he said.

Morgan Stanley & Co. has been hired as the leading underwriter for the IPO, alongside the investment banking units of Banco Bradesco SA, Credit Suisse AG, Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, JPMorgan Chase & Co and UBS AG, according to the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. Reuters reported in October that Bain Capital LP, Intermédica’s controlling shareholder, was considering listing the company to take advantage of growing investor demand for shares of healthcare and personal services companies in Brazil. The banks and Intermédica declined to comment. NotreDame Intermédica, a low-cost health insurer, has managed to ride out a deep recession in Brazil by picking up customers at the expense of its higher-priced peers. Intermédica’s IPO would add to a flurry of bond and equity offerings so far this year, the busiest such period in at least six years, as investors show confidence that South America’s largest economy will emerge from the recession and implement much-needed fiscal, pension and labor reforms this year.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search How Much Will Banks Actually Benefit From Trump’s Nixing Of Dodd-Frank? February 7, 2017 6:40am NYSE:XLF ShareTweet From Brad Hoppmann: During the presidential campaign, candidate Donald Trump often criticized Wall Street and the banking system for its role in America’s financial difficulties. On Friday, President Trump did an about-face of sorts. He embraced some of Wall Street’s brightest luminaries and did something that the financial industry has wanted for nearly seven years. The president signed executive orders that begin the process of rolling back financial industry regulations. With industry leaders such as Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock (BLK), and Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan (JPM), gathered around him, Trump proudly put his signature on executive orders designed to dismantle Dodd-Frank. The 2010 law was put in place as a response to the 2008 financial crisis. But critics say it stifles bank activity, and tightens bank lending. Now, the Trump administration has essentially laid out at least the beginnings of a framework that’s aimed at undoing those regulations. The executive orders instruct heads of regulatory agencies to report back to him within 120 days with suggestions on ways to change existing financial regulations. As you might expect, banking and financial stocks vaulted higher on the news. Now the question is who will likely benefit most, and what does that mean for investors? That’s the conclusion from sector analysts at Morningstar. In an article on the company’s website, Morningstar analysts offered up the following assessment of the Trump action:Despite the rise in large-cap financial stocks Friday (and since Election Day), at least one group of analysts says that any banking deregulation is “no panacea for big banks.” We see Trump’s plans as an opening salvo in an effort to ease the regulatory burden on the nation’s banks. However, efforts to repeal or replace the law in its entirety will be far more difficult, and we don’t expect significant boosts to banks’ profitability in the near future as a result of the rule review alone. I agree with the assessment that the “near future” isn’t likely to see a jump in bank bottom lines. After all, Washington’s wheels grind slowly, and any rewrite of the Dodd-Frank law will take time. It also will cost the president some significant amount of political capital. Yet that doesn’t mean financial stocks won’t continue to trade higher based on the expectation of a lightened regulatory burden. After all, think about the run higher in not only financials, but in the major market indices nearly across the board since Election Day. The Financial SPDR (XLF) is up 13.5% since the U.S. election. Sure, the economic data has improved over the past couple of months (albeit slightly). But that’s not the reason for the buying. The reason for the buying is all about the great expectations of growth that might be engineered by the Trump policies. A rollback of Dodd-Frank and other financial industry regulations is a step in the right direction in terms of making that growth a reality. But there’s still a long way to go before we can actually start seeing corporate bottom lines benefit. The same is true for the all-important corporate tax reform proposals. Wall Street would love to see corporate taxes go to 20% from 35%. In fact, the Trump administration’s goal on this front is far more important than rewriting Dodd-Frank. Yet so far, we’ve seen mixed signals on corporate tax reform, at least in terms of urgency. Rumblings out of Washington point to as far away as 2018 for any real progress on corporate tax reform. And that’s not good news for bulls who hope the 2017 rally will continue. So, is Dodd-Frank reform a good thing, and will it juice up the economy? Generally, I say yes, but it depends on how the law is amended. It depends whether a rewrite helps banks lend more freely. If lending does get easier, and banks are able to open up their vaults to borrowers, then that will be good for American business. The same goes for the economy at large, for banking and financial stocks — and, of course, for investors with exposure to these sectors. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) rose $0.05 (+0.21%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, XLF has gained 1.55%, versus a 2.42% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. XLF currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 38 ETFs in the Financial Equities ETFs category.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) An Indonesian court postponed on Tuesday the hearing of a billion-dollar dispute between Goldman Sachs and a local tycoon by two weeks, granting him time to gather more evidence to prove a claim the US bank’s unit unlawfully sold shares he owned. Goldman had taken the unusual step of counter-suing the retail-to-property businessman – Benny Tjokrosaputro – in a Jakarta court claiming reputational damage. The court hearing on Tuesday was set to have given Tjokrosaputro a chance to rebuff Goldman’s assertion, but it is now delayed until Feb. 21. Watch what else is in the news The dispute comes at a time when Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, is embarking on its biggest drive for foreign investment in a decade. Its government recently raised investor concerns by cutting business ties with JPMorgan over a negative research report and partially reversing a mining policy. At stake in the Goldman case is the protection of the rights of foreigners, amid a general lack of transparency in Indonesian court proceedings, legal experts say. “This lack of transparency can result in very surprising decisions, especially when you have a foreign party seeking recovery from a well-resourced and well-connected local party,” Bill Sullivan, senior foreign counsel at Indonesian law firm Christian Teo & Partners, told Reuters in an email. Goldman’s dispute with Tjokrosaputro, president director of property developer PT Hanson International Tbk, stems from an arcane area of the financial market in which individuals or firms sell shares in return for short-term funding, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter. Such a repurchase agreement, or a repo, effectively acts as a loan but the deal involves temporarily transferring legal ownership of the shares. Tjokrosaputro had pledged 425 million Hanson shares to US hedge fund Platinum Partners in return for funding on the basis that he could get the shares back upon repayment, according to Tjokrosaputro’s lawyers and court documents. Goldman Sachs International, a London-based unit of Goldman, bought the Hanson shares from Platinum as a hedge for the derivatives it had entered into with the fund, a bank spokesman said. In late 2014, New York-based Platinum fell into financial difficulties and had trouble paying back a large number of investors, according to US authorities who recently charged top executives of the fund with running a $1 billion fraud. Goldman started selling the Hanson shares last year, but was forced to stop after Tjokrosaputro filed a police complaint. He went on to sue Goldman in September for 15 trillion rupiah ($1.1 billion), alleging the transaction was conducted “unlawfully”. In response, Goldman counter-sued the tycoon last month for at least $1.1 billion. Goldman “lawfully” acquired the shares from Platinum through the negotiated board of the Indonesian Stock Exchange and the transactions were validly settled, it says in its court documents. A key area of the dispute relates to who actually owned the shares during the repo transaction. Goldman says in its court filings that it “understands” Platinum originally acquired the Hanson shares from an entity named Newrick Holdings Ltd, rather than from Tjokrosaputro. According to the “Panama Papers” online database as of 2015, which compiled millions of leaked documents from law firm Mossack Fonseca, Newrick is a company registered in the British Virgin Islands in which Tjokrosaputro was a shareholder. A bank spokesman told Reuters that Goldman Sachs International was not aware of any dealings between Tjokrosaputro or his affiliated entities and Platinum Partners, nor any restrictions on the shares it purchased. The tycoon’s lawyer reiterated on Tuesday that Tjokrosaputro was the legal owner of the shares in the repo transaction with Platinum and, since he did not breach any contract with Platinum, only he had the right to sell them. Tjokrosaputro’s lawyer did not immediately provide comment on Goldman’s claim that Platinum had acquired the shares from Newrick. Platinum has earlier declined to comment on the dispute.

The JPMorgan Chase CEO stood amid the tumult and said the market was cheap. He backed up his belief by purchasing 500,000 shares of his company's stock, which was tanking at the time. He never actually called a market trough, but many in the market since then have referred to it as the "Dimon bottom." Much has been made of the move and deservedly so considering the profit Dimon made on that purchase — what appears now to be a $17 million gain on a $26.6 million investment, just based on the shares purchased that day. That's based on where JPMorgan stock was compared with where it is now. And that doesn't even account for the total profit he made on his holdings. The Feb. 11, 2016, purchase came at an average price of $53.18. The stock closed Friday at $87.18, equaling a $34 per share gain, or 64 percent. Bank shares actually saw mediocre performance through much of the year, but a late-year rally fueled by Donald Trump 's upset victory in the presidential race sent financial stocks soaring. JPMorgan shares are up 24 percent since Election Day. The purchase brought Dimon's total holdings in his bank to about 6.75 million shares, which would have been worth $359 million at the time. Assuming that $34 per share profit since the buy, his total profit comes to around $229.4 million. To be sure, it was a bold move that could have gone otherwise. At the time, there were fears of a global recession brought on by a slowdown in China. Investors worried that Deutsche Bank was in major trouble, the Federal Reserve appeared determined to raise interest rates even amid the difficulties and political uncertainty was running high. Warren Buffett is fond of saying that he is fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful. For Dimon, it's a lesson that paid off handsomely.

 JPMorgan on Brexit white paper: 'Shallowness of the analysis and absence of detail are matters of great concern' Oscar Williams-Grut Feb. 3, 2017, 4:29 AM 2,015 facebook linkedin twitter email print Brexit Secretary David Davis. PA Wire/PA Images LONDON — JPMorgan has delivered a scathing verdict on the government's Brexit white paper setting out plans for leaving the European Union, calling it shallow and lacking in detail. The government on Thursday published a 78-page document setting out its official negotiating position for Britain leaving the EU, fleshing out the 12 objectives Prime Minister Theresa May outlined in a speech last month. Malcolm Barr, an economist who covers the UK at the Wall Street bank, gives a damning verdict of the document, saying it is far too light on detail and underestimates the size of the challenge facing Britain. Barr says in a note sent to clients on Thursday: "As a distillation of the state of knowledge within the UK government six months after the vote, and with the beginnings of a time-compressed negotiation just weeks away, the shallowness of the analysis and absence of detail are matters of great concern, in our view." He highlights a lack of detail on EEA membership, the UK’s likely liabilities upon leaving the EU, what regulatory bodies and regimes will need to be replaced upon exit, and says there is "no meaningful detail" on how the government will control migration. Barr says that the government is "misjudging both the political and practical scale of the task ahead" and warns "we see increasing grounds for concern that the plan as constituted cannot be credibly delivered." He says multinationals "may choose to vote with their feet rather than waiting to see the negotiated outturn" given the continued uncertainty. JPMorgan is one of several investment banks that has warned it will have to move jobs out of the UK as a result of Brexit. CEO Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg at Davos last month: "It looks like there will be more job movement than we hoped for." The bank employs 16,000 people in the UK.

The social media revolt spurred a viral #DeleteUber and even caused dissent within his own company. The 40-year-old billionaire, in a statement made available to the Wall Street Journal, pointed out that his participation on the council had been misconstrued to mean an endorsement of the 70-year-old President’s policies. “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the President or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that.” Uber Technologies CEO Travis Kalanick leaves president’s business council https://t.co/e0djLp1Iq3 — Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) February 3, 2017 Mr. Kalanick was expected to join other participants Friday, including Walt Disney and Wal-Mart CEOs Bob Iger and Doug McMillon, as well as Tesla Inc’s chief executive, Elon Musk and JP Morgan Chase’s chief executive Jamie Dimon. The group was billed to meet for the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum in Washington D.C. However, the Uber CEO had informed the President beforehand that he was backing out of the council. “I spoke briefly with the President about the immigration executive order..I also let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council.” Customers and drivers had accused the Uber CEO, who has a net worth of $6 billion, of getting cozy with the Trump administration in the aftermath of the executive order banning the travel of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries to the U.S. The White House had asserted that ‘extreme vetting” was required to keep terrorists from finding their way into America. Many people saw it as a crack-down contrary to the ideals of American diversity. #DeleteUber reportedly led 200,000 people to delete their accounts https://t.co/5GtEGS5oMW pic.twitter.com/ndmjP4oenn — The Verge (@verge) February 3, 2017 The avalanche of criticism towards the ride sharing and car hire service had spiraled out of control with many people, including celebrities, gingering people to delete the Uber app from their smart devices. The revolt picked up over the weekend when the San-Francisco based company tweeted that it was halting a price increase to John F. Kennedy International Airport. The decision came at a time when traditional drivers had suspended their services to protest the travel ban. Observers felt that Uber was trying to take advantage of a lull in transport services and make more money. Others believed car services did not fully grind to a halt, it would sabotage the full thrust of the protest. According to the Business Insider, more than 200,000 people deleted their accounts. By Thursday, the Independent Guild, a group of Uber drivers based in New York began circulating a petition for Kalanick to pull out from President Trump’s economic council. The group in a bid to sympathize with enraged customers also suggested that the company make a donation to attorneys and non-profits fighting the travel ban. #uber pledges $3 million for drivers affected by immigration banhttps://t.co/rPx3blVpLw pic.twitter.com/VXqIy90GiV — Express Tribune Tech (@ETribuneTech) January 30, 2017 Kalanick had met with Uber employees before he resigned making the point that being on the council would have positioned the company to influence change and express dissatisfaction from within. Many of his staffers thought he was giving a rationale on why he would remain on the council. The co-founder of the peer-to-peer file sharing company, Red Swoosh, gave no indication he was going to resign. Despite Kalanick’s withdrawal from the advisory council, protests are still penciled to go ahead across the country, including in New Orleans, New York, and San Francisco. The Uber CEO’s resignation is only one of the many blowbacks the President has received since assuming office over two weeks ago. This week, department-store giant, Nordstrom announced that they were cutting ties with Ivanka Trump and would not be selling any of her fashion products on their website, as reported by the Inquisitr. Elon Musk says he will raise objections to Trump's immigration order at a meeting at the White House on Friday https://t.co/fUN3C1gFd2 pic.twitter.com/nS8oJcoczC — CNN (@CNN) February 3, 2017 Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has insisted that despite the resignation of the Uber CEO, he will remain on the council. The 45-year-old revealed that his presence at the advisory council meetings did not mean he aligned himself with the Trump administration. Musk, who is worth a reported $13 billion, pointed out that his presence will “on balance serve the greater good.” [Featured Image by Paul Sakluma/AP Images] Now Watch This: Palestinian Hairdresser Uses Blowtorch On Clients Now Read This: Indian ‘Stigmata’ Boy Perplexes Doctors, Teen Bleeds Randomly 10 Times A Day Share 1 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Tito Ojo-Medubi Tags: #deleteuber, Travis Kalanick, trump muslim ban, donald trump 100 days November 3, 2013 Kendall Jenner Turns 18, Porn Offers Flood Her Inbox November 3, 2013 Nick Foles Throws 7 TDs, Ties NFL Record Comments LATEST HEADLINES ‘The Walking Dead’ Producer Says Alexandria Will Be Heroes In Season 7B ‘Spy In The Wild’: New PBS Show Reveals Secret Life Of Animals [Video] Anna Nicole Smith Still Dotes On Daughter Dannielynn From Beyond The Grave George Clooney Disobeyed The 12-Week Rule To Tell Matt Damon His Baby News Blue Ridge, Texas: Seaway Pipeline Spill Was The Second One In A Year Jimmy Fallon V.

It is best placed to capitalise on urban consumption recovery, it feels. The research firm is overweight on the Stock, with a target price at Rs 1,230. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Moneycontrol Bureau Jubilant Foodworks With maintaining outperform rating on Jubilant Foodworks, with a target price at Rs 1,150, Credit Suisse says a 3.3 percent decline in same store sales growth was better than estimates and focus on closing non-performing stores is a positive move. JPMorgan says focus on profitability is a welcome step, but in near-term uncertainty in demand remains. The brokerage house is overweight on the stock, with a target price at Rs 1,140. Deutsche Bank has reiterated buy rating on the stock, with a target price at Rs 1,400 as same-store-sales growth trajectory is improving and new product pipeline is strong. Closure of underperforming stores is the practical approach, it feels. Margin is likely to have bottomed out, according to the brokerage house. CLSA also retained its buy call on the stock with increased target price at Rs 1,250 (from Rs 1,100) as company seems to have changed track from ‘growth’ to ‘profitable growth’ and closure of six stores highlights management’s focus. It feels pause in price hikes to offer value is also a welcome step. Jubilant's Q3 was better than its subdued forecast but same-store-sales-growth of negative 3.3 percent is disappointing in the context of the 5 percent of Westlife, it says. Morgan Stanley also says earnings are ahead of estimates and there was impressive cost control. It is best placed to capitalise on urban consumption recovery, it feels. The research firm is overweight on the Stock, with a target price at Rs 1,230. However, Nomura feels challenges continue to remain for the company.

Goldman took the unusual step of counter-suing the tycoon - Benny Tjokrosaputro - for reputational damage. The hearing on Tuesday will give the retail-to-property businessman a chance to rebuff Goldman's assertion. The dispute comes at a time when Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, is embarking on its biggest drive for foreign investment in a decade. Legal experts say the outcome could give an indication on whether the country's civil court proceedings will protect the rights of foreigners. Indonesia's government has recently raised investor concerns by cutting business ties with JPMorgan over a negative research report and partially reversing a mining policy. Goldman's prospects at the hearing could be affected by a general lack of transparency in Indonesian court proceedings, said Bill Sullivan, senior foreign counsel at Indonesian law firm Christian Teo & Partners. "This lack of transparency can result in very surprising decisions, especially when you have a foreign party seeking recovery from a well-resourced and well-connected local party," Sullivan told Reuters in an email. show chapters The verdict on investing in Indonesia    Wednesday, 12 Oct 2016 | 7:16 PM ET | 01:43 Goldman's dispute with Tjokrosaputro, president director of property developer PT Hanson International, stems from an arcane area of the financial market in which individuals or firms pledge shares in return for short-term loans, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter.

Goldman had taken the unusual step of counter-suing the retail-to-property businessman — Benny Tjokrosaputro — in a Jakarta court claiming reputational damage. The court hearing today was set to have given Tjokrosaputro a chance to rebuff Goldman’s assertion, but it is now delayed until February 21. The dispute comes at a time when Indonesia, South-east Asia’s largest economy, is embarking on its biggest drive for foreign investment in a decade. Its government recently raised investor concerns by cutting business ties with JPMorgan over a negative research report and partially reversing a mining policy. At stake in the Goldman case is the protection of the rights of foreigners, amid a general lack of transparency in Indonesian court proceedings, legal experts say. “This lack of transparency can result in very surprising decisions, especially when you have a foreign party seeking recovery from a well-resourced and well-connected local party,” Bill Sullivan, senior foreign counsel at Indonesian law firm Christian Teo & Partners, told Reuters in an email. Goldman’s dispute with Tjokrosaputro, president director of property developer PT Hanson International Tbk, stems from an arcane area of the financial market in which individuals or firms sell shares in return for short-term funding, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter. Such a repurchase agreement, or a repo, effectively acts as a loan but the deal involves temporarily transferring legal ownership of the shares. Tjokrosaputro had pledged 425 million Hanson shares to US hedge fund Platinum Partners in return for funding on the basis that he could get the shares back upon repayment, according to Tjokrosaputro’s lawyers and court documents. Goldman Sachs International, a London-based unit of Goldman, bought the Hanson shares from Platinum as a hedge for the derivatives it had entered into with the fund, a bank spokesman said. In late 2014, New York-based Platinum fell into financial difficulties and had trouble paying back a large number of investors, according to US authorities who recently charged top executives of the fund with running a US$1 billion (RM4.4 billion) fraud. Goldman started selling the Hanson shares last year, but was forced to stop after Tjokrosaputro filed a police complaint. He went on to sue Goldman in September for 15 trillion rupiah (RM4.9 billion), alleging the transaction was conducted “unlawfully”. In response, Goldman counter-sued the tycoon last month for at least US$1.1 billion. Goldman “lawfully” acquired the shares from Platinum through the negotiated board of the Indonesian Stock Exchange and the transactions were validly settled, it says in its court documents. A key area of the dispute relates to who actually owned the shares during the repo transaction. Goldman says in its court filings that it “understands” Platinum originally acquired the Hanson shares from an entity named Newrick Holdings Ltd, rather than from Tjokrosaputro. According to the “Panama Papers” online database as of 2015, which compiled millions of leaked documents from law firm Mossack Fonseca, Newrick is a company registered in the British Virgin Islands in which Tjokrosaputro was a shareholder. A bank spokesman told Reuters that Goldman Sachs International was not aware of any dealings between Tjokrosaputro or his affiliated entities and Platinum Partners, nor any restrictions on the shares it purchased. The tycoon’s lawyer reiterated today that Tjokrosaputro was the legal owner of the shares in the repo transaction with Platinum and, since he did not breach any contract with Platinum, only he had the right to sell them. Tjokrosaputro’s lawyer did not immediately provide comment on Goldman’s claim that Platinum had acquired the shares from Newrick. Platinum has earlier declined to comment on the dispute. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business China regulator still plans oil futures, weighs easing equity curbs Bursa Malaysia to trade higher next week Dollar rises on hopes for Trump tax reform Uber suffers for Trump ties that leave Tesla’s Musk unsullied (VIDEO) If Trump hits China, regional demand would ease blow in Asia Bursa Malaysia opens easier Sri Lanka eyes China free trade deal this year, PM to visit in May Another day, another mall: How KL Gateway Mall hopes to succeed in a crowded market Ringgit opens slightly lower against US dollar Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Goldman Sachs files US$1b countersuit against Indonesian businessman Goldman Sachs rejects Indonesian businessman’s US$1.1b claim over share trade Goldman Sachs Asia chairman to step down Source: New York financial regulator seeks more info from Goldman on fundraiser for 1MDB Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login President Trump Determined to Dismantle Dodd-Frank Posted on February 6, 2017 by Brad Hoppmann During the presidential campaign, candidate Donald Trump often criticized Wall Street and the banking system for its role in America’s financial difficulties. On Friday, President Trump did an about-face of sorts. He embraced some of Wall Street’s brightest luminaries and did something that the financial industry has wanted for nearly seven years. The president signed executive orders that begin the process of rolling back financial industry regulations. With industry leaders such as Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock (BLK), and Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan (JPM), gathered around him, Trump proudly put his signature on executive orders designed to dismantle Dodd-Frank. The 2010 law was put in place as a response to the 2008 financial crisis. But critics say it stifles bank activity, and tightens bank lending. Now, the Trump administration has essentially laid out at least the beginnings of a framework that’s aimed at undoing those regulations. The executive orders instruct heads of regulatory agencies to report back to him within 120 days with suggestions on ways to change existing financial regulations. As you might expect, banking and financial stocks vaulted higher on the news. Now the question is who will likely benefit most, and what does that mean for investors? Despite the rise in large-cap financial stocks Friday (and since Election Day), at least one group of analysts says that any banking deregulation is “no panacea for big banks.” That’s the conclusion from sector analysts at Morningstar. In an article on the company’s website, Morningstar analysts offered up the following assessment of the Trump action: We see Trump’s plans as an opening salvo in an effort to ease the regulatory burden on the nation’s banks. However, efforts to repeal or replace the law in its entirety will be far more difficult, and we don’t expect significant boosts to banks’ profitability in the near future as a result of the rule review alone. I agree with the assessment that the “near future” isn’t likely to see a jump in bank bottom lines. After all, Washington’s wheels grind slowly, and any rewrite of the Dodd-Frank law will take time. It also will cost the president some significant amount of political capital. Yet that doesn’t mean financial stocks won’t continue to trade higher based on the expectation of a lightened regulatory burden. After all, think about the run higher in not only financials, but in the major market indices nearly across the board since Election Day. The Financial SPDR (XLF) is up 13.5% since the U.S. election. Sure, the economic data has improved over the past couple of months (albeit slightly). But that’s not the reason for the buying. The reason for the buying is all about the great expectations of growth that might be engineered by the Trump policies. A rollback of Dodd-Frank and other financial industry regulations is a step in the right direction in terms of making that growth a reality. But there’s still a long way to go before we can actually start seeing corporate bottom lines benefit. The same is true for the all-important corporate tax reform proposals. Wall Street would love to see corporate taxes go to 20% from 35%. In fact, the Trump administration’s goal on this front is far more important than rewriting Dodd-Frank. Yet so far, we’ve seen mixed signals on corporate tax reform, at least in terms of urgency. Rumblings out of Washington point to as far away as 2018 for any real progress on corporate tax reform. And that’s not good news for bulls who hope the 2017 rally will continue. So, is Dodd-Frank reform a good thing, and will it juice up the economy? Generally, I say yes, but it depends on how the law is amended. It depends whether a rewrite helps banks lend more freely. If lending does get easier, and banks are able to open up their vaults to borrowers, then that will be good for American business. The same goes for the economy at large, for banking and financial stocks — and, of course, for investors with exposure to these sectors. *** What do you think financial industry regulatory rollback? Do you think it’s just what the doctor ordered for the economy … or does it open the door to another banking crisis? Let me know your thoughts by leaving me a comment on our website or by sending me an e-mail. *** Super Bowl LI saw the Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots tied at 28-28 when the clock ran out. This makes last night’s big game the first in history to go into overtime. The Patriots won 34-28, their fifth time taking home the Vince Lombardi trophy. If you go by the Super Bowl Indicator, this means stocks could drop in 2017. In the past 50 years, when an old AFL team (now the AFC) won, the market closed in the red about 80% of the time. And this year, the Patriots represented the AFC. As if on cue, markets opened — and mostly stayed — in the red today. The S&P 500 closed 5 points lower, or -0.2%, in Monday’s session. Since a lot of traders seemed to take it easy today after a very exciting night, here are some game-related tidbits … • More reasons why last night’s game was historic: No team has come back from greater-than-10-point deficit before. (The Falcons were ahead by as much as 25 points early in the game.) Plus, Tom Brady had more completions, pass attempts and passing yards than anyone else in Super Bowl history. • The game was the best metered rating for Fox, although Nielsen ratings show this Super Bowl was slightly less-watched than the 2016 event, which attracted some 111.9 million viewers. The 2015 event (the last time the Pats played) attracted a record 114.4 million viewers, and 112.2 million watched the 2014 event. Nielsen says the 2017 game drew in 111.3 million viewers, with 117.5 million tuning in for Lady Gaga’s halftime show and 117.7 million tuning in to watch the final moments of the game. • Some recent sportsball survey results: Two-thirds of Americans have a favorite sports team. And nearly 40% of Americans say football is their favorite sport to watch. Fifty percent of Americans say that a higher power rewards devout athletes, while 25% believe that a higher power has a role in determining the final score. As for politics, 58% of Americans say they aren’t bothered when pro athletes make public statements about it, but 40% are bothered by athletes who take a public position on a political topic. (PRRI.org) • We may never know what was in the Tiffany & Co. (TIF) blue box that Melania Trump gave Michelle Obama on Inauguration Day. But the luxury jeweler’s flagship Fifth Avenue store, which is on the same block as Trump Tower, saw holiday sales fall 14% in part due to “post-election traffic disruptions.” This famed location generates 8% of the company’s sales. Total sales for the company were down 4%. TIF shares fell 2.5% today. • Executive revolving doors. TIF just saw its CEO step down, not long after its CFO and head designer both left the company. Ralph Lauren (RL) also just saw its CEO step down last week due to creative differences with the famous founder himself. Five other senior executives at RL have also reportedly left in recent months. RL shares gained 0.5% today, after falling more than 12% to a six-year low on Thursday. • Gold traded at a three-month high (+11.3 to $1,232) on concerns that President Trump’s economic concern among traders. Bullion prices are up 7% this year, and the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) is in its longest stretch of gains (four days) since October. Good luck and happy investing, Brad Hoppmann Publisher Uncommon Wisdom Daily Your thoughts on “President Trump Determined to Dismantle Dodd-Frank” Mike Ciaraldi says: February 6, 2017 at 6:39 pm Trump claims that regulations cost banks “hundreds of billions of dollars” every year. Since he didn’t give an exact figure, let’s say $250 billion. Considering that the GDP of the entire USA is about $5 trillion a year, that would mean that 5% of the GDP is being spent just on bank regulations. That sounds pretty implausible to me. The Web site for Americans for Tax Reform claim that in the first six years after Dodd-Frank, banks spent a total of $40 billion on the D-F regulations. That’s about $6.5 billion a year. Which is right? Reply Mark says: February 7, 2017 at 6:31 pm Your point sounds good until you realize that your assumption that the US GDP is $5 trillion per year is way off. The US GDP in 2015 was over $18 trillion. Also, the $250 billion figure you gave is your own assumption. The larger question here is whether this legislation and the regulations arising because of it are actually doing any good. I tend to doubt it as government regulations do not have much of a track record of actually achieving their goals. So whatever we are spending on it is probably too much. Reply clyde says: February 6, 2017 at 6:53 pm Less GOV. THEEE BETTER!!!!!!!!! Clyde Reply roger f fleck says: February 6, 2017 at 7:01 pm o thank god its like being a criminal being a loan officer . Hail Trump on the front !! Reply R. Freschi says: February 6, 2017 at 7:35 pm By all means dismantle Dodd-Frank. But I strongly believe the mega-financial institutions should be broken up. Banks should not be under the same corporate umbrella as trading institutions. Let these firms and their shareholders be responsible from losses from trading deritives and other risky ventures – not taxpayers! Reply Steve H says: February 6, 2017 at 7:45 pm Why should the big banks be able to have trading desks and other activities that put customer and taxpayer money at risk? I do hope they keep the portion of Dodd/Frank that applies to the “fiduciary” rule. Investment advisers should show clients all alternatives and not push their own high priced stuff. I know from experience, and when I figured this out, moved all my money to a reputable broker and became a self directed investor. Best move I ever made. Reply Broomy says: February 6, 2017 at 9:35 pm While easing Dodd-Frank may encourage banks to lend more money, I’m not sure that’s necessarily what we want. Aren’t liar loans and home loans to anyone with a pulse, regardless of whether they could pay it back what got us into the problems we’re still struggling to free ourselves from? Part of the problem is that there just aren’t enough viable investments to warrant the risk. If there were good options we wouldn’t have corporations sitting on trillions of dollars in cash earning a pittance. They’d be investing their hordes to earn even more. Reducing regulations to encourage lending when the rate of return isn’t there is a recipe for disaster. Reply Eleanor Allert says: February 6, 2017 at 10:21 pm Based on the multi-trillion dollar deficit that we are facing in our economy, I don’t think that banks should have freedom to create more financial chaos than we had eight years ago. If they go back to their old tricks creating derivatives and bamboozling the public, the only people left standing at the end will be the 1%. On the other hand, a two-year delay in making those changes might mitigate the effect of bank exuberance. I think we need to be very careful and painstakingly slow about how we relieve bank restrictions. Reply Billy says: February 6, 2017 at 11:24 pm Brad, The concern right off the top is: are the Banking Elite trying to co-opt Trump by getting him to relax regulations, which would bring us back to the environment that lead to immoral and unethical lending, bond rating, and mortgage backed derivative creation or, does he see banking de-regulation being key to kickstart the economy. The MAJOR problem is the world is ALREADY AWASH IN MASSIVE AMOUNTS DEBT and at this point, you are simply pushing on a string if you believe that lowering interest rates and relaxing lending standards is going to work….We have a major capital market correction coming right around the corner regardless of what Trump decides to do with banking regulation. In other words, the cake is already baked! The MASSIVE DEBT is ALREADY ON SITE! Reply Books says: February 6, 2017 at 11:29 pm The financial disaster of 2008 was due to deregulation which allowed for the Wild West of the financial arena. There are rules and regulations in all parts of life because they are needed. We accept traffic rules, we raise our children with rules and morals, there are rules for obtaining a college degree, and the list goes on. Why do the banks, private equity outfits, mortgage companies, etc. think they should be exempt from regulation? If they are making fewer loans nowadays, maybe it’s because they should be careful who they loan to. Reply ed the grocer says: February 7, 2017 at 12:35 am You should start with the real problem. The problem is that the USD as a reserve currency is ending. The international reach of banks, near instant electronic settlements, massive fake loans, and the vastly inflated national currencies all render any absolute need for a reserve currency, therefore Trump must a) deflate the USD slowly we hope, the easiest is by fiddling with the derivatives market, b) squeeze the Yuan upwards with a simple trade war and a lot of rhetoric, c) help China competitors such as Vietnam, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, d) bring Russia back into the European fold especially as their energy provider. e) manage the border for illegal workers f) open the investment market to public utilities. We have spent to much time trying to keep Russia out when we should have kept them close. We must also force China into the same demographic mess that we are in and hope that a Chinese Middle class will blunt the last of any socialist feelings. These are not cures for massive debt but it could change the trend line. The real cure is still in investment in production which must be in North America. That new industrial state will lead us to a home made New World Order. Reply gaffgolf says: February 7, 2017 at 12:54 am Dear President Trump, The financial disaster that grew over years and finally crashed in 2008 was due to Wall Street GREED and poor SEC regulation enforcement. About 2,500 people on Wall Street & in DC (Banksters & SEC Regulators) screwed over 300+ Million Americans!!!!! Just read the Commission Findings led by Phil Angelides confirming this and the fact that it should not have happened—–had the regulators done their job. Dodd-Frank has been advertised to protect the American taxpayer against the “Too Big To Fail” argument in the future. However, the financial institutions succeeded in having it “watered down” during the actual writing of the law after initial Dodd & Frank legislation was originally drafted & passed. This particularly occurred with regard to promised improvement in the “control & transparency” regarding derivative transactions—–especially those which are designed to circumvent existing laws & precautions in various industries. For example, regulated insurance companies operating in the U.S. such as AIG have regulated capital & liquidity requirements that limit the size of insurance policies they can issue to insure debt default. However, since derivatives are outside of the regulatory environment, the credit default swap derivative was created to avoid these capital/liquidity controls. Literally about anybody or any entity could issue a credit default swap without having the capital and/or more importantly the liquidity to pay off upon default. AIG was an active player in both regulated debt insurance and the issuance of huge credit default swaps which brought them down along with most of the former investment banks on Wall Street. The main problem was that they could do these crazy deals as derivatives with no regulatory control but then settled them in our regulated American (so called safe) banking system in real dollars!! If you want to avoid regulatory restraints meant to protect the American bank depositor/taxpayer then settle your transactions outside our regulated banking system—-perhaps in Bitcoin or some other type of internet currency!!! Never again should the American taxpayer (and our National Debt) be burdened by the excessive greed of Wall Street. All derivatives must be reviewed and those like credit default swaps that are designed to avoid existing financial safety regulations and/or regulatory control either eliminated or settled outside the regulated American banking system. If this means Wall Street losing this business to London or Frankfurt or Paris or Hong Kong or Beijing than SO BE IT!!! Never again should the unbridled greed of so few affect the financial lives of Hundreds of Millions Americans (and Billions Around The Entire World!!!) Reply ed the grocer says: February 7, 2017 at 1:29 am gaffgolf, I would like to add that whereas the unlimited layers of derivative “insurance” led to unlimited risk and unlimited trading volume there was also the accompanying fees. These fees had to be extracted from somewhere and that somewhere was the bottom customer which simply reduces income for the investor. Reply J Savella says: February 7, 2017 at 1:36 am So far the comments haven’t come from the Wallstreeters,since almost all support regulation to prevent another 2008 catastrophe or spliting the huge financial institutions so they can’t gamble with depositors $ via games such as derivatives.The banks and investors must be responsible for losses they have caused,not the American public. Reply gaffgolf says: February 7, 2017 at 2:22 am J Savella, The current “watered-down” edition of Dodd-Frank (parts of which our President wants to undo) will not prevent a re-enactment of the “Too Big To Fail” scenario. The banks, financial institutions, investors, etc. you refer to still do not have the necessary capital and/or more importantly, the reserve liquidity needed to survive another large negative financial event. This is why dealing in risky derivatives needs to be stopped or settled outside the regulated US banking system so as not to (1) negatively impact its safety & soundness for the depositors of the US banking system and (2) continue to add Trillions to our national debt for for all future federal taxpayers. Believe it is accurate to say that there are a helluva lot more FICA-Insured Depositors who are not currently and don’t plan to be Taxpayers!!! Reply dave says: February 7, 2017 at 7:17 am If Jamie Dimon is involved watch out – he sure watches out for himself. Big buddy of Obama and wears presidential seal cuff links to prove it. Reply gaffgolf says: February 7, 2017 at 11:58 pm Jamie Dimon was one of the pioneers in developing derivatives in the 1990’s and their huge expansion in the United States & around the world since the turn of the century. Reply Kenneth Roy Viney says: February 7, 2017 at 1:37 pm Phil Gramm the guy that pushed through the Bill that destroyed Glass Segal which protected us from the big banks gambling with our savings for over 64 years had his wife Wendy assist building the Dodd Frank Banking Regulation law which was a political excuse to do something so BANKS WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE BAILED OUT BY THE TAXPAYER AGAIN. This set of regulations did nothing to reform the SEC, US TREASURY, THE FED or THE RATING AGENCIES who all contributed to the 2008-2009 crisis and transferred over $ 3 trillion of TARP and FED. FUNDS to the big banks and AIG. Had Obama wanted to drain the swamp he would have brought charges against HANK PAULSON, JAMIE DIMON, GOLDMAN SACKS, COUNTRYWIDE FIN., AIG, GLEN HUBBARD, BEN BERNANKE, DICK FULD, MOODYS, AND OTHERS guilty of fraud and theft. This law did not stop investment banks from trading in derivatives like CDOs as they are today. Unless Trump truly drains the swamp and passes the Glass Seagal again there will be another bailout of the banks and they will double up in size Reply gaffgolf says: February 7, 2017 at 11:52 pm Agree!! Well-said!! Reply Eric Newton says: February 8, 2017 at 12:16 pm – Glass Stegall act should be reinstated. – Too big to fail is ridiculous. Don’t use taxpayer dollars to socialize losses while privatizing gains. – Get over the TARP bailout. It was wrongheaded but the decision was made at the time to do this. – None of the people cited (heads of banks) should go to jail because they didnt actually break the law. Reply Fred Clore says: February 9, 2017 at 4:08 pm Sir, You are correct in that it was not proven that anyone broke the law, instead the institutions agreed to pay fines without admitting fault. The government is happy because it can use it’s kangaroo court to rip off companies for large sums of money, most of which was retained by the government. The institutions are happy because there is no personal liability involved for what was extremely bad behavior. Who pays, the ones who don’t have representation in all this, the stock holders. Their investments are not worth as much because there is less stock holder equity. Now I’m of the opinion that when a bank takes a portfolio of junk bonds and repackages them in tranches, gets a rating agency to give this package a AAA rating, and then sells these instruments as risk free, somebody committed fraud. At the very least the CEO’s fiduciary responsibility to its stock holders was breached by putting the company in a precarious position. Where I live, fraud is still against the law and the regulations do require fiduciary responsibility. Just because no one was tried for a crime does not mean a crime was not committed. Reply Eric Newton says: February 8, 2017 at 12:17 pm Also, Dodd-frank did do some good: – Credit card and lending companies required to clearly state interest rates, fees, etc. Positive.

Indonesia will hold a court hearing on Tuesday into a billion-dollar dispute between Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and a local tycoon, who says the Wall Street giant's unit unlawfully sold shares he owned, in the latest test for the country's legal system. Goldman took the unusual step of counter-suing the tycoon - Benny Tjokrosaputro - for reputational damage. The hearing on Tuesday will give the retail-to-property businessman a chance to rebuff Goldman's assertion. The dispute comes at a time when Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, is embarking on its biggest drive for foreign investment in a decade. Legal experts say the outcome could give an indication on whether the country's civil court proceedings will protect the rights of foreigners. Indonesia's government has recently raised investor concerns by cutting business ties with JPMorgan over a negative research report and partially reversing a mining policy. Goldman's prospects at the hearing could be affected by a general lack of transparency in Indonesian court proceedings, said Bill Sullivan, senior foreign counsel at Indonesian law firm Christian Teo & Partners. "This lack of transparency can result in very surprising decisions, especially when you have a foreign party seeking recovery from a well-resourced and well-connected local party," Sullivan told Reuters in an email. Goldman's dispute with Tjokrosaputro, president director of property developer PT Hanson International Tbk <MYRX.JK>, stems from an arcane area of the financial market in which individuals or firms pledge shares in return for short-term loans, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter. Tjokrosaputro had pledged 425 million Hanson shares to U.S. hedge fund Platinum Partners in return for a loan on the basis that he could get the shares back upon repayment - an arrangement known as a repurchase agreement or a repo. Goldman's unit, Goldman Sachs International, bought the Hanson shares from Platinum as a hedge for the derivatives it had entered into with the fund, a bank spokesman said. In late 2014, New York-based Platinum fell into financial difficulties and had trouble paying back a large number of investors, according to U.S. authorities who recently charged top executives of the fund with running a $1 billion fraud. Goldman started selling the Hanson shares last year, but was forced to stop after Tjokrosaputro filed a police complaint. He went on to sue Goldman in September for 15 trillion rupiah ($1.1 billion), alleging the transaction was conducted "unlawfully". Tjokrosaputro's lawyer told Reuters his client did not breach his contract with Platinum and that no-one other than Tjokrosaputro had the right to own or sell the shares. In response, Goldman countersued the tycoon last month for at least $1.1 billion claiming reputational damage. Goldman "lawfully" acquired the shares from Platinum through the negotiated board of the Indonesian Stock Exchange and the transactions were validly settled, the bank says in its claim documents. A bank spokesman told Reuters that Goldman Sachs International was not aware of Tjokrosaputro's dealings with Platinum, nor any restrictions on the shares it purchased.

REUTERS/David Gray/File PhotoMore By Eveline Danubrata JAKARTA (Reuters) - An Indonesian court postponed on Tuesday the hearing of a billion-dollar dispute between Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and a local tycoon by two weeks, granting him time to gather more evidence to prove a claim the U.S. bank's unit unlawfully sold shares he owned. Goldman had taken the unusual step of counter-suing the retail-to-property businessman - Benny Tjokrosaputro - in a Jakarta court claiming reputational damage. The court hearing on Tuesday was set to have given Tjokrosaputro a chance to rebuff Goldman's assertion, but it is now delayed until Feb. 21. The dispute comes at a time when Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, is embarking on its biggest drive for foreign investment in a decade. Its government recently raised investor concerns by cutting business ties with JPMorgan over a negative research report and partially reversing a mining policy. At stake in the Goldman case is the protection of the rights of foreigners, amid a general lack of transparency in Indonesian court proceedings, legal experts say. "This lack of transparency can result in very surprising decisions, especially when you have a foreign party seeking recovery from a well-resourced and well-connected local party," Bill Sullivan, senior foreign counsel at Indonesian law firm Christian Teo & Partners, told Reuters in an email. Goldman's dispute with Tjokrosaputro, president director of property developer PT Hanson International Tbk <MYRX.JK>, stems from an arcane area of the financial market in which individuals or firms sell shares in return for short-term funding, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter. Such a repurchase agreement, or a repo, effectively acts as a loan but the deal involves temporarily transferring legal ownership of the shares. Tjokrosaputro had pledged 425 million Hanson shares to U.S. hedge fund Platinum Partners in return for funding on the basis that he could get the shares back upon repayment, according to Tjokrosaputro's lawyers and court documents. Goldman Sachs International, a London-based unit of Goldman, bought the Hanson shares from Platinum as a hedge for the derivatives it had entered into with the fund, a bank spokesman said. In late 2014, New York-based Platinum fell into financial difficulties and had trouble paying back a large number of investors, according to U.S. authorities who recently charged top executives of the fund with running a $1 billion fraud.

He went on to sue Goldman in September for 15 trillion rupiah ($1.1 billion), alleging the transaction was conducted "unlawfully". In response, Goldman counter-sued the tycoon last month for at least $1.1 billion. Goldman "lawfully" acquired the shares from Platinum through the negotiated board of the Indonesian Stock Exchange and the transactions were validly settled, it says in its court documents. A key area of the dispute relates to who actually owned the shares during the repo transaction. Goldman says in its court filings that it "understands" Platinum originally acquired the Hanson shares from an entity named Newrick Holdings Ltd, rather than from Tjokrosaputro. According to the "Panama Papers" online database as of 2015, which compiled millions of leaked documents from law firm Mossack Fonseca, Newrick is a company registered in the British Virgin Islands in which Tjokrosaputro was a shareholder. A bank spokesman told Reuters that Goldman Sachs International was not aware of any dealings between Tjokrosaputro or his affiliated entities and Platinum Partners, nor any restrictions on the shares it purchased. The tycoon's lawyer reiterated on Tuesday that Tjokrosaputro was the legal owner of the shares in the repo transaction with Platinum and, since he did not breach any contract with Platinum, only he had the right to sell them. Tjokrosaputro's lawyer did not immediately provide comment on Goldman's claim that Platinum had acquired the shares from Newrick. Platinum has earlier declined to comment on the dispute.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website 9  −   =  two Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Tom Gentile This is a story we've been hearing a lot lately: The stock market is near fresh all-time highs, and the retail sector is at dismal lows. In fact, the sector's top exchange-traded fund, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSE Arca: XRT), is already down 2.2% year to date, and it's off nearly 11% from its 52-week high. The "official" outlook is even bleaker. Some television pundits are predicting the "extinction of retail" in the not-too-distant future. JPMorgan Chase & Co., America's largest bank, is recommending its clients take a bearish approach to trading the sector – if they trade it at all. The thing is, I agree. Retail is in terrible shape. It has largely failed to adapt to the changes that are now destroying it. And in a minute, I'll show you a creepy picture that proves it. But there's a big difference here that matters to investors: I'm not willing to write off an entire sector – not when there's this much upside to be had from a few choice stocks. These three companies chose to adapt to shifting consumer behavior before it was too late. They did better than that, in fact – they made the change in consumer habits work to their own advantage. And now their shares are actually set to outperform. The more brick-and-mortar operations close, the more malls are abandoned, the better these companies will do. The profit potential here is really remarkable, and it looks like Wall Street is scared to join us. So let's dive in… Where to Profit Amidst the "Death" of Brick-and-Mortar Stores Last Saturday, my wife and I decided to spend the day shopping in the Westfield Mall, which is a commercial property that handles several different retail outlets both within the United States and abroad. Understandably, people are shopping less now that the holidays are behind us… but I was really surprised at the lack of shoppers flocking to all of the clearance and store closure sales, like Macy's. Actually, it almost felt like we were the only humans in the mall and reminded me of one of those "The Walking Dead" episodes. It was so empty, I had to snap a photo of it to show you… Pretty grim, huh? Now, I'm not a retail shopper. I went cyber long before it was cool to shop online. In fact, the only reason I go to the mall is to visit the Apple store or the Tesla dealership that sits across from it. I spend 99.9% of my time shopping from the same terminal I'm writing from: my computer. But there's no denying that malls are becoming more like sanctuaries from the hot summers and cold winters or recreation parks. In a lot of malls, there are even signs now that tell you how far you've walked. And therein lies the problem when it comes to the retail sector… "Anchor stores" are the big retailers that used to pull in the big business for malls. We're talking Macy's, Sachs, JCPenney, and Sears, to name a few. Those days are gone, though. As I'm sure you already know, Macy's is expected to close 15% of its stores this year, JCPenney should soon follow, and Sears is all but bankrupt. And if these stores all drop the bomb this year and announce massive closings, this will hurt the already bruised brick-and-mortar malls as well as their commercial retail companies. But while some department stores scratch and claw for what may be their final customers before closing their doors indefinitely, others embrace technology and make it work for them, their customers, and their shareholders.  The shift in the way we buy merchandise should also translate in the way we invest in retail companies… And these three companies will actually thrive in the "extinction" of malls: 1. Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) This one's a bit of a no-brainer, as both online sales and the stock continue to climb to all-time highs. Amazon recently announced its plans to hire an additional 100,000 people this year to work in its distribution centers. This wouldn't happen unless they needed to meet growing demand, so take that as a bullish sign. Also with the rollout of continued Prime services as well as same-day drone delivery, it's fulfilling the "I need it now" customers who will pay top dollar to get their goods quickly. As I mentioned, the stock is closing in on the all-time highs it set back in September 2016. And despite last quarter's slight earnings miss, investors are optimistic about the future of this company. Revenue and profit numbers continue to tell us that digital shopping is here to stay and also that the current price of AMZN ($850) won't be here long. You can also see in the chart above that volatility is on the rise, but that's merely because earnings are due out soon. So don't be surprised if you see the stock hit $900 real soon… 2. Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD) Home Depot hasn't gone entirely online, but most of what people need from this retailer has to be seen in person. After all, it's hard to make big home improvement purchases without actually seeing it for yourself first. For that reason, its brick-and-mortar stores are doing – and will continue to do – very well. As the largest home improvement chain in the United States, Home Depot continues to capitalize on an improving housing market with the type of same-day sales that attract even the shoppers who otherwise swear to shopping only online. The stock is also hitting all-time highs right now, which reflects a retail space with plenty of room to grow. I don't see this trend letting up, either, as earnings continue to beat expectations. And when you look at the chart above, you'll notice that volatility of this stock is closing in on annual lows… another great bullish sign. In fact, I predict HD hitting $150 this year. 3. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) Although Wal-Mart had to play a bit of catch-up with its online experience, keep in mind that this chain bucks the trend of department stores for two reasons: it keeps its prices low and most of what it sells is considered a necessity (like food or pharmaceuticals). So you're not going to waste your time taking a trip to the mall or placing an online order for something you need right now. The stock hasn't exactly rebounded in price and has actually traded lower since Trump's election victory. WMT has also dropped off its 12-month highs since August 2016, but as continued positive earnings come in, I predict this stock becoming a value play at $65 per share. I'm targeting the top side of the range this year and expect WMT to be back at the $75 resistance level soon.

I am a former director for national retailers. My history includes the Melville Corporation (Now CVS) and Phillips VanHeusen (now PVH.) This past week I had the opportunity to visit a mall where I opened a store in 1987 and just thought I would stop in and see the mall. Whoa, what a depressing visit. One main Anchor (fronting the main road) had closed some years back and has remained vacant. Three anchors left with Macy's also fronting the main road with Sears and Penney's on the back side. Macy's store exterior was originally white but now is covered with a graying slime that is beyond my understanding. A simple wash/scrub would rejuvenate this making it much more so inviting. Walking though the store is much the same with flickering lights, no visible staffing and an eerie empty feeling. The mall itself has 48 vacant spaces of the 110 originally opened. There isn't even an attempt to cover the glass or clean up the interior of vacated spaces. Of the remaining stores there were few national brands still open. Victoria Secret, Gold's Gym, Foot Locker and two recognizable restaurant fast food chains in Chick Fil A and Sbarros. I remember this mall when it opened to great fanfare and found myself a bit depressed upon leaving the building. I sat in the parking lot convinced that the cancer I saw happening in the late 80's is now in stage 4 with the patient on complete life support. I also remember when PVH had over 1200 outlet stores between it's divisions. The outlet centering of America was about 20 years behind the Malling of America so their fate will mirror regular retails demise somewhere near 2025. Out of that business now I own my own retail and have found ways to prosper with the introduction of a digital marketplace and through amazing customer relations. I'm on the 6 year plan as I wind down my career but will never fully leave the business until they carry me out toes up. Thank you for an insightful and well done article.

JULIE BYKOWICZ Associated Press Leave a comment (AP/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) WASHINGTON (AP) _ Uber’s CEO quit President Donald Trump’s business council. Nordstrom stopped selling Ivanka Trump’s fashion. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Toyota, meanwhile, suffered through the discomfort of being on the receiving end of Trump Twitter tirades. The Trump era is a perilous new landscape for corporate America. Companies are feeling political pressure like never before, squeezed on one side by consumers who are boycotting products with any ties to the administration and on the other by the outspoken, social media-loving president. For most companies, the decision to get political used to be made after long, careful deliberations among a company’s leader, public relations team, lawyers and lobbyists. Now, in an increasingly divided America, companies may have no choice but to move quickly. “You have to understand your customers in real time because political ramifications are happening instantly,” said Matt Friedman, a crisis communications adviser based near Detroit who has worked with public and private companies. “Each business now has to look at where their customer fits into the political divide and how their company values align to what the president is doing on a day-to-day basis.” The predicament for companies was on display ahead of Trump’s first White House meeting Friday with his business forum, a group that includes General Motors CEO Mary Barra, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and a dozen others. The night before, Uber’s Travis Kalanick told his employees he’d decided to quit the council because his presence on it was being “misinterpreted” as an endorsement of the president. “I spent a lot of time thinking about this and mapping it to our values,” Kalanick told employees in an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press. Disney CEO Bob Iger didn’t attend either; instead he was at a company board meeting in California. A seat on a high-profile White House council, no matter the political party in power, has previously been a can’t-pass-up sign of prestige. It’s a direct way for a company to express opinions to the president _ far less fraught than trying to gain access through lobbying or donating money. Trump said he intends to take advice from the council, which he said would meet regularly to discuss policies. Trump said he’d be seeking guidance on his plans to roll back the financial services legislation known as the Dodd-Frank bill from JP Morgan’s Dimon. “There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie,” he said Friday. But an audience with this president, at least at this stage, brings with it customer complications. No doubt weighing into Kalanick’s decision to give up that influence was the boycott the ride-sharing company, popular in urban, largely Democratic areas, had been experiencing all week. That campaign went viral on social media Saturday night when people perceived Uber as trying to break a taxi strike to and from New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport that was in response to Trump’s executive order suspending the country’s refugee program. It didn’t let up even after Uber publicly condemned Trump’s executive order and contributed to relief groups. Shannon Coulter, one of the organizers of the “Grab Your Wallet” social media effort to encourage boycotts of companies tied to Trump, said she would only be satisfied when Kalanick resigned from the presidential forum, saying: “This is not a `seat at the table’ moment. This is a flip-the-table moment.” Grab Your Wallet claimed another victory Thursday night when Nordstrom announced it had stopped selling first daughter Ivanka Trump’s fashion line. The company cited the brand’s performance. The department store was one of Grab Your Wallet’s first targets. Neiman Marcus also appears to have stopped selling her jewelry. “Companies have been late to the game with realizing how much ire it can create to associate with a person like Donald,” Coulter said. While the anti-Trump boycotters cheered Nordstrom, angry Trump supporters deluged the company with angry messages on Twitter _ some saying they were now prepared to begin their own boycott. Nordstrom spent the night responding to hundreds of them, with messages like: “We’re so sorry to disappoint you. It’s not a political decision for us.” Maine-based retailer L.L. Bean faced the flip side of that. Linda Bean, one of many family members involved in the company, gave money to a pro-Trump super PAC during the campaign, prompting Grab Your Wallet to call for a boycott, which in turn prompted Trump to weigh in with a bit of social-media marketing. “Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L. Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L. Bean,” Trump tweeted last month, a few weeks before taking office. When they make a move that could be perceived as a knock on the president, companies like Nordstrom must calculate not only the financial impact of angering Trump supporters but also the possibility that Trump himself could take notice _ spiraling the crisis to another level. Robert Passikoff, president of Brand Keys Inc., said CEOs are especially vulnerable now because technology allows people to protest and vent their anger without organizing a march, or even leaving their home. Among those who can weigh in with a few finger taps: the leader of the free world. “The direct communication from the president of the United States, with attacks on specific brands and specific people, is not something we’ve ever seen before,” he said. Just how much this new, perilous environment for CEOs will actually affect business in the long term is difficult to know. Shares of Lockheed fell sharply after the president tweeted in December that the cost of its F-35 fighter jets was “out of control,” then fell again after he complained about the military contractor at a news conference the next month. The stock quickly recovered both times. ___ Associated Press writers Bernard Condon in New York and Jill Colvin in Washington contributed to this report.   Also On The Michigan Chronicle: Detroit International Auto Show first and best photos 100 photos Launch gallery Detroit International Auto Show first and best photos 1. 1 of 100 2. 2 of 100 3. 3 of 100 4. 4 of 100 5. 5 of 100 6. 6 of 100 7. 7 of 100 8. 8 of 100 9. 9 of 100 10. 10 of 100 11. 11 of 100 12. 12 of 100 13. 13 of 100 14. 14 of 100 15. 15 of 100 16. 16 of 100 17. 17 of 100 18. 18 of 100 19. 19 of 100 20. 20 of 100 21. 21 of 100 22. 22 of 100 23. 23 of 100 24. 24 of 100 25. 25 of 100 26. 26 of 100 27. 27 of 100 28. 28 of 100 29. 29 of 100 30. 30 of 100 31. 31 of 100 32. 32 of 100 33. 33 of 100 34. 34 of 100 35. 35 of 100 36. 36 of 100 37. 37 of 100 38. 38 of 100 39. 39 of 100 40. 40 of 100 41. 41 of 100 42. 42 of 100 43. 43 of 100 44. 44 of 100 45. 45 of 100 46. 46 of 100 47. 47 of 100 48. 48 of 100 49. 49 of 100 50. 50 of 100 51. 51 of 100 52. 52 of 100 53. 53 of 100 54. 54 of 100 55. 55 of 100 56. 56 of 100 57. 57 of 100 58. 58 of 100 59. 59 of 100 60. 60 of 100 61. 61 of 100 62. 62 of 100 63. 63 of 100 64. 64 of 100 65. 65 of 100 66. 66 of 100 67. 67 of 100 68. 68 of 100 69. 69 of 100 70. 70 of 100 71. 71 of 100 72. 72 of 100 73. 73 of 100 74. 74 of 100 75. 75 of 100 76. 76 of 100 77. 77 of 100 78. 78 of 100 79. 79 of 100 80. 80 of 100 81. 81 of 100 82. 82 of 100 83. 83 of 100 84. 84 of 100 85. 85 of 100 86. 86 of 100 87. 87 of 100 88. 88 of 100 89. 89 of 100 90. 90 of 100 91. 91 of 100 92. 92 of 100 93. 93 of 100 94. 94 of 100 95. 95 of 100 96. 96 of 100 97. 97 of 100 98. 98 of 100 99. 99 of 100 100. 100 of 100 Skip ad Continue reading Boycotts, Trump’s tirades part of new business landscape Detroit International Auto Show first and best photos comments – Add Yours Your browser does not support iframes.

Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Levin Report Can Trump’s Top Goldman Hire Sideline Steve Bannon? Amid the backstabbing inside the White House, Gary Cohn is reportedly rising in the ranks—and emerging as a formidable counterweight to Trump’s more radical, right-wing advisers. by Bess LevinFebruary 6, 2017 6:30 pm Email Facebook Twitter The president, seen here with Cohn, does not appear to have begun his remedial hand-shaking classes. By Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images. Few of Donald Trump’s critics failed to notice that the same candidate who railed against Wall Street on the campaign trail quickly endeavored as president to drain the Goldman Sachs swamp by hiring away much of the bank’s top talent: Goldman Sachs partner Dina Powell, former partner Steven Mnuchin, ex-banker Stephen Bannon, and a handful of other Goldman-affiliates, including Trump’s S.E.C. pick Jay Clayton, who represented Goldman among his clients. In mid-December, Trump dealt the ultimate death-blow to the financial establishment by poaching the bank’s no. 2, Gary Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, to serve as his top economic adviser. For Wall Street antagonists like Senator Elizabeth Warren, Cohn’s leadership of the National Economic Council was a personal affront that only grew more offensive when Trump thanked Cohn and JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon before signing a pair of executive orders intended to gut Dodd-Frank, the regulatory framework put in place to prevent another financial crisis, and a fiduciary rule intended to force brokers to act in their clients’ best interests. In the pages of The Wall Street Journal and on cable news shows like CNBC, there was Cohn, insisting that the billions banks would save by dismantling Dodd-Frank would be a mere happy byproduct. The fiduciary rule, he argued, was like preventing freedom-loving Americans from eating unhealthy foods just because they “might die younger.” Doesn’t everyone deserve to make that decision on their own? Still, even Cohn’s biggest critics might be breathing a sigh of relief these days to have him in Trump’s inner circle. While slashing critical financial regulations and letting brokers scam retirees is pretty unpalatable, in this horror show of an administration, wherein the former chairman of Breitbart News is dictating policy, Cohn actually represents something of a voice of reason. With the rest of Trump’s top advisers agitating for trade wars with Mexico, real wars with China, and a 1920s-era immigration policy, Cohn, a longtime Democratic donor who is comfortable working both sides of the aisle, may be the last line of defense for Washington centrists hoping to keep Trump’s nationalist brain trust at bay. Per Politico’s Ben White: The more critical and long-term question for executives across multiple industries is whether Cohn will emerge as a powerful countervailing economic force to temper Trump's instincts toward protectionism. To pull this off, Cohn will have to nudge Trump himself while also muscling out Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller as well as to lesser degrees Trump adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross. If anyone can pull this off, it's Cohn, a powerful personality not known to be shy about making his views known. He has an added bonus in his favor: he came into the Trump orbit through Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, critical advisers to the president. Those inclined to Cohn's worldview inside the administration believe the former Goldman banker will eventually win the day. Some even mention him as a potential future chief of staff or shadow chief of staff. For companies and investors who like Trump's plans for tax cuts and regulatory relief, the hope is that when the shake-up comes, hard-line voices like Bannon and Miller will be marginalized and more moderate, business-friendly advisers like Cohn, [former Goldman partner Dina] Powell, and current chief of staff Reince Priebus will emerge with stronger hands. In the battle royale that is the Trump White House, Cohn may have a good chance of coming out on top. Trump has long been known to encourage his staff to compete with each other, a practice he fostered at the Trump Organization and one that was put into sharp relief on the campaign trail and during the transition, as internal conflict resulted in the ousters of Corey Lewandoski, Paul Manafort, and finally Chris Christie in quick succession. Rudy Giuliani, too, got the boot. The most recent victim of the White House Game of Thrones was Anthony Scaramucci, who lost his promised West Wing job last week amid questions about his inability to quickly clear the government’s vetting process. (The official line was that Scaramucci’s sale of his business to a Chinese conglomerate posed too many conflicts of interest, but sources close to the administration believe tension between Scaramucci and Priebus was a deciding factor.) Given that Trump reportedly hired Cohn as much for his well-fitted suits and alpha attitude as his financial acumen (Trump liked that he “carried himself like someone to reckon with,” aides told Axios), Trump would probably be thrilled to see Cohn and Bannon fight each other to the death. Cohn’s already started small, according to The Washington Post, “work[ing] prevent CNBC commentator Larry Kudlow, a longtime Trump economic adviser, from joining the administration” and reportedly trying to “sideline Peter Navarro, a vocal China critic and hard-liner on trade inside the White House.” It might sound counterintuitive, but remember, according to organizational experts, Trump is a horrible manager. This kind of thing is right up his alley. If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, click here to subscribe. Alternative Facts Speaking of Dodd-Frank, one of the criticisms that’s been levied against it is that it prevents banks from lending. Trump himself said on Friday that he knows “so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses, [that] can’t borrow money. . .because the banks just won’t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.” Unfortunately, there’s little evidence that’s true. Per CNBC: Statistics on bank lending don't back up that claim. Since the law took effect in July 2010, bank lending to businesses and consumers has continued to hit new highs. Great work, Donny! It turns out that Trump’s unhinged tweeting about Mexico paying for The Wall, his threatening tone toward Mexico’s president, and his general unpleasantness toward our southern neighbors has not engendered warm and fuzzy feelings between us and Mexico. And in a hilarious twist, Trump’s supposed boardroom tactics are backfiring. “The U.S. trade tensions with Mexico are putting the Mexican government on overdrive trying to find new export markets," said Sean Miner, a fellow at the Atlantic Council, a D.C.-based think tank, told CNBC. “Recently, China and Mexico have become closer. Clearly, this is a consequence of the rising tensions.” Actual, legitimate investors fell for a Hamilton Ponzi scheme Paul Tudor Jones is a legendary hedge fund manager who has made billions upon billions of dollars for himself and his investors in Tudor Investment Corp. over the years. (His fund currently manages approximately $11 billion.) For decades, young traders have viewed him as an icon, and getting one’s hands on a copy of Trader—a 1987 PBS documentary about Jones that so embarrassed the billionaire that he bought the rights to prevent subsequent airings—was considered the ultimate coup. And yet even a man with his exquisite professional bona fides was blinded to an obvious scam by the absolute mania surrounding Hamilton. Per Bloomberg: When U.S. authorities busted a Ponzi scheme that centered on marked-up tickets to the hit Broadway musical “Hamilton” last month, prosecutors described phone calls about a “big name” investor who’d demanded his money back. As it turns out, there were several big names -- including billionaires Paul Tudor Jones and Michael Dell, as well as an executive at Och-Ziff Capital Management Group -- among the more than 125 people who had unwittingly poured cash into the sprawling scam, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The ringleaders would approach people and encourage them to put money in a pool to buy blocks of tickets for the hottest concerts and plays, the government said. The most prominent was Hamilton, whose popularity pushed prices to the highest in Broadway history. Victims were promised their money back, and at least a 10 percent profit. Sure, take out Hamilton, and it seems obviously too good to be true, but it’s Hamilton! A show people are taking out second mortgages on their homes to see a year and-a-half after it had its Broadway debut! Without the original cast! How could it not be a sure thing? Deutsche Bank is sorry On an almost weekly basis, financial institutions announce they’ve reached settlements with various government regulators over allegations of wrongdoing that they neither admit nor deny but pay millions and billions to put behind them. Generally, they don’t make a big show of apologizing—or apologizing period—unless whatever they’ve been accused of doing is really, really bad and someone in P.R. demands it. If they take out space in the paper to print a memo detailing all their various screw-ups, apologizing for them, and promising to try really hard not to make them in the future, they’re at the point where they’re internally debating if they should just turn off the lights and let squatters take over the place or give it this one last shot. Deutsche Bank knows what we’re talking about: Deutsche Bank AG bought full-page ads in all major German newspapers over the weekend to apologize for “serious errors” after misconduct costs helped tip the company into two years of losses. Legal cases that date back many years cost the Frankfurt-based company “reputation and trust” in addition to about 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) since John Cryan took over as chief executive officer in July 2015, the CEO said in the ad, blaming the “misconduct of a few” employees. Cryan, who signed on behalf of the executive board, expressed “deep regret” that “the conduct of the bank didn’t follow our standards” in relation to the U.S. mortgage business in 2005 to 2007 and was “unacceptable.” That was also the case in other matters, he wrote. . .Deutsche Bank’s leadership will “do everything in our power to prevent these events from re-occurring,” Cryan said in the ad.

REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A JAKARTA: Indonesia will hold a court hearing on Tuesday into a billion-dollar dispute between Goldman Sachs and a local tycoon, who says the Wall Street giant's unit unlawfully sold shares he owned, in the latest test for the country's legal system. Goldman took the unusual step of counter-suing the tycoon - Benny Tjokrosaputro - for reputational damage. The hearing on Tuesday will give the retail-to-property businessman a chance to rebuff Goldman's assertion. The dispute comes at a time when Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, is embarking on its biggest drive for foreign investment in a decade. Legal experts say the outcome could give an indication on whether the country's civil court proceedings will protect the rights of foreigners. Indonesia's government has recently raised investor concerns by cutting business ties with JPMorgan over a negative research report and partially reversing a mining policy. Goldman's prospects at the hearing could be affected by a general lack of transparency in Indonesian court proceedings, said Bill Sullivan, senior foreign counsel at Indonesian law firm Christian Teo & Partners. "This lack of transparency can result in very surprising decisions, especially when you have a foreign party seeking recovery from a well-resourced and well-connected local party," Sullivan told Reuters in an email. Goldman's dispute with Tjokrosaputro, president director of property developer PT Hanson International Tbk , stems from an arcane area of the financial market in which individuals or firms pledge shares in return for short-term loans, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter. Tjokrosaputro had pledged 425 million Hanson shares to U.S. hedge fund Platinum Partners in return for a loan on the basis that he could get the shares back upon repayment - an arrangement known as a repurchase agreement or a repo. Goldman's unit, Goldman Sachs International, bought the Hanson shares from Platinum as a hedge for the derivatives it had entered into with the fund, a bank spokesman said. In late 2014, New York-based Platinum fell into financial difficulties and had trouble paying back a large number of investors, according to U.S. authorities who recently charged top executives of the fund with running a US$1 billion fraud. Goldman started selling the Hanson shares last year, but was forced to stop after Tjokrosaputro filed a police complaint. He went on to sue Goldman in September for 15 trillion rupiah (US$1.1 billion), alleging the transaction was conducted "unlawfully". Tjokrosaputro's lawyer told Reuters his client did not breach his contract with Platinum and that no-one other than Tjokrosaputro had the right to own or sell the shares. In response, Goldman countersued the tycoon last month for at least US$1.1 billion claiming reputational damage. Goldman "lawfully" acquired the shares from Platinum through the negotiated board of the Indonesian Stock Exchange and the transactions were validly settled, the bank says in its claim documents. A bank spokesman told Reuters that Goldman Sachs International was not aware of Tjokrosaputro's dealings with Platinum, nor any restrictions on the shares it purchased.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 7:20 AM, February 7, 2017 Updated: 8:00 PM, February 7, 2017 JAKARTA - An Indonesian court postponed on Tuesday the hearing of a billion-dollar dispute between Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and a local tycoon by two weeks, granting him time to gather more evidence to prove a claim the U.S. bank's unit unlawfully sold shares he owned. Goldman had taken the unusual step of counter-suing the retail-to-property businessman - Benny Tjokrosaputro - in a Jakarta court claiming reputational damage. The court hearing on Tuesday was set to have given Tjokrosaputro a chance to rebuff Goldman's assertion, but it is now delayed until Feb. 21. The dispute comes at a time when Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, is embarking on its biggest drive for foreign investment in a decade. Its government recently raised investor concerns by cutting business ties with JPMorgan over a negative research report and partially reversing a mining policy. At stake in the Goldman case is the protection of the rights of foreigners, amid a general lack of transparency in Indonesian court proceedings, legal experts say. "This lack of transparency can result in very surprising decisions, especially when you have a foreign party seeking recovery from a well-resourced and well-connected local party," Bill Sullivan, senior foreign counsel at Indonesian law firm Christian Teo & Partners, told Reuters in an email. Goldman's dispute with Tjokrosaputro, president director of property developer PT Hanson International Tbk <MYRX.JK>, stems from an arcane area of the financial market in which individuals or firms sell shares in return for short-term funding, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter. Such a repurchase agreement, or a repo, effectively acts as a loan but the deal involves temporarily transferring legal ownership of the shares. Tjokrosaputro had pledged 425 million Hanson shares to U.S. hedge fund Platinum Partners in return for funding on the basis that he could get the shares back upon repayment, according to Tjokrosaputro's lawyers and court documents. Goldman Sachs International, a London-based unit of Goldman, bought the Hanson shares from Platinum as a hedge for the derivatives it had entered into with the fund, a bank spokesman said.

Goldman "lawfully" acquired the shares from Platinum through the negotiated board of the Indonesian Stock Exchange and the transactions were validly settled, it says in its court documents. A key area of the dispute relates to who actually owned the shares during the repo transaction. Goldman says in its court filings that it "understands" Platinum originally acquired the Hanson shares from an entity named Newrick Holdings Ltd, rather than from Tjokrosaputro. According to the "Panama Papers" online database as of 2015, which compiled millions of leaked documents from law firm Mossack Fonseca, Newrick is a company registered in the British Virgin Islands in which Tjokrosaputro was a shareholder. A bank spokesman told Reuters that Goldman Sachs International was not aware of any dealings between Tjokrosaputro or his affiliated entities and Platinum Partners, nor any restrictions on the shares it purchased. The tycoon's lawyer reiterated on Tuesday that Tjokrosaputro was the legal owner of the shares in the repo transaction with Platinum and, since he did not breach any contract with Platinum, only he had the right to sell them. Tjokrosaputro's lawyer did not immediately provide comment on Goldman's claim that Platinum had acquired the shares from Newrick. Platinum has earlier declined to comment on the dispute.

Legal experts say the outcome could give an indication on whether the country's civil court proceedings will protect the rights of foreigners. Indonesia's government has recently raised investor concerns by cutting business ties with JPMorgan over a negative research report and partially reversing a mining policy. Goldman's prospects at the hearing could be affected by a general lack of transparency in Indonesian court proceedings, said Bill Sullivan, senior foreign counsel at Indonesian law firm Christian Teo & Partners. "This lack of transparency can result in very surprising decisions, especially when you have a foreign party seeking recovery from a well-resourced and well-connected local party," Sullivan told Reuters in an email. Goldman's dispute with Tjokrosaputro, president director of property developer PT Hanson International Tbk, stems from an arcane area of the financial market in which individuals or firms pledge shares in return for short-term loans, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter. Tjokrosaputro had pledged 425 million Hanson shares to U.S. hedge fund Platinum Partners in return for a loan on the basis that he could get the shares back upon repayment - an arrangement known as a repurchase agreement or a repo. Goldman's unit, Goldman Sachs International, bought the Hanson shares from Platinum as a hedge for the derivatives it had entered into with the fund, a bank spokesman said. In late 2014, New York-based Platinum fell into financial difficulties and had trouble paying back a large number of investors, according to U.S. authorities who recently charged top executives of the fund with running a $1 billion fraud. Goldman started selling the Hanson shares last year, but was forced to stop after Tjokrosaputro filed a police complaint. He went on to sue Goldman in September for 15 trillion rupiah ($1.1 billion), alleging the transaction was conducted "unlawfully". Tjokrosaputro's lawyer told Reuters his client did not breach his contract with Platinum and that no-one other than Tjokrosaputro had the right to own or sell the shares. In response, Goldman countersued the tycoon last month for at least $1.1 billion claiming reputational damage. Goldman "lawfully" acquired the shares from Platinum through the negotiated board of the Indonesian Stock Exchange and the transactions were validly settled, the bank says in its claim documents. A bank spokesman told Reuters that Goldman Sachs International was not aware of Tjokrosaputro's dealings with Platinum, nor any restrictions on the shares it purchased.

Today’s marketing has a dirty secret: it’s gotten lazy. During the past decade the number of marketing technology tools has exploded to well over 3,000. Overwhelmingly, those tools have focused on collecting, organizing, and finding insights from data. In response, marketers have defined growth as a mathematical exercise of collecting bigger and bigger datasets. Get all the data you can, goes the conventional wisdom, and software will find the magic bullet buried within the numbers. True, software can create leverage for your marketing efforts. Data can help inform. But as an industry and as a practice, marketing departments are replacing the sound business fundamentals it once practiced with the procedural tasks of buying and leasing data using tools devoted to collecting as much customer data as possible. In this rush to accumulate and sell data for its own sake, we’re jumping past using data to validate a strong product market fit, creating solid positioning, and developing customer trust. After two decades in marketing, my thinking has come full circle. For growth-minded companies, collecting customer data for the sake of collecting data is more risk than the rewards can usually justify. Instead, we should be looking for ways to collect less data and go lean. Why? Because our collection tools create expensive overhead and risks that are impacting the trust of our customers in a negative way. Consider the fallout from the Ashley Madison security breach in 2015, which affected 33 million users and cost the company an estimated $850M in damages — all for a company for which discretion and security is a critical brand value. Or JPMorgan Chase’s cyberattack in 2014, affecting 76 million customers and 7 million small businesses with estimates of total damage around $1B, despite the bank spending $250M per year on data security. In the last year alone, the number of companies selling software products that collect, parse, and help marketers take action on data has increased from around 2,000 to nearly 3,700 companies. That’s about 80 percent growth. It should be a fantastic golden age for marketers right now, but it’s not, because there are a few fundamental problems. What if we’re buying these marketing tools, because we think they will help us achieve growth where there isn’t a viable product market fit? What if it’s easier to continue to collect data than to take a risk without absolute certainty? What if we don’t need customer data beyond what’s explicitly been given to us by the customers already? “The Answer” isn’t in those piles of data, no matter how many marketing tools we use to condense and concatenate it. It usually doesn’t work that way. Hardly ever. Mostly never.  And for most startup and growth-stage companies, the age of Big Data is a confusing mess without the added risks of collecting, storing, and protecting sensitive data. Maintaining data is a full-time obligation to customers and it requires several levels of expertise. IT and marketing have to balance security concerns with access privileges. Data analysts have to balance actionable recommendations with inconclusive results. And everyone in business needs a refresher on the difference between correlation, causation, and sample bias. Because of this obsession with data, we’re slipping a notch further into abstractions of our customers. We’re not doing our fundamental marketing research with the customers themselves: understanding our customer population, knowing if and where they exist, knowing what their needs are, and knowing what benefit we actually provide to them. You might say, “Look, I’m a growth marketer, and these are the tools of the trade. This is the way we have to operate. Just forget about it, and we’ll deal with the data risks if they actually become something real.” But we aren’t dealing with the risks, and they are becoming something real. We know this from first-hand experience. Last year, my team at Mozilla had an epiphany when our customers said, “We actually don’t care about using your services for the reasons that you think. It’s not about you being faster, or better, or whatever. We care about something different.” Our customers said they cared about the purpose that we have as an organization, and by extension they said they cared about being informed and in control about what we do with their information. We believe our customers told us this for a simple reason. People are becoming aware of how businesses violate their privacy, either purposefully or accidentally. Customers know they’re being bought and sold by data brokers. The millennial mindset that’s emerging and changing the consumer world can be summed up in one word: Trust. People want to buy from companies they trust. And I think we, as marketers, should care about that. Trust is earned by living up to our product’s promises and taking care of our customers’ data. We should care, because this is where our growth opportunities are going to be. And we’re not going to be able to meet them by merely maintaining status-quo industry data practices. Instead, I hope I can convince you that trust and growth are not mutually exclusive business tradeoffs, that profits are not stunted by more judicious collection, protection, and use of customer data. To the contrary, lean data practices and profits reinforce one another. More importantly, lean data practices teach us marketers to think carefully about trust. Don’t worry, I’m not saying data doesn’t help. You can still play with data. You can keep your toys. I have mine, too. But for the most part, compiling bigger and more complex sets of customer data will not lead to the big profit and marketshare breakthroughs that Big Data promises. Instead, we marketers must learn to live and think lean. The twin false gods of Big Data and MarTech will continue to encourage thousands of marketers to gather all the data they can wielding an ever-expanding arsenal of tools to sift through it all, with little discussion about whether the mad scramble to vacuum up customer info is worth the trouble, expense, and risk. I challenge the assumption that more data is always better. Rather, I say you can have too much of a good thing. And I call that sort of scrape-first think-later behavior lazy marketing.

We strongly recommend bookmarking this community calendar of rallies, meetings, workshops, and fundraisers dedicated to fighting the good fight. Below, we've amassed a list of great ways to stay active and organized. Let the pinching continue! Get Organized Brooklyn: Full Group Meeting This Monday night, City Council Member Brad Lander will again host a panel discussion and breakout meetings intended to answer your questions about how to become more active in community efforts against Trump's agenda. Although the meeting's space holds 1200 people, it's expected to reach full capacity and then some, so get there early to guarantee yourself a seat! Monday, February 27th, 6:30-9:30 p.m. // Congregation Beth Elohim, 274 Garfield Place, Brooklyn Stand Up For Public Schools: A Candlelight Vigil With Betsy DeVos's confirmation vote hanging by a thread, anyone and everyone who gives a damn about public schools is being encouraged to stand in front of one for an impromptu nationwide candlelight vigil for America's education. You can search the #StandUpForPublicSchools hashtag to find out how others both here in New York and across the country are getting involved (and while you're at it, maybe call your representatives!). Monday, February 6th, 7 p.m. // Any and all public schools Locked in Solidarity To paraphrase a certain Democratic Socialist from Vermont, America needs to invest in jobs and education, not jails and incarceration. For the fourth year in a row, the Christian Community Development Association will rally against the mass injustices that crowd America's prisons with a forum that includes educational talks, first-hand stories from former inmates, planning for future action, and a bit of prayer (hey, it can't hurt). Tuesday, February 7th, 7:30 p.m. // Recovery House of Worship, 360 Schermerhorn Street, Brooklyn Drinking Liberally You can stay involved while intoxicated at Drinking Liberally at Fourth Ave Pub in Boerum Hill on Tuesday night, when the invited guests will be Indivisible Nation BK, a group committed to shedding light on the positions of Trump's appointees and recommending courses of action for protest and civic engagement. Bartenders will be pouring plenty of beer, and Indivisible's organizers will be coming with letters addressed to Senators Schumer and Gillibrand encouraging them to stand up to Trump's executive branch and congressional Republicans for you to sign. Tuesday, February 7th, 7-10 p.m. // Fourth Ave Pub, 76 4th Avenue, Brooklyn Students Resist: A Walkout For A Better Tomorrow As part of a nationwide school walkout planned in protest of Trump's Muslim travel ban, students in Manhattan will gather in Foley Square Tuesday afternoon in solidarity with those targeted by the administration. Given last weekend's Temporary Restraining Order agains the ban, the rally will be focused on permanently killing the ban and creating a society in which people of all ethnicities and creeds are safe. The rally is co-sponsored by the NY Immigration Coalition, Arab American Association of NY, and MPower Change. Tuesday, February 7th, 12-4 p.m. // Foley Square, Manhattan Demonstrators at a 'What the Fuck, Chuck?' rally encouraging Senator Schumer to stand up to Trump's cabinet appointees on January 31st, 2017 (Getty Images) Resist Trump Tuesdays at Schumer and Gillibrand Office Pay New York's Senators a visit and demand that they resist Trump's appointees, executive orders, and legislative plans this Tuesday. Two groups will stop by Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand's local offices in Midtown to specifically demand they decry the Muslim travel ban and block Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Tuesday, February 7th, 12 and 4:30 p.m. // 780 3rd Avenue (between 48th and 49th Streets) Resist Trump Tuesdays to Beat Back the Banks! Of all Trump's proposed policies, his commitment to loosening Wall Street regulations and repealing the Dodd-Frank Act is perhaps the most terrifying, given that unfettered capitalism has caused almost every American recession in the past 70 years. This Tuesday, the Working Families Party will host a gathering as a part of their #ResistTrumpTuesdays series centered around combatting the influence of big banks in government. With former Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn writing executive orders and J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon advising economic policy, we need all the help we can get. Tuesday, February 7th, 6-8 p.m. // 28 Liberty Street (formerly One Chase Manhattan Plaza) The Trump Effect: Immigration, Apparel Manufacturing and the Environment A meet-and-greet with local activist groups will set the stage for a panel discussion on women's rights, immigration, the environment, and manufacturing at Pratt's Brooklyn Fashion + Design Accelerator offices. Speakers will focus on how the shifting political climate will have a direct impact on the apparel industry, and how designers, makers, and marketers can all do their part in the fight for justice. At the talk will be organizing veteran Deirdre Shannon, ITAC's executive director Kinda Younes, and more. Tuesday, February 7th, 6:30-8:30 p.m. // Brooklyn Accelerator, 630 Flushing Ave, 7th Floor Brooklyn // $10 State of Immigration, State of Emergency: What Changes Might Occur Under President Trump & How to Prepare Council Member Jumaane Williams and a trio of state legislators will host an immigration forum this week to parse out the specifics of Trump's proposed policy changes. Most important, though, will be talks on how to prepare for the coming xenophobic mess. Family Reunification, DACA/DAPA, Fee Changes, Temporary Protected Status, and Citizenship Family Based Petitions are all on the agenda. Wednesday, February 8th, 6-8:30 p.m. // Flatbush YMCA, 1401 Flatbush Avenue, Brookklyn NYC Birddogging Training With the Republicans holding onto the Senate by a slim margin and so many local offices and legislative bodies in play, New Yorkers are organizing a "birddogging" workshop on how to get active in campaigns, town hall meetings, and mobilize to get progressives elected at all levels of government. This week's rally is primarily centered around healthcare policy, but other issues will be on the table as well. Wednesday, February 8th, 7-8:30 p.m. // 208 West 13th Street, Manhattan PPA Special Wed Meeting: BlackLivesMatter in the era of Trump A multitude of activist groups including PPA, and NYC Shut It Down are coming together this week to talk about what's next for Black Lives Matter here in NYC. How will Trump's justice department handle police brutality and systemic racism? What sort of tangible goals will organizers be seeking in the coming year? What are the best ways to continue Swiping It Forward in 2017? These questions and more are all on the docket. Wednesday, February 8th, 7-9 p.m. // Solidarity Center NYC, 147 West 24th Street, Second Floor Tattoo to Protect Your Parts: A Planned Parenthood Affair If you've been holding off on getting a new tattoo, this is the week to do it. Renowned ink artist Todd Woodz and his team at Magic Cobra Tattoo Society are setting up shop at Magick City and will be doing a flash sale of $40 blank ink tattoos with all proceeds going to Planned Parenthood. Appointments begin at 2 p.m. and will be available until 7 p.m. sharp, so consider playing hooky from work for the chance to snag some meaningful ink from some of the city's best. There'll be live performances during the day, and it all spills over into St. Vitus's Party To Protect Your Parts: A PP Benefit (also a PP benefit!), just down the block. Wednesday, February 8th, 2-7 p.m. (St. Vitus Party 6:30 p.m. - 12 a.m.) // Magick City, 37 Box Street, Brooklyn // Saint Vitus Bar, 1120 Manhattan Avenue, Brooklyn // Tattoos $40, Concert Tickets $15 Give a Puck: Air Hockey Fundraiser for the ACLU Do you want to help support the ACLU while kicking your friends' asses in air hockey? Of course you do. Thursday, February 9th, 7-11 p.m. // Ocean's 8, 308 Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn // Tickets $20-40 Momentive Strike Rally | Taking the Fight to Schwarzman Trump has done a tremendous job of surrounding himself with billionaires and giving them positions of power and influence, and while pretty much every last one of them should be taken down, this week activists are focusing on Wall Street's "designated villain" Stephen Schwarzman, who chairs Trump's "Strategic and Policy Forum" on jobs and economic growth. Strikers will gather outside Schwarzman's Park Avenue apartment this week to demand his race-to-the-bottom strategy is kept out of Washington. If you can't make it in person, be sure to sign a petition on behalf of Momentive, whose workers recently fell prey to Schwarzman's exploitative uber-capitalism. Thursday, February 9th, 5:30-7:30 p.m. // 740 Park Avenue, Manhattan Stand For Planned Parenthood This Saturday, multiple rallies set on defunding Planned Parenthood have been scheduled across the country. New Yorkers are battling back, of course, but not with a counter-rally outside of clinics—instead, a separate action meant to bolster Planned Parenthood's funding is being planned. Organizers have expressed concerns over crowding the entrance to clinics like Bleecker Street's Margaret Sanger Health Center, and have asked that reproductive rights supporters keep an eye on this page for more instructions. Saturday, February 11th // More info here The People or Trump: A Teach In The choice is easy! The People or Trump is a panel discussion exploring the polarization between what one side needs and what the other side wants. The event will feature a discussion between Distinguished Professor of History from Baruch College and the director of the Arms and Security Project from the Center for Immigration Policy, followed by lunch and a talk with activist Laurie Cagan.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 February 2017 by Military News A Foolish Take: The World’s Most Valuable Bank Brand … Is Now In China Data source: BrandFinance. Chart by author. At different times throughout history, public sentiment has turned against America’s biggest banks. Big banks are dangerous and must be broken up, many people believe. At the very least, they shouldn’t be allowed to get any larger. But the problem with this argument is that by throttling the growth of American banks, the summit of global finance is ceded to institutions in other countries. In fact, the biggest bank in China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, or ICBC, is already roughly a third larger than the biggest bank in the United States, JPMorgan Chase, when measured by the size of their balance sheets. And it’s not just rote size where U.S. banks have begun to lag behind their counterparts in the East Asian country. The same is true when it comes to brand value. ICBC is now the world’s most valuable bank brand, says BrandFinance. Problems at Wells Fargo over the past year — it was caught opening as many as two million fake accounts for customers — caused the California-based bank to fall from the top spot last year. When the White House talks about the importance of enabling American financial companies to compete more effectively with firms abroad, as the President did in a recent executive order targeting the Dodd-Frank Act, these trends are probably what he and his team have in mind.

Trump knocked Hillary Clinton’s paid speeches to Wall Street and villainized Goldman Sachs in his closing campaign ad. Yet Wall Street is enjoying an incredible reversal of fortunes in Washington now that Trump has replaced former President Obama, who famously called bank CEOs “fat cats.” Consider the optics of Trump’s executive order last Friday that kicked off the process of rolling back the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Seated next to the president was Wall Street mega billionaire Stephen Schwarzman, the man who had cobbled together the “world-class group” of CEOs that were at the meeting. Also at the table was Wall Street’s best-known CEO: Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. “There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie,” Trump pointed out. Trump also lavished praised on Larry Fink, the BlackRock boss, for making him richer. “Larry did a great job for me. He managed a lot of my money. I have to tell you, he got me great returns,” Trump said. And the face of the Trump administration’s financial deregulation: Gary Cohn, who was Goldman Sachs’ No. 2 executive until December. Cohn was named Trump’s top economic adviser and walked away from Goldman with a $285 million haul that is raising conflict of interest concerns. On Friday, Cohn appeared on TV channels and granted interviews to explain the planned changes, telling Bloomberg, “We’re going to attack all aspects of Dodd-Frank.” Cohn also stood behind Trump in the Oval Office, looming over the president as he signed the executive order. Trump’s critics pounced, claiming the new president is essentially letting the fox guard the henhouse. “This guy is a fraud,” Senator Bernie Sanders told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday, pointing to Trump’s campaign promises to take on Wall Street. “It is hard not to laugh to see President Trump alongside these Wall Street guys…I think he is going to sell out the middle class, the working class, of this country,” Sanders said. Trump defended his willingness to lean on Wall Street CEOs for advice, explaining he’s focused on creating jobs. “When I campaigned for office I promised the American people that I’d ask for our country’s best and brightest,” Trump said on Friday. This newfound friendship between Wall Street and Washington is an about-face from life under Obama. Bank CEOs never forgave Obama for calling them “fat cats” in the opening weeks of his administration amid a public uproar over golden parachutes for execs who contributed to the financial crisis. Now big bank stocks are enjoying a big post-election surge, which continued last week as Trump promised to “do a big number” on the shackles placed on Wall Street following the 2008 meltdown that wrecked the economy. Goldman Sachs stock alone surged nearly 5% on Friday, up an incredible 33% since Trump’s victory. Goldman, like other big banks, is benefiting from Trump’s bashing of the laws put in place to prevent another Wall Street meltdown. Bank stocks are climbing on hopes that Trump will usher in faster growth in part by slashing taxes. It can’t hurt that Trump has hired numerous ex-Goldman Sachs guys to help him run the country. Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin was a Goldman Sachs partner, Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon also worked there, and Trump picked Jay Clayton, a former lawyer who represented Goldman Sachs and other big banks, to lead the SEC.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Feb 6, 2017 at 1:41PM Data source: BrandFinance. Chart by author. At different times throughout history, public sentiment has turned against America's biggest banks. Big banks are dangerous and must be broken up, many people believe. At the very least, they shouldn't be allowed to get any larger. But the problem with this argument is that by throttling the growth of American banks, the summit of global finance is ceded to institutions in other countries. In fact, the biggest bank in China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, or ICBC, is already roughly a third larger than the biggest bank in the United States, JPMorgan Chase, when measured by the size of their balance sheets. And it's not just rote size where U.S. banks have begun to lag behind their counterparts in the East Asian country. The same is true when it comes to brand value. ICBC is now the world's most valuable bank brand, says BrandFinance. Problems at Wells Fargo over the past year -- it was caught opening as many as two million fake accounts for customers -- caused the California-based bank to fall from the top spot last year. When the White House talks about the importance of enabling American financial companies to compete more effectively with firms abroad, as the President did in a recent executive order targeting the Dodd-Frank Act, these trends are probably what he and his team have in mind.

The JPMorgan Chase CEO stood amid the tumult and said the market was cheap. He backed up his belief by purchasing 500,000 shares of his company's stock, which was tanking at the time. He never actually called a market trough, but many in the market since then have referred to it as the "Dimon bottom." Much has been made of the move and deservedly so considering the profit Dimon made on that purchase — what appears now to be a $17 million gain on a $26.6 million investment, just based on the shares purchased that day. That's based on where JPMorgan stock was compared with where it is now. And that doesn't even account for the total profit he made on his holdings. The Feb. 11, 2016, purchase came at an average price of $53.18. The stock closed Friday at $87.18, equaling a $34 per share gain, or 64 percent. David A. Grogan | CNBC Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co. at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Bank shares actually saw mediocre performance through much of the year, but a late-year rally fueled by Donald Trump's upset victory in the presidential race sent financial stocks soaring. JPMorgan shares are up 24 percent since Election Day. The purchase brought Dimon's total holdings in his bank to about 6.75 million shares, which would have been worth $359 million at the time. Given the $34 per share rise in JPMorgan's stock price, those holdings are now worth closer to $588.5 million. That would be a gain of over $229 million. To be sure, it was a bold move that could have gone otherwise. At the time, there were fears of a global recession brought on by a slowdown in China. Investors worried that Deutsche Bank was in major trouble, the Federal Reserve appeared determined to raise interest rates even amid the difficulties and political uncertainty was running high. Warren Buffett is fond of saying that he is fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful. For Dimon, it's a lesson that paid off handsomely. Correction: The version has been updated to reflect that Jamie Dimon's holdings have surged by $229 million since his 2016 "bottom" buy. show chapters JPMorgan's Dimon meets with Trump economic advisor    Friday, 27 Jan 2017 | 3:47 PM ET | 01:55 Jeff CoxFinance Editor Dominic ChuCNBC Markets Reporter Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change JPM --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Paul Waldman By Paul Waldman February 6 Follow @paulwaldman1 During a meeting with business executives, President Trump said he expects to "be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank," on Feb. 3 at the White House. (The Washington Post) Alongside the idea that America was a fetid pit of misery and despair from which only he could deliver us, the most consistent theme of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was that the “elites” had ignored the interests of ordinary people for too long. If you put your faith in him, Trump argued, he would give you your country back and make it great again. Some of us were more than a bit skeptical of this claim, arguing that Trump’s “populism” was more stylistic than substantive, and if elected he’d pursue the interests of the wealthy with as much zeal as any Republican. Well now he’s president, and we’re finding out just how far Donald Trump and those he has chosen to work for him will go to screw over consumers. Just in these first couple of weeks, he’s already undertaken a remarkable number of anti-consumer initiatives. Let’s run down some of them: On Friday, Trump signed an executive order to begin exploring ways to ease regulations on Wall Street banks. “We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank,” the law passed to prevent a repeat of the 2009 financial meltdown, he explained, “Because frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine, that had nice businesses, they just can’t borrow money.” Whatever the alleged fortunes of Donald Trump’s friends, all evidence suggests that credit is widely available for businesses and individuals. But he made clear who he’s listening to: “There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie, so you’re going to tell me about it,” he said of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. As part of the Wall Street deregulation effort, Trump will likely target the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an idea originated by Elizabeth Warren before she became a senator. In the five and a half years of its existence, the CFPB has returned billions of dollars to consumers wronged by banks, credit card companies, payday lenders, and debt collectors. They also unraveled the Wells Fargo scandal, in which the bank created accounts in the names of thousands of customers without their knowledge. So as far as Trump and congressional Republicans are concerned, the CFPB has got to go. On Friday Trump signed another executive order instructing the Department of Labor to prepare the ground to rescind the “fiduciary rule,” a regulation the Obama administration wrote last year. It requires financial advisers to act in their client’s best interests, just like doctors or lawyers are required to. The need for it came about because often those advisers push their clients to buy products that are bad for them but that bring the advisers higher commissions. You’d think that a rule saying you have to serve your client would be uncontroversial, but no. The administration is preparing to kill an Obama-era Labor Department rule that would have meant overtime pay for millions of American workers. Trump’s new head of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, has been on a tear. As the New York Times described it, “Mr. Pai took a first swipe at net neutrality rules designed to ensure equal access to content on the internet. He stopped nine companies from providing discounted high-speed internet service to low-income individuals. He withdrew an effort to keep prison phone rates down, and he scrapped a proposal to break open the cable box market.” Trump has not yet chosen the new head of the Food and Drug Administration, but all the candidates are interested in reducing the regulations that protect consumers. The leading contender believes that drugs should be allowed on the market before they’ve been shown to actually do what they claim. This is just one corner of the actions the Trump administration is taking on a range of issues, but the unifying principle of these moves is that corporations should be free to do what they want, even if it hurts consumers, workers, or ordinary citizens. Indeed, the expansion of corporate power and privileges already looks like it will be one of the hallmarks of this administration. Which would make it no different from any other Republican administration. But that’s precisely my point: for all Trump’s rhetoric about taking on the “elite,” when it comes to making policy he’s just as interested in enhancing corporate power at the expense of citizens as is Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell. “But what about trade?” you might say. “Isn’t he a populist there?” We don’t yet know, because Trump is so vague on what he would actually do about trade. All he says is that past trade agreements were terrible deals, and he’ll make them better. How? Who knows. As this blog has pointed out before, the mere fact that Trump says he’ll revamp our trade deals doesn’t mean he’d do so in a way that favors the interests of workers. The only concrete thing the administration has suggested on trade was a 20 percent tariff on goods coming in from Mexico in order to pay for a border wall, a tariff that would of course be paid by American consumers. While you would have known all this if you had paid close attention during the campaign, millions of people convinced themselves that Trump would be looking out for the little guy once he got to office. You may remember the closing ad of the Trump campaign, in which he decried “a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.” Two weeks into the Trump administration, it seems like it was almost a joke. And just wait until Republicans start cutting taxes for the wealthy.   opinions plum-line Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

On the campaign trail, Trump slammed Wall Street for causing "tremendous problems" and promised to "drain the swamp" in part by breaking up the biggest banks. Trump knocked Hillary Clinton's paid speeches to Wall Street and villainized Goldman Sachs in his closing campaign ad. Yet Wall Street is enjoying an incredible reversal of fortunes in Washington now that Trump has replaced former President Obama, who famously called bank CEOs "fat cats." Consider the optics of Trump's executive order last Friday that kicked off the process of rolling back the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Seated next to the president was Wall Street mega billionaire Stephen Schwarzman, the man who had cobbled together the "world-class group" of CEOs that were at the meeting. Also at the table was Wall Street's best-known CEO: Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase (JPM). "There's nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie," Trump pointed out. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon (left) is greeted by President Trump during a meeting of CEOs advising the White House on economic policy. Related: Trump begins dismantling Obama financial regulations Trump also lavished praised on Larry Fink, the BlackRock (BLK) boss, for making him richer. "Larry did a great job for me. He managed a lot of my money. I have to tell you, he got me great returns," Trump said. And the face of the Trump administration's financial deregulation: Gary Cohn, who was Goldman Sachs (GS)' No. 2 executive until December. Cohn was named Trump's top economic adviser and walked away from Goldman with a $285 million haul that is raising conflict of interest concerns. On Friday, Cohn appeared on TV channels and granted interviews to explain the planned changes, telling Bloomberg, "We're going to attack all aspects of Dodd-Frank." Cohn also stood behind Trump in the Oval Office, looming over the president as he signed the executive order. Trump's critics pounced, claiming the new president is essentially letting the fox guard the henhouse. "This guy is a fraud," Senator Bernie Sanders told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union" on Sunday, pointing to Trump's campaign promises to take on Wall Street. "It is hard not to laugh to see President Trump alongside these Wall Street guys...I think he is going to sell out the middle class, the working class, of this country," Sanders said. Trump defended his willingness to lean on Wall Street CEOs for advice, explaining he's focused on creating jobs. "When I campaigned for office I promised the American people that I'd ask for our country's best and brightest," Trump said on Friday. Gary Cohn, former president of Goldman Sachs, watches as President Trump signs an executive order that begins the process of rolling back bank regulation. Related: Elizabeth Warren to Cohn: Recuse yourself This newfound friendship between Wall Street and Washington is an about-face from life under Obama. Bank CEOs never forgave Obama for calling them "fat cats" in the opening weeks of his administration amid a public uproar over golden parachutes for execs who contributed to the financial crisis. Now big bank stocks are enjoying a big post-election surge, which continued last week as Trump promised to "do a big number" on the shackles placed on Wall Street following the 2008 meltdown that wrecked the economy. Goldman Sachs stock alone surged nearly 5% on Friday, up an incredible 33% since Trump's victory. Goldman, like other big banks, is benefiting from Trump's bashing of the laws put in place to prevent another Wall Street meltdown. Bank stocks are climbing on hopes that Trump will usher in faster growth in part by slashing taxes. It can't hurt that Trump has hired numerous ex-Goldman Sachs guys to help him run the country. Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin was a Goldman Sachs partner, Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon also worked there, and Trump picked Jay Clayton, a former lawyer who represented Goldman Sachs and other big banks, to lead the SEC.

Born on this date in 1756, Burr is mainly remembered for two things: killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel and later getting himself tried for treason under President Jefferson. Less attention is usually paid to Burr’s major accomplishments. Did you know, for example, that he basically invented modern campaign organizing? Or that he helped Tennessee join the union? Or that he had a remarkably progressive outlook on women’s rights for a man of his time? If you love the Hamilton musical, these 14 facts should give you a whole new outlook on the show’s most compelling character. 1. HE GRADUATED FROM PRINCETON AT AGE 16. Burr was left an orphan at the age of 2. The toddler and his sister Sally (then nearly 4) were taken in by their maternal uncle, Timothy Edwards. For two years, the youngsters lived in Stockbridge, Massachusetts before they relocated with Edwards to Elizabethtown, New Jersey. An intelligent, precocious boy, Burr submitted an application to Princeton (then the College of New Jersey) when he was just 11 years old. An examiner barred his admission, but that didn’t stop Burr from reapplying two years later. This time, Burr—now 13—was accepted into the university, which his late father had presided over. Four years younger than most of his classmates, he earned the affectionate nickname “Little Burr,” a reference to both the teen’s age and his short stature. He graduated with distinction in 1772. 2. DURING THE REVOLUTION, BURR SERVED UNDER BENEDICT ARNOLD FOR A TIME. Both of these guys would one day know how it felt to be the most notorious person in America. In 1775, Colonel Benedict Arnold led a contingent of patriot soldiers from Massachusetts to Quebec City by way of Maine. Altogether, some 1100 men made the journey; Burr was one of them. En route, the impressed colonel remarked that this future vice president was “a young gentleman of much life and activity [who] has acted with great spirit and resolution on our fatiguing march.” Fatiguing march, indeed: Arnold had severely underestimated the severity of the trek, and around 500 of his men had run off, died, or been captured by the time they reached their destination. Near the end of this northward trudge, Burr was sent to deliver a message to General Richard Montgomery who, having taken Montreal, was also on his way to Quebec City with his own force of 300 men. Montgomery took an instant liking to Burr and recruited him as his personal aide-de-camp—but their partnership would soon be cut short. On December 31, in the midst of a snowy winter’s battle, the general was killed by a cannon blast on the outskirts of the city. Some eyewitnesses later reported that Burr tried in vain to retrieve his commander’s body from the battlefield, but historians have their doubts about this story. 3. BURR WILLINGLY LEFT GEORGE WASHINGTON’S MILITARY STAFF. In 1776, Burr received an invitation to join Washington’s staff, and that June—after he returned from fighting in Quebec—he met the general in person to accept the position. But he wouldn’t retain it for long; not content to serve as “a practical clerk,” Burr started yearning for a job that would expose him to more combat action. Within a month, he requested and received a transfer to the staff of Major General Israel Putnam. From there, the relationship between Burr and Washington cooled. In 1798, the Virginian threw some shade on his one-time staffer, saying, “By all that I have known and heard, [Burr] is a brave and able officer, but the question is whether he has not equal talents at intrigue?” The tension was two-sided: According to John Adams, Burr once privately remarked that “he despised Washington as a man of no talents and one who could not spell a sentence of common English.” 4. HE ADMIRED MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT. Unlike most of his contemporaries, Burr had feminist leanings. On July 2, 1782, he married his first wife, Theodosia Prevost Bartow. The two had much in common, including a deep admiration for women’s rights essayist Mary Wollstonecraft. (In fact, they even hung her portrait on their mantle.) The mother of Frankenstein author Mary Shelley, Wollstonecraft’s best-known writing is, by far, her 1792 manifesto A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Considered a watershed document in the history of feminism, it passionately argued that members of both sexes deserve the same fundamental rights, and denounced the educational systems of its era for failing to provide women with the opportunities afforded to men. The Burrs loved it: In 1793, Aaron described Wollstonecraft’s essay as “a work of genius.” To his dismay, however, his peers seemed to overwhelmingly disregard the text. “Is it owing to ignorance or prejudice that I have not yet met a single person who had discovered or would allow the merit of this work?” Burr once asked. In keeping with Wollstonecraft’s philosophy, the Burrs saw to it that their daughter, also named Theodosia, received a top-notch education—the kind normally reserved for boys. 5. BURR FOUNDED WHAT LATER BECAME J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. Shortly after the war wrapped up, Burr established himself as one of New York City’s hottest lawyers—and its most prominent Democratic-Republican. For many years, his party found itself at a major disadvantage in the Big Apple. In the early 1790s, the city’s banks were all run by rich Federalists, and none of these establishments would lend money to Democratic-Republicans. So in 1798, Burr hatched a plot to get around this. Taking advantage of a recent yellow fever epidemic, Burr asked the Federalist-controlled state legislature to give him a charter for what he called The Manhattan Company, a private organization that would provide New Yorkers with fresh, clean water. One of the most passionate supporters of Burr’s plan was none other than Mr. Federalist himself, Alexander Hamilton—though he would soon regret coming to his rival’s aid. In 1799, the legislature gave Burr that charter, which included a clause that allowed the Manhattan Company to employ “surplus capital” in any “monied transactions or operations not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of this state or of the United States.” Using this major loophole, Burr turned the Manhattan Company into a Democratic-Republican bank. It barely delivered water at all (although to keep the charter, a bank employee would ceremoniously pump water until 1923). Hamilton—along with the entire New York legislature—had been duped into helping Burr break the Federalist monopoly on banking in the city. The Manhattan Company has since evolved into JP Morgan Chase & Co., one of the largest banking institutions in the world. It now owns the pistols that were used in the Burr-Hamilton duel. 6. IN THE SENATE, HE HELPED TENNESSEE ACHIEVE STATEHOOD. Backed by New York Governor George Clinton and his family, Burr became a senator for the state of New York in 1791. Five years later, Senator Burr played a key role in Tennessee’s admission to the Union. Early in 1796, when the future state was still considered a federal territory, Governor William Blount spearheaded a constitutional convention at its voters’ behest. A constitution was drafted in Knoxville and then presented to both chambers of the U.S. Congress. Upon reviewing the document, the House, with its Democratic-Republican majority, voted to grant Tennessee its statehood. However, the Senate was dominated by Federalists, who stalled—and a partisan gridlock ensued. As a manager of the bipartisan Senate committee that had been created to deal with this problem, Burr rallied most of his colleagues to Tennessee’s cause. In the end, the committee came out in favor of the territory’s bid for admission into the Union. Shortly thereafter, the Senate voted to give Tennessee statehood status. It officially became America’s 16th state on June 1, 1796. Burr’s actions earned him the gratitude of many a prominent Tennessean. “I pronounce positively that Mr. Burr ... may be ranked among [Tennessee’s] very warmest friends,” Governor Blount declared. And when Burr visited the Volunteer State in 1805, Andrew Jackson entertained him as his personal houseguest in Nashville. At one point, Old Hickory even suggested that Burr relocate to Tennessee—where both men were quite popular—and seek public office there. 7. HE ONCE KEPT ALEXANDER HAMILTON OUT OF A DUEL. The man on the $10 bill nearly traded gunfire with America’s fifth president. Here’s what happened: In 1792, then-senator James Monroe and two of his fellow Democratic-Republicans had accused Hamilton of illegally giving government money to a man named James Reynolds, who was in prison for committing forgery. When they confronted him, Hamilton revealed that he was having an affair with Reynolds’s wife; Reynolds had demanded payment to keep quiet and to allow the affair to continue. The investigation wrapped up shortly thereafter, but Hamilton wasn’t out of the woods yet: In 1797, muckraking journalist James Callender publicly exposed the affair. Convinced that Monroe must have leaked the story, Hamilton went to confront his longtime opponent. Angrily, the two politicians waged a shouting match. “Do you say I represented falsely? You are a scoundrel,” Monroe barked. “I will meet you like a gentleman,” Hamilton said. “I am ready,” Monroe replied, “get your pistols.” Within a month, both founders were preparing themselves in earnest for a duel. But the showdown never came—and it was Burr who put an end it. Monroe picked Burr as his “second,” a designated go-between charged with negotiating the terms of this impending clash. For his part, Burr figured that both Hamilton and Monroe were being “childish,” and he did everything in his power to prevent them from squaring off. Eventually, he was able to calm both parties down: Thanks to Burr’s diplomacy, the duel went unfought. 8. HE LOVED CIGARS. In Fallen Founder: the Life of Aaron Burr, historian Nancy Isenberg writes that John Greenwood, who served as Burr’s law clerk from 1814 to 1820, “knew Burr … as a constant cigar smoker, for instance—he had extra long cigars made especially for him.” Often, the law clerk would find his boss cloaked in a haze of tobacco smoke. During Burr’s travels in Europe, he’d sometimes burn through as many as six cigars a day. He also discovered that the choicer ones paired well with rancio wines, which he said “[recall] the spiciness of tobacco, and they are the ideal accompaniment for cigars, often complementing them better than brandies.” 9. HE’S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FIGURES IN THE HISTORY OF TAMMANY HALL. To quote Gore Vidal, “Aaron Burr … professionalized politics in the United States.” Just look at Tammany Hall. Founded in 1788, this organization started out as the “Society of Saint Tammany,” a non-political New York City social club that appealed to immigrant and working families. But by the mid-19th century, it had been transformed into Gotham’s strongest political faction—and it was Burr who triggered the change. During the election of 1800, Burr made it his mission to win New York’s 12 electoral votes for the Democratic-Republican party. To help him do so, he enlisted the Society of Saint Tammany. Though Burr never belonged to the club, he easily capitalized on the anti-Federalist sentiments of its immigrant members, who loathed the party of John Adams and his Alien & Sedition Acts. Under Burr’s leadership, Tammany volunteers campaigned door-to-door and raised money from local donors. All their hard work paid off in dividends when Thomas Jefferson and Burr carried New York en route to winning the White House. 10. AFTER BURR KILLED HAMILTON IN THAT DUEL, TWO DIFFERENT STATES INDICTED HIM FOR MURDER. Like Washington, Jefferson eventually grew wary of Burr. Believing that the New Yorker had schemed to seize the presidency for himself in 1800, Jefferson resolved to drop his V.P. from the Democratic-Republican ticket in 1804. Realizing that he’d soon be out of the job, Burr made a bid to re-enter the arena of New York politics. In the spring of 1804, he ran for governor, but was roundly defeated by fellow Democratic-Republican Morgan Lewis. It was during this campaign that Hamilton made the remarks that sealed his fate. While the race was going on, Hamilton vocally denounced Burr at a dinner party. Among those in attendance was Charles Cooper, a Democratic-Republican who sent off a letter to a friend describing Hamilton’s comments. Somehow, bits and pieces of the letter began appearing in local newspapers, prompting a stern denial from Hamilton’s father-in-law Philip Schuyler. An angry Cooper wrote a letter to Schuyler saying that Schuyler should be happy he had been “unusually cautious” and that “I could detail to you a still more despicable opinion which General Hamilton has expressed of Mr. Burr.” This letter too wound up in the press, and in June the relevant paper was sent to Burr, who wasted no time in contacting Hamilton. “You must perceive, Sir,” he wrote, “the necessity of a prompt and unqualified acknowledgement or denial of the use of any expressions which could warrant the assertions of Dr. Cooper.” Thus began an exchange of letters that culminated in the infamous duel of July 11, 1804. As anyone who’s listened to the Hamilton soundtrack knows, Burr won. But what the show leaves out is the incident’s legal aftermath. That August, a New York coroner’s jury indicted him for murder. The following October, New Jersey—where the duel had been fought—did likewise. In a letter to his daughter, Burr explained his predicament thusly: “There is a contention of a singular nature between the two States of New York and New Jersey. The subject in dispute is which shall have the honor of hanging the Vice President. You shall have due notice of time and place.” But Burr didn't hang. At the urging of Burr’s Democratic-Republican friends in the U.S. Senate, New Jersey dismissed its indictment against him in 1807; New York also dropped the murder charges. 11. BURR WAS FAMOUSLY TRIED FOR (AND ACQUITTED OF) TREASON. Correctly assessing that the New York City area was no longer a safe place for him, Vice President Burr ran away to Georgia in August 1804, where he briefly stayed at the plantation of Major Pierce Butler. But as the sitting V.P., he couldn’t stay away from Capitol Hill for long. By November 4, he was back in Washington to preside over the impeachment trial of Samuel Chase, a Federalist Supreme Court Justice. The trial wrapped up on March 1, 1805 and Chase was acquitted. One day later, Burr gave a stirring farewell address to the Senate and took his leave. Soon, he would be replaced as Jefferson’s vice president by George Clinton. And yet, the administration hadn’t seen the last of Aaron Burr. Not by a long shot. The word filibuster had a different meaning in the early 19th century. Back then, it was defined as “one who engages in unauthorized and irregular warfare against foreign states.” With his prospects on the east coast looking bleak, Burr headed westward to establish one in 1805. He attracted around 60 men to his cause and began arousing plenty of suspicion. His modern defenders argue that the former vice president was convinced there’d soon be a war between the U.S. and Mexico, and that he may have been planning to bide his time in the American south until said war broke out, at which point he’d lead his men into Spanish-controlled territory. But there were those who believed Burr wanted nothing less than to conquer America’s western holdings and create his own nation there. President Jefferson assumed the worst. In 1806, the commander-in-chief called for Burr’s arrest. He got his wish on February 19, 1807, when Burr was apprehended in present-day Alabama. Burr was subsequently charged with treason and taken to the United States Court for the Fifth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia. Presiding over the case was John Marshall, Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, who said that the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence with which to convict Burr—and he was acquitted. Once again, though, Burr sensed that public opinion had turned sharply against him. In 1808, the disgraced politician set sail for Europe and didn’t return to the States until 1812. 12. WHEN BURR’S SECOND WIFE LEFT HIM, SHE HIRED ALEXANDER HAMILTON JR. AS HER DIVORCE ATTORNEY. Talk about courtroom drama! Burr’s first wife had passed away in 1794, a victim of stomach cancer. He didn’t remarry until 1833, when he exchanged “I dos” with a rich widow named Eliza Jumel. (In the interim, his beloved daughter, Theodosia, vanished forever at sea.) After two turbulent years, Jumel accused Burr of committing adultery and of trying to liquidate her fortune, and sued for divorce. Her attorney during the proceedings was Alexander Hamilton Jr. Yes, the son of the man Aaron Burr had shot in 1804 represented his estranged second wife in a highly-publicized divorce case that was derided by haughty Whig newspapers. Burr died on September 14, 1846—the day this divorce was made final. 13. MARTIN VAN BUREN WAS RUMORED TO BE BURR’S ILLEGITIMATE SON. They shared a knack for growing sideburns, but no genes. “Old Kinderhook,” as Van Buren was sometimes known, first met Burr in 1803. The two became reacquainted after Jefferson’s former V.P. came back from his self-imposed European exile and resumed his New York law practice. Together, they ended up collaborating on a handful of legal cases. This gave rise to the absurd rumor—as recorded by John Quincy Adams in his diary—that Van Buren was Burr’s bastard child. 14. A WORK OF AARON BURR EROTICA WAS ANONYMOUSLY PUBLISHED IN 1861. No really, this exists. Burr’s enemies—including Hamilton—were known to accuse him of rampant womanizing. Such rumors help explain what is quite possibly the strangest work in American literature: 1861’s The Amorous Intrigues and Adventures of Aaron Burr. Presented as a novelized biography, the book (whose author is unknown) retells everything from Burr’s birth in 1756 to his death 80 years later. But it also includes lurid descriptions of fictitious sexual conquests in several different states, with virgins, young widows, and unhappy wives constantly throwing themselves at our protagonist. For those who might be looking for a less racy novel about Jefferson’s first vice president, there’s Gore Vidal’s 1973 best-seller, Burr.

Trump knocked Hillary Clinton’s paid speeches to Wall Street and villainized Goldman Sachs in his closing campaign ad. Yet Wall Street is enjoying an incredible reversal of fortunes in Washington now that Trump has replaced former President Obama, who famously called bank CEOs “fat cats.” Consider the optics of Trump’s executive order last Friday that kicked off the process of rolling back the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Seated next to the president was Wall Street mega billionaire Stephen Schwarzman, the man who had cobbled together the “world-class group” of CEOs that were at the meeting. Also at the table was Wall Street’s best-known CEO: Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. “There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie,” Trump pointed out. Trump also lavished praised on Larry Fink, the BlackRock boss, for making him richer. “Larry did a great job for me. He managed a lot of my money. I have to tell you, he got me great returns,” Trump said. And the face of the Trump administration’s financial deregulation: Gary Cohn, who was Goldman Sachs’ No. 2 executive until December. Cohn was named Trump’s top economic adviser and walked away from Goldman with a $285 million haul that is raising conflict of interest concerns. On Friday, Cohn appeared on TV channels and granted interviews to explain the planned changes, telling Bloomberg, “We’re going to attack all aspects of Dodd-Frank.” Cohn also stood behind Trump in the Oval Office, looming over the president as he signed the executive order. Trump’s critics pounced, claiming the new president is essentially letting the fox guard the henhouse. “This guy is a fraud,” Senator Bernie Sanders told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday, pointing to Trump’s campaign promises to take on Wall Street. “It is hard not to laugh to see President Trump alongside these Wall Street guys…I think he is going to sell out the middle class, the working class, of this country,” Sanders said. Trump defended his willingness to lean on Wall Street CEOs for advice, explaining he’s focused on creating jobs. “When I campaigned for office I promised the American people that I’d ask for our country’s best and brightest,” Trump said on Friday. This newfound friendship between Wall Street and Washington is an about-face from life under Obama. Bank CEOs never forgave Obama for calling them “fat cats” in the opening weeks of his administration amid a public uproar over golden parachutes for execs who contributed to the financial crisis. Now big bank stocks are enjoying a big post-election surge, which continued last week as Trump promised to “do a big number” on the shackles placed on Wall Street following the 2008 meltdown that wrecked the economy. Goldman Sachs stock alone surged nearly 5% on Friday, up an incredible 33% since Trump’s victory. Goldman, like other big banks, is benefiting from Trump’s bashing of the laws put in place to prevent another Wall Street meltdown. Bank stocks are climbing on hopes that Trump will usher in faster growth in part by slashing taxes. It can’t hurt that Trump has hired numerous ex-Goldman Sachs guys to help him run the country. Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin was a Goldman Sachs partner, Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon also worked there, and Trump picked Jay Clayton, a former Goldman lawyer, to lead the SEC.

The license enables JPMorgan to underwrite debt financing instruments issued by non-financial entities, including commercial papers, medium-term notes and other instruments approved by regulators, it said. The license was granted by the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors, which oversees the Chinese interbank bond market, said a JPMorgan statement. China is the third-largest bond market in the world, with 43.7 trillion yuan (US$6.4 trillion) outstanding at the end of 2016 and the interbank bond market accounting for over 90 percent, said China Central Depository & Clearing Co.

Life Buy/Sell Business Close Tyson reveals subpoena likely linked to alleged price-fixing Reuters Feb 6, 2017 (…) Tyson Foods Inc. said on Monday it received a subpoena from U.S. authorities, and was cooperating with an investigation, which it believes to be in an early stage. Last year, U.S. poultry buyers sued Tyson, the nation's biggest chicken processor, and other companies, claiming they had colluded since 2008 to reduce production in violation of antitrust laws. Tyson has denied the accusations. The seller of Jimmy Dean sausage and Ball Park hot dogs received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 20 in connection with an investigation related to the company, according to documents filed with the SEC. The company revealed the subpoena as it reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit, helped by higher beef and pork exports and lower livestock costs. Commenting on the SEC subpoena, JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman said "obviously it is not a positive" for Tyson shares. The subpoena and strong results come as Tom Hayes is getting his footing as Tyson's new chief executive officer. He took over from former CEO Donnie Smith on Dec. 31. "We wonder what exactly is being investigated and what risk this creates for Tyson," RBC Capital Markets said about the subpoena. In a separate lawsuit last month, chicken farmers sued Tyson and other top U.S. poultry companies for allegedly conspiring to depress their pay. Tyson has denied those allegations. The company has sought to increase profit by selling more value-added items such as pre-seasoned products and heat-and-serve meals, which command higher margins than basic meats. Net income attributable to Tyson rose to $593 million, or $1.59 per share, in the first quarter ended Dec. 31, from $461 million, or $1.15 per share, a year earlier.

Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.26 per share and revenue of $9.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Tyson said earnings per share and operating margins for Tyson's pork and beef units reached record highs in the quarter. "Strong exports and big domestic supply created the perfect storm for beef and pork," RBC Capital Markets said. Tyson raised its forecast for full-year profit to $4.90 to $5.05 per share, up from its earlier forecast of $4.70 to $4.85. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

The JPMorgan Chase CEO stood amid the tumult and said the market was cheap. He backed up his belief by purchasing 500,000 shares of his company's stock, which was tanking at the time. He never actually called a market trough, but many in the market since then have referred to it as the "Dimon bottom." Much has been made of the move and deservedly so considering the profit Dimon made on that purchase — what appears now to be a $17 million gain on a $26.6 million investment, just based on the shares purchased that day. That's based on where JPMorgan stock was compared with where it is now. And that doesn't even account for the total profit he made on his holdings. The Feb. 11, 2016, purchase came at an average price of $53.18. The stock closed Friday at $87.18, equaling a $34 per share gain, or 64 percent. David A. Grogan | CNBC Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co. at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Bank shares actually saw mediocre performance through much of the year, but a late-year rally fueled by Donald Trump's upset victory in the presidential race sent financial stocks soaring. JPMorgan shares are up 24 percent since Election Day. The purchase brought Dimon's total holdings in his bank to about 6.75 million shares, which would have been worth $359 million at the time. Given the $34 per share rise in JPMorgan's stock price, those holdings are now worth closer to $588.5 million. That would be a gain of over $229 million. To be sure, it was a bold move that could have gone otherwise. At the time, there were fears of a global recession brought on by a slowdown in China. Investors worried that Deutsche Bank was in major trouble, the Federal Reserve appeared determined to raise interest rates even amid the difficulties and political uncertainty was running high. Warren Buffett is fond of saying that he is fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful. For Dimon, it's a lesson that paid off handsomely. Correction: The version has been updated to reflect that Jamie Dimon's holdings have surged by $229 million since his 2016 "bottom" buy. show chapters JPMorgan's Dimon meets with Trump economic advisor    Friday, 27 Jan 2017 | 3:47 PM ET | 01:55 Jeff CoxFinance Editor Dominic ChuCNBC Markets Reporter Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change JPM --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Just how big is hard to quantify. But over the past month, a number of Fed officials have openly discussed the need for the central bank to reduce its bond holdings, which it amassed as part of its unprecedented quantitative easing during and after the financial crisis. The talk has prompted some on Wall Street to suggest the Fed will start its drawdown as soon as this year, which has refocused attention on its $1.75 trillion stash of mortgage-backed securities. While the Fed also owns Treasuries as part of its $4.45 trillion of assets, its MBS holdings have long been a contentious issue, with some lawmakers criticizing the investments as beyond what’s needed to achieve the central bank’s mandate. Yet because the Fed is now the biggest source of demand for U.S. government-backed mortgage debt and owns a third of the market, any move is likely to boost costs for home buyers. In the past year alone, the Fed bought $387 billion of mortgage bonds just to maintain its holdings. Getting out of the bond-buying business as the economy strengthens could help lift 30-year mortgage rates past 6 percent within three years, according to Moody’s Analytics Inc. Unwinding QE “will be a massive and long-lasting hit” for the mortgage market, said Michael Cloherty, the head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at RBC Capital Markets. He expects the Fed to start paring its investments in the fourth quarter and ultimately dispose of all its MBS holdings. Unprecedented Buying Unlike Treasuries, the Fed rarely owned mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis. Over the years, its purchases have been key in getting the housing market back on its feet. Along with near-zero interest rates, the demand from the Fed reduced the cost mortgage debt relative to Treasuries and encouraged banks to extend more loans to consumers. In a roughly two-year span that ended in 2014, the Fed increased its MBS holdings by about $1 trillion, which it has maintained by reinvesting its maturing debt. Since then, 30-year bonds composed of Fannie Mae-backed mortgages have only been about a percentage point higher than the average yield for five- and 10-year Treasuries, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s less than the spread during housing boom in 2005 and 2006. Talk of the Fed pulling back from the market has bond dealers anticipating that spreads will widen. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees the gap increasing 0.1 percentage point this year, while strategists from JPMorgan Chase & Co. say that once the Fed actually starts to slow its MBS reinvestments, the spread would widen at least 0.2 to 0.25 percentage points. “The biggest buyer is leaving the market, so there will be less demand for MBS,” said Marty Young, fixed-income analyst at Goldman Sachs. The firm forecasts the central bank will start reducing its holdings in 2018. That’s in line with a majority of bond dealers in the New York Fed’s December survey. The Fed, for its part, has said it will keep reinvesting until its tightening cycle is “well underway,” according to language that has appeared in every policy statement since December 2015. The range for its target rate currently stands at 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent. Mortgage Rates Mortgage rates have started to rise as the Fed moves to increase short-term borrowing costs. Rates for 30-year home loans surged to an almost three-year high of 4.32 percent in December. While rates have edged lower since, they’ve jumped more than three-quarters of a percentage point in just four months. The surge in mortgage rates is already putting a dent in housing demand. Sales of previously owned homes declined more than forecast in December, even as full-year figures were the strongest in a decade, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. People are starting to ask the question, “Gee, did I miss my opportunity here to get a low-rate mortgage?” said Tim Steffen, a financial planner at Robert W. Baird & Co. in Milwaukee. “I tell them that rates are still pretty low. But are rates going to go up? It certainly seems like they are.” Part of it, of course, has to do with the Fed simply raising interest rates as inflation perks up. Officials have long wanted to get benchmark borrowing costs off rock-bottom levels (another legacy of crisis-era policies) and back to levels more consist with a healthy economy. This year, the Fed has penciled in three additional quarter-point rate increases. The move to taper its investments has the potential to cause further tightening. Morgan Stanley estimates that a $325 billion reduction in the Fed’s MBS holdings from April 2018 through end of 2019 may have the same impact as nearly two additional rate increases. Finding other sources of demand won’t be easy either. Because of the Fed’s outsize role in the MBS market since the crisis, the vast majority of transactions are done by just a handful of dealers. What’s more, it’s not clear whether investors like foreign central banks and commercial banks can absorb all the extra supply -- at least without wider spreads. On the plus side, getting MBS back into the hands of private investors could help make the market more robust by increasing trading. Average daily volume has plunged more than 40 percent since the crisis, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association data show. “Ending reinvestment will mean there are more bonds for the private sector to buy,” said Daniel Hyman, the co-head of the agency-mortgage portfolio management team at Pacific Investment Management Co. What’s more, it may give the central bank more flexibility to tighten policy, especially if President Donald Trump’s spending plans stir more economic growth and inflation. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said last month that he’d prefer to use the central bank’s holdings to do some of the lifting, echoing remarks by his Boston colleague Eric Rosengren. Nevertheless, the consequences for the U.S. housing market can’t be ignored.

Posted 06 Feb 2017 20:50 Updated 07 Feb 2017 07:15 Tyson food meat products are shown in this photo illustration in Encinitas, California May 29, 2014. REUTERS/Mike Blake Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Tyson Foods Inc disclosed on Monday it has received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission following allegations it conspired with rivals for years to fix chicken prices. The chicken sector, which is dominated by a handful of large meat companies, has come under increased scrutiny over the past year as customers and farmers have alleged antitrust violations relating to pricing, production and compensation. U.S. poultry buyers claimed in a lawsuit in 2016 that Tyson, the nation's biggest chicken processor, and its competitors had colluded since 2008 to reduce output and manipulate prices. Tyson, Pilgrim's Pride Corp and Sanderson Farms Inc have denied the accusations. Investors in separate lawsuits have alleged the processors made misleading statements or failed to disclose information about price fixing. Tyson Chief Executive Tom Hayes declined to share details about its subpoena on a conference call with reporters after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit. He said the company had not changed pricing practices. Tyson received the subpoena from the SEC on Jan. 20 in connection with an investigation related to the company, according to regulatory documents. The seller of Ball Park hot dogs said it had limited information and was cooperating with the probe, which is in an early stage. Pilgrim's Pride said it had not received a subpoena from the SEC. Sanderson Farms declined to comment. Tyson's stock ended down 3.5 percent at US$63.13. Shares of Pilgrim's Pride, mostly owned by meat packer JBS SA, lost 4 percent to US$18.64. Sanderson Farms shares slid 1.9 percent to US$89.50. Commenting on the subpoena, JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman said "obviously it is not a positive" for Tyson. Joe Agnese, analyst for CFRA Research, said the news will restrict Tyson's valuation until investors' concerns are alleviated. The subpoena arrived as Hayes is finding his footing as Tyson's new CEO after taking over for Donnie Smith on Dec. 31. Tyson has sought to increase profit by selling more value-added items such as pre-seasoned products and heat-and-serve meals, which command higher margins than basic meats. Net income attributable to the company rose to US$1.59 per share in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from US$1.15 a year earlier. Sales were US$9.18 billion, up from US$9.15 billion. Analysts on average expected earnings of US$1.26 and revenue of US$9.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Tyson raised its full-year profit forecast to US$4.90 to US$5.05 per share from US$4.70 to US$4.85.

In a note to clients dated Friday but sent to media on Monday, analysts from the bank discussed various scenarios after a Le Pen victory in April and May. "Euro and oil have decent downside on a Le Pen victory: euro could fall about 10 cents to about $0.98 over a few weeks and oil could decline by 5-10 percent," the note said. "In the remote scenario of a Le Pen Presidency with supportive government and parliament, 10-year Bunds could approach 0 basis points and 10-year France-Germany (yield spread) 200 basis points."

(Delwyn Verasamy, M&G) With its iconic mountain, beaches and vineyards, it’s easy to attract global mining bosses and fund managers to Cape Town. Yet as thousands of executives, shareholders and officials flock to South Africa for the annual Mining Indaba, the industry’s investments are flowing the opposite way. A mix of shrinking reserves, rising labour costs, frequent stoppages and regulatory uncertainty has prompted major mining companies to rethink their presence in South Africa, home to the world’s largest platinum, chrome and manganese reserves and the source of one-third of all gold ever mined. Anglo American, once a keystone of the economy, is selling half its assets in the country, while BHP Billiton and Gold Fields both spun off their local operations in the past four years. AngloGold Ashanti tried to do the same. South Africa, which was the world’s largest gold producer for a century until 2007, has now dropped to sixth place. “They’re difficult mines in a tough operating environment with wage inflation constantly eating away at margins,” said Neil Gregson, who manages about $2.5-billion of natural-resources stocks at JPMorgan Asset Management in London.  “Increasingly, you need specialised management teams to run those assets. We don’t see any growth there.” About 6 000 attendees were expected at the Mining Indaba, which started on Monday. Executives from companies including Anglo American, Rio Tinto, AngloGold Ashanti and South32 are scheduled to speak at the event, Africa’s biggest resource industry conference. As the largest mining companies shift their priorities elsewhere, investors are valuing South Africa-focused stocks more cheaply than global peers. The FTSE/JSE Africa Mining Index trades at 1.3 times book value, compared with 1.9 times for the Bloomberg World Mining Index. The measure for South African stocks has been at a discount to the figure for the global index for the past five years, except for during one month in 2013. Even Sibanye Gold, the locally focused spin-off from Gold Fields, chose to go to the United States for its largest acquisition to date. The company had previously stated its intention to buy in its home country or elsewhere in Africa and took investors by surprise in December with a plan to buy Montana-based Stillwater Mining for $2.2-billion. “They’ve chosen to go overseas for the acquisition rather than something closer to home. It shows you how politically difficult it is to close things in South Africa,” said Michael Rawlinson, co-head of metals and mining investment banking at Barclays, which lends money to Sibanye. Many of the South African mining industry’s problems stem from its turbulent and oppressive past. Mines, particularly gold, were largely built on the basis of cheap labour, minimal safety standards and plentiful electricity, with profits flowing to their white owners to the exclusion of the black majority. Above-inflation wage increases To redress the inequity of apartheid, the government wants mining companies to be 26% owned by black investors, even if those investors later sell their stakes. Companies argue this will lead to continual dilution. The Chamber of Mines said today it restarted talks with the government last month on the issue. Government is committed to “radical economic transformation” to secure black South Africans a bigger stake in the economy, and will publish revised mine ownership requirements next month whether the industry agrees with them or not, Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane said on Monday at the Mining Indaba. “Security over tenure is a concern for us,” JPMorgan’s Gregson said. After more than a century of intensive mining, resources have been depleted, unions have commanded above-inflation wage increases, safety breaches are drawing increased scrutiny from government and power is increasingly expensive. The industry made its first net loss since at least 2009 in the year through June, as commodity prices plunged, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Local gold production declined by almost half to 144.5 metric tons and output of platinum-group metals dropped 11% in the decade to 2015, according to the Chamber of Mines. Labour costs, which make up a third of the industry’s overall expenses, almost tripled to R117-billion a year. Still, mining makes up about half of the country’s export earnings. Safety stoppages The government has also irked companies by imposing what they say are unnecessary safety stoppages that cost production. At up to 4km below ground, South African gold mines are the deepest and among the most dangerous in the world, typically employing thousands of workers mainly using hand-held drills. If international investors and mining companies are deterred by South Africa’s problems, locals may be willing to step in. Patrice Motsepe, the executive chairperson of African Rainbow Minerals who had success buying unwanted gold mines in the late 1990s, said last month he’s once again looking to snap up unloved South African assets. “South Africa has good infrastructure, it’s got great technical skills, it’s got a long history of mining,” Barclays’s Rawlinson said.  “But that long history means the best deposits have already been developed. To compensate for that it needs to be easy. That easiness is gone.” - Bloomberg   AngloGoldminingmineral resourcesMosebenzi Zwane Read More Small-scale mining on the rise Mining companies’ spat with government deepens over revised charter Mining transforms the once sleepy Tubatse Illegal Limpopo chrome mining — digging deep for empty promises Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus OkMalumKoolKat: The case of an escape artist Music | 2017-01-30 00:00:00 Music | 2017-01-30 00:00:00 ANC plans 'constitutional revolution' on land Politics | 2017-02-03 00:00:00 Politics | 2017-02-03 00:00:00 Clubs down, it's time for footgolf Politics | 2017-02-03 13:17:00 Politics | 2017-02-03 13:17:00 LGBTI activists face uphill battle in getting churches to see the light National | 2017-01-24 00:00:00 National | 2017-01-24 00:00:00 Gordhan court bid rattles Guptas News | 2017-01-27 00:00:00 News | 2017-01-27 00:00:00 Most Read Client Media Releases Press OfficesAfroCentric HealthBarloworld LogisticsBoston City CampusCIO Council of South AfricaContinuitySACorporate TravellerDefencewebFaculty Training InstituteFCm Travel SolutionsFedGroup Financial ServicesFutureSenseGIBSHollardImperial LogisticsInternet SolutionsIpsosiStoreITWebJag MethodLime CapitalLottery ResultsKhulumani Support GroupMail and GuardianMandela Bay DevelopmentMiWayMiX TelematicsMessageLOUDMitelMTNNihilent TechnologiesNorth West UniversityOxbridge AcademyPragmaRosebank CollegeSANRALSAS InstituteSAP AfricaSentechSoarsoft InternationalTeraco Data EnvironmentsThe Innovation HubTiger BrandsVaal University of Technology iStore Introducing iStore Makers: the evolution of iPhoneography North West University NWU professor speaks at 4BIGT Ipsos Poll: South Africans disappointed by political leadership PRAGMA Kolosa Madikizela: Pragma's first female MD Vaal University of Technology Not just a career, but a true calling Hollard Hollard gives BI calculator away - free Want to publish your media releases here?

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Almost a decade after it all began, the Federal Reserve is finally talking about unwinding its grand experiment in monetary policy. And when it happens, the knock-on effects in the bond market could pose a threat to the U.S. housing recovery. Just how big is hard to quantify. But over the past month, a number of Fed officials have openly discussed the need for the central bank to reduce its bond holdings, which it amassed as part of its unprecedented quantitative easing during and after the financial crisis. The talk has prompted some on Wall Street to suggest the Fed will start its drawdown as soon as this year, which has refocused attention on its $1.75 trillion stash of mortgage-backed securities. While the Fed also owns Treasuries as part of its $4.45 trillion of assets, its MBS holdings have long been a contentious issue, with some lawmakers criticizing the investments as beyond what’s needed to achieve the central bank’s mandate. Yet because the Fed is now the biggest source of demand for U.S. government-backed mortgage debt and owns a third of the market, any move is likely to boost costs for home buyers. In the past year alone, the Fed bought $387 billion of mortgage bonds just to maintain its holdings. Getting out of the bond-buying business as the economy strengthens could help lift 30-year mortgage rates past 6 percent within three years, according to Moody’s Analytics Inc. Unwinding QE “will be a massive and long-lasting hit” for the mortgage market, said Michael Cloherty, the head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at RBC Capital Markets. He expects the Fed to start paring its investments in the fourth quarter and ultimately dispose of all its MBS holdings. Unprecedented Buying Unlike Treasuries, the Fed rarely owned mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis. Over the years, its purchases have been key in getting the housing market back on its feet. Along with near-zero interest rates, the demand from the Fed reduced the cost mortgage debt relative to Treasuries and encouraged banks to extend more loans to consumers. In a roughly two-year span that ended in 2014, the Fed increased its MBS holdings by about $1 trillion, which it has maintained by reinvesting its maturing debt. Since then, 30-year bonds composed of Fannie Mae-backed mortgages have only been about a percentage point higher than the average yield for five- and 10-year Treasuries, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s less than the spread during housing boom in 2005 and 2006. Talk of the Fed pulling back from the market has bond dealers anticipating that spreads will widen. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees the gap increasing 0.1 percentage point this year, while strategists from JPMorgan Chase & Co. say that once the Fed actually starts to slow its MBS reinvestments, the spread would widen at least 0.2 to 0.25 percentage points. “The biggest buyer is leaving the market, so there will be less demand for MBS,” said Marty Young, fixed-income analyst at Goldman Sachs. The firm forecasts the central bank will start reducing its holdings in 2018. That’s in line with a majority of bond dealers in the New York Fed’s December survey. The Fed, for its part, has said it will keep reinvesting until its tightening cycle is “well underway,” according to language that has appeared in every policy statement since December 2015. The range for its target rate currently stands at 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent. Mortgage Rates Mortgage rates have started to rise as the Fed moves to increase short-term borrowing costs. Rates for 30-year home loans surged to an almost three-year high of 4.32 percent in December. While rates have edged lower since, they’ve jumped more than three-quarters of a percentage point in just four months. The surge in mortgage rates is already putting a dent in housing demand. Sales of previously owned homes declined more than forecast in December, even as full-year figures were the strongest in a decade, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. People are starting to ask the question, “Gee, did I miss my opportunity here to get a low-rate mortgage?” said Tim Steffen, a financial planner at Robert W. Baird & Co. in Milwaukee. “I tell them that rates are still pretty low. But are rates going to go up? It certainly seems like they are.” Part of it, of course, has to do with the Fed simply raising interest rates as inflation perks up. Officials have long wanted to get benchmark borrowing costs off rock-bottom levels (another legacy of crisis-era policies) and back to levels more consist with a healthy economy. This year, the Fed has penciled in three additional quarter-point rate increases. The move to taper its investments has the potential to cause further tightening. Morgan Stanley estimates that a $325 billion reduction in the Fed’s MBS holdings from April 2018 through end of 2019 may have the same impact as nearly two additional rate increases. Finding other sources of demand won’t be easy either. Because of the Fed’s outsize role in the MBS market since the crisis, the vast majority of transactions are done by just a handful of dealers. What’s more, it’s not clear whether investors like foreign central banks and commercial banks can absorb all the extra supply -- at least without wider spreads. On the plus side, getting MBS back into the hands of private investors could help make the market more robust by increasing trading. Average daily volume has plunged more than 40 percent since the crisis, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association data show. “Ending reinvestment will mean there are more bonds for the private sector to buy,” said Daniel Hyman, the co-head of the agency-mortgage portfolio management team at Pacific Investment Management Co. What’s more, it may give the central bank more flexibility to tighten policy, especially if President Donald Trump’s spending plans stir more economic growth and inflation. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said last month that he’d prefer to use the central bank’s holdings to do some of the lifting, echoing remarks by his Boston colleague Eric Rosengren. Nevertheless, the consequences for the U.S. housing market can’t be ignored. The “Fed has already hiked twice and the market is expecting” more, said Munish Gupta, a manager at Nara Capital, a new hedge fund being started by star mortgage trader Charles Smart. “Tapering is the next logical step.” © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

Morgan Healthcare Investment Banking Veteran to Join Glaukos in May, Replacing the Company’s Retiring CFO, Richard Harrison SAN CLEMENTE, Calif., Feb 06, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Glaukos Corporation GKOS, -1.09% an ophthalmic medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of breakthrough products and procedures designed to transform the treatment of glaucoma, today announced that Joseph E. Gilliam will join the company as Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Corporate Development in May 2017. Mr. Gilliam will replace the company’s current Chief Financial Officer Richard Harrison, who is retiring later in 2017. Mr. Gilliam joins Glaukos from J.P. Morgan, where he was Managing Director in the Healthcare Investment Banking Group and focused on the life sciences industry, including the medical technology, diagnostics and biotechnology sectors. Since 2000, Mr. Gilliam has held various positions of increasing responsibility at J.P. Morgan, Chase Manhattan and The Beacon Group, prior to these firms being combined in 2001. Mr. Gilliam began his career in the audit services division of PricewaterhouseCoopers in 1998. He holds a bachelor’s degree in accounting from the Kelly School of Business at Indiana University, Bloomington. Over the course of his nearly 20-year career, Mr. Gilliam has gained broad experience across capital markets, strategic advisory and other banking services. He also has significant experience in ophthalmology, having executed numerous medical device and biotechnology transactions, including leading the Glaukos initial public offering (IPO) for J.P. Morgan in June 2015. “Joe brings an extensive range of healthcare experience, financial acumen and market perspective to our organization and we believe his contributions will be invaluable to Glaukos as we continue to expand our business and implement our growth strategies,” said Thomas Burns, Glaukos President and Chief Executive Officer. “In addition, we are extremely grateful to Rich for his many contributions and years of dedicated leadership at Glaukos, as well as his willingness to postpone retirement for several more months to assist in a smooth and orderly transition of his responsibilities.” Mr. Harrison, who has been the company’s Chief Financial Officer since January 2008, will remain with Glaukos in a transitional advisory role to Mr. Gilliam. Mr. Harrison notified the company in July 2016 of his plan to retire in 2017 in order to dedicate more time to family and personal interests. “Joining Glaukos represents an extraordinary opportunity for me to be part of a dynamic and pioneering company that is deploying truly disruptive technologies that benefit practitioners, patients and the healthcare system,” said Mr. Gilliam. “Moreover, having worked closely with Glaukos in recent years, I have gained tremendous respect for the organization and am honored to join such a talented, committed and cohesive senior leadership team.” About Glaukos Glaukos (www.glaukos.com) is an ophthalmic medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of breakthrough products and procedures designed to transform the treatment of glaucoma, one of the world’s leading causes of blindness. The company pioneered Micro-Invasive Glaucoma Surgery, or MIGS, to revolutionize the traditional glaucoma treatment and management paradigm. Glaukos launched the iStent [®] , its first MIGS device, in the United States in July 2012 and is leveraging its platform technology to build a comprehensive and proprietary portfolio of micro-scale injectable therapies designed to address the complete range of glaucoma disease states and progression. The company believes the iStent, measuring 1.0 mm long and 0.33 mm wide, is the smallest medical device ever approved by the FDA.

Global economic activity hit the strongest rate in 22 months in Jan led by higher production, new orders and business sentiment, JPMorgan/Markit PMIs showed. • Although the data does not include a number of Asian nations’ numbers including ones for China. • Services sector growth climbed to a 17-month high more than compensating for a slight decline in manufacturing expansion pace. • “The global economy looks well set to  build on this solid start during the remainder of the quarter,” the report read. • Input price increases were recorded at both manufacturers and services providers with output charges climbing for the 11th consecutive month. Dow Jones Industrials  +0.94% at 20,071  Nikkei 225   +0.31% at 18,977  HK Hang Seng   +0.91% at 23,339  Shanghai Composite    +0.54% at 3,157  FTSE 350 Mining   -3.22% at 16,293 AIM Basic Resources   -0.14% at 2,560  Economic News US – Headline employment numbers beat estimates; although, earnings growth underperformed. • Given a slower than expected wage growth despite a strong growth in jobs created suggests there is more slack in the labour market and supports the Fed case for a gradual monetary tightening. • The US$ index dropped and gold prices jumped post the release of payroll numbers. • “Three rate increases, like I said, it’s a reasonable guess, a reasonable perspective to have as a base case… But honestly, I think there’s a lot of potential that this economy is going to perhaps get more of a boost than the base case,” San Francisco President John Williams said in Friday interview to Bloomberg News. China – Following weaker manufacturing PMI data released on Friday, services sector numbers also showed slowing growth momentum in Jan. • Although the Dec services PMI did mark a 45-month high. • “New business (in the services segment) continued to grow rapidly, though at a marginally slower rate than in the previous month; while input and output charges increased at faster rates,” Markit said. • “The economy is unlikely to maintain the pace of expansion seen in the fourth quarter of last year… China’s economic growth may decelerate after the first quarter of this year.” • Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI (released on Friday): 51.0 v 51.9 in Nov and 51.8 forecast. • Caixin/Markit Services PMI: 53.1 v 53.4 in Nov. • Caixin/Markit Composite PMI: 52.2 v 53.5 in Nov.

Savannah Resources (LON:SAV) 6.1p, Mkt Cap £28m – Metallurgical assays on the Oman copper project • The Company completed preliminary metallurgical tests on the Mahab 4 copper deposit located in Oman and estimated to host 1.51mt at 2.1% Cu in JORC compliant Inferred Resources. • Study looked at a standard copper floatation circuit with results based on Mahab 4 master composite containing 4.38% Cu. • Sulphide mineralisation is predominantly pyrite, chalcopyrite (the sole copper bearing mineral) with minor amounts of sphalerite (a zinc containing sulphide mineral). • The liberation size of chalcopyrite was estimated at 50 microns with a reground concentrate to 38 microns yielding over 90% recoveries and suggesting a potential for a >23% Cu saleable concentrate production with gold and silver by-products. • The presence of sphalerite will require zinc depression during floatation to keep zinc grade in the concentrate below 3% Zn. • Further work regarding a potential to recover zinc without affecting copper grades and recoveries is required. • Rock hardness tests showed the processed ore to be relatively soft. • Additional test work is currently being carried with a view to optimise the process flowsheet and improve recoveries and copper concentrate grades. Strategic Minerals* (LON:SML) 0.6p, Mkt Cap £7m – Interest in Cornwal Resources increased to 50% • The Company completed the subscription to 248,864 shares of Cornwall Resources (CRL) for £844k (£3.39/share). • This brings total number of shares owned by the SML in the JV with New Age Exploration to 309,838 shares or 50%. • Additional funds will see Cornwall Resources commencing a two-stage drilling programme aimed at expanding the current resource at the Redmoor tin/tungsten project. • “We look forward to updating the market on the drilling programme in the first quarter of 2017,” the Company said. *SP Angel act as Nomad and joint broker to Strategic Minerals alongside Optiva Securities SP Angel Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version DISCLAIMER This note has been issued by SP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (“SP Angel”) in order to promote its investment services.

Keep me logged in I forgot my password No Thanks Briefing highlights The ‘sheer cussedness’ of the loonie Council urges higher retirement age What to watch for this week How Super Bowl ads scored Toyota raises profit outlook Loonie's resilience Analysts are somewhat amazed by the “sheer cussedness” of a Canadian dollar now worth more than 76 cents (U.S.). Some don’t understand why the loonie isn’t sinking as they’d expected, and wonder if markets are “complacent” given the threat to Canadian trade from the young Trump administration. “The resilience of CAD continues to confound our expectations,” said Paul Meggyesi of JPMorgan Chase, citing the “sheer cussedness” of the currency, which he referred to by its symbol. But for a dip a couple of weeks ago, when Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz knocked it down by saying an interest rate cut was still a possibility, the loonie has fared much better than other currencies. THE GLOBE AND MAIL » SOURCE: QUANDL “Indeed, the Canadian dollar is the second-best performing major currency since the U.S. election … seemingly at odds with the rising downside risk to Canada’s economy stemming from a more protectionist stance by the Trump administration,” said Toronto-Dominion Bank senior economist Leslie Preston. “The loonie has had a helping hand from firmer oil prices, but markets may be somewhat complacent about the potential impact from any thickening of the U.S. border.” Looked at another way, the Canadian dollar has now “bounced back more aggressively than any other currency as a proportion of its initial post-election selloff,” JPMorgan’s Mr. Meggyesi said in a report. “CAD is now fairly valued on a short-run model basis, which in our view will be difficult to sustain, both in view of the potential collateral economic damage Canada will sustain from the now inevitable renegotiation of NAFTA and also because of the BoC’s easing bias, which is not adequately reflected in rate market pricing (and that easing bias is a direct consequence of the currency which BoC believes is inappropriately strong).” What he means by that is that markets are underestimating the possibility of Mr. Poloz and his central bank colleagues cutting their already low benchmark rate to offset the impact of the loonie’s recent strength. The central bank has bemoaned the fact that the loonie had been dragged higher along with the U.S. dollar against other currencies after the election, though the greenback has lost some ground of late. Remember, Mr. Poloz is counting on a lower currency to help boost Canadian exports. “The loonie touched its best level since early September [last] week, despite Governor Poloz’s best efforts to talk the currency down,” noted BMO Nesbitt Burns senior economist Benjamin Reitzes. At this point, though, we’re not likely to see any real action from Mr. Poloz, other than “jawboning,” unless the loonie were to head back toward the 80-cent mark, which “might be a bit more jarring for the bank and could warrant a meaningful forecast downgrade,” Mr. Reitzes said. “That would open the door a little wider to possible easing, though it’s clear Poloz doesn’t want to cut rates again at the moment,” he added. “Bottom Line: The resilient loonie is causing trouble for the BoC. While we continue to look for the Canadian dollar to soften through 2017, that dynamic may take a bit longer to evolve than anticipated.” More on this topic David Parkinson: Why Poloz needs to shout louder to talk down loonie Scott Barlow: Loonie caught in 'Trump trade' dilemma Fears mount that world on cusp of trade-currency war But what if the loonie doesn't tumble?

Creating chaos Everything you (and Trump) should know about U.S. trade threats Rachelle Younglai: 'Border tax' threatens exports Council urges higher retirement age The federal council on economic growth says Canadians should be encouraged to delay retirement by raising the eligibility age for Old Age Security and the Canada Pension Plan as a way of boosting labour force participation. The proposal is just one of many significant policy changes that the panel recommends as a way of boosting economic growth and preparing Canada for an era of dramatic change in the way Canadians work, The Globe and Mail’s Bill Curry and Sean Silcoff report. While some of the ideas, such as as raising the eligibility age for OAS and CPP, run counter to the current position of the federal Liberals, many of the other proposals are in line with the government’s goals or are likely to find a home in some form in the upcoming federal budget. More on this topic Bill Curry, Sean Silcoff: Council urges higher retirement age What to watch for this week It’s going to be a busy-ish few days that include a look at the latest trade numbers, which will be interesting given the Trump administration’s focus on trade and currencies. Analysts are divided over what to expect from Statistics Canada’s Tuesday report on the merchandise trade balance in December. There are some suggestions Canada could plunge back into a trade deficit, though many observers expect to see a surplus of about $300-million, shy of November’s $500-million. BMO’s Mr. Reitzes, however, expects the surplus to swell to $1-billion, which would be the best showing since mid-2014. “The Canadian dollar was slightly firmer in the month, but not enough to meaningfully impact trade,” Mr. Reitzes said. “We’ll be watching export volumes closely as usual, to see if exporters can build on the 3.9-per-cent surge recorded in November,” he added. Tuesday also brings the U.S. trade report, and it will be interesting to see what Mr. Trump has to say about another deficit that economists expect will come in at about $45-billion (U.S.) for December. Friday morning brings everyone’s favourite punching bag, Statistics Canada’s monthly jobs report, this one for January. It’s a favourite target because the numbers bounce around so much, and economists oft question the results. Regardless, economists expect to see that Canada lost about 10,000 jobs in January, with an unemployment rate at 6.9 per cent. It’s also a big week for corporate earnings.
