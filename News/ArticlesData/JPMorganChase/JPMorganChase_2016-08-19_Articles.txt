By Kedar Grandhi August 20, 2016 11:43 BST JPMorgan as part of the settlment would receive $645mReuters JPMorgan Chase & Co has settled a legal dispute with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) and Deutsche Bank. The American bank revealed the same on Friday (19 August) and said it would receive $645m (£493m) in settlement of litigation. The lawsuit was relating to JPMorgan's purchase of Washington Mutual's (WaMu) banking operations during the 2008 financial crisis. WaMu had been America's largest savings and loan bank before FDIC seized it. The independent agency then sold WaMu's banking operations to JPMorgan for about $1.9bn (£1.45bn), before the parent holding company of WaMu filed for bankruptcy protection. The three companies have since been fighting over who would take responsibility for the alleged defects in WaMu's mortgage underwriting at the time of the crisis. JPMorgan sued the FDIC in 2013. It claimed the agency to be responsible for more than $1bn in liabilities. The bank argued that the FDIC had agreed to protect it from all liabilities that would arise from WaMu. On the other hand Deutsche Bank too had filed against the FDIC and JPMorgan over losses arising from WaMu's defected mortgage underwriting. Trustee Deutsche Bank oversees 99 trusts that hold residential mortgage securities backed by WaMu's home loans. JPMorgan would receive the $645m settlement from the estate of Washington Mutual Bank, which was placed into receivership with the FDIC in 2008. In exchange the New York City based bank said it would drop $1bn worth of claims. Deutsche Bank will also have a claim against the estate, JPMorgan added, according to Reuters. According to Bloomberg, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has said he would have bargained for a much lower price for WaMu, had he known there would be unexpected legal costs involved. The settlement resolves claims worth billions of dollars between the three parties. The settlement is however now subject to court approval. If it gets the approval, the settlement will mark the end of four WaMu-related lawsuits involving the bank and the FDIC in the Washington, DC federal court.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel JPMorgan Chase & Co said it will receive USD 645 million in a settlement of litigation with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Deutsche Bank AG arising from its purchase of Washington Mutual Inc's banking operations during the financial crisis in 2008. According to a regulatory filing, JPMorgan will collect the cash payment from the estate of Washington Mutual Bank, for which the FDIC acts as receiver. In exchange, JP Morgan, the largest US bank by assets said it will drop its more than USD 1 billion in claims related to the Washington Mutual (WaMu) purchase. JPMorgan also said Deutsche Bank, the trustee overseeing 99 trusts holding residential mortgage securities backed by soured WaMu home loans, will have a claim against the estate. JPMorgan had filed lawsuits seeking to force the FDIC to indemnify it on claims relating to the WaMu purchase, in which it also assumed some of the thrift's liabilities. Deutsche Bank had filed a USD 10 billion lawsuit against the FDIC and JPMorgan over losses stemming from alleged defects in WaMu's mortgage underwriting. JPMorgan said the settlement requires court approval, and would end four WaMu-related lawsuits involving the bank and the FDIC, and pending in the federal court in Washington, D.C. The bank and the FDIC have long fought over who is liable to investors for claims arising from Seattle-based WaMu's collapse. WaMu had been nation's largest savings and loan before the FDIC seized it on Sept. 25, 2008 and sold its banking operations to New York-based JPMorgan for about USD 1.9 billion. The parent holding company of WaMu filed for bankruptcy protection. Tags  JPMorgan Chase & Co Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Deutsche Bank AG Washington Mutual Deutsche Bank Buy, Hold, Sell ?

Dollar bond sales in Asia excluding Japan reached $23.9 billion since June 30, 48 percent up from the $16.2 billion in the same period of 2015, according to Bloomberg data. That’s a record for the period. The extra yield over Treasuries that investors demand to hold U.S. currency notes from the region’s issuers slid 21 basis points this month to 204 on Aug. 16, the lowest since 2007, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.

You will now receive the Technology newsletter “We expect the momentum to stay strong for the rest of the year driven by the robust investor demand for higher-yielding assets in today’s low rate environment,” said Mark Follett, Hong Kong-based head of Debt Capital Markets for Asia excluding Japan at JPMorgan, which ranks sixth in managing Asia ex-Japan dollar bond sales in 2016. “Relative to many parts of the world, Asian credit in general offers better stability and return for an equivalent rating profile, and this will further support the strength of the demand.” Global investors are flooding into Asian corporate bonds after sovereign yields from Japan to Germany dropped below zero. The 3.7 percent yuan depreciation for the past year is also luring Chinese funds into the Asian dollar bond market. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimated foreign-exchange outflows out of China climbed to $55 billion in July, from $49 billion in June. Rising Demand Odds of an increase in U.S. borrowing costs by year-end stand at 47 percent, down from 51 percent on Tuesday, according to futures trading data compiled by Bloomberg. “We don’t anticipate any expectations on the Fed’s next move will have a major impact on financing costs in the near term,” said Follett. “Demand for credit will have a greater impact on pricing than underlying rates.” Chinese investors’ demand for Asian dollar bonds has been on the rise in the past six to 12 months, Ben Yuen, fixed income chief investment officer at BOCHK Asset Management, said at a press briefing this month. Firms from China sold $13.7 billion of dollar bonds in the offshore market this quarter, up from $11.2 billion in the same period of 2015, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The previous three quarters’ sales all declined from the year-earlier periods. “Chinese companies’ offshore dollar bond sales in the second half may exceed that in the first half of this year, especially high-yield property developers,” said Xie Tong, China head of debt capital markets at JPMorgan, in a phone interview from Beijing. “The low borrowing costs would encourage other high-yield issuers, who are still watching, to sell bonds offshore.” — With assistance by Lianting Tu, and Judy Chen Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Christian Identity in the Workplace by Elliot Milco 8 . 19 . 16 On Monday, Yahoo Finance published an article examining the role of religious practice in the modern workplace. The article begins by considering a case of apparent anti-religious discrimination at the Manhattan office of JPMorgan Chase. Beginning in the early 2000s, a number of JPMorgan employees organized a Christian prayer group and bible study that met in company spaces. The group was fairly successful and well-attended for several years, but was ordered to cease meeting on company property in 2014, because corporate resources “can only be used for business purposes.” What counts as “business purposes” becomes somewhat confusing when we look at the measures currently being taken by JPMorgan to promote corporate diversity. The bank makes company resources available to hundreds of “employee networking chapters” devoted to connecting and supporting members of various identity groups (LGBT, disabled, Latino, black, etc.). Not having been to meetings of these groups myself, I suppose it’s possible that they exist solely for “business purposes,” but I doubt it. In all probability, “business purposes” are merely the excuse for a more natural and robust goal: building communities among people who share common viewpoints and experiences. Christians may look at this list of diversity organizations and feel aggrieved at the double standard. What distinguishes a Christian group from any of these others? Why would JPMorgan go out of its way to bus Muslim employees in the UK to prayers during the day, but ban a Christian prayer group from its offices? Surely those of Christian identity deserve just as much support as those who identify as LGBT, disabled, Asian, black, etc. Part of the answer lies in the way “identity” functions as a moral and political category. Identities occupy a paradoxical middle ground in contemporary popular anthropology. On the one hand, identities are accepted as brute facts of individual personalities—personal characteristics that are either unchosen, or chosen in a way that does not allow others to question the choice. If someone has a particular identity, that is simply “who they are”—end of story. On the other hand, identities are clearly a kind of social fiction. They are constructed around widespread patterns of appropriation and designation, and they do not generally admit of definition or demarcation based on objective attributes. No one bothers to ask what constitutes “being black” or “being Asian,” much less “being LGBT.” A person simply self-identifies, appropriates the label, and is identified socially as such—this is enough. Any attempt to pin down which characteristics entitle a person to these identities will quickly reach a dead end. This is not to say that real characteristics don’t play into the appropriation of an identity (they clearly do), or that identities are simply chosen by those who appropriate them (for the most part they aren’t), or that having a particular identity doesn’t have a real impact on the circumstances or shape of one’s life. What is distinctively constructed about identities is their differentiation from any ordinary social, cultural, or physical type—the elevation of a set of characteristics or labels into a personality-defining absolute. Christianity is not generally seen as an identity—being Christian is never seen as a fundamental feature of one’s personality, a given that cannot be questioned. Although one can be born into Christianity and raised Christian, we live in a society so saturated with lapsed Christians that no one has any illusions about Christianity being inextricable from the practice of one’s individual selfhood. Diversity officers treat Christianity differently from Islam for precisely this reason: Islam, like Christianity, is a religion. But Islam is recognized as an identity and given accommodations because, in the West, being Muslim generally goes along with being part of an ethnic minority. Ethnic status is at least partly unchosen, and is identify-defining—therefore Islam, as an expression of ethnic identity, deserves protection and cannot be questioned. Being Christian, on the other hand, is never seen as unchosen, and it does not place one in an ethnic minority. Christians are perceived as being over-represented and over-privileged, and Christianity is thought of as little more than an irrational, tasteless (and potentially pernicious) moral ideology. Christians deserve no support because they need no support—we are culturally and ethnically at home. Islam deserves special treatment because it is (in the eyes of the relevant persons) foreign. As much as we might be inclined to fight to get Christianity a seat at the table in the identity regime, this would be a mistake. They are right—Christianity is not an identity. In fact, it deviates on almost every point from the common characteristics of modern identity groups. It is not hereditary. It is not an ethnicity. It can be questioned, and expects to be questioned. It can be dispensed with at any time, for any reason, until one’s dying breath. It is not a feature of Christians’ innate lifestyle tendencies (quite the contrary). It is of a different sort altogether from being a Muslim of Pakistani descent, say, or being a disabled gay veteran. Our society has a different category for Christianity: “religion.” It used to be that “religion” denoted one’s concrete obligations to the divine, or (more narrowly) adherence to vows made before God about one’s way of life. Several centuries of Enlightenment secularism and American political ideals have given the term a different sense. Today, like identity, “religion” and its instances are more or less indefinable, though religions are commonly seen as sharing a few basic features—among them, subjectivity, irrationality, and privacy. If we look back to the early Church, we rarely find people speaking about “religion,” and never about “identity.” Christianity was not a personality attribute for them or a privately held superstition—for the greatest of the Church Fathers, it was nothing other than the perfection and fulfillment of the way of life imagined by Plato and the philosophers. To be a Christian was to be a philosopher, since we share with the philosophers a common goal: to see the face of God. Justin Martyr recognized this, as did Augustine, the Cappadocians, and long list of others. Lately I have been revisiting Plato, and it strikes me that the basic problem of Christianity in the secular workplace is not the selective distribution of “identity” status or the uneven application of liberal principles. Our problem is that we live in a society as hostile to the aims of the philosophical life—a life in pursuit of moral integrity, the truth, and union with God—as was Athens in the time of Socrates. Our fellow citizens do not understand our preference for spiritual goods over material prosperity. They despise us because we disapprove of pleasures everyone else accepts. Chiefly, though, I think they are impatient with our impractical fixation on intangible truths. In Plato’s Gorgias, Callicles gives voice to what I take to be the basic attitude toward Christianity in the modern workplace: My own reaction to grown men who practice philosophy is very much like that to men who lisp and play like children. When I see philosophy in a young lad I approve of it; I think it appropriate and consider such a person well-bred. … But when I see an older man still engaging in philosophy and not giving it up, I think such a man by this time needs a flogging. Such a person, however intelligent he may be, is bound to become unmanly by fleeing the centers of his city and its marketplaces, in which (as the poet said), “men get themselves fame and glory”—instead, he will surely spend the rest of his days muttering in some corner with three or four boys, and never uttering anything well-bred, important, or apt. … Listen to me, my good man, and stop your arguing. Practice the sweet music of an active life, and do it where you’ll get a reputation for intelligence. Elliot Milco is deputy editor of First Things.

Reuters/Neil Hall By A. Ananthalakshmi, Bernardo Vizcaino and Carolyn Cohn KUALA LUMPUR/SYDNEY/LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank JPMorgan will include Islamic bonds, or sukuk, in its emerging markets indices for the first time from later this year, widening the appeal of Islamic instruments among global debt investors. JPMorgan, which runs the most widely used benchmarks of emerging market debt, will include eight sukuk across its index family starting Oct. 31. The decision was taken after JPMorgan conducted an annual governance review it said in a research report to clients, and seen by Reuters. Dollar-denominated sukuk from Turkey, Malaysia and Indonesia will be included in JPMorgan's flagship EMBI Global Diversified index, against which an estimated $313 billion in assets is benchmarked. Advertisement The move could help sukuk break away from their traditional buy-and-hold investor base. "Despite having a market size of $200 billion, so far sukuk was seen as an exotic asset class mainly targeted at Islamic banks," said Okan Akin, emerging market credit analyst at AllianceBernstein in London. The decision by JPMorgan would increase the liquidity of sukuk instruments, the lack of which has been the main negative feature of the market, Akin said. Including sukuk into such benchmarks would attract higher bids and may support prices at higher levels, said Anita Yadav, head of fixed income research at Emirates NBD in Dubai. "Non-traditional investors that generally hesitate to invest in sukuk may also be forced to buy should they be using JPMorgan as their performance benchmark," Yadav said. Sukuk, which follow religious principles such as bans on interest and gambling, have their core centres in the Gulf region and Southeast Asia although the funding format has made inroads in Western markets in recent years. TEST FOR REGULATORY REGIME While the inclusion of sukuk will benefit the sector in the short term, the omissions of some names could also encourage regulators to address persistent weaknesses in the sector. To be eligible sukuk must be rated, have their liquidity assessed prior to inclusion in the JPMorgan indices and meet other criteria similar to conventional bonds. At the outset, however, not all issuers might meet such requirements. Only two corporate sukuk will be included in the JPMorgan Corporate Emerging Markets Bond Index: a 2023 sukuk from Dubai's DP World and a 2024 sukuk from the Gulf region's largest utility Saudi Electricity Co . Pakistan's $1 billion sukuk maturing in 2019 will be included in the JPMorgan Asia Credit Index alongside sukuk from Indonesia and Malaysia, but the likes of Qatar and Bahrain are currently absent. Malaysia was the only country to have its local currency sukuk included in JPMorgan's Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets, which comprises higher yielding local debt. Two sukuk from Malaysia maturing in 2023 and 2026 will be included in the GBI-EM index, which is tracked by an estimated $207 billion in assets under management. "We believe this move could boost foreign interest on a gradual basis," said Mohamad Safri Shahul Hamid, deputy chief executive officer of Malaysia's CIMB Islamic Bank. "Active investors will move into markets when they spot opportunities and this would be one of them."

Business Home LBoard Family cremates wrong body after hospital mix-up FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US JPMorgan adds sukuk to emerging markets indices Reuters | August 19, 2016 Dollar-denominated sukuk from Turkey, Malaysia and Indonesia will be included in JPMorgan's flagship EMBI Global Diversified index, against which an estimated $313 billion in assets is benchmarked. NEW YORK: US investment bank JPMorgan will include Islamic bonds, or sukuk, in its emerging markets indices for the first time from later this year, widening the appeal of Islamic instruments among global debt investors. JPMorgan, which runs the most widely used benchmarks of emerging market debt, will include eight sukuk across its index family starting Oct. 31. The decision was taken after JPMorgan conducted an annual governance review it said in a research report to clients, and seen by Reuters. Dollar-denominated sukuk from Turkey, Malaysia and Indonesia will be included in JPMorgan’s flagship EMBI Global Diversified index, against which an estimated $313 billion in assets is benchmarked. The move could help sukuk break away from their traditional buy-and-hold investor base. “Despite having a market size of $200 billion, so far sukuk was seen as an exotic asset class mainly targeted at Islamic banks,” said Okan Akin, emerging market credit analyst at AllianceBernstein in London. The decision by JPMorgan would increase the liquidity of sukuk instruments, the lack of which has been the main negative feature of the market, Akin said. Including sukuk into such benchmarks would attract higher bids and may support prices at higher levels, said Anita Yadav, head of fixed income research at Emirates NBD in Dubai. “Non-traditional investors that generally hesitate to invest in sukuk may also be forced to buy should they be using JPMorgan as their performance benchmark,” Yadav said. Sukuk, which follow religious principles such as bans on interest and gambling, have their core centres in the Gulf region and Southeast Asia although the funding format has made inroads in Western markets in recent years. Test for regulatory regime While the inclusion of sukuk will benefit the sector in the short term, the omissions of some names could also encourage regulators to address persistent weaknesses in the sector. To be eligible sukuk must be rated, have their liquidity assessed prior to inclusion in the JPMorgan indices and meet other criteria similar to conventional bonds. At the outset, however, not all issuers might meet such requirements. Only two corporate sukuk will be included in the JPMorgan Corporate Emerging Markets Bond Index: a 2023 sukuk from Dubai’s DP World and a 2024 sukuk from the Gulf region’s largest utility Saudi Electricity Co. Pakistan’s $1 billion sukuk maturing in 2019 will be included in the JPMorgan Asia Credit Index alongside sukuk from Indonesia and Malaysia, but the likes of Qatar and Bahrain are currently absent. Malaysia was the only country to have its local currency sukuk included in JPMorgan’s Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets, which comprises higher yielding local debt. Two sukuk from Malaysia maturing in 2023 and 2026 will be included in the GBI-EM index, which is tracked by an estimated $207 billion in assets under management. “We believe this move could boost foreign interest on a gradual basis,” said Mohamad Safri Shahul Hamid, deputy chief executive officer of Malaysia’s CIMB Islamic Bank. “Active investors will move into markets when they spot opportunities and this would be one of them.” Foreign holdings in the two Malaysian sukuk would be expected to increase over the next three to six months due to inclusion in the index, said Winson Phoon, fixed income analyst at Maybank Investment Bank.

Six years later, UPB needs more cash to survive, but it's looking closer to home for help. The South Side bank, at $602 million in assets less than a third the size of predecessor ShoreBank at its peak, has launched a campaign to raise at least $15 million in fresh equity. UPB Chairman David Vitale, better known to Chicagoans as Mayor Rahm Emanuel's former chairman of the Chicago Board of Education, is meeting with CEOs of locally headquartered banks like Northern Trust, PrivateBancorp, Wintrust Financial and MB Financial to help bail out the bank. UPB is operating under an Aug. 5 consent order with state and federal bank regulators that requires it to raise capital and pursue a new business plan. UPB has not earned a profit since its inception. For Vitale, who spent most of his career as an executive at First Chicago and Bank One, the challenge will be to convince local banking chiefs that UPB won't just be back to them in a few years, hat in hand, after burning through their capital. Photo by Urban Partnership Bank David Vitale After all, UPB has blown through more than $100 million of the Wall Street cash it got in 2010. “I feel pretty good,” Vitale says, adding with wryness, “Last time it was $150 (million); this time it's $15.” “The general response has been, 'We should find a way to support you,' “ he says. “Nobody has said, 'Don't send me the (investment) package.' “ The other big challenge is that, unlike ShoreBank's former leaders—who attempted to transfer what had been a successful lending model on Chicago's South Side to other parts of the country and the world—UPB's ambitions are small-scale. It's focusing on making $40 million to $50 million in small commercial real estate and business loans each year on the South and West sides of Chicago and in Detroit. “It isn't the same,” says William Michael Cunningham, social investing adviser at Creative Investment Research, a Washington, D.C.-based firm focused on minority banking. “They don't have that same record of innovation ShoreBank had.” UPB's branch network also is substantially smaller than ShoreBank's was, and it won't lend to consumers. The business plan “will be more focused on what we've proven we can do, which is commercial origination,” Vitale says. The main appeal to local bankers, who otherwise might be underwhelmed, is that an investment in UPB will give their banks credit with federal regulators for helping underserved neighborhoods as they're required to do under the Community Reinvestment Act. Their effective choice: Build their own branches in parts of the city they might prefer to avoid or help prop up UPB, which already is serving many of those areas. One banker Vitale has contacted, who asked not to be identified, says CRA credit is attractive, but the fear is that, once a bank is an investor, it will be pressured to contribute again if UPB gets in trouble. Vitale's response to those concerns has been to emphasize that the ShoreBank woes are in the past. UPB now has an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to end its arrangement to share losses on the old ShoreBank loans. Earlier this year, UPB sold off virtually all the old ShoreBank mortgages on its books. But he acknowledges UPB didn't properly assess what digging out of ShoreBank's hole would cost. UPB projected that about $50 million of the $150 million it raised from Goldman Sachs et al. would cover the ShoreBank losses. The actual figure was double that. The cost of managing the nearly $1 billion portfolio was far more than UPB anticipated, Vitale says. Loan losses were worse than expected as well. “Home values (in UPB's neighborhoods) continued to go down for three to four years,” he says. “We didn't see it bottom until 2014.” Quietly, Vitale says, UPB has had a big impact on the South and West sides. “For the last four years, we've put $300 million of capital into these neighborhoods.” In addition to the locally headquartered banks, on Vitale's speed dial are super-regional banks with big Chicago presences like Cincinnati-based Fifth Third, Minneapolis' U.S. Bank and PNC Financial in Pittsburgh. BMO Harris Bank, a unit of Toronto-based BMO Financial Group, and local insurance titans State Farm and Allstate are targets as well. PNC, BMO Harris, U.S. Bank, Northern Trust and State Farm all contributed to the 2010 launch of UPB. BMO Harris Bank Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. J. P. Morgan Chase & Co. RL ShoreBank Corp.

The agency affirmed the country’s rating at “BBB-,” a notch above junk grade. The rating is in line with Moody’s Investors Service, which has placed it on review for a possible downgrade while it assesses the impact of the military takeover attempt. S&P Global Ratings lowered Turkey one level to “BB,” two steps below investment grade, on July 20. UTILITIES State Grid ‘disappointed’ China’s State Grid Corp (國家電網) — the world’s biggest utility — on Friday said it “deeply regrets” Australia’s decision to stop the company from buying a majority stake in the state-owned power network Ausgrid. The company said it agreed to participate in the bidding after an invitation from the New South Wales government in November last year and has “absolutely” followed the guidance and conditions set by the seller through to submission of the final paperwork. “We find it hard to understand and are very disappointed” that bidders were rejected on the pretext of national security at a very late stage, the state-owned company said in a statement. BANKING JPMorgan wins lawsuit JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest US bank, is to be paid US$645 million from a receivership estate to end a dispute over who was responsible for toxic securities created by a failed bank acquired during the financial crisis. The agreement with Deutsche Bank AG and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp was signed on Friday, New York-based JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing. It resolves claims among the three parties over more than US$6 billion in securities backed by flawed Washington Mutual Inc mortgages. The agreement is subject to judicial approval. COSMETICS Estee Lauder outlook glum Estee Lauder Cos provided a full-year profit forecast that trailed analysts’ estimates, citing economic turbulence and a stronger dollar that are hurting its sales overseas. Profit would be US$3.38 to US$3.44 per share, excluding some items, in the year through June, the New York-based company said on Friday. While Estee Lauder’s outlook was glum, its profit for the latest quarter topped analysts’ expectations. Earnings were US$0.43 per share, excluding some items, beating the US$0.40 average estimate. Revenue was US$2.65 billion, just missing the US$2.66 billion average projection, hurt by a 0.7 percent drop in skincare sales. BANKING RBS clients to pay interest Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS), Britain’s largest taxpayer-owned lender, said some of its biggest trading clients must pay interest on collateral as a consequence of low central-bank interest rates. Some of the bank’s institutional clients would need to pay interest on funds pledged as collateral when trading futures contracts, the bank said on Friday. The changes for pound and euro futures and options trading would probably affect about 60 large clients, a person with knowledge of the matter said earlier on Friday.

JPMorgan ends WaMu disputes with FDIC, to receive $645 million Reuters 8/19/2016 By Jonathan Stempel © REUTERS/Mike Segar A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. Corporate headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York Quotes in the article JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▲ 78.87 +0.34 +0.43% JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) on Friday said it will receive $645 million in a settlement of litigation with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) arising from its purchase of Washington Mutual Inc's banking operations during the financial crisis in 2008. According to a regulatory filing, JPMorgan will collect the cash payment from the estate of Washington Mutual Bank, for which the FDIC acts as receiver. In exchange, JP Morgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets said it will drop its more than $1 billion in claims related to the Washington Mutual (WaMu) purchase. JPMorgan also said Deutsche Bank, the trustee overseeing 99 trusts holding residential mortgage securities backed by soured WaMu home loans, will have a claim against the estate. JPMorgan had filed lawsuits seeking to force the FDIC to indemnify it on claims relating to the WaMu purchase, in which it also assumed some of the thrift's liabilities. Deutsche Bank had filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the FDIC and JPMorgan over losses stemming from alleged defects in WaMu's mortgage underwriting. JPMorgan said the settlement requires court approval, and would end four WaMu-related lawsuits involving the bank and the FDIC, and pending in the federal court in Washington, D.C. The bank and the FDIC have long fought over who is liable to investors for claims arising from Seattle-based WaMu's collapse. WaMu had been nation's largest savings and loan before the FDIC seized it on Sept. 25, 2008 and sold its banking operations to New York-based JPMorgan for about $1.9 billion. The parent holding company of WaMu filed for bankruptcy protection. FDIC spokesman David Barr and Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Oksana Poltavets declined to comment.   (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman) Go to MSN Home More in Money 7 successful icons who had a brush with bankruptcy InvestorPlace 20 best money tips of all time from Tony Robbins GOBankingRates 7 CEOs heading to the chopping block InvestorPlace The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money Up Next What the richest 1 percent earns in every state Money Talks News AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More From Reuters Should I stay or should I go?

The agreement with Deutsche Bank AG and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was signed Friday, New York-based JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing. It resolves claims among the three parties over more than $6 billion in securities backed by flawed Washington Mutual Inc. mortgages. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has said that he would have demanded a much lower price for Washington Mutual given the unexpected legal costs from that deal and the acquisition of Bear Stearns Cos. The takeovers, done during the crisis, saddled the bank with billions of dollars of litigation and regulatory expenses. JPMorgan sued the FDIC in 2013, claiming the agency was responsible for more than $1 billion in liabilities faced by the company as a result of its 2008 takeover of Washington Mutual’s bank. JPMorgan had argued that the FDIC agreed to shield it from liability tied to failures by Washington Mutual. JPMorgan said it will drop its claims and receive $645 million in cash. The agreement is subject to judicial approval. A tentative deal was disclosed this month in a JPMorgan filing. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Deutsche Bank had filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the FDIC and JPMorgan over losses stemming from alleged defects in WaMu's mortgage underwriting. JPMorgan said the settlement requires court approval, and would end four WaMu-related lawsuits involving the bank and the FDIC, and pending in the federal court in Washington, D.C. The bank and the FDIC have long fought over who is liable to investors for claims arising from Seattle-based WaMu's collapse. WaMu had been nation's largest savings and loan before the FDIC seized it on Sept. 25, 2008 and sold its banking operations to New York-based JPMorgan for about $1.9 billion. The parent holding company of WaMu filed for bankruptcy protection. FDIC spokesman David Barr and Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Oksana Poltavets declined to comment. The FDIC's full name is the .

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:05 AM, August 20, 2016 Updated: 7:15 AM, August 20, 2016 JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> on Friday said it will receive $645 million in a settlement of litigation with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Deutsche Bank AG <DBKGn.DE> arising from its purchase of Washington Mutual Inc's banking operations during the financial crisis in 2008. According to a regulatory filing, JPMorgan will collect the cash payment from the estate of Washington Mutual Bank, for which the FDIC acts as receiver. In exchange, JP Morgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets said it will drop its more than $1 billion in claims related to the Washington Mutual (WaMu) purchase.

This, however, might not suffice to make it a high performer on Dalal Street, going by global experience. Globally, there seems to be a negative correlation between a bank's size (in assets) and its stock performance. Most of the world's biggest banks in terms of assets — Mitsubishi UFJ, JPMorgan Chase, BNP Paribas, Bank of America, Citi Group, Deutsche Bank, Barclays — have been gross underperformers on the bourses in both the past year and three years. Most of them witnessed a decline in their share price and market capitalisation, despite a global rally in equities. For example, the stock price of Mitsubushi UFJ — currently the world's top bank outside China, in terms of assets — is down 40 per cent over the past 12 months and gave a negative annualised return of 1.4 per cent in the past three years. At the end of March, it had total assets of $2.65 trillion, nearly six times that of SBI, which tops the list in India with assets of around $450 billion. The analysis is based on a list of 40 banks from North America, Europe, Japan and the Asia-Pacific. The sample is based on the peer group definition of Bloomberg. Similarly, Mitsubishi's peers in Western Europe and North America are underperforming on the bourses. For example, Europe's biggest bank, BNP Paribas, has given a negative return of 24 per cent in the past year and a negative annualised return of 2.2 per cent in the past three years. Deutsche Bank, the top one in Germany, has been the biggest laggard, falling 57 per cent in the past 12 months and having given a negative 26.5 per cent annualised return in the past three years. In comparison, most of the smaller banks in the sample have given double-digit returns to their shareholders in the past year and high single digit returns in the past three years. In America, JPMorgan Chase seems an exception and has done reasonably well, despite its large size. The bank has given double-digit return to shareholders in the past three years and its stock price has been stable in the past 12 months. In SBI's case, most analysts are bullish on the stock and see synergy gains from the merger in the long term. However, they point to the immediate cost. Aashish Agarwal of CLSA writes the synergy gains are likely to accrue only in the medium to long term. "First, the alignment of non-performing loans' (NPLs') recognition of subsidiaries with the parent will push up their NPL and credit costs, leading to losses during the first quarter of the current fiscal. Second, as per management, there will be a one-time pension cost of around Rs 3,000 crore for employees of subsidiary banks," he writes on the merger. SBI will also have to bear an additional cost of Rs 25 crore a month (Rs 300 crore a year) for the change in salary structure of the associate banks. In comparison, the SBI management estimates synergy gains of around Rs 3,500 crore from merging and aligning the operations of subsidiary banks with itself. However, while the cost from the merger is real, the upfront gain is contingent on smooth and effective integration. A failure to juice out the gains that outweigh the cost could hit the stock in the medium to longer term.

A gentlemen's boutique in downtown Valparaiso is looking to be able to serve whisky at charitable events as it adapts to a changing retail landscape. Rusted Oak, a clothier at 19 Lincolnway, has received initial approval from the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission, to get a fraternal club liquor license that would let it offer whisky and other alcoholic drinks after after-hours fundraisers for local charities. Other stores such as Albert's Diamond Jewelers have staged events like whisky tastings and casino nights to lure in millennials, who marketers view as valuing experiences over possessions because of the popularity of social media sharing. It's one of a few changes the upscale menswear store in downtown Valparaiso is making at a time when retail giants like Macy's are closing scores of brick-and-mortar locations and dress codes are getting loosened in workplaces nationwide. "There's a big transition," said Rusted Oak owner Robert Ordway, a Lake Station native and Valparaiso University graduate. "The expectations of society have shifted for professional wardrobes. Brooks Brothers is no longer a staple." Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg popularized hoodies, and J.P. Morgan Chase no longer requires employees to wear ties if they're not at meetings. Rusted Oak specializes in custom suits and shoes, and tuxedo rentals for black tie events, but is broadening its offerings to include "athleisure" wear like golf clothes to cater to changing tastes. "Younger people are more into fitness and exercising a lot," he said. "They have unique muscular bodies. They're doing Crossfit. We're going back to the custom clothing we had 100 years ago. Customization allows the individual person to be better dressed for their lifestyle." Fifty years ago, most men in Northwest Indiana might have been steelworkers, but now they defy easy categorization, Ordway said. Steelworkers might dress up on Friday nights to take their wives out on the town. Lawyers might go deer hunting on weekends, and farmers might moonlight as musicians. Rusted Oak has worked to lure men in with a personalized shopping experience, as well as goods like beard oils, beard butter, private-label colognes and decorative whisky barrels. It also expanding to offer more women's clothing. "Women outspend men two to one in retail in this country," he said. "Women buy for fun, while men buy based on need." Retailers as a whole have been declining, closing stores and laying off workers nationwide. "Big box is dead," he said. "You have to sell the experience to be modern and stay relevant. Gone are the days of stack it high and watch it fly." That's why Ordway is asking the state for a liquor license similar to those the Elks and Oddfellows have so the boutique could have whisky tastings at private events to benefit local charities. Attendees to the in-store gales would buy tickets that would make them part of a private club, satisfying the state's fraternal club requirement. "Clothing can be purchased online, so you have to sell the experience as paramount to consumption," he said. "A whisky bar or barber drives foot traffic. It's a highly competitive, mature industry with a lot of shifts. You have to adapt." Ordway is also looking at kicking back a portion of store purchases to local charities like Kid's Alive International or the Gabriel Horn Homeless Shelter. Customers could play a plinko game to select one out of six nonprofits. "I've seen the very bad business model where someone will spend a hundred dollars and then you ask them for one dollar for the St. Jude Foundation," Ordway said. "The millennial generation is looking for new ways to get engaged with the community, and want to be connected with groups where they could invest their time, treasure and talent."

Hoosier Bat, Ublee Soda join Indiana Grown Two Valparaiso companies, Ublee Soda Co. and Hoosier Bat Co., have joined Indiana Grown, a state program that promotes Hoosier products. Shopping rush starts Thanksgiving day, though some stores closing Black Friday has crept forward to Thanksgiving over the last few years, but this year a number of retailers are pushing back.
