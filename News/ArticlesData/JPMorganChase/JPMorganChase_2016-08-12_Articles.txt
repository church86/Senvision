 TOP IPO BANKER: We have 'a pretty broad swath of deals ready for launch' Portia Crowe Aug. 8, 2016, 4:29 PM 3,806 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan's Liz Myers. Screenshot/Bloomberg TV It's been a slow year for the initial public offering, or IPO, market — but things could start to really pick up soon. That's what JPMorgan's global head of equity capital markets, Liz Myers, expects. She said in a recent Bloomberg TV interview that JPMorgan has more than 20 IPOs slated for launch globally in September, and a "full pipeline" for 2017. "It's a pretty broad swath of deals ready for launch," Myers said. She also noted that the firm expects to see more than a dozen tech IPOs before the end of the year. Those will mainly be smaller deals in software, Myers said, although we'll start to see larger tech IPOs in 2017 and 2018. In 2018, she added, we can expect to see activity in the virtual-reality, artificial-intelligence, and robotics spaces. She also said that Asia will see some larger IPOs toward the end of 2016 and into 2017. The largest tech IPO this year was the Japanese messaging app Line, which raised about $1 billion in its July debut on the Tokyo and New York stock exchanges. In addition to the tech sector, Myers said to expect more deals in the financial-services, healthcare, and consumer-retail sectors. She said that investors right now are not overly worried about the outcome of the US presidential election in November, nor are they overly cautious about the activities of the Federal Reserve. "Right now the reception [to IPOs] has been pretty good across a multitude of sectors," Myers said.

The sign-up bonus alone would give cardholders $625 in rewards that can be redeemed through Chase Ultimate Rewards. To sweeten the deal, Chase offers another 5,000 in bonus points when you add an authorized user who makes at least one purchase. Another benefit is that cardholders can transfer their Chase points to qualifying frequent flyer programs at full value. The one caveat is that the points wouldn’t be good for travel on two of the major airlines, Delta and American. Annual fee: $0 for the first year, then $95 Other fees: The greater of either $10 or 5 percent of each cash advance; the greater of either $5 or 5 percent of each balance transfer Intro APR: N/A APR: 16.24% to 23.24% for purchases and balance transfers Pros: 50,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 on purchases in the first three months 2x points on dining and all travel, including taxis and trains 1 point per $1 spent on all other purchases Cons: No introductory APR offers Points can’t be used on some major airlines, like American and Delta Late penalty fee up to $37 Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card The Gold Delta SkyMiles credit card can be a great card — if you only fly on Delta.

What this means is that the balance must be paid in full each month. In some ways, this card is more of a rewards card than a traditional credit card. You can use it to gain access to a host of upscale travel advantages, like entry to the private Centurion Lounge at airports, as well as hotel savings, flight upgrades and much more. However, these perks come with a steep annual fee of $450. Annual fee: $450 Other fees: The greater of either $37 or 2.99 percent of the amount on late payments APR: N/A; balance must be paid in full each month, unless account holder has a “pay over time” feature, in which case interest may be charged.

Singapore’s property companies and real estate investment trusts (Reits) have an unprecedented S$1.8 billion of local currency bonds maturing this quarter, S$1.2 billion in the final quarter and another S$3.7 billion next year. Credit Suisse Private Banking said it does not recommend the smaller developers due to “relatively high” leverage. JPMorgan Chase said these companies are the “most exposed” to a further property market correction given their weakening financial profiles. “Many bonds are unrated and investors aren’t adequately rewarded and have underpriced the risk,” said Mr Ben Sy, head of fixed income, currencies and commodities at the private banking arm of JPMorgan in Hong Kong. The finances of the smaller developers in Singapore are weakening and leverage is rising in a market that lacks sufficient scrutiny, he added. Home values in Singapore have dropped 9.4 per cent from the peak in 2013 and the declines show no signs of abating. The Urban Redevelopment Authority index tracking private home prices fell for the 11th quarter in the three months ended June 30 and the Government on Thursday cut its 2016 economic growth forecasts amid global uncertainties. The smallest 50 real estate firms and trusts listed on the Singapore Exchange are in a weaker position to repay debt, with operating earnings dropping to 9.2 times interest expenses from 15.8 times five years ago. Investors are now demanding bigger premiums to hold notes from the smaller borrowers. Heeton Holdings, which builds homes along Holland Road, has seen the yield on its 2017 bonds rise about 130 basis points from a year ago to 6.54 per cent, according to Bloomberg data. The firm has total debt of S$369.2 million and cash and equivalents of S$11.2 million as of June 30, according to company filings. The yield on the 2017 securities of Aspial Corp, a developer of high-rise condos more known for its jewellery retail business, has jumped to about 9.8 per cent, according to Bloomberg data. Credit Suisse Private Bank prefers Reits, whose borrowing levels are capped by regulators at 45 per cent of total assets. “We prefer Reits where the leverage is lower and cash flows are more stable,” said Mr Neel Gopalakrishnan, the firm’s Singapore-based emerging markets fixed-income analyst. However, not all trusts have escaped unscathed from the downturn, as demand for leasing properties has weakened and some have taken on more debt for acquisitions. Moody’s Investors Service changed its outlook on Singapore-listed Suntec Real Estate Investment Trust to negative on Tuesday after it proposed to buy a stake in a Melbourne property and fund the acquisition with debt. The ratings firm said that Singapore Reits have been making debt-funded acquisitions and while the ones with strong sponsors have access to banking relationships, smaller trusts may face challenges refinancing. “All of them have become a lot more aggressive in terms of acquisitions over the past 12 to 24 months,” said Ms Rachel Chua, a Singapore-based analyst at Moody’s.

 The tech IPO window could be opening — here's what to expect in September Portia Crowe Aug. 12, 2016, 11:08 AM 11,359 facebook linkedin twitter email print The art installation "Alice" by Spanish artist Cristina Lucas. REUTERS/Marcelo del Pozo The tech IPO market is primed for a resurgence in September — after a historically sluggish start to the year. At least three tech startups that have filed for initial public offerings confidentially could make their intentions public as early as the week of August 22, according to people familiar with the matter. Those include the software-as-a-service company Apptio, the cybersecurity-software company Carbon Black, and the software company Coupa. Apptio, which is based in Bellevue, Washington, and develops business management applications, was reportedly planning for an IPO more than a year ago but has yet to make a filing public. It hired Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch last July, according to The Wall Street Journal. Carbon Black, formerly known as Bit9, is based in Waltham, Massachusetts, and develops endpoint security software. The startup, which is backed by Sequoia Capital and Blackstone, hired Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan to lead an IPO, Bloomberg reported in June. Coupa is a cloud-based software company based in San Mateo, California, that helps companies manage their finances. Reuters in July reported that it had hired Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Barclays, and Royal Bank of Canada for an IPO. All three are likely contenders for the post-Labor Day window — a natural time for dealmaking to pick up after a late summer slump — although that's not a guarantee they'll hit the road then. Even thought the Nasdaq Composite index is at a record, any turbulence in the market could discourage issuers. At the moment, though, IPO investors are indicated they'll be receptive to new listings, one of the people said, in part because of the scarcity of such deals this year. Mutual funds that invest in IPOs, for example, are looking for opportunities to bolster their returns before the end of the year. And although there have only been six tech IPOs this year, those that did approach the market performed well. NYSE president Tom Farley, right, congratulates Line executives after ringing the opening bell. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid The cloud-communications company Twilio, for example, priced above range in June and continued to soar for days. The Japanese messaging app Line priced above its range in July, jumped 27% on its first day of trading, and continues to hover. Strong tech IPO performance has also piqued the interest of momentum investors, or hedge funds that might be looking to play IPOs as an asset class by betting on the kinds of short-term gains that Twilio and Line posted. In short, bankers are advising companies that are in a position to launch to consider doing so, the person said. Other deals that could go in the fall include the enterprise-storage company Nutanix, which has been on file publicly since late 2015, and the application-intelligence software company AppDynamics, which has not yet filed publicly but is a likely contender for the fourth quarter, the people said. Most tech IPOs that are likely to go this year — including Apptio, Carbon Black, and Coupa — have revenues under $1 billion, allowing them to file confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS, Act. Companies that file confidentially must make their documents public 15 business days before holding a roadshow — which is why any tech startups looking to launch right after Labor Day could file publicly by the week of August 22. Of course, not every company that files will necessarily end up launching its deal. Recently, a number of startups planning to go public have ended up being bought instead. Those include the security-software company Blue Coat Systems and the Canadian auto marketplace Trader. And a failed deal from a company that tries to price its shares too aggressively would slam that window shut. Apptio and Carbon Black declined to comment for this story. Coupa could not immediately be reached for comment.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 12, 2016 9:05am   Comments Share: Related JPM Conference Calls And Profanity? Yes It's A Thing Investors Have Cast Their Ballots For Big Bank Stocks U.S. Banks Less Worried By Too-Big-To-Fail Stigma (Seeking Alpha) The investment unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: JPM) said it will liquidate one of its Japan-focused funds due to a large string of client withdrawals and poor performances over the years. According to Bloomberg, JPMorgan's Japan Market Neutral Fund was launched in June 2011, but will now close after its total assets fell to around $17 million - below the $30 million liquidation threshold. The fund has seen what the company described as "significant redemption" over the past few months - a move that may not necessarily be surprising as the fun has lost a cumulative 16 percent since inception. Investor appetite for Japanese assets has been impacted by uncertainty over the direction of the country's central banking policies and what impact negative interest rates will have on local assets. Bloomberg obtained a letter from the fund's managers which explained the closure. It noted a "limited prospect of attracting new subscriptions." Meanwhile, other Japan focused funds have seen similar outflows. Bloomberg noted that WisdomTree Investments has seen $4.6 billion worth of redemption in its Japan Hedged Equity Fund. In fact, investors pulled out $974 million from Japan-focused hedge funds in the first quarter of 2016, representing a rate of redemption six times more than what was seen in the same quarter a year ago.

Investor demand for higher returns has eclipsed a drop in oil prices and pushed the ruble’s correlation with crude to the lowest in a year. The currency of the world’s biggest energy exporter has turned from one of 2015’s five worst emerging-market performers to the third-best this year. Russia’s economy shrank 0.6 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, the least since a contraction began at the start of 2015. The future’s looking brighter, too, with options traders the least pessimistic on the ruble’s long-term prospects since mid-2014. Years of easy-money policies in developed economies have pushed yields below zero from Japan to Europe -- in stark contrast to Russia, whose 10.5 percent main rate makes it a popular destination for money borrowed cheaply elsewhere. “The ruble is going to be one of the outperformers in the emerging markets,” said Saad Siddiqui, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., which topped Bloomberg’s latest currency rankings for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “It offers one of the best carry trades.” JPMorgan is predicting a 5 percent gain in the ruble to 61.36 per dollar by year-end, from 64.72 in Moscow on Friday. That contrasts with the 1 percent drop forecast in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Record Low The ruble has rallied 14 percent this year, the best performance in emerging markets after the Brazilian real and the South African rand. That’s a turnaround from January, when collapsing crude prices pushed the currency to an all-time low of 85.999 per dollar. Start your day with what’s moving markets.

You will now receive the Technology newsletter The global rush to lock in yields helped the ruble buck a fresh bout of oil weakness this quarter. While Brent dropped 7 percent since June, the ruble is almost 1 percent stronger and carry traders have taken home a 21 percent return this year, the second-best after the real among 23 developing-nation peers. The ruble’s 30-day correlation with oil has fallen to 0.5, the lowest since June 2015, from as much as 0.9 in October. A reading of one would mean the two assets were in lockstep. “Russia still has relatively attractive real interest rates vis à vis other investment destinations and the oil price is volatile, but on a small scale,” said Sergey Dergachev, a senior money manager at Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH in Frankfurt, which oversees about $13 billion. "The carry trade is really supportive for the ruble and other higher yielding currencies." August Calamities At the same time, Dergachev said the ruble still remains susceptible to risks including the flare-up in hostilities in Ukraine. The currency has only gained against the dollar in August on three occasions since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the month has come to be associated with Russian catastrophes as well as the summer doldrums. In August 1998 Boris Yeltsin’s government defaulted on its local debt and the currency collapsed almost 40 percent; August 2004 saw a spate of terror attacks culminating in the Beslan hostage-taking on Sept. 1; the Kursk nuclear submarine sank in August 2000, days after a fatal bomb blast in a Moscow underpass. While options prices suggest traders are still more pessimistic on the ruble than any other emerging-market currency apart from the Turkish lira and South African rand, they’re rapidly shedding their pessimism. The premium on contracts to sell the ruble versus the dollar in a year’s time, compared with options to buy, narrowed to 4.1 percentage points this week, the least since July 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s down from more than 17 percentage points in January, when the ruble slumped to a record. “In the current global environment with yields at a record low in developed economies, investors are looking for opportunities in the EM universe,” said Piotr Matys, a strategist at Rabobank in London. “High yielders are at the top of their list.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

If the Fed agrees, the extension would give banks more time to exit fund investments that are difficult to sell, but no longer allowed by the law. The added grace period, which follows three one-year extensions, would start next year and run through 2022. The law on Volcker rule implementation says banks can ask for an extra five-year extension for "illiquid" funds, where banks had contractual commitments to invest. In deciding whether to grant Wall Street more leeway, the Fed has asked banks to provide details on their specific investments to prove that they fall under the statutory definition of "illiquid," said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss non-public regulatory discussions. Those seeking the extension include Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co and some other banks, the sources said. They are making their push in part through Wall Street lobbying group the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA). "SIFMA is working with our members to ensure that regulators have the data they need to adequately appraise the situation," the association said in a statement to Reuters. Congress intended to provide "an appropriate transition period" so that banks could exit illiquid funds without disrupting markets, SIFMA added. The banks and the Federal Reserve declined to comment. The Volcker rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, is part of the sweeping 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. It aims to reduce risk-taking by preventing banks from using their own capital to make speculative bets. Critics say its many loopholes – with exemptions for activities like merchant banking and foreign exchange trading – have made it less effective than it was intended to be. "It's laughable that the biggest, most sophisticated financial firms in the world claim they can't sell the stakes year after year," said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of non-profit Better Markets. "Everyone else in America has to comply with the law and Wall Street should also."   TOUGH CALL The Fed has already granted three one-year extensions for compliance with a broader provision of the Volcker rule regarding stakes in hedge funds and private equity funds – the maximum number of extensions it could provide in that context. The new requests, which were widely expected, concern only "illiquid" fund investments. The Fed risks criticism for giving Wall Street more wiggle room, but also risks blame for fire-sale losses or for banks and their investor clients getting tied up in court if they are forced to exit certain contractual agreements quickly. Before the crisis, big banks had proprietary trading desks that made bets on market direction, as well as in-house hedge funds, investments in external hedge funds and co-investments alongside clients in internal private-equity funds. Underlying assets could range from investments in private companies to real estate and long-dated derivatives. While the regulated banks have spun off much of that activity, bankers say there are still some investments that do not contractually expire for years or lack a liquid market for an immediate sale. But disclosures are few and far between, making it difficult to independently discern how truly illiquid the investments are. Banks are now asking the Fed for more time to exit stakes in funds they deem to be illiquid, sources said. In response, the Fed is demanding more details about why the funds, or their underlying assets, are considered illiquid, how much time it would take to exit the investments and what efforts have been made to exit investments sooner, sources said. In granting banks its final one-year extension last month, the Fed said it would soon provide details on how it will address illiquid funds. Banks have been selling down non-compliant investments over the last several years, with Goldman having reduced its exposure by more than half since mid-2013. Yet in regulatory filings, banks have said they may face difficulty in getting rid of those investments by upcoming deadlines. As of June 30, Goldman Sachs held $7 billion worth of private equity investments, real estate holdings and hedge funds affected by the Volcker rule. In March, Goldman said it expected to sell the majority of those stakes before the July 2017 deadline, but it removed that language in its most recent quarterly filing. Morgan Stanley, which has about $3.2 billion in real estate and private equity funds, recently said it expected to be able to divest much of those investments. But the bank said in a second-quarter filing that it expected to ask for further extensions "for certain illiquid funds." JPMorgan has around $1 billion in hedge funds, private equity and real estate investments.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Weak July Retail Sales Won't Change What Fed Does Next It will take more than one month of weak retail sales to sway the Federal Reserve either way at its September meeting, says David Lebovitz, JPMorgan Asset Management. Scott Gamm Aug 12, 2016 10:51 AM EDT July retail sales came in weaker than expected, but as the Federal Reserve's September meeting nears, the central bank isn't relying on any one data point when deciding when to hike short-term interest rates. "It's not going to be any individual data point that causes the Fed to go or stay," said David Lebovitz, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, based in New York. Retail sales, a key gauge of consumer spending, remained unchanged in July, according to a Friday report from the U.S. Census Bureau. Analysts had expected a 0.4% increase. Core retail sales, which doesn't account for food, autos and gas, also showed no growth in July. After June's 0.8% increase in retail sales, Lebovitz said the consumer merely took a pause in July and doesn't think the report is 'terribly troubling.' "I think there's a lot of uncertainty out there," Lebovitz said. "We saw economic growth slow in both the first and second quarter, down from that 2 percent pace that we had been averaging thus far in the expansion." Gasoline sales slipped 2.7%, while auto sales gained 1.1 percent. The national average for a gallon of gas stands at $2.13, compared to $2.23 one month ago, according to AAA. For the Federal Reserve, which is looking to continue to normalize policy after making its first rate hike since the Great Recession back in December of 2015, Lebovitz thinks the Fed will be looking at the broader economic picture, including global developments, rather than any one retail sales or jobs report.

 Goldman Sachs is squaring up against JPMorgan and HSBC to decide the future of gold trading Will Martin Aug. 12, 2016, 5:37 AM 5,052 facebook linkedin twitter email print A worker scoops gold shots at Japanese jewellery brand, Ginza Tanaka's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) factory in the Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo September 14, 2009. REUTERS/Yuriko Nakao There's a battle brewing in the heart of the gold industry, and some of the world's biggest banks are involved. The fight centres itself around the way in which gold — one of the most divisive assets in the financial markets — is traded. There are two clear camps: People who want precious metals like gold, silver and precious metals to be traded on a new platform regulated by a central exchange. Those who want gold trading to remain as an activity done directly between buyers and sellers. Those two camps, according to a brilliant story from Neil Hume and Henry Sanderson at the Financial Times, contain some of the world's foremost financial institutions. On the side of modernising and creating a new exchange are Goldman Sachs, the most powerful bank in the world when it comes to commodities, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the giant Chinese lender with more than £2.5 trillion of total assets. Fighting the other corner are what the FT describes as "two big bullion banks" — JP Morgan and HSBC. This pair is backing an initiative from the London Bullion Market Association to improve transparency in the current system, which has previously been criticised for being too opaque in its operations, according to the FT. As it stands, the trading on spot gold — gold bought and sold on the day, rather than as a future — is done over the counter, meaning that no exchange is involved. Advocates of OTC trading say the lack of an exchange provides flexibility and ease of transaction, while as previously mentioned, those who prefer exchange trading criticise it for being opaque and subject to less regulation. The likes of ICBC argue that the gold markets need to evolve or face "declining" in the future."There’s been a decline in liquidity within the London market. It’s clear the market hasn’t evolved for decades," Raj Kumar, head of precious metals ‎strategic development at ICBC Standard Bank told the FT. "With regulatory changes likely in the future the market is at risk of declining without suitable solutions." The fight comes amid a surge in interest among investors in gold. With uncertainty about the future direction of the global economy, fears about what Britain's Brexit vote means for Europe, and serious geopolitical troubles worldwide, the asset that has been used as a haven for thousands of years is back in fashion. Gold's price has increased by more than 25% so far in 2016, and in July, analysts from UBS argued that the metal has entered a so-called "new phase."Investing.com UBS said that the UK's vote to leave the EU has reinforced the risks facing the global economy, boosted uncertainty, and helped to crystallise worries about the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policies like negative interest rates. All of this combines to create an environment where gold is a hugely attractive investment and is right at the forefront of the global markets. You can read the full Financial Times story here.

X US inflation is on the rise - JP Morgan Bond yields indicate investors expect inflation worldwide of 1.17% Fri, Aug 12, 2016, 07:40 JP Morgan Asset Management says the idea US inflation is always going to be low is an anachronism. Photograph: iStock         JP Morgan Asset Management, overseeing $1.7 trillion, says US inflation is picking up. “US inflation has actually come back,” Benjamin Mandel, a strategist for the company in New York, said on Thursday. “This idea that US inflation is low and is always going to be low is an anachronism.” Bond yields indicate investors expect inflation worldwide of 1.17 per cent over the life of securities, the highest level in eight months. The number is derived by comparing yields on nominal bonds to those on inflation-linked debt, using Bank of America indexes. It’s still less than the 2 per cent target set by the central banks in the US, the UK and Japan. Benchmark US 10-year note yields fell two basis points to 1.54 per cent as of 6:39 am in London, Bloomberg Bond Trader data shows. The price of the 1.5 per cent security due in August 2026 rose 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face value, to 99 5/8. The US will publish data on Friday for producer prices, retail sales and consumer sentiment. The yield will climb to 1.7 per cent by year-end, based on the median forecast of economists.       Topics: Benjamin Mandel Bank of America Bloomberg Jp Morgan Asset Management Japan London(GB) New York City United Kingdom United States Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services 1:10 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing English Soccer Ex-England player David White reveals sexual abuse by coach Economy Downbeat Philip Hammond offers little to soothe economic fears Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Data commissioner steps up investigation into Yahoo hack 20:01 CityJet pilots defer planned airline strike 19:55 Renovated Bewley’s Cafe can seat 500 customers at a time 19:39 Lidl and Aldi to hold prices in Republic despite sterling slide 19:27 Downbeat Philip Hammond offers little to soothe economic fears 18:55 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 Renovated Bewley’s Cafe can seat 500 customers at a time 2 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules 3 Central Bank mortgage rule change: What it means for you 4 What to do in your 20s/30s...if you don’t want to be broke in your 60s 5 Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case 6 Shocking revelations at Rush Credit Union are just the start 7 Sorry millennials: Buying a home was just as hard for your parents 8 Thousands affected as RaboDirect axes investment funds 9 Downbeat Philip Hammond offers little to soothe economic fears 10 Will the Central Bank make it any easier to get a mortgage?

JPMorgan Funds - Japan Market Neutral Fund, launched in June 2011, will liquidate after assets dipped to about $17 million as of Aug. 4 following “significant redemptions” in recent months, the firm said in a letter to investors, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. The fund has lost a cumulative 16 percent since inception, according to the firm’s website. Keiko Kobayashi, a JPMorgan spokeswoman in Tokyo, confirmed the liquidation. “Given these redemptions and its historical performance, the Board sees limited prospect of attracting new subscriptions,” according to the letter, which added that assets have fallen below the $30 million liquidation threshold outlined in the fund prospectus. Money managers and hedge funds in Japan have been especially hard hit as they’ve struggled to anticipate how the central bank’s policy of negative interest rates and asset purchases would impact markets. Stock market declines and unexpected events such as Brexit have also spurred losses, prompting investors to take cover. Fund Outflows WisdomTree Investments Inc., an asset manager that specializes in exchange-traded funds, has seen a record outflow of $6.3 billion from its Europe Hedged Equity Fund, while its Japan Hedged Equity Fund has had $4.6 billion of redemptions. Investors pulled about $974 million from Japanese hedge funds in the first quarter, six times more than they did in the same period last year, according to data compiled by Hedge Fund Research Inc. The number of new hedge fund launches last year in Japan dropped to the lowest since at least 2007, according to data from Eurekahedge Pte, with only two funds starting in 2015. Some 65 hedge funds were liquidated in Japan in the five years ended 2015, the data show. The JPMorgan fund sought to achieve returns “in excess of cash” by investing in Japanese companies and using financial derivative instruments, according to information posted on its website.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Aug 13, 2016 at 10:49AM I've always known that Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) was a heavily traded stock, but it wasn't until today that I compared its trading volume to other big banks. Here's what I found: Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. This confirms what I thought. Yet I was surprised by how much higher Bank of America's trading volume is than the other banks. Its shares change hands at four times the velocity of runner-up Citigroup's (NYSE:C) on a typical day. The comparison to Citigroup is apt because the banks are in similar positions. Both it and Bank of America lost so much money in the crisis eight years ago that they've had to focus on recovering ever since. This decimated shareholder value, and contributes to the fact that their stocks still trade for 40% discounts to book value. The banks are similarly structured, too, offering both commercial and investment-banking products. And they're of approximately the same size: Bank of America has $2.1 trillion in assets on its balance sheet compared to Citigroup's $1.8 trillion. This begs the question: If these two banks are so alike, what explains the fact that Bank of America's trading volume is four times that of Citigroup's? Or for that matter, of Wells Fargo's and JPMorgan Chase's? The answer is much-less exciting than one might imagine. Namely, the reason Bank of America's shares trade at such a high velocity relative to these other banks is because its share price is lower. This makes it affordable for hedge funds and high-frequency traders to buy and sell a large number of Bank of America's shares. Bank Share Price* JPMorgan Chase $65.32 Wells Fargo $47.90 Citigroup $45.58 Bank of America $14.85 *As of Aug. 8, 2016. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. The numbers aren't exact, but the size of the difference between these banks' share prices corresponds roughly over to volume. For instance, Bank of America's shares trade at four times the rate of Citigroup's because the latter's shares are three times the price of the former's. It's worth noting, as well, that Bank of America's shares don't trade at a high volume only in the context of bank stocks; its volume is also high when you look at the broader market. Shares of the North Carolina-based bank trade at a higher average daily volume than any other company on the S&P 500. The runner-up is Chesapeake Energy, shares of which trade hands at half the pace of Bank of America's volume. The point here is that Bank of America is a volatile stock. It offers a lot of potential, but it's not for the faint of heart. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Despite Massive Downgrades, Some Analysts Still See SunPower Shining Bright By Jon C. Ogg August 13, 2016 9:20 am EST Print Email Tweet SunPower Corp. (NASDAQ: SPWR) managed to obliterate its shareholders in the past week. It was supposed to have decent earnings, but the guidance and the commentary about new competition hurting its orders created a drag-down effect for the entire solar industry during the week. When growth investors think of alternative and renewable energy’s growth prospects in the years ahead, they might begin to scratch their heads when they hear that a company has to have layoffs. SunPower shares had fallen 3.4% to $14.78 the day ahead of earnings, but the guidance was so dismal (ditto for layoffs) that the shares were indicated down 30% at $10.30 to a new 52-week low even before the dust settled for the week. The stock hit a new low of $10.05 this week, but SunPower shares ended the week at $10.85. The prior 52-week low before the big drop was $13.29, and its 52-week high is $31.10. 24/7 Wall St. not only wanted to list the numerous downgrades, but also to see which firms were still telling their clients to be buyers on weakness. It turns out that two firms think that this latest drop is a gift. Just make sure to keep in mind that when stocks drop 30% or more in a day that they almost never bounce back handily on their own internal efforts. Some analysts did not release their downgrades immediately after the drop. Morgan Stanley downgraded SunPower to Equal Weight from Overweight on Friday, slashing its price target to $12 from $27. Barclays downgraded SunPower’s rating to Equal Weight from Overweight on Thursday, with its price target slashed to $12 from $23. Other analyst downgrades of SunPower were seen as follows: JPMorgan downgraded it to Neutral from Overweight and cut the target to $17 from $28. Janney downgraded it to Neutral from Buy and the fair value estimate was slashed to $13. Oppenheimer downgraded it to Perform from Outperform, but no price target is offered now. Credit Suisse downgraded it to Neutral and slashed the price target to $12 from $32. Deutsche Bank cut its rating to Hold from Buy and lowered the price target to $11 from $37. Not everyone is advising clients to bail out here. We have two ratings that were seen in basic calls and two which were expanded upon. Robert W. Baird’s team maintained its Outperform rating, but they did get more realistic on their price target, cutting that to $21 from $37. Standard & Poor’s kept its Buy rating, but it is much more conservative now with a 12-month target price to $13 (down from $22). Then there was Raymond James, which also maintained its Outperform rating. That firm’s analyst came on CNBC and said that investors should be more interested in a great company after its shares were battered. Pavel Molchanov, the solar analyst at Raymond James, believes that the market and the host of analyst downgrades are simply wrong to keep battering SunPower’s stock lower. Still, he lowered his target for clients to $20 from $30. Molchanov told CNBC that the United States has a lot of room to grow its solar energy efforts. His appearance said: We don’t have to wait 35 years. Look at Europe—Germany and Italy. Last year [solar] was almost 10 percent of total power generation. In the United States, we are not even at 1 percent… There’s enormous scope for solar growth in the U.S., and enormous technology improvements to be implemented. Europe has driven costs down by investing heavily in solar and the U.S. stands to benefit a great deal. Merrill Lynch’s Krish Sankar also kept a Buy rating, but the firm’s price objective was lowered to $25 from $31 in that call. This is still more than 100% implied upside if correct, and the report said that SunPower is a top pick among solar stocks. That report said: We see SunPower’s continued market share gains in the residential sector as a positive. However, the challenge facing this segment is that more home owners prefer cash sales/loans rather than a 20-year lease from the solar installer, thereby impacting EBITDA and the long-term cash flow stream. Other positives include management’s view of possible margin expansion in the commercial business and reduced operating expenses (~1,200 employee reduction). The company offers the industry’s highest efficiency panel, has exposure to key growth markets globally, and is backed by global energy giant Total. In addition to utility-scale project opportunities, the company’s US-based rooftop leasing business holds long-term value. We see substantial opportunity for the company to leverage high efficiency technology and low-cost Total-backed financing to expand contracted project opportunities around the world. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Again, it would be silly to believe that SunPower is going to snap back immediately on its own. An outside force, or a merger would be able to change that view, but companies that get hit this hard just do not usually get immediately up off the floor. SunPower’s new consensus analyst price target from Thomson Reuters was at $18.67 on Friday. It was more than $31 in July and above $32 in May. By Jon C.

Americans stopped spending in July Americans in July continued to splurge on cars — but they certainly weren’t driving them to the mall to go shopping. Retail sales in July were “virtually unchanged” from June, according to figures released by the Commerce Department on Friday after growing 0.8 percent in June. The falloff in spending in July disappointed Wall Street, which was expecting a 0.4 percent jump in sales. Further confounding the Street is that June’s figures were revised upward from their original estimate of 0.6 percent — meaning consumers simply stopped shopping last month. Over the last year, retail sales increased 2.3 percent. The one bright spot was auto sales, which showed a 1.3 percent gain in July. Without auto sales, July retail sales would have dropped 0.3 percent. Michael Feroli, an economist with JPMorgan Chase, said the retail sales hot streak has ended and called the figures a “disappointment” in a note following the data release. The weaker-than-expected July numbers helped send the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 down on the day. Of course, the two indexes — plus the Nasdaq — hit all-time highs on Thursday. The poor retail numbers, plus a Labor Department report showing producer prices fell 0.4 percent in July — meaning the threat of inflation was remote — lessened the chances that the Federal Reserve would raise rates when it met next month. In fact, data compiled by Bloomberg showed that the probability of a September rate hike already fell 4 percentage points from Thursday, to 18 percent, suggesting that the month’s dormant sales figures represent a broader trend instead of a one-time blip. Meanwhile, even though there were bright spots in Friday’s report, they spoke to the broader problems in the retail space. Furniture sales were up 0.2 percent from the previous month, giving shoppers less of a reason to leave their newly plush homes. Non-store sales — which generally means online shopping — were also a bright spot, growing 1.3 percent, meaning that consumers who bought furniture during the month were really enjoying shopping from the comfort of their new armchairs. Put simply, it’s becoming a “Netflix and chill” consumer economy, to the detriment of restaurants and bars — which saw sales dip 0.2 percent — and traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Department stores and grocery stores were down 0.5 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively. Sales at sporting and hobby stores were down 2.2 percent over the last month, suggesting that July shoppers were not inspired by the upcoming Olympic Games in Rio.
