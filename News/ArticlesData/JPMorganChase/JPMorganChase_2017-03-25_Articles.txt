Take a look at JPMorgan, Nucor, and IBM. Tyler Crowe, Tim Brugger, and Jordan Wathen (TMFDirtyBird) Mar 25, 2017 at 8:20AM When most people think of safe places to put their money, their minds leap to classic low-risk investments like Treasury bonds, or to simply stashing cash under the proverbial mattress. If you plan to hold on to that money for a long time, though, those options are going to lose the battle with inflation. If you want a safe investment for the long term that's likely to avoid losing value, your best bet is probably in the stocks of strong, stable companies with staying power. We asked three of our contributors each to pick a stock investors could buy now and not have to worry much about all the way out to 2030. Their choices: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Nucor (NYSE:NUE), and IBM (NYSE:IBM). Image source: Getty Images Jamie's fortress Jordan Wathen (JPMorgan Chase): It's hard to get excited about a bank stock, but when you do, you might have something special. JPMorgan Chase needs no introduction, but the average consumer might not recognize just how dominant the bank has become under CEO Jamie Dimon. JPMorgan leads its peers in deposit growth, credit card issuance, and payment volume, and it also takes the top spot in multiple categories in investment banking and markets. Oh, and it also takes first place in the wealth management industry for profitability; it has attracted more money over the last five years than anyone but BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. It's really a remarkable collection of businesses that benefit from being cogs in a larger machine. For consumers, it can be a true "financial supermarket," with everything from competitive deposit products to credit cards, car loans, and mortgages. On the commercial and corporate side, the company offers everything from merchant processing to multimillion-dollar loan products. By 2030, the United States will certainly have navigated another recession, possibly two or three, which is never good for the banking business, or bank stocks. But over the long haul, I think the below-average historical losses in JPMorgan's loan portfolios point to a better-than-average outcome for its shareholders. An investment as solid as steel Tyler Crowe (Nucor): The skeleton of modern society is built with steel, and that isn't going to change much anytime soon. The challenge with investing in the steel industry is that it is an immensely capital-intensive business that goes through some pretty big up and down cycles. It also doesn't exactly help things that China currently produces more steel than the rest of the world combined, which means that cycle tends to follow the Chinese market more than anything else. Despite this challenging industry environment, Nucor has stood out among the crowd thanks to its unique business model. It got its start as a contrarian player in the market by utilizing mini mills that produce new steel from scrap and recycled products, rather than the traditional blast furnaces that use iron ore and metallurgical coal. This innovative method has the advantage of allowing for smaller-scale operations that can be ramped up or down rather quickly, making Nucor more nimble as it responds to ups and downs in the market, and thus better able to capture market share. On top of that, the company's employee compensation structure is tied more closely than is common to the bottom line, which incentivizes productivity on a weekly basis. This unique structure also means that its selling, general, and administrative costs are less on average, and they tend to be much more variable than those of its peers. It's little things like this that have enabled Nucor to generate strong returns on equity throughout the industry's cycles, and to raise its dividend annually for more than 40 years straight. Unless we are able to come up with some supermaterial that has the strength of steel without the high costs of manufacturing, steel will remain a critical component in the background of our everyday lives, and Nucor is the kind of company that turns manufacturing this essential product into a high-return, dividend-paying business. That's the kind of investment I want to own till 2030 -- and beyond. Right place, right time Tim Brugger (IBM): If timing is in fact everything, then IBM is a stock worthy of inclusion in most any long-term portfolio. While its solid dividend yield is a nice bonus, what sets IBM apart from other alternatives is an ongoing transformation that's refocusing the company on fast-growing markets. IBM's relatively flat year-over-year revenue might concern some investors. However, total sales should take a backseat -- at least for the time being -- to how IBM's strategic imperatives are performing. CEO Ginni Rometty began the process of transitioning away from the legacy hardware and associated businesses a few years ago. The objective since then has been to lead the shift to the cloud, data security, and analytics, along with mobile-related markets, and IBM is doing just that. Last year's results speak volumes about Big Blue's successful transformation. Yes, total revenue declined 2% in 2016 to $79.9 billion. But IBM's strategic imperative sales jumped a combined 13% to $32.2 billion, led by a whopping 35% improvement in cloud-related sales to $13.7 billion. Key strategic imperatives revenue now makes up 41% of total sales, and that percentage continues to climb with each passing quarter. In addition to IBM's focus on what many pundits expect to be some of the fastest-growing market opportunities around, at just 12 times future earnings, it's ridiculously inexpensive relative to its peers. Not only does IBM's current valuation equate to a bargain, it also limits its downside risk for long-term investors. Toss in a 3.2% dividend yield, and IBM is an ideal stock for investors with time on their side. Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Britain's financial watchdog did not wrongfully identify a JPMorgan executive linked to the London Whale scandal, the Supreme Court has ruled The court said the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had successfully hidden Achilles Macris's identity when it fined the bank for running up 6.2 billion US dollars (£4.3 billion) in losses through a complex financial instrument called a synthetic credit portfolio. The landmark judgement could potentially shield the agency from legal challenges by other traders who claim they were not given a chance to contest the FCA's findings before it published a penalty notice. JPMorgan was hit with 920 million US dollars (£739 million) in fines by US and UK regulators in 2013 after the London Whale scandal emerged. The FCA also fined Mr Macris £792,900 for not informing its predecessor - the Financial Services Authority - about the huge losses his department was amassing between March 28, 2012 and April 29, 2012. Mr Macris, who won a legal case against the the watchdog in the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal, was the head of the bank's chief investment office in London which made the London Whale trades. An FCA spokesman said: "The FCA is pleased there is now a final ruling on the issue and is considering the impact of the Supreme Court's judgement on the other third-party references currently before the tribunal." Mr Macris's unit included French rogue trader Bruno Iksil, who became known as the London Whale for the size of the bets the bank was making. Chris Dyke, lawyer at criminal and regulatory law firm Corker Binning, said: "This judgment of the Supreme Court will be a relief for the FCA. "The overturned Court of Appeal decision exposed the tension between the FCA's desire to quickly settle regulatory investigations into financial institutions and its public criticism of the employees of those companies necessitated by those settlements. "The time and resources required to deal with the interventions and representations of a potentially very large pool of individuals would have been a very heavy burden for the FCA and could have significantly slowed the speed of regulatory enforcement."

Updated 16 hours ago Last year, the investor Arjuna Capital helped urge seven tech companies to doing something unexpected: Publish the percentage pay gap that exists between their male and female employees and commit to closing it. Now, the woman behind that push is taking aim at another industry known for its male-dominated workplace: The financial sector. Natasha Lamb, managing director of Arjuna Capital, which focuses on sustainable and social impact investing, said Thursday she had filed proposals at six financial companies urging them to prepare a report addressing their goals at reducing the gender pay gap and including the percentage gap between the pay of men and women. The banks and credit card firms targeted are Citigroup, Wells Fargo, American Express, MasterCard, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. “It makes no sense to hold America's top tech companies to a high standard on gender pay equity and then pretend that banks should be allowed to discount the issue and operate with no transparency,” Lamb said in a conference call with reporters. Lamb said she was going after the major banks in part because financial services is such a male-dominated industry. In the proposal, she cited data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows female financial advisers faced a 61.3 percent pay gap in 2014, the widest of occupations reviewed, as well as a 2016 study from the management consultancy Oliver Wyman showing it will take three decades before women reach 30 percent of the industry's executive committees. Other research cited showed links between risks and rewards for investors in companies that have diverse executive teams. Lamb said she has been in dialogue with all the companies in question, but most of the financial firms have been more opposed to her proposal. “We've seen a night and day difference in the tech and financial worlds,” Lamb said. All but one of the six companies have come out against the proposal, Lamb said; she has not gotten an answer from MasterCard. Among the nine tech companies she worked with last year, only three formally opposed the resolutions in their proxies, one of which was eBay, where an unusually high number of shareholders voted in favor of the proposal and the company said it would share its analysis publicly. Of course, the tech companies revealed nearly nonexistent percentage gaps when analyzing people working in similar jobs, which may have made them more willing to share the information. Those numbers also overlook the industry's position gap: Men and women may earn roughly the same in the same jobs, but men are more frequently in higher-paying roles in both of these industries. Meanwhile, four of the banks — Wells Fargo, Bank of America, American Express and Citigroup -- defended their numbers of female leaders and their pay practices in lengthy sections of their proxy statements. In them, the companies highlighted a range of internal efforts to prevent bias, improve numbers of women and minorities, use third party consultants to check for pay equity, as well as note recognition they've received for diversity and leadership involvement in diversity programs. As a result, Lamb's proposal was described by the companies as unnecessary.

Reuters More On: google Google loses more top advertisers amid placement nightmare Google's ad crisis response shows web is growing up Google's 'hate' video crisis could become a $1 billion problem Google Maps will soon be able to track you On St. Patrick’s Day, executives at ad buying giant Havas filed into their London offices for another day at work — and discovered some very unpleasant news. Ads that they had paid Google to place across its many digital properties were popping up attached to videos from some of the Internet’s most active hate mongers — including white nationalists such as David Duke, animal-rights extremists and ISIS. They were not happy. One ad, for Oracle and NetSuite, featuring smiling office workers, was displayed prominently on a video of two men carrying an ISIS flag. Another, for Walmart, sat atop a masked man crouching with fierce dogs. While the ad world has long harbored resentment toward Google for its secretive ways, the videos were more than Havas could stomach. Havas’ UK boss, Paul Frampton, immediately yanked all of his clients’ commercials from the web giant. “We have a duty of care to our clients in the UK marketplace . . . where we can be assured that that environment is safe, regulated to the degree necessary and additive to their brands’ objectives,” Frampton said in a statement. Days later, Google apologized and promised to fix the problem — but it wasn’t enough. Within a week, AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, PepsiCo, Wal-mart, General Motors, Starbucks, Verizon, JPMorgan Chase and other mega-advertisers had followed suit, pulling their ads from Google’s platforms in the US. YouTube It was a moment of reckoning for Google. After years of happily banking ever-expanding ad budgets, the world’s second-biggest company was on notice. Google, the search engine, and its subsidiaries like YouTube have always insisted that they are simply a platform that serves content or ads. But suddenly that excuse wasn’t cutting it anymore. Outrage arose after ads appeared alongside videos pushing animal-rights extremism (top) and anti-Semitism (above).YouTube “They’ve always maintained they were sort of digital engineers standing there with their digital [wrenches], trying to tighten the nuts on their digital pipes and not being responsible for the content that was going through the pipes,” Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the WPP Group, the biggest advertiser in the world with $102 billion in client ad money, said on CNBC. But after the Havas snafu, “They can’t just say, ‘Look, we’re a technology company, we have nothing to do with the content that is appearing on our digital pages.’ ” In fact, many industry leaders are now charging that Google and other tech giants, like Facebook, aren’t just web platforms; they’re publishers — like a news organization or a TV network — and they must shoulder the responsibility that comes with that role. “We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company,” Sorrell said. With brands including Google Maps and its Gmail service, Google has a market cap of $562.4 billion and it controls 41 percent of the $83 billion US digital ad market. (Facebook controls 14.7 percent of the US digital ad business, according to eMarketer.) But its once-impenetrable brand equity is now in danger of evaporating, at least with a growing band of major advertisers. They can’t just say, ‘Look, we’re a technology company, we have nothing to do with the content that is appearing on our digital pages.’ Traditionally, marketers spend considerable time and energy ensuring media outlets don’t run their ads next to clashing content. Fast-food ads, for example, are expected not to run alongside stories about dieting or diabetes. Airlines typically tell TV news outlets to drop their ads from breaks when plane crashes are reported. But online? It’s a whole other story. There are few checks and balances. Google argues it can never guarantee where ads land, because it’s contending with 400 hours of content uploaded every minute. Google also operates YouTube, one of the biggest destinations online offering advertisers a billion hours of viewing content per day, and a global ad exchange called DoubleClick, which automatically serves up ads on millions of websites all over the world. Because of its size and dominance, for a long time Google called the shots. While other, less-important outlets were forced to provide advertisers with data that showed whether or not their online campaigns were effective, Google has long refused to share those metrics. The company’s algorithm, which it uses to filter out unsavory content when placing ads, is also secret. But now it’s also clear it doesn’t work. The Times of London was the first to reveal Google’s glitch, with an investigation earlier this month exposing the Havas problem and setting off the advertising boycott. Google’s response to the Times of London’s findings only seemed to compound the problem. On Monday, Google’s European chief, Matt Brittin, told advertisers at a conference that the company already had the tools to keep their ads off bad content, they just weren’t using them correctly. He added that Google would step in to help them figure it out and claimed that 98 percent of flagged content is reviewed within 24 hours. Google’s European chief, Matt Brittin.Getty Images (But after flagging several bad ad placements to Google that weren’t rectified within the 24 hour period, the Times of London proved this wasn’t entirely true.) By Tuesday, Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler, in a blog post, pledged to do more: “We know advertisers don’t want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values. So, starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content,” he wrote. “In cases where advertisers find their ads were served where they shouldn’t have been, we plan to offer a new escalation path to make it easier for them to raise issues.” Meanwhile, Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has been unable to promise a zero-tolerance policy. Appearing on Fox Business on Thursday, Schmidt stated that while Google “can get pretty close” to making sure ads won’t appear next to extremist content, he can’t guarantee it. And now the damage may be too big to contain. In May, big digital players including Google, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and AOL/Yahoo will start pitching their business as part of the “Digital New Fronts” — where marketers aiming to advertise the upcoming TV season commit the majority of their budgets to web outlets. In the coming weeks, as Google hopes to grab TV ad budgets, execs will likely be spending most of their time discussing issues of brand safety, notes Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser. Advertisers spend about $70 billion on TV ads in the US, and Wieser estimates Google could lose as much as $1 billion in new ad money as a result of the boycott and its aftermath. “Google’s stated solution was late and woeful. Given numerous opportunities to nip it in the bud, they’ve seemingly made it worse.” Wieser said Google is “attempting to minimize the problem rather than eliminating it. We think that Google will probably need to articulate goals that sound more like a zero-tolerance policy, to alleviate concerns before it can fully recover.” On Monday, Wieser showed his lack of confidence in Google stock, downgrading Alphabet from a buy to a hold. By Friday, Alphabet stock was $814.43, losing $35 per share in a week. While Google has allowed hate-speech content to run riot on its platforms, it is also accused of restricting ad funds to legitimate websites. Israel-based Matan Uziel runs a serious documentary series on YouTube featuring women discussing rape and abuse. It includes, among other subjects, ex-models discussing how they became bulimic working in the fashion business. He says his organization supports Emma Watson’s UN initiative, “HeForShe.” Uziel says Google served ads to his channel on YouTube until December, when suddenly the company halted the flow. Uziel says he’s complained to YouTube that his female-empowerment series has been prevented from monetizing the clips in the “Real Women, Real Stories,” online series. He pointed out that videos glorifying drugs and showing self-harm are able to monetize their ads, perhaps because the content of the ads isn’t so obvious to Google’s algorithm. He says he has called on YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki to address the problem but got no response. “It is a dark time in the US for women,” Uziel said. “Google owns YouTube and, like any multinational tech company, they are supposedly acting in their own best interests. But they are undermining their creators.” (Google declined to comment on Uziel’s claims.) Getty Images Stunned by the volume of complaints from major advertisers, on Friday Google issued a client memo detailing the changes it is making. The firm is promising to use a new type of artificial intelligence to flag inappropriate content that will even pick up a T-shirt bearing bad language, according to Bloomberg, which obtained the memo. It will also retool a video verification process and create a staff hotline to respond to complaints. Google said it would implement changes by Sunday. But some are saying Google needs to go even further, hiring actual human editors who can judge the nuances of content more effectively than an automated system. Google’s many rivals in the space, including AppNexus and AOL’s Marketplace, note that they have much tighter policies on what’s acceptable. “They need to hire more data scientists,” said one digital ad executive. Critics say Google, which was cooked up nearly 20 years ago in a Menlo Park, Calif., garage by two college kids, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, is finally having to grow up, take responsibility for its content and deal with the issues that old-school publishers have long had to face. “It’s a shame it took this kind of a pressure,” one digital advertising executive told The Post. Jon Bond, a veteran ad exec who works with In-N-Out Burger as co-chairman of ad agency holding company Shipyard, added that technology companies’ insensitivity to people is a huge weak point. “Google isn’t about people, and that’s going to bite them,” Bond told The Post. “They’ve never had to go to a meeting where something inappropriate got blown up by the press and consumers wrote letters to the CEO.” He said Google needs to fine-tune its artificial intelligence so that it has more of a human touch. “It’s impossible to be perfect. People aren’t perfect in the print world. But there is an acceptable range and they have to get closer to where the publishing world is — where it’s humans making decisions.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under advertising ,  anti-semitism ,  digital publishing ,  google ,  youtube Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Google loses more top advertisers amid placement nightmare Read Next Google loses more top advertisers amid placement nightmare Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 85,427 Ex-maid says Bloomberg's $20M estate was sex-filled nightmare 64,211 Cops mow down armed woman 58,316 Huma Abedin 'working hard' on marriage with Anthony Weiner Now On Samira Wiley marries Lauren Morelli in Palm Springs Wyclef Jean’s label CEO filmed arrest incident Casey Stengel’s cap flap SEE ALL Video 1:35 Girl stranded in the Grand Canyon for 119 hours lives to tell about it Now On 10 Things You Didn’t Know About ‘The Godfather’ SEE ALL More Stories pagesix Gwyneth answers all your burning questions about anal sex Now On Decider 10 Sex Scenes That Changed Film History nypost Ex-maid says Bloomberg's $20M estate was sex-filled nightmare New York Post Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Email Newsletters Mobile Apps Contact Us Tips Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Sections & Features News Real Estate Page Six Tech Sports Media Metro Photos Entertainment Video Business Alexa Opinion Covers Fashion Horoscopes Living Classifieds Newsletters & Feeds Email Newsletters RSS Feeds NYPost Store Home Delivery Subscribe Manage Subscription Preferences Help/Support Customer Service App FAQ & Help Contact Us Tips Newsroom Letters to the Editor Reprints Careers Apps iPhone App iPad App Android Phone Android Tablet Advertise Media Kit Contact Post Digital Network © 2017 NYP Holdings, Inc.

According to a research report published today, Blacks and Latinos are “severely underrepresented” among borrowers who obtained a loan from a major bank to purchase a home in the city of Oakland. The report, by the Greenlining Institute and Urban Strategies Council, also found that banks issued a much smaller total number of home mortgage loans in Oakland compared to Fresno and Long Beach, two other cities analyzed in the study. And Black and Latino borrowers in Oakland applied for home loans at very low rates, and were approved at lower rates than whites. This dearth in mortgage lending by major banks in Oakland, compounded by low numbers of mortgage loan applications from Black and Latino customers, and lower loan approval rates, is perpetuating and exacerbating wealth disparities, the authors of the study concluded. See also: JP Morgan Chase's Home Loans in Oakland Mostly Went to White and Wealthy Residents The study analyzed bank lending data for the year 2013 that was obtained from the federal government. The twelve largest banks, measured by the total dollar amount of loans originated in California, were included in the study. The authors compared Oakland, Fresno, and Long Beach because these cities are of similar size and have racially diverse populations, and they represent different geographic areas of the state with different economies. The data analyzed by the Greenlining Institute and Urban Strategies Council showed that major banks are making far fewer total mortgage loans in Oakland compared to Fresno and Long Beach. “Despite comparable populations, Oakland had less than one quarter as many loan applications and originations as Long Beach and Fresno,” the report states. It’s unclear why major banks are approving fewer home loans in Oakland, but it may be due to Oakland’s increasingly unaffordable prices, and the presence of cash investors who crowd out buyers who need bank loans to close a deal. Whatever the cause, this lower level of bank lending in Oakland is compounded by racial disparities. According to the report, Black and Latino residents make up 56 percent of Oakland’s total population, but they received just 10 percent of the total dollars lent by major banks for home purchases. “Across the board, what the report shows is that Black and Latino communities were way under-represented when it comes to obtaining mortgage loans,” said Zachary Murray of the Greenlining Institute, one of the authors of the report. Greenlining Institute and Urban Strategies Council found that in 2013 the top twelve banks only approved a total of four loans for Black borrowers to purchase homes in the city of Oakland. The other 44 home mortgage loans made to Black borrowers in Oakland were refinance loans. In the same year, Latinos only obtained sixty mortgage loans in Oakland, and just seven of these were to purchase a home. By contrast, white borrowers obtained 358 mortgage loans in 2013 and 40 of these were to purchase homes. Asians obtained 186 mortgage loans, and 37 of these were to buy a home. Particular banks exhibited wide racial disparities in their mortgage lending activities. According to the report, Wells Fargo Bank, US Bank, and CashCall all exhibited much lower loan origination rates for Blacks and Latinos than for Asians and whites. A loan origination rate measures what percent of applicants for a loan are approved and receive the loan. Some banks, including Chase and Bank of America did better, originating loans at almost equal rates for Black and Latino customers as they did for white and Asian customers. But for all of the twelve banks analyzed in the report, white and Asian customers were more likely to have their loans approved than Black and Latino customers. Sasha Werblin of Greenlining, one of the authors of the study, said that lower average household wealth and income could be one reason that Blacks and Latinos are less able to obtain home loans. The economic crisis and recession of 2007-2010, and the foreclosure crisis that peaked in 2011-2012 reduced the savings of many families, and had a disproportionately harmful impact on Black and Latino households in California. But Werblin said that it is also incumbent on banks to offer sustainable and quality financial products that help them build wealth and secure housing. “What are banks doing to market to these individuals? Do they have products that would fit the needs of these individuals?” said Weblin in a previous interview.

By Nadja Sayej / The Guardian March 17, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Hare Krishna / Shutterstock This week, President Trump released his “America first” federal budget plan, which intends to completely wipe out the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. It is the first time a president has ever proposed their complete obliteration. It came a day before the opening of the Whitney Biennial – the longest-running survey of American art – casting a gloomy shadow on a group exhibition that explores the topic of funding, or its lack thereof. The 63 artists on view are co-curated by Mia Locks and Christopher Y Lew, who want to mirror this bleak era. “This biennial arrives at a time rife with racial tensions, economic inequities and polarizing politics,” they write in the introductory statement, “inviting us to pause and pose questions in a tumultuous world.” It’s a politically charged show on the state of America but without the predictable satire. Rather, this exhibition feels like a graveyard of the establishment’s broken promises with glimmers of hope from some of its suffering citizens. Part of the Occupy Museums group show. Photograph: Occupy Museums In light of arts funding cuts, the art collective Occupy Museums, which was formed in 2011 alongside Occupy Wall Street, has created a mini group show in the biennial called Debtfair. The works of 30 artists are grouped by the corporations they are in debt to; JPMorgan Chase, Navient and the FirstBank of Puerto Rico. The artworks can be bought for the artist’s monthly debt charge. What about art education, you ask? Puerto Rican artist and activist Chemi Rosado-Seijo took all the desks and chairs from a classroom from the Lower Manhattan Arts Academy and put the class inside the museum. The piece, called Salón Sala Salón, brings the high school art students to the museum for a weekly workshop, showing the importance the creative arts education in a time when its meaning is being diminished. The arts aren’t the only sector suffering funding cuts – the budget proposal wipes out thousands of jobs in health, science and social programs. New York artist Cameron Rowland’s piece Public Money shows one alternative form of funding that could pave the way for the future, social impact bonds. “The purpose is to gain a more intimate understanding of how they work,” he said. “So few people know they exist, let alone how they work, which is something that is crucial at this moment.” While there are no Trump portraits or American flags, there is a Statue of Liberty standing outside in below-zero weather. The performance, called Liberté (Liberty), has a performer holding up an unlit torch. It was created by art group Puppies Puppies, who are selling foam Liberty Island crowns downstairs in the gift shop for $5, debunking the myth that high art has to be expensive (and inaccessible). Even with holdups at airports and the looming Muslim ban, other pieces dig into the refugee crisis, like The Island, a film by Vietnamese artist Tuan Andrew Nguyen. Shot on the Malaysian island of Bidong, a former Vietnam war refugee camp, it mirrors the present refugee crisis at a time when millions of Syrian refugees have fled their homeland. While the small island accommodated 250,000 people from the 1970s to the time it shut down in 1991, America will accept no more than 50,000 refugees this year after screening each one under a microscope. During the presidential campaign, Melania Trump was called out for copying and pasting parts of Michelle Obama’s speech. Here, there is also a plagiarism spat. On Instagram, Toronto artist Maya Ben David claimed that a sculpture in the biennial by Ajay Kurian looks too similar to a character she created called Mary Jane Anthro Plane, which is featured in her video art piece MBD: Origin Story, which was shown in a gallery last year. Kurian’s sculpture, which is part of a series he called Childermass, features a figure with a red wig and a white mask, just like David’s. “The sculpture in the Whitney not only resembles my character with an airplane mask and red hair, but she is wearing layered shirts and sneakers just like in my work,” said Ben David. “I would like an apology from the artist and curators at the Whitney Museum and recognition that the character Mary Jane Anthro Plane is my creation.” An email sent to Kurian’s gallerist was not answered at the time of publishing this story. Raúl de Nieves’s Technicolor stained glass wall. Photograph: Will Ragozzino It feels like many people are being sold short, and it isn’t just Trump’s budget cuts to the arts. While his proposed Mexican-US border wall will cost billions, the current border is a point of inspiration in the show. Mexican artist Raúl de Nieves’s Technicolor stained glass wall reads Hope, while the Postcommodity art collective created a video that follows the rusty metal fence that currently divides Douglas, Arizona, and Agua Prieta, Mexico. “The border continues to mystify the American public during this administration, as it did before Trump entered,” said Postcommodity artist Cristobal Martinez, who refers to their piece as “a metaphor for the imprisonment caused by the polarizing bipartisan discourse”.   Nadja Sayej is a freelance journalist in Berlin covering art and culture.

WALL STREET SHUFFLE - the tyranny of mere wealth, the tyranny of plutocracy (Image by YouTube, Channel: JFWilliam)   Permission   Details   DMCA - Advertisement - By golly, The Donald delivers. Trump and his new blue-ribbon panel of working-class champions have announced a bold new initiative to create millions of American jobs. A spokesman for the panel, Steve Schwarzman, praised Trump as a leader who wants to "do things a lot better in our country, for all Americans." Wait a minute -- Steve Schwarzman? Isn't he a billionaire hedge-fund huckster on Wall Street? Yes -- and holy money bags, there's Jamie Dimon, head of the scandal-ridden bank JPMorgan Chase. - Advertisement - Working-class champions? Hardly. Trump's whole "jobs" panel, it turns out, is made up of Wall Street banksters and corporate powers like Wal-Mart that are notorious for laying off and ripping off workers. Trump-the-candidate fulminated against such moneyed elites, calling them "responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class." But now, in a spectacular flip-flop, he's brought these robbers directly inside his presidency, asking them to be architects of his economic strategy. Worse, he's doing this in the name of helping workers. Hello! To develop policies beneficial to working stiffs, bring in some working stiffs! But there's not a single labor advocate on his policy council, in his cabinet, or anywhere near his White House. Thus, the so-called "job-creation plan" announced by Trump and his corporate cohorts doesn't create any jobs, but calls instead for de-regulating Wall Street. These flim-flammers actually want us rubes to believe that "freeing" banksters to return to casino-style speculation and consumer scams will give them more money to invest in American jobs. - Advertisement - Do they think we have sucker wrappers around our heads? Trump's scheme will let banks make a killing, but it doesn't require them to invest in jobs -- so they won't. There's a name for this: fraud.   - Advertisement - 2   1   View Ratings | Rate It Jim Hightower is an American populist, spreading his message of democratic hope via national radio commentaries, columns, books, his award-winning monthly newsletter (The Hightower Lowdown) and barnstorming tours all across America.

Union bosses are NOT "workers." Washington, as you know is a very aristocratic, closed society. How many middle class Americans are appointed to anything? Until this changes we will continue the to have a status-quo government which goes nowhere but down.

Now, the woman behind that push is taking aim at another industry known for its male-dominated workplace: The financial sector. Natasha Lamb, managing director of Arjuna Capital, which focuses on sustainable and social impact investing, said she had filed proposals at six financial companies urging them to prepare a report addressing their goals at reducing the gender pay gap and including the percentage gap between the pay of men and women. The banks and credit card firms targeted are Citigroup, Wells Fargo, American Express, MasterCard, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. "It makes no sense to hold America's top tech companies to a high standard on gender pay equity and then pretend that banks should be allowed to discount the issue and operate with no transparency," Lamb said in a conference call with reporters. Lamb said she was going after the major banks in part because financial services is such a male-dominated industry. In the proposal, she cited data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows female financial advisers faced a 61.3 percent pay gap in 2014, the widest of occupations reviewed, as well as a 2016 study from the management consultancy Oliver Wyman showing it will take three decades before women reach 30 percent of the industry's executive committees. Other research cited showed links between risks and rewards for investors in companies that have diverse executive teams. Lamb said she has been in dialogue with all the companies in question, but most of the financial firms have been more opposed to her proposal. "We've seen a night and day difference in the tech and financial worlds," Lamb said. All but one of the six companies have come out against the proposal, Lamb said; she has not gotten an answer from MasterCard. Among the nine tech companies she worked with last year, only three formally opposed the resolutions in their proxies, one of which was eBay, where an unusually high number of shareholders voted in favor of the proposal and the company said it would share its analysis publicly. Of course, the tech companies revealed nearly nonexistent percentage gaps when analyzing people working in similar jobs, which may have made them more willing to share the information. Those numbers also overlook the industry's position gap: Men and women may earn roughly the same in the same jobs, but men are more frequently in higher-paying roles in both of these industries. Meanwhile, four of the banks — Wells Fargo, Bank of America, American Express and Citigroup — defended their numbers of female leaders and their pay practices in lengthy sections of their proxy statements. In them, the companies highlighted a range of internal efforts to prevent bias, improve numbers of women and minorities, use third party consultants to check for pay equity, as well as note recognition they've received for diversity and leadership involvement in diversity programs. As a result, Lamb's proposal was described by the companies as unnecessary. In an emailed statement, Citigroup spokesman Mark Costiglio added that "we have had productive discussions with Arjuna Capital on their proposal and look forward to continued engagement on this issue." JPMorgan has not yet released its proxy, and a spokesman declined to comment, though Lamb said she expects the company to oppose the proposal, pending further dialogue. A spokesman from MasterCard, which also hasn't released its proxy, said in an emailed statement that it would be premature to comment on the resolution but that the company "strive[s] to ensure gender pay parity. We regularly examine pay practices and, at our company, both in the U.S. and globally, men and women in the same level earn equal pay for equal performance."

At present, this is one of the most technologically advanced sectors in the country employing probably the highest number of white-collar professionals. Since the promulgation of Drug Policy in 1982, the sector has grown from strength to strength and today this has emerged as a potential export sector. Thanks to the private sector for its significant investment in building capabilities — both infrastructure and people — to bring this industry to compete in the global marketplace. Bangladeshi medicines are now being exported to more than 100 countries and leading players are also building their presence in the regulated markets of Europe, US and Australia which are known for strict regulation and highest quality standards. In view of its export potential, pharma has been declared as the thrust sector by the government of Bangladesh with an aim to diversify country’s export portfolio and lower its dependence on readymade garment sector. Pharma has received a lot of attentions in recent times for its huge potential to become a major export-oriented sector. Pharma is largely a knowledge-driven and technology-intensive industry and this requires significant investment in R&D compared to other industries. And its success mostly depends on the intellectual capital where special skill-set is required to deal with every stage of operations. The country has highly competitive workforce and cost of production is among the lowest in the world, which allows us to offer medicines at a much affordable cost. Fortunately for Bangladesh, Drug Policy of 1982 created an opportunity for the local industry to flourish and make it self-reliant whereby local companies increased their share of production from 30% in 1970 to almost 90% today, which translates into tremendous amount of foreign currency savings for the country every year. Bangladesh is the only country among all LDC countries, which has a well-developed pharma industry that, over time, could successfully make the transition from being an import dependent to exporting one. Pharma market in Bangladesh is currently valued at more than $2 billion and the industry continues to maintain double-digit growth over the years. Rise in per capita income, increase in government expenditure on health, increasing access to healthcare facilities and modern treatment options continue to drive healthy growth in pharma industry. And this is likely to encourage the companies to invest more in R&D and basic research in the future, which will open up new avenues of growth for the industry. There are about 250 pharmaceutical companies in Bangladesh. According to the Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA), there are about 23,500 brands of drugs being sold covering more than 1,200 generics. Besides conventional products like tablets, capsules and syrups, Bangladesh is also exporting specialized and differentiated products like metered dose inhalers, sterile ophthalmics, nasal sprays, injectables etc., and they are being used in leading hospitals and institutes around the world. The sector has attracted overseas buyers and it has earned good reputation as a quality drug manufacturer. Leading pharma companies have already secured accreditations from major drug regulatory agencies like US FDA, UKMHRA, EMA, TGA, GCC, ANVISA, Health Canada etc. More and more companies are now getting certified in an effort to expand their overseas presence. Recently leading pharma company Beximco Pharma has launched inhaler products in Kuwait and they have a plan to export medicines to other Gulf countries including KSA. Bangladesh also has the advantage under TRIPS waiver, which allows the LDC country to produce any patented drugs and even export to other LDC countries till 2033. We could utilize the benefits through API Technology Park for producing bulk drugs. Bangladesh is producing a number of APIs on a commercial scale, and working on the new and patented drugs, and meeting the growing demand. The industry has also seen rapid progress in developing biosimilar and vaccine capabilities. Local companies have made major investment in this space and human insulins, vaccines and a number of biosimilar products are now being manufactured locally. Bangladesh Pharma Market: • Emerging generic drug hub in the region • Total market size approx. $2 billion (2016) • Historically good growth maintained (c.>10-15% last few years) • Leading contributor to national exchequer • Registered pharmaceutical companies: 250 • All the top 10 companies are local and they have 70% market share • 5 MNCs in top 20 • Leading companies have major regulatory approvals (US FDA, EU GMP, UK MHRA, TGA, GCC, Health Canada, ANVISA etc.) Why Bangladesh? • Fast growing economy with consistent GDP growth over 6%(7.2% in 2016) • 2nd largest apparel exporter in the world • Goldman Sachs has placed Bangladesh in its “Next 11” countries to watch • Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Merrill Lynch consider Bangladesh to be the next Asian success story • Standard Chartered has included Bangladesh in the prestigious “7% Club“ of economies that may grow by 7% or more for an extended period • Bangladesh is included in the “PWC30” list of high growth economies; projected to be 23rd largest economy by 2050 • Bangladesh ranks No. 1 in HSBC’s Global Trade Confidence Index 2015 • Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Moody’s have adjudged Bangladesh economic outlook as ‘stable’ Bangladesh Pharma Advantages • Pharmaceutical remains one of the most technologically advanced sectors in the country. • Availability of skilled manpower at a highly competitive cost; much cheaper than China and India • Medicine price is among the lowest in the world • Leading companies have been already accredited by major global regulatory authorities • Increasing investment in R&D and creating world class infrastructure • Currently exporting to more than 100 countries including USA, EU and Australia • Proven skills with specialized and difficult to copy drug delivery systems (MDI, DPI, Ophthalmics, Injectables, PFS etc.) • Growing capabilities in vaccines and biosimilars with major investment in facilities • Sound track record of partnership with global MNCs • Drugs worth $100 billion going off patent in the next few years which creates opportunities for Bangladesh to supply generic versions • WTO/TRIPS waiver for pharmaceuticals extended till 2033 Bangladesh pharma industry is moving forward and steps are being taken to further improve its competitiveness which includes strengthening of Drug Regulatory Authority, creating special economic zone (SEZ) for pharma, capacity building in IP/regulatory affairs, promoting industry and academia collaboration etc. The opportunities in generic drugs are increasing day by day with increasing government pressures around the world to cut healthcare costs. The country has tremendous opportunities for pharma export, particularly for value added generics in regulated markets. Patented drugs worth $100 billion are going off patent by the next few years, which open up opportunities for generic manufacturers around the world. Bangladesh is ideally positioned to gain from generic drug opportunities with its cost advantages and skilled manpower. There is huge opportunity in contract manufacturing, drug discovery, clinical trial and custom synthesis. Pharmaceutical contract manufacturing is already a $60 billion dollar business and increasing number of MNCs are looking for outsourcing their production from cost effective destinations like India or China. Having considerable cost advantages in manufacturing, Bangladesh is in a position to offer this service to global clients as the country has a sound track record of partnerships with a number of major multinational companies.

Ogg March 25, 2017 10:10 am EDT Print Email Tweet Idera Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: IDRA) is focused on cancer and rare diseases, and it could be a what traders refer to as a three-bagger or four-bagger, if two analysts who made key calls in recent days end up being correct here. As it has a market cap of just about $370 million, investors need to consider that they likely are taking far greater risk in Idera than with established biotech and pharmaceutical companies. Idera’s most recent quarterly announcement of financial results did not seem as full of losses as many other emerging companies. It reported net income of about $800,000 (or $0.01 per share), in part due to a $15 million upfront payment received during the quarter from Vivelix Pharmaceuticals. That was for an outlicensing agreement for TLR 7, 8 and 9 antagonist IMO-9200. Futhermore, Idera ended the most recent quarter with about $109 million in cash and equivalents. Before investors automatically jump on board with the one or two very aggressive analyst calls, some serious considerations and a reality check need to be made. Just because an analyst says that a stock is cheap, has incredible value or is going to see its stock surge. it does not mean that it is an assured outcome. Many analysts sometimes have wrong assumptions. Sometimes their firms may be involved in or seek to be involved in helping these companies raise money. And sometimes there are just unforeseen events inside of a company or an industry (or even the market) that just wreck an upside thesis. Now that you have been warned that Idera’s exponential upside is not an assured outcome, here are some of the calls that drove more interest of late. For the most aggressive analyst call: Idera was started as Market Outperform with an $8 price target at JMP Securities on March 22. This compared with a $2.09 prior closing price. Idera’s shares were indicated up about 20% at $2.50 on Wednesday morning when the call was made. JMP’s Michael King noted that Idera recently has made a strategic pivot into immuno-oncology with its lead IO asset, IMO-2125. He noted that it has exhibited impressive clinical activity in combination with checkpoint inhibition in the setting of anti-PD-1 refractory metastatic melanoma. His note said: We view Idera as a leading oligonucleotide discovery and development company with the capacity for generating novel product candidates using its innovative third-generation antisense and toll-like receptor technology platforms. A company characterized by its strong scientific underpinning, Idera counts as its founding scientist Dr. Sudhir Agrawal, a recognized pioneer in the field of nucleic acid therapeutics. Idera Pharmaceuticals was reiterated as Outperform with a $6 price target at Wedbush Securities back on March 17. The firm’s Robert Driscoll believes that the durable responses in the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of IMO-2125 in PD-1 refractory melanoma patients support Idera’s aggressive development strategy. The firm sees IMO-2125’s MOA and safety profile being well-suited for combination studies, and the firm also sees potential for partnerships around this program. The Wedbush target of $6 was based on a sum-of-the-parts analysis of projected peak revenues for IMO-8400 in dermatomyositis, and IMO-2125 in refractory melanoma, discounted by 40% and 30%, respectively. For a more “conservative” view of Idera: JPMorgan issued a report in March that was still with an Outperform rating. That being said, the firm withdrew an end-of-2017 target of $5 per share and now calculates a fair value range of $3.50 to $4.00 per share. Also in mid-March, after earnings, Piper Jaffray’s Edward Tentoff reiterated his Overweight rating and $4 price target. On Friday, March 24, shares of Idera Pharma closed up 2.5% at $2.48 on Friday, in a 52-week trading range of $1.19 to $3.33. Its market cap was last seen at over $369 million, and its consensus analyst price target from Thomson Reuters was listed as $5.00. Friday’s trading volume of more than 3.1 million shares was also more than double a normal day’s volume. According to Nasdaq, Idera’s short interest at the middle of March was 8.5 million shares.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, Mar 26, 2017 - Page 14　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Most Asian shares gain, despite Wall Street losses Bloomberg and Reuters Asian equities on Friday rose for the 10th time in 11 days, shrugging off US declines as the yen snapped an eight-day streak of gains. Banking and consumer stocks led the advance as earnings season continued in Hong Kong. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.3 percent to 148.11, extending a rebound that has retraced about half of Wednesday’s 1.3 percent loss. The index is slightly down from last week’s 148.31. Shares in Taiwan fell after moving in a narrow band throughout the trading session amid concerns over stiff technical resistance ahead of the 10,000 point mark, dealers said. The weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange closed down 27.76 points, or 0.3 percent, at 9,902.98. The index is down 0.06 percent from last week’s 9,908.69 points. Japan’s TOPIX and Australia’s benchmark gauge on Friday added 0.8 percent each, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 0.1 percent. Most sectors in Hong Kong lost ground, with resource stocks leading the declines. Shares in China Huishan Dairy Holdings (中國輝山乳業) plunged 85 percent before trade was halted. It was not immediately clear what triggered the slide. In December last year, US-based short-seller Muddy Waters questioned the firm’s profits and said it had inflated spending on its cattle farms to artificially raise capital expenditure figures. CNOOC Ltd (中國海洋石油) jumped 3.9 percent in Hong Kong as the oil giant gave more information on its reserve base and announced a higher-than-expected dividend. The stock was upgraded at CICC, Macquarie and JPMorgan. In Tokyo, Fukuoka Financial Group Inc rose 1.2 percent as analysts upgraded the stock following a writedown of goodwill. Toshiba Corp jumped 7.6 percent after a hedge fund became the embattled conglomerate’s biggest shareholder. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slipped 0.1 percent while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.9 percent while South Korea’s KOSPI lost 0.2 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index added 0.5 percent. FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI was little changed and the Jakarta Composite Index lost 0.2 percent, while the Philippine Stock Exchange Index retreated 0.4 percent.

The company — known as Saudi Aramco — is talking to banks for a role as financial adviser to review potential listing destinations and prepare the company for the float, the people said, asking not to be identified as the talks are private. Banks that do well in that role will then be considered for subsequent stages including underwriting, the people said. Saudi Aramco may re-tender the work if they’re unhappy with a bank’s performance, they said. No final decisions have been made on the advisory roles, though Saudi Aramco is expected to mandate banks in coming days, the people said. Saudi Aramco asked banks including Goldman Sachs Group and HSBC Holdings to pitch for the advisory role on the IPO, people familiar with the matter said in January. Credit Suisse Group, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase were also invited, the people said. Evercore Partners has already been hired to work alongside rival Moelis as a financial adviser on the listing, people familiar with the matter said earlier this month. Once banks are mandated for an IPO they typically continue working on it until the point a company lists, though staggered mandates could incentivise the banks as they compete for coveted roles. When Chinese Internet retailer Alibaba Group Holding sold shares in 2014, it awarded about 17 per cent of the deal’s $300 million in fees to banks based on performance, people familiar said at the time. Its sale is the largest ever, raising $25 billion. Saudi Arabia plans to sell less than 5 percent of the company as part of plans by the kingdom to set up the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund and reduce the economy’s reliance on hydrocarbons. The kingdom estimates the company could be valued at about $2 trillion, with the share sale expected to dwarf Alibaba’s. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Trumping Trump and Howling at the Moonves Friday, March 24, 2017 By JP Sottile, Consortium News | News Analysis font size decrease font size increase font size Print Tweet Les Moonves cannot lose … and he knows it. The all-too-well compensated CEO of CBS said as much back in late February of 2016. The Bataan Death March of presidential campaigns had finally kicked into high gear and a month-long barrage of primaries, caucuses and televised debates portended just the sort of never-ending story-line that makes a media mogul's dreams come true. The man at the center of that long, pitched battle for the hearts and mindlessness of the American people was none other than future Reality-Star-in-Chief and all-around good for business-man President Donald J. Trump. His starring role in the daily melodrama also known as "The race for the White House" had Les leaping over the moon with financial excitement. Moonves was so effusive that, in a fit of gleeful honesty, the titular head of America's number one network told the denizens of a Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference in San Francisco that Trump's candidacy "may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS." At the time, Moonves was just pondering all the advertising dollars that would inevitably pile up on the way to a profitable political train-wreck. And Les was right. Train-wrecks may make for bad politics and even worse policy, but boy-oh-boy … do they ever make for great television! In fact, televising train-wrecks, car crashes or any kind of contentious conflict is a sure-fire way to goad world-weary audiences into rubbernecking. In this age of low-overhead/high-drama reality programming, it's also the cheapest and easiest way to pile up cash on a corporate media balance sheet. And no doubt, Moonves could see early on that Trump would pile it higher and deeper than anyone who'd come before him. As the Hollywood Reporter detailed, Les wanted a lot more. He hoped the "circus" full of "bomb throwing" would continue all the way through the campaign. And why not? In 2012, the Obama vs. Romney match-up generated nearly $900 million on television ads. With the Clintons' infamous fundraising machine kicking into high gear and a billionaire businessman crashing the other party, Les was understandably forecasting a contest that would make it rain like never before. As Moonves noted, "The money's rolling in and this is fun." He went on to say, "I've never seen anything like this, and this going to be a very good year for us. Sorry. It's a terrible thing to say. But, bring it on, Donald. Keep going." That's exactly what Donald did. He kept it going all the way to the White House. And the ever-prescient Moonves -- who retroactively dismissed his gleeful honesty as a "joke" shortly after video emerged of Trump touting his penchant for grabbing a woman's genitals -- would not be disappointed by the reality star's hit political psychodrama. But really, Les was only halfway right. Although Trump's GOP opponents would spend millions on their way to ignominious defeat, Les hadn't foreseen the bigger picture that came into focus when Trump squared off with Hillary. Ironically, Les and the media he so fully embodies were about to be recast in a whole new reality show. Reality Bites What Les didn't yet know back in February of 2016 was that the profligate trend-line of recent campaigns was about to be broken. Political ad spending would not be the full story … or even the main story … of 2016. Actually, combined spending by the two campaigns was down. According to a post-mortem by Reuters, Trump dished out a mere "$107 million on advertising, including television ads." A report by analytics firm Borrell Associates found that the overall Trump campaign "spent around 34% less" than Mitt Romney did in 2012. That year, Romney dropped a cool $1 billion, which nearly matched the $1.1 billion spent by President Barack Obama. But in 2016, Trump and pro-Trump groups raised about $600 million and he was almost as likely to use that money to reimburse his own companies as he was to buy advertising. Although Hillary Clinton spent nearly as much as the Obama campaign did in 2012, many broadcasters found that early predictions of "the most expensive race ever" kinda fell flat. And that drop -- which has been attributed in no small part to Trump's "unconventional campaign" -- turned into a significant financial pinch for smaller networks of local stations that rely on revenue from political ads every two and four years. The bottom line is that the well-heeled half of the Two-Party system simply didn't deliver't deliver on broadcasters' champagne wishes or their caviar dreams. On the other hand, analytics firm mediaQuaint found that Trump scored a staggering $4.96 billion worth of "free" media. That's all the non-stop coverage, the constant kibitzing of the blatherati, the hours upon hours of live rallies, the one-on-one interviews, the Sunday show call-ins and everything else that transformed the campaign into a 24-hour version of TrumpTV. Hillary Clinton got her share of freebies, too. But her $3.24 billion worth of gifted gab could not compete with the trump card Donald played in the middle of nearly every news cycle. Trump's tendentiousness, his relentless tweeting and his campaign's increasingly pugilistic attitude toward the press recast the contest. Throughout a nearly 18 month-long process, the media and Trump switched back and forth between playing the role of bête noir and conquering hero. It was pure television gold that literally programmed itself. And that's where Trump truly flipped the script … not just on the political establishment, but on the way the media would interact with and cover both his campaign and, sadly, cover his nascent presidency. Flipping Out Until the 2016 election, the media business (local stations, regional networks, medium-sized station groups, cable news channels and the big four broadcasters) reliably reaped a bi-annual windfall from the hundreds of millions of dollars in political advertising they packed into the commercial breaks in-between their programming. The two-year election cycle was good. The presidential cycle was way better. But Trump changed the paradigm. This time, the coverage became the political commercial and the political commercial became the programming. Simply put, Trump's bloviating, bombastic style translated into ratings. And those ratings translated into dollars that could be earned by charging more for the ads in-between the coverage. So, while Hillary and anti-Trump groups were flooding the commercial breaks with hundreds of millions of dollars in ad buys, Trump's freebie coverage was raising the price of all advertising by keeping eyeballs glued to the boob tube. Perhaps even more importantly, the same free media that both served Trump's political campaign and, thanks to his power to hold audiences, the value of ad time … also essentially rescued the cable news industry's flaccid business model. Quite frankly, the cable news business was on the rocks before Trump. But Pew Research noted that 2015 (the start of Trump's long march) was the first time the industry saw primetime viewer growth after three years of decline. Daytime viewership grew, too.  Pew also found that ad revenue grew a bit for the major networks, but cable news saw a much-needed 10 percent increase in both ad and subscriber revenue. So, just imagine the revenue that poured in during 2016 when FOX News topped ESPN as the most watched basic cable network. The Trump effect produced a 36 percent spike that gave FOX News an "average of 2,475,000 viewers in primetime." It also sparked CNN's 77 percent rise in viewership (from 732,000 to 1,298,000) and MSNBC's audience grew by 87% (from 596,000 to 1,113,000)," according to year-end numbers reported by IndieWire. Amazingly enough, CNN didn't even rank in the top ten of all cable networks in 2015. But thanks to Trump's eye-grabbing impact, CNN went from the 24th to the 10th most-viewed network and MSNBC went from 29th to 12th on Deadline's cable ranking list. And all of those numbers can ultimately be attributed to Trump. He turned boring political coverage into an egg-laying golden goose. And the unctuous media's substantial investment in "free" time paid some big dividends. As Adweek reported, "the election resulted in big ad revenue bumps" with CNN notching a 57.8 percent jump, MSBNC an increase of 47.9 percent and Fox News bringing up the rear with a respectable 25.7 percent rise in ad income. Overall, political advertising in 2016 reached a record high of $9.8 billion spent on everything from local races for dog catcher all the way up to the Presidency. It was a respectable rise of 4.6 percent from 2012, but rise in digital media spending meant "broadcast television turned out to be the big loser of the cycle," according to Mashable. Broadcasting's "commanding 58-percent market share in 2012" slipped by 13 percentage points in 2016. And in spite of Moonves's early optimism, CBS saw a 6 percent drop in viewership. Still, they led all comers with an average 8.8 million viewers. Yet, for some reason Les is still bullish on Trump. Why? Well, Moonves once again let the proverbial cat out of his cash-filled bag. And he did it at yet another bank-hosted media confab. This time, Les opined at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet and Telecom Conference. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Moonves is comforted by strong advertising and a strong balance sheet, but it's Trump's presidency that has him thinking even bigger.  At a conference ironically hosted by one of Trump's biggest creditors, Moonves "signaled his approval of the Trump administration's deregulatory agenda, which could allow the network to buy up more TV stations and get more revenue from retransmission consent fees." That's right. The guy at the center of the monomaniacal coverage Moonves touted during the campaign is the selfsame guy Moonves is now banking on to deliver yet more media deregulation. If nothing else, it is newsworthy to note that more media deregulation is even possible after the one-two punch delivered by Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Apparently, there is still more to monopolize, which is why Les is willing to put aside Trump's supposed war with the media to make peace with Trump's deconstructive agenda. As he said, "Obviously, there is a lot of information coming out of Washington and although we are not the enemy of the people, we welcome the deregulations that are going on there." So Les's golden opportunism -- which got him into a bit of hot water after his "bad for America means good for CBS" quip -- is about to pay even more dividends. And that's despite the fact that more isn't exactly what Les … or the media … really needs. Bark at the Moonves Moonves was recently named "the most overpaid CEO on the S&P 500"… and for good reason. As the head of CBS, Moonves enjoys one of corporate America's best compensation packages. According to the last SEC filing, CBS lavished Les with a staggering pay package totaling $56.8 million for the 2015. That was actually down a little bit from 2014. As Variety duly noted, that year he brought home a cool "$57.2 million, including a $25 million bonus and $25 million in stock awards and options." By comparison, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase garnered a "paltry" $27 million for 2015 … and, as the New York Times explained, that was a 35 percent increase over the previous year's sum. Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs came in just below Dimon with $23 million in 2015. And then there's Bank of America CEO Brian T. Moynihan. He "earned" $16 million for his role atop one of the nation's biggest banks. Sure, that's a lot of coin for running a bank. But it doesn't quite compare to Moonves or the pharaoh-like compensation packages given to the small group of people who sit atop the media pyramid. Deadline noted that in 2015, the top seven "chiefs collectively made $283.8 million" and they followed Moonves all the way to the bank. Here they are in descending order: Philippe Dauman of Viacom ($54.2 million), Bob Iger of Disney ($44.9 million), Brian Roberts of Comcast ($36.2 million), David Zaslav of Discovery Communications ($32.4 million), Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, ($31.5 million) and last, but in many ways the least of all, Rupert Murdoch of Fox ($27.9 million). So, the takeaway here is that the lowest paid of the top media dogs (Murdoch) actually made more than one of banking's biggest wigs (Dimon). In other words, the banksters who are so widely regarded as the poster boys for America's ever-widening wealth and income gaps actually pale in comparison to the television titans who lord over the vast majority of the Fourth Estate. But that's not the whole picture. Some of the "news" media's biggest on-air talents garner salaries that approach the territory of the banksters so many Americans love to hate. Business Insider tallied the totals and Matt Lauer of NBC makes $20 million, Bill O'Reilly of FOX News makes $18 million to $20 million, Shepard Smith pulls $10 million, boyish George Stephanopoulos tallies $10 million, Anderson Cooper "earns" somewhere between $9 million to $11 million and former Fox star and Trump antagonist Megyn Kelly is going to take home between $15 million and $20 million from her new gig with NBC, according to The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. So, what does any of this have to do with the price of tea in China? It's a good question. The problem is that we'll never find out the price of tea in China … or anything else, for that matter … by turning on what now passes for "the news" on television. That's because the television news media -- which has long since seen its coverage whittled down as investigative units were culled, international bureaus where shuttered and even regional bureaus were amalgamated into ever-more sparsely populated offices housed in four or five of the biggest media markets -- just got it's great programming chief of all time. They essentially "hired" President Donald J. Trump to run their shops. Just think of the $4.96 billion in free media that helped Trump get elected as an industry-wide investment in a four-year long reality show. It was non-stop Trump during the campaign. It was non-stop Trump during the transition. It's been non-stop Trump since the inauguration. And the permanent campaign Steve "Apocalypse Soon" Bannon obviously wants to run is made sustainable by the self-reinforcing feedback loop Trump and the media first created during the campaign. Basically, the permanent campaign is here and it is far too juicy of a role for the media to turn it down. Television News Made Easy Remember when Trump was down in the polls and speculation about his post-election play had him starting his own network? The popular rumor was that he was positioning himself to start a venture with former FOX News Svengali and fellow sexual predator Roger Ailes. Oddly enough, Trump didn't lose nor did he have to start his own network. Instead, he just took over the entire news media by lassoing them into the ultimate feedback loop. We know that Trump is a voracious consumer of the media. And we know that Trump's number one priority is to see himself being covered by the media. He's also a disciple of professional wrestling. And as a reality showman, he knows exactly how to drum up ratings and interest with conflict. Remember the rubbernecking power of train-wrecks that had Moonves so happy during the campaign? Well, Trump has slammed that train into the White House. He's made the media his villain and since they oblige by covering him at nearly the exclusion of all else, Trump keeps on having good reasons to respond to the media's relentless coverage. And then they lavish coverage on his response to their coverage … and so the next cycle begins. Basically, the news cycle gets a ready-made story each time he peddles his irresistible brand of reality showmanship. In other words, Trump isn't just good for ratings … he's television news made easy. He makes morning editorial meetings easy. He makes allocating resources -- like reporters and camera crews and field producers -- easy. Sometimes he even gets up in the wee hours to tweet out the forthcoming day's agenda. And he doesn't just like to talk, but he almost always says something. Heck, he'll literally say anything. Each of the somethings and anythings he says are instantly news, even if they eventually turn out to be nothing. In fact, if something turns out to be nothing … that's almost the biggest news of all. And Trump's willingness to turning the news into a dumpster fire also makes life atop a television network very, very easy. Whether you run a cable news channel or one of the big four behemoths, Trump has injected a level of cost certainty into the surprisingly profitable news business. They know exactly what the primary focus of their incessant coverage will be … so long as Trump keeps on shuttling between the White House and his golf course at Mar-a-Lago. So long as Sean Spicer takes the podium. So long as Congress has to respond to the latest dust-up. Whatever comes up inside the bubble, they've got it covered. They've got the infrastructure in place. Their DC bureaus are, unlike almost everywhere else in America and the world, well-stocked with producers, reporters, photographers and editors. And New York can still be the center of their universe … one that turns on the axis of the Acela corridor. Opportunity Costs With TrumpTV pre-programming almost every single minute of every day's coverage, there's no need to worry about sending reporters around the world or around America to cover expensive stories that require hiring people and buying satellite time and booking travel and paying for insurance. There's no need to go to Afghanistan to report on America's longest war (newsflash for the media: It's still going). There's no need to go to Yemen to chronicle America's escalating involvement. No need to trace the impact of bombs that America sold the Saudis that the Saudis, in turn, dropped on a funeral. Let the BBC do that. They've got reporters who do that sorta thing, anyway. And why bother following-up on the story of the women and children who saw other women and children killed in Trump's first military misadventure? Why go there … when they've got Trump right here, right now. And why send a reporter to Baghdad when she can just go check Twitter? Instead, they can ignore the crisis at Fukushima. They can ignore the tragic plight of the Rohingya who are being brutally "ethnically cleansed" by Chevron's partners in the government of Myanmar. They can ignore a looming famine around the Horn of Africa. They can ignore the cycle of massacre and exhumation that bedevils the Mexican people just across the border. And they can incessantly talk about Russia without ever spending a dime to send reporters to Moscow or St. Petersburg or Crimea to actually do some actual interviews with actual Russians and find out what it is actually like to live in Putin's Russia. Instead, the media has turned over the programming of news to Trump. It's just too cheap and too easy. That's why Fox Business channel basically converted to TrumpTV. Why not? Business news is probably all about the "Trump Rally" or his faux jobs deals, anyway. And despite a recent suggestion by NBC's Chuck Todd that his network reopen a bureau in Denver so they might better cover those parts of America outside the Acela Corridor, the media has a huge financial incentive to stay in TrumpTV's low overhead lane. But what if NBC heeded Chuck's call and took $5 million off Matt Lauer's salary and $5 million of Megyn Kelly's salary and hired ten reporters to crisscross America in search of stories that have nothing to do with Trump? Or what if they spent the combined ten million bucks to produce daily reports from one of America's wars? Does anyone think any of those high-priced on-air presenters would walk away from television if they only made $5 million per year? Or $2 million per year? And what if Les Moonves could get by on $25 million per year? Heck, the extra $31.8 million bucks could probably open ten new bureaus here and around the world. And how many reporters, producers and camera crews could be deployed with just half of the $283.8 million made by the top seven media moguls? Alas, unlike the Moonves' dream of a perpetually contentious campaign, that just ain't gonna happen. Not when the real masters of the universe -- the obscenely compensated captains of the media industry -- can get it coming and going. To wit, the Hollywood Reporter noted, "Moonves … said Trump's ubiquity during his early days in the White House was giving a ratings bump to late night CBS shows like Stephen Colbert's Late Show." Yup, not only is TrumpTV programming the news division, but it's also helping stoke the entertainment division. Les went on to say without a hint of irony, "Obviously Stephen is a big social commentator and the things that are going on in the country with the president … people want to see social commentary, they don't want to see fun and games." And maybe that's all the people can expect -- a little biting social commentary to help us laugh at the absurdity they've helped create. The people certainly shouldn't expect Les or his profiteering peers to invest much in actual news … not when the fun and games of TrumpTV means everyone in the media can be a winner no matter the outcome of Trump's presidency. Really, if the bottom line is their only bottom line … they literally cannot lose. This piece was reprinted by Truthout with permission or license.

With the Clintons' infamous fundraising machine kicking into high gear and a billionaire businessman crashing the other party, Les was understandably forecasting a contest that would make it rain like never before. As Moonves noted, "The money's rolling in and this is fun." He went on to say, "I've never seen anything like this, and this going to be a very good year for us. Sorry. It's a terrible thing to say. But, bring it on, Donald. Keep going." That's exactly what Donald did. He kept it going all the way to the White House. And the ever-prescient Moonves -- who retroactively dismissed his gleeful honesty as a "joke" shortly after video emerged of Trump touting his penchant for grabbing a woman's genitals -- would not be disappointed by the reality star's hit political psychodrama. But really, Les was only halfway right. Although Trump's GOP opponents would spend millions on their way to ignominious defeat, Les hadn't foreseen the bigger picture that came into focus when Trump squared off with Hillary. Ironically, Les and the media he so fully embodies were about to be recast in a whole new reality show. Reality Bites What Les didn't yet know back in February of 2016 was that the profligate trend-line of recent campaigns was about to be broken. Political ad spending would not be the full story … or even the main story … of 2016. Actually, combined spending by the two campaigns was down. According to a post-mortem by Reuters, Trump dished out a mere "$107 million on advertising, including television ads." A report by analytics firm Borrell Associates found that the overall Trump campaign "spent around 34% less" than Mitt Romney did in 2012. That year, Romney dropped a cool $1 billion, which nearly matched the $1.1 billion spent by President Barack Obama. But in 2016, Trump and pro-Trump groups raised about $600 million and he was almost as likely to use that money to reimburse his own companies as he was to buy advertising. Although Hillary Clinton spent nearly as much as the Obama campaign did in 2012, many broadcasters found that early predictions of "the most expensive race ever" kinda fell flat. And that drop -- which has been attributed in no small part to Trump's "unconventional campaign" -- turned into a significant financial pinch for smaller networks of local stations that rely on revenue from political ads every two and four years. The bottom line is that the well-heeled half of the Two-Party system simply didn't deliver't deliver on broadcasters' champagne wishes or their caviar dreams. On the other hand, analytics firm mediaQuaint found that Trump scored a staggering $4.96 billion worth of "free" media. That's all the non-stop coverage, the constant kibitzing of the blatherati, the hours upon hours of live rallies, the one-on-one interviews, the Sunday show call-ins and everything else that transformed the campaign into a 24-hour version of TrumpTV. Hillary Clinton got her share of freebies, too. But her $3.24 billion worth of gifted gab could not compete with the trump card Donald played in the middle of nearly every news cycle. Trump's tendentiousness, his relentless tweeting and his campaign's increasingly pugilistic attitude toward the press recast the contest. Throughout a nearly 18 month-long process, the media and Trump switched back and forth between playing the role of bête noir and conquering hero. It was pure television gold that literally programmed itself. And that's where Trump truly flipped the script … not just on the political establishment, but on the way the media would interact with and cover both his campaign and, sadly, cover his nascent presidency. Flipping Out Until the 2016 election, the media business (local stations, regional networks, medium-sized station groups, cable news channels and the big four broadcasters) reliably reaped a bi-annual windfall from the hundreds of millions of dollars in political advertising they packed into the commercial breaks in-between their programming. The two-year election cycle was good. The presidential cycle was way better. But Trump changed the paradigm. This time, the coverage became the political commercial and the political commercial became the programming. Simply put, Trump's bloviating, bombastic style translated into ratings. And those ratings translated into dollars that could be earned by charging more for the ads in-between the coverage. So, while Hillary and anti-Trump groups were flooding the commercial breaks with hundreds of millions of dollars in ad buys, Trump's freebie coverage was raising the price of all advertising by keeping eyeballs glued to the boob tube. Perhaps even more importantly, the same free media that both served Trump's political campaign and, thanks to his power to hold audiences, the value of ad time … also essentially rescued the cable news industry's flaccid business model. Quite frankly, the cable news business was on the rocks before Trump. But Pew Research noted that 2015 (the start of Trump's long march) was the first time the industry saw primetime viewer growth after three years of decline. Daytime viewership grew, too.  Pew also found that ad revenue grew a bit for the major networks, but cable news saw a much-needed 10 percent increase in both ad and subscriber revenue. So, just imagine the revenue that poured in during 2016 when FOX News topped ESPN as the most watched basic cable network. The Trump effect produced a 36 percent spike that gave FOX News an "average of 2,475,000 viewers in primetime." It also sparked CNN's 77 percent rise in viewership (from 732,000 to 1,298,000) and MSNBC's audience grew by 87% (from 596,000 to 1,113,000)," according to year-end numbers reported by IndieWire. Amazingly enough, CNN didn't even rank in the top ten of all cable networks in 2015. But thanks to Trump's eye-grabbing impact, CNN went from the 24th to the 10th most-viewed network and MSNBC went from 29th to 12th on Deadline's cable ranking list. And all of those numbers can ultimately be attributed to Trump. He turned boring political coverage into an egg-laying golden goose. And the unctuous media's substantial investment in "free" time paid some big dividends. As Adweek reported, "the election resulted in big ad revenue bumps" with CNN notching a 57.8 percent jump, MSBNC an increase of 47.9 percent and Fox News bringing up the rear with a respectable 25.7 percent rise in ad income. Overall, political advertising in 2016 reached a record high of $9.8 billion spent on everything from local races for dog catcher all the way up to the Presidency. It was a respectable rise of 4.6 percent from 2012, but rise in digital media spending meant "broadcast television turned out to be the big loser of the cycle," according to Mashable. Broadcasting's "commanding 58-percent market share in 2012" slipped by 13 percentage points in 2016. And in spite of Moonves's early optimism, CBS saw a 6 percent drop in viewership. Still, they led all comers with an average 8.8 million viewers. Yet, for some reason Les is still bullish on Trump. Why? Well, Moonves once again let the proverbial cat out of his cash-filled bag. And he did it at yet another bank-hosted media confab. This time, Les opined at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet and Telecom Conference. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Moonves is comforted by strong advertising and a strong balance sheet, but it's Trump's presidency that has him thinking even bigger.  At a conference ironically hosted by one of Trump's biggest creditors, Moonves "signaled his approval of the Trump administration's deregulatory agenda, which could allow the network to buy up more TV stations and get more revenue from retransmission consent fees." That's right. The guy at the center of the monomaniacal coverage Moonves touted during the campaign is the selfsame guy Moonves is now banking on to deliver yet more media deregulation. If nothing else, it is newsworthy to note that more media deregulation is even possible after the one-two punch delivered by Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Apparently, there is still more to monopolize, which is why Les is willing to put aside Trump's supposed war with the media to make peace with Trump's deconstructive agenda. As he said, "Obviously, there is a lot of information coming out of Washington and although we are not the enemy of the people, we welcome the deregulations that are going on there." So Les's golden opportunism -- which got him into a bit of hot water after his "bad for America means good for CBS" quip -- is about to pay even more dividends. And that's despite the fact that more isn't exactly what Les … or the media … really needs. Bark at the Moonves Moonves was recently named "the most overpaid CEO on the S&P 500"… and for good reason. As the head of CBS, Moonves enjoys one of corporate America's best compensation packages. According to the last SEC filing, CBS lavished Les with a staggering pay package totaling $56.8 million for the 2015. That was actually down a little bit from 2014. As Variety duly noted, that year he brought home a cool "$57.2 million, including a $25 million bonus and $25 million in stock awards and options." By comparison, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase garnered a "paltry" $27 million for 2015 … and, as the New York Times explained, that was a 35 percent increase over the previous year's sum. Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs came in just below Dimon with $23 million in 2015. And then there's Bank of America CEO Brian T. Moynihan. He "earned" $16 million for his role atop one of the nation's biggest banks. Sure, that's a lot of coin for running a bank. But it doesn't quite compare to Moonves or the pharaoh-like compensation packages given to the small group of people who sit atop the media pyramid. Deadline noted that in 2015, the top seven "chiefs collectively made $283.8 million" and they followed Moonves all the way to the bank. Here they are in descending order: Philippe Dauman of Viacom ($54.2 million), Bob Iger of Disney ($44.9 million), Brian Roberts of Comcast ($36.2 million), David Zaslav of Discovery Communications ($32.4 million), Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, ($31.5 million) and last, but in many ways the least of all, Rupert Murdoch of Fox ($27.9 million). So, the takeaway here is that the lowest paid of the top media dogs (Murdoch) actually made more than one of banking's biggest wigs (Dimon). In other words, the banksters who are so widely regarded as the poster boys for America's ever-widening wealth and income gaps actually pale in comparison to the television titans who lord over the vast majority of the Fourth Estate. But that's not the whole picture. Some of the "news" media's biggest on-air talents garner salaries that approach the territory of the banksters so many Americans love to hate. Business Insider tallied the totals and Matt Lauer of NBC makes $20 million, Bill O'Reilly of FOX News makes $18 million to $20 million, Shepard Smith pulls $10 million, boyish George Stephanopoulos tallies $10 million, Anderson Cooper "earns" somewhere between $9 million to $11 million and former Fox star and Trump antagonist Megyn Kelly is going to take home between $15 million and $20 million from her new gig with NBC, according to The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. So, what does any of this have to do with the price of tea in China? It's a good question. The problem is that we'll never find out the price of tea in China … or anything else, for that matter … by turning on what now passes for "the news" on television. That's because the television news media -- which has long since seen its coverage whittled down as investigative units were culled, international bureaus where shuttered and even regional bureaus were amalgamated into ever-more sparsely populated offices housed in four or five of the biggest media markets -- just got it's great programming chief of all time. They essentially "hired" President Donald J. Trump to run their shops. Just think of the $4.96 billion in free media that helped Trump get elected as an industry-wide investment in a four-year long reality show. It was non-stop Trump during the campaign. It was non-stop Trump during the transition. It's been non-stop Trump since the inauguration. And the permanent campaign Steve "Apocalypse Soon" Bannon obviously wants to run is made sustainable by the self-reinforcing feedback loop Trump and the media first created during the campaign. Basically, the permanent campaign is here and it is far too juicy of a role for the media to turn it down. Television News Made Easy Remember when Trump was down in the polls and speculation about his post-election play had him starting his own network? The popular rumor was that he was positioning himself to start a venture with former FOX News Svengali and fellow sexual predator Roger Ailes. Oddly enough, Trump didn't lose nor did he have to start his own network. Instead, he just took over the entire news media by lassoing them into the ultimate feedback loop. We know that Trump is a voracious consumer of the media. And we know that Trump's number one priority is to see himself being covered by the media. He's also a disciple of professional wrestling. And as a reality showman, he knows exactly how to drum up ratings and interest with conflict. Remember the rubbernecking power of train-wrecks that had Moonves so happy during the campaign? Well, Trump has slammed that train into the White House. He's made the media his villain and since they oblige by covering him at nearly the exclusion of all else, Trump keeps on having good reasons to respond to the media's relentless coverage. And then they lavish coverage on his response to their coverage … and so the next cycle begins. Basically, the news cycle gets a ready-made story each time he peddles his irresistible brand of reality showmanship. In other words, Trump isn't just good for ratings … he's television news made easy. He makes morning editorial meetings easy. He makes allocating resources -- like reporters and camera crews and field producers -- easy. Sometimes he even gets up in the wee hours to tweet out the forthcoming day's agenda. And he doesn't just like to talk, but he almost always says something. Heck, he'll literally say anything. Each of the somethings and anythings he says are instantly news, even if they eventually turn out to be nothing. In fact, if something turns out to be nothing … that's almost the biggest news of all. And Trump's willingness to turning the news into a dumpster fire also makes life atop a television network very, very easy. Whether you run a cable news channel or one of the big four behemoths, Trump has injected a level of cost certainty into the surprisingly profitable news business. They know exactly what the primary focus of their incessant coverage will be … so long as Trump keeps on shuttling between the White House and his golf course at Mar-a-Lago. So long as Sean Spicer takes the podium. So long as Congress has to respond to the latest dust-up. Whatever comes up inside the bubble, they've got it covered. They've got the infrastructure in place. Their DC bureaus are, unlike almost everywhere else in America and the world, well-stocked with producers, reporters, photographers and editors. And New York can still be the center of their universe … one that turns on the axis of the Acela corridor. Opportunity Costs With TrumpTV pre-programming almost every single minute of every day's coverage, there's no need to worry about sending reporters around the world or around America to cover expensive stories that require hiring people and buying satellite time and booking travel and paying for insurance. There's no need to go to Afghanistan to report on America's longest war (newsflash for the media: It's still going). There's no need to go to Yemen to chronicle America's escalating involvement. No need to trace the impact of bombs that America sold the Saudis that the Saudis, in turn, dropped on a funeral. Let the BBC do that. They've got reporters who do that sorta thing, anyway. And why bother following-up on the story of the women and children who saw other women and children killed in Trump's first military misadventure? Why go there … when they've got Trump right here, right now. And why send a reporter to Baghdad when she can just go check Twitter? Instead, they can ignore the crisis at Fukushima. They can ignore the tragic plight of the Rohingya who are being brutally "ethnically cleansed" by Chevron's partners in the government of Myanmar. They can ignore a looming famine around the Horn of Africa. They can ignore the cycle of massacre and exhumation that bedevils the Mexican people just across the border. And they can incessantly talk about Russia without ever spending a dime to send reporters to Moscow or St. Petersburg or Crimea to actually do some actual interviews with actual Russians and find out what it is actually like to live in Putin's Russia. Instead, the media has turned over the programming of news to Trump. It's just too cheap and too easy. That's why Fox Business channel basically converted to TrumpTV. Why not? Business news is probably all about the "Trump Rally" or his faux jobs deals, anyway. And despite a recent suggestion by NBC's Chuck Todd that his network reopen a bureau in Denver so they might better cover those parts of America outside the Acela Corridor, the media has a huge financial incentive to stay in TrumpTV's low overhead lane. But what if NBC heeded Chuck's call and took $5 million off Matt Lauer's salary and $5 million of Megyn Kelly's salary and hired ten reporters to crisscross America in search of stories that have nothing to do with Trump? Or what if they spent the combined ten million bucks to produce daily reports from one of America's wars? Does anyone think any of those high-priced on-air presenters would walk away from television if they only made $5 million per year? Or $2 million per year? And what if Les Moonves could get by on $25 million per year? Heck, the extra $31.8 million bucks could probably open ten new bureaus here and around the world. And how many reporters, producers and camera crews could be deployed with just half of the $283.8 million made by the top seven media moguls? Alas, unlike the Moonves' dream of a perpetually contentious campaign, that just ain't gonna happen. Not when the real masters of the universe -- the obscenely compensated captains of the media industry -- can get it coming and going. To wit, the Hollywood Reporter noted, "Moonves … said Trump's ubiquity during his early days in the White House was giving a ratings bump to late night CBS shows like Stephen Colbert's Late Show." Yup, not only is TrumpTV programming the news division, but it's also helping stoke the entertainment division. Les went on to say without a hint of irony, "Obviously Stephen is a big social commentator and the things that are going on in the country with the president … people want to see social commentary, they don't want to see fun and games." And maybe that's all the people can expect -- a little biting social commentary to help us laugh at the absurdity they've helped create. The people certainly shouldn't expect Les or his profiteering peers to invest much in actual news … not when the fun and games of TrumpTV means everyone in the media can be a winner no matter the outcome of Trump's presidency. Really, if the bottom line is their only bottom line … they literally cannot lose. This piece was reprinted by Truthout with permission or license.

Subscribe Home News YouTube hate videos snare Ikea ads as Google crisis spreads Story Comments Print Create a hardcopy of this page Font Size: Default font size Larger font size Posted: Saturday, March 25, 2017 6:00 am YouTube hate videos snare Ikea ads as Google crisis spreads By Joe Mayes Bloomberg News SentinelSource.com Posted on Mar 25, 2017 by Paul Miller Major advertisers across Europe and Asia are still appearing alongside extremist YouTube videos days after technology giant Google said it was taking steps to protect its clients from inadvertently supporting hate. An anti-Semitic clip claiming the existence of a "Jewish World Order" was featured alongside advertisements in Germany from insurer AXA, oil company Total in France, Range Rover vehicles in South Africa, footwear retailer Skopunkten and website Tradera in Sweden, Bloomberg searches of YouTube from each country found on Thursday. The video was also paired with brands in Asia — Castrol lubricants in India and Cow & Gate infant formula in Hong Kong. A separate sermon by preacher Ahmad Musa Jibril, who according to U.S. prosecutors once took credit for a terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia, can be viewed alongside advertisements from Nissan in Sweden and wireless carrier MTN Group in South Africa. Meanwhile, the Islamophobic English Defence League gathers support from advertisers Total, Netflix, IBM and watchmaker Tag Heuer International in France. The controversy over ad placement, now in its second week, is expanding across the globe at a pace Alphabet's Google has struggled to match in its response. On Thursday, as Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt said Google could "get pretty close" to guaranteeing companies' ads won't be placed near hateful material, advertisers throughout Europe were confronting more than a dozen new examples and scrambling to protect their brands. "We didn't know that our ads were played in this context," Axa spokeswoman Anja Kroll said in an email. "We have immediately arranged for an update of the filters and stopped the delivery" of ads with these videos because "diversity, tolerance and openness are values that are of key importance for us and that we practice daily." While Axa hasn't pulled its ads from YouTube, the German unit is using "blacklist" filters to prevent its ads from appearing next to extremist, racist or other undesired content, Kroll said. In this case, she said, the filters apparently failed. "We don't comment on individual videos but as announced, we've begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear," a Google spokesperson said. "We're also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers' brands." Range Rover said in an email it was suspending its YouTube campaign in South Africa while it investigates. Telenor Sweden, which had an ad showing before a propaganda video from a Swedish neo-Nazi group, also halted all YouTube advertising, according to Aron Samuelsson, a spokesman. Nissan said it was "urgently reviewing" with Google while Nilson Group, owner of Skopunkten, said it had asked its media agency about the ads and is "awaiting answers," according to Linda Fernell, a spokeswoman. Total, IBM, MTN, Tag Heuer, Netflix, Castrol India and Cow&Gate owner Danone didn't respond or had no immediate comment. Tradera's owner, Paypal, declined to comment. In Sweden, an Ikea spot was found alongside a homophobic and anti-Semitic video entitled: "Gay Pride Parade a Tool of International Jews," while another clip in India tied the so-called gay agenda to "Satanic Illuminati" and touted the F3 Plus smartphone from China's Oppo. An ad for HBO's "The Young Pope" found its way to the pre-roll for "Jewish Hypocrisy -- Flooding Europe With Immigrants" in Spain. "It is completely unacceptable that IKEA appears in a context like this," spokeswoman Cecilia Nettelbladt Stenberg said by phone. "What we've done now is to ask our media agency to immediately investigate the reason behind this." "We don't control the YouTube ad placement, but we greatly oppose it," HBO said in an email. "We will be taking steps to get it removed." Oppo didn't respond. The advertisers' discomfort highlights the reliance of Google and Facebook on automated software that maximizes volume to help them dominate online advertising. Digital advertising grew by 17 percent globally to $178 billion in 2016, according to marketing consultant Magna Global, which projects that digital-based ad sales will overtake TV to become the No. 1 media category this year. The global array of companies caught up in the controversy illustrates the scale of the problem for Google, which risks potential financial and reputational damage. The company was already facing claims in a lawsuit by the family of a terror attack victim that it profits from ads linked to terrorist propaganda promoting violence. The latest crisis erupted after a Times of London investigation last week revealed ads running alongside offensive content. Alphabet's market value has dropped by about $24 billion this week. "A cascade of major brand boycotts for Google ad spend (mostly non-search) has emerged, raising concerns on first quarter and second quarter results and the future of programmatic advertising," Justin Post, an analyst with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a research note on Thursday, referencing the automated software Google uses to match advertisers with content online. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Ford Motor Co. suspended their YouTube ads on Thursday. AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline and Verizon Communications joined the boycott earlier this week, after British Broadcasting Corp., Sainsbury, Volkswagen and Toyota Motor Corp. said they had pulled ads in the U.K. The latest examples show the global scope of the Google's problem, reaching beyond the U.K. and U.S. to big European markets like Germany, France and Sweden, as well as Hong Kong, India and South Africa. At Skopunkten, a major shoe-store chain in Sweden, spokeswoman Fernell said she was unaware of the "Jewish World Order" video but said the company had noticed some unwanted videos popping up in its YouTube campaigns. "I hope they can help us redirect the ads," she said. "We need to learn more about this." While Google's tools can be incredibly sophisticated, allowing ads to follow users from site to site, the software hasn't fully matched the human judgment necessary to protect brands from inadvertently funneling cash to causes their customers would find objectionable. The high number of intermediaries in digital advertising further complicates the problem. So Google's announced fixes may not completely solve the challenge. "Google isn't yet fully addressing advertisers' concerns and needs to take stronger steps to regain the trust of brands," Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients Thursday. Google said Tuesday that it was increasing safeguards to protect advertisers, such as automatically excluding ads from videos deemed "potentially objectionable" and giving advertisers more control over placement. While YouTube revenue isn't reported separately by Google, analysts estimate the video site brings in billions of dollars each year, and say it's among Google's fastest-growing businesses. Schmidt, in an appearance on Fox Business Network's "Mornings With Maria" on Thursday, said Google can generally ensure clients that their ads won't be placed next to "hate" content. "We match the ads and the content," Schmidt said, according to a transcript from Fox Business. "But because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn't match." He said that Google had tightened its policies and increased the amount of time it spends manually reviewing the content, "and so I think we're going to be okay."

Bloomberg News reports that he was at the group’s next meeting, and in 1989, he chained himself to a balcony at the New York Stock Exchange with a banner reading "Sell Wellcome." Days later, Burroughs Wellcome lowered the price of the AIDS treatment AZT by 20%. Jes Staley, now chief executive of Barclays, remembers that protest - he was on JPMorgan’s equities desk at the time - and can chart his own transformation as a banker standing up for gay rights and AIDS research, as well as the influence of his brother. "We talk politics a lot," Jes Staley said Thursday night at the 35th anniversary benefit of the Gay Men’s Health Crisis, which has set its sights on eliminating AIDS. The event, at Highline Stages in Manhattan, brought Peter and Jes together to be honored and to reflect on activism.

PrintCommentRecommend (-) By Phillip Yoo | 03-24-17 | 06:00 AM | Email Article  PowerShares Senior Loan ETF may offer an attractive yield and low interest-rate risk, but it takes significant credit and liquidity risk in doing so. It provides market-cap-weighted exposure to the 100 largest U.S. floating-rate senior loans, which are among the most liquid in the loan market. But this is still a very illiquid market where active management of liquidity and credit risk offers an advantage over this index strategy. So, despite its attempt to mitigate liquidity risk, the fund earns a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Neutral. About the Author Phillip Yoo is an analyst, passive strategies research, for Morningstar Research Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Morningstar, Inc. Contact Author | Meet other investing specialists Senior loans have minimal price sensitivity to changing interest rates because their coupon payments float with prevailing interest rates and typically reset once a quarter. These adjustments make the duration of the loans close to zero, limiting the fund’s interest-rate risk. While its interest-rate risk is low, its credit risk is high. Most of the fund’s assets are invested in below-investment-grade loans. As of February 2017, the average default rate from 2002 to 2017 for high-yield loans was 3.3%, according to JPMorgan and S&P. The minimum initial spread must be 125 basis points over Libor to be included in this fund. Thus, despite its short duration, the fund offered a yield of 2.7% in February 2017. Senior loans’ illiquidity creates challenges for the fund. There is a liquidity mismatch because the fund must provide daily liquidity, while there is no set time limit to settle senior-loan trades. In fact, it took 17 days on average to complete a senior-loan trade during the second quarter of 2016, per Markit. The fund employs various measures to address the liquidity risk. It allocates roughly 10% of its assets to cash and more-liquid high-yield bonds. The rest of the assets are skewed toward the most-liquid and largest loans. It also has a line of credit for emergency liquidity events. Even though it has struggled to keep up with the index recently, the fund has tracked its index well through the years. During the trailing five-year period through February 2017, the fund lagged its benchmark by 67 basis points annually. This gap is in line with its annual cost of 0.65%. Fundamental View A senior loan is issued by a non-investment-grade company, and its assets are pledged against the loan. This structure gives the investor a claim on the company assets, providing some protection against defaults. Below-investment-grade companies seek senior loans mainly because they can lower funding costs, customize the financing structure, and keep their sensitive information private. There is an inherent liquidity risk built in this fund. While it provides daily liquidity, its holdings are thinly traded. For example, senior loans’ average bid-ask spread was 85 basis points as of February 2017, according to LSTA. It can be even more expensive particularly for an index fund like this that demands liquidity. This illiquidity is primarily driven by the private origination and heterogeneous nature of senior loans. However, the fund takes a few steps to mitigate liquidity risk. First, it maintains around 10% of the portfolio in cash and high-yield bonds that are settled within three days after the transaction. The fund attempts to source high-yield bonds from the same issuers of senior loans in its index where possible. Second, the fund invests in the 100 largest, most-traded senior loans. This focus should help reduce transaction costs, but it also tilts the fund toward the most-indebted issuers. The fund also sources loans from the primary market, which arguably provides better pricing than secondary markets. Third, the managers may request accelerated settlement from their counterparties. Invesco is a large participant in the U.S. senior-loan market, so counterparties have incentives to accommodate these requests. Last, the fund has an emergency line of credit, which allows it to borrow to bridge the gap between the time it takes to receive cash from the sale of its holdings and its obligation to provide daily liquidity to investors.   This fund takes less credit risk than most of its senior-loan Morningstar Category peers, leading to lower returns. While more than 60% of its assets are in loans issued by non-investment-grade firms, the corresponding figure for the category average is more than 80%. The fund’s five-year annual return through February 2017 of 3.5% was behind the category average of 4.2%. Its Sharpe ratio, a risk-adjusted return metric, ranked in the bottom 10% during the same period. This underperformance was partially attributable to the fund’s cash position. Given the fund’s large cash holdings combined with a less-aggressive credit-risk profile, its risk/return pattern is likely to continue. Portfolio Construction The fund earns a Neutral Process rating because of the liquidity challenges and high transaction costs it faces. Also, its index is not representative of the target market it is trying to capture. Thus, the fund’s performance can deviate from the category average as its peers favor less-liquid and riskier loans. Active management should pay off in this market. This fund seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond to the performance of the S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index. The index is composed of the 100 largest senior loans, weighted by market value. Qualifying loans must be senior-secured, denominated in U.S. dollars, and have a publicly assigned CUSIP. Also, they must have a minimum initial term of one year and minimum initial spread of Libor plus 125 basis points. The minimum par amount is $50 million. Each Friday, S&P reviews the index constituents and reduces the weighting of constituents that exceed 2.0% of the market-value weighting of the index to 1.9%. The index is rebalanced semiannually to avoid excessive turnover. But it is reviewed weekly to reflect pay-downs and ensure that the index portfolio maintains 100 loans. The fund can invest 20% of its capital in securities outside of the index, and it regularly parks some of its assets in cash and high-yield bonds to mitigate liquidity risk. These positions may create some tracking error. Fees/Costs This fund charges 0.65%, which is cheaper than 87% of its peers and supports the Positive Price Pillar rating. The category average fee is 0.86%. The fund’s return has come close to its index over the long term, but the gap between the fund and the index has been widening in recent years. Its five-year annual return through February 2017 of 3.55% was 67 basis points less than the index’s return. However, it posted annual returns during the trailing one- and three-year periods through February 2017 of 10.53% and 2.15%, respectively. They were behind the index by 201 and 79 basis points during the same period. This underperformance can be attributed to a few factors. The market experienced high volatility after the November election, and subsequently the fund experienced an inflow of $2 billion from December 2016 to January 2017. High transaction costs associated with market volatility and the fund’s large cash balance contributed to its underperformance against the index. Alternatives  Highland/iBoxx Senior Loan ETF is a close passively managed alternative that has considerable overlap with BKLN’s holdings. The fund screens for the most-liquid 100 senior loans and weights those by market value to mimic the returns of the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid Leveraged Loan Index. With an expense ratio of 0.55%, it was the cheapest bank-loan exchange-traded fund as of February 2017. Unlike BKLN, it does not hold high-yield bonds.  SPDR Blackstone/GSO Senior Loan ETF is a comparably priced (0.70% expense ratio) actively managed alternative. The fund is subadvised by Blackstone/GSO, under the leadership of Dan McMullen. The team seeks to uncover mispriced securities through bottom-up credit research. This fund held 7% in bonds and virtually no cash as of March 6, 2017. Although it is slightly more expensive than BKLN, it is a persuasive option for exposure to senior loans.  First Trust Senior Loan ETF is also actively managed and charges a higher 0.86% expense ratio. The managers perform fundamental credit analysis on loans and tend to make many small bets to reduce the liquidity needs of any single holding. The fund favors companies with stable cash flows, strong management teams, and quality assets.   Disclosure: Morningstar, Inc. licenses indexes to financial institutions as the tracking indexes for investable products, such as exchange-traded funds, sponsored by the financial institution.
