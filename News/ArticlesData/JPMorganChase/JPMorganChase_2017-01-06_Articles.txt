If interest rates continue to climb, profits at the nation's biggest bank by assets should follow suit, lifting its share price higher. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 7, 2017 at 9:49AM Image source: The Motley Fool. Last year was a year to remember for bank stocks, many of which surged by double-digits after the presidential election in November convinced investors that profits in the industry could soon improve. But while 2017 offers a new slate of risks and rewards, it could turn out to be yet another very good year for the nation's biggest bank by assets, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). The December rate hike At the end of last year, the Federal Reserve raised the fed funds rate, the primary short-term interest rate benchmark in the United States, for only the second time since the financial crisis. "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace since mid-year," the Fed wrote in its press release announcing the move. Although the central bank only increased rates by 25 basis points, or a quarter of a percentage point, the move nevertheless confirms that the economy is still headed in the right direction, continuing its slow but steady recovery from the 2008 crisis. It's also significant because banks make more money when interest rates are higher. US Target Federal Funds Rate data by YCharts. In JPMorgan Chase's case, its latest interest rate sensitivity analysis shows that a 100 basis point increase in short- and long-term rates would translate into $2.8 billion in additional net interest income in the 12 months following the rate hike. And if rates were to climb by 200 basis points, or two percentage points, then JPMorgan Chase would stand to earn an added $4.5 billion worth of net interest income. Strictly speaking, that additional income counts as revenue, not earnings. But because higher interest rates don't require a bank to spend more money to hire new employees or open new branches, most of that revenue falls directly to the bottom line. The net result is that higher interest rates will almost necessarily translate into fatter profits for JPMorgan Chase. More rate hikes on the horizon Of course, the 25 basis point increase in December was only a fraction of the 100 basis points that JPMorgan Chase needs to generate the full $2.8 billion in added annual net interest income alluded to in its interest rate sensitivity analysis. But there are reasons to be optimistic on this score. In the first place, long-term rates shot up faster than short-term rates in the final months of last year. Between the end of September and the beginning of 2017, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, the primary long-term interest rate benchmark in the United States, climbed from 1.6% to 2.5%. That equates to 90 basis points. 10 Year Treasury Rate data by YCharts. And there's reason to believe that short-term rates will follow suit in 2017, as the majority of the members of the Fed's monetary policy committee are targeting a fed funds rate of between 1.25% and 1.5% or higher by the end of this year. This calls for at least three rate hikes of 25 basis points in 2017, bringing the total increase in short-term rates to 100 basis points after factoring in the Fed's move in December. This doesn't necessarily mean that JPMorgan Chase's stock is a screaming bargain. After all, it did climb 31% last year. However, even though it's much more expensive now than it was six months ago, it's still not excessively overvalued, trading at a 30% premium to its book value compared to the two or more times book value that's generally associated with overvalued bank stocks.

Home Mail Search News Cricket Movies Lifestyle Celebrity Flickr Mobile Answers More Yahoo Search Search Mail News Home Follow us YEAR IN REVIEW 2016 National World Finance Cricket Lifestyle Sports Good News Videos Autos Indonesia plans regulation to ensure bond dealers produce 'factual' research By Hidayat Setiaji and Gayatri Suroyo Reuters7 January 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share By Hidayat Setiaji and Gayatri Suroyo JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia is planning regulation to ensure primary bond dealers produce only "factual" research, senior government officials said, in a move that is likely to add to bankers' concerns about a growing backlash over negative investment commentary. The officials' remarks came after the Indonesian government cut its business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co following a November downgrade by the U.S. bank in its Indonesian stocks recommendation to "underweight" from "overweight". While Indonesia has subsequently sought to reassure banks and research firms that they will not be sanctioned for their assessment of the country as long as it is "credible", some Jakarta-based analysts at foreign banks have said they were becoming more cautious. Suahasil Nazara, the Finance Ministry's head of fiscal policy office, said on Friday that primary bond dealers have to ensure their assessments of Indonesia are based on facts and do not cause a disruption to the financial system. "The point is, the analysis has to be credible and correspond to factual data," Nazara said in a text message. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov. 25. The regulation will "hopefully" be released next week and will govern the accountability of analysis or the release of information, Robert Pakpahan, director-general of budget financing and risk management, said in a text message. "The publication of analysis and opinion that is inaccurate, speculative in nature and not based on facts will not be allowed," Pakpahan said, adding that the regulation has to be approved by the finance minister. In the JPMorgan case, the Finance Ministry dropped the U.S. bank's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. JPMorgan said in response that the impact on its clients was minimal and that it continued to operate its business as usual in Indonesia. FOREIGN OWNERSHIP Indonesia's sensitivity to negative commentary is likely enhanced due to the relatively high foreign ownership of its sovereign bonds and broader concerns over potential capital outflows, analysts have said. Emerging markets, including Indonesia, are vulnerable to potentially disruptive capital outflows as expectations of faster U.S. interest rate hikes and President-elect Donald Trump's promise of fiscal stimulus push the dollar higher. More protectionist trade policies under Trump could intensify that pressure. Foreigners hold more than 37 percent of Indonesia's government bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for the Southeast Asian nation. Foreign investors sold 20.15 trillion rupiah ($1.5 billion) of Indonesian government bonds in the three weeks after Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. JPMorgan's skirmish with the Indonesian government also highlights the conflicts that banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or a company. Banks ranging from Morgan Stanley in China to Banco Santander in Brazil have faced rows with governments in emerging markets, although the pressure has usually been less explicit than faced by JPMorgan in Indonesia. In some cases that had led to a chilling effect where analysts cut back on even run-of-the-mill research, leaving investors in the dark as to any risks or opportunities.

The officials’ remarks came after the Indonesian government cut its business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co following a November downgrade by the US bank in its Indonesian stocks recommendation to “underweight” from “overweight’’. While Indonesia has subsequently sought to reassure banks and research firms that they will not be sanctioned for their assessment of the country as long as it is “credible’’, some Jakarta-based analysts at foreign banks have said they were becoming more cautious. Suahasil Nazara, the Finance Ministry’s head of fiscal policy office, had said on Friday that primary bond dealers have to ensure their assessments of Indonesia are based on facts and do not cause a disruption to the financial system. “The point is, the analysis has to be credible and correspond to factual data,” Nazara said in a text message. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of November 25. The regulation will “hopefully” be released next week and will govern the accountability of analysis or the release of information, Robert Pakpahan, director-general of budget financing and risk management, said in a text message. “The publication of analysis and opinion that is inaccurate, speculative in nature and not based on facts will not be allowed,” Pakpahan said, adding that the regulation has to be approved by the finance minister. In the JPMorgan case, the Finance Ministry dropped the US bank’s services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. JPMorgan said in response that the impact on its clients was minimal and that it continued to operate its business as usual in Indonesia. Foreign ownership Indonesia’s sensitivity to negative commentary is likely enhanced due to the relatively high foreign ownership of its sovereign bonds and broader concerns over potential capital outflows, analysts have said. Emerging markets, including Indonesia, are vulnerable to potentially disruptive capital outflows as expectations of faster US interest rate hikes and President-elect Donald Trump’s promise of fiscal stimulus push the dollar higher. More protectionist trade policies under Trump could intensify that pressure. Foreigners hold more than 37 per cent of Indonesia’s government bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for the Southeast Asian nation. Foreign investors sold 20.15 trillion rupiah ($1.5 billion) of Indonesian government bonds in the three weeks after Trump won the US presidential election on November 8. JPMorgan’s skirmish with the Indonesian government also highlights the conflicts that banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or a company. Banks ranging from Morgan Stanley in China to Banco Santander in Brazil have faced rows with governments in emerging markets, although the pressure has usually been less explicit than faced by JP Morgan in Indonesia. In some cases that had led to a chilling effect where analysts cut back on even run-of-the-mill research, leaving investors in the dark as to any risks or opportunities. David Sumual, chief economist at PT Bank Central Asia Tbk (BCA), said the “fire-wall” between the bank’s business and research divisions had been reinforced since the global financial crisis in 2008. Sumual said his research is based on the data that is available to him, but “there’s still a disclaimer that this can change from time to time and the ultimate decision still lies with the investors.” BCA is Indonesia’s biggest bank by market value and one of the country’s primary dealers.($1 = 13,360.00 rupiah) (This article was published on January 7, 2017) Related TOPICS World | Indonesia | finance (general) | debt market and bonds | Get more of your favourite news delivered to your inbox SEND MY NEWS Please enter your email.

"I expect the drug stocks will be a mixed bag, but the banks should be in hog heaven," the "Mad Money" host said. Before diving into bank earnings on Friday, Cramer will have his eye on the drug stocks, kicking the week off with the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Usually conferences aren't powerful enough to move the tape, but the JPMorgan conference is the biggest and most important of its kind and could provide powerful insight to the drug stocks. Cramer will be focused specifically on the drug stocks that can break news. After shares of Constellation Brands plunged 7 percent on Thursday, Jim Cramer did his homework to see if it was time to reshuffle his beer stocks. Constellation Brands is the world's leading purveyor of premium wines and alcohol, and also imports popular Mexican beer brands like Corona, Modelo and Pacifico into the U.S. Cramer attributed the shares falling to beer sales that weren't strong enough for the bulls, but mainly, due to concerns over President-elect Donald Trump's agenda. "Investors are worried that the company could get hurt if the Trump administration imposes some kind of cross-border tariff on Mexican imports," Cramer said. After speaking with Constellation's CEO Rob Sands on Thursday, Cramer came to the conclusion that fears of Trump's agenda are overblown. It's not like Ford or General Motors moving an auto plant from Michigan to Mexico. If they made a Mexican beer in the U.S., it wouldn't really be a Mexican beer. Airline stocks suddenly seemed to be flying high recently thanks to the pro-business agenda expected of Trump and Warren Buffett's blessing. However, with 2017 in full swing, that sentiment on the group seems to have cooled rapidly. In the past two days, there were two bearish calls on airlines from Cowen and Morgan Stanley. "If you have been riding these stocks up, I don't blame anybody who wants to take their cue from this negative research and ring the register up here," Cramer said. Now that the airlines have had a huge run, he expects the stocks to become less attractive if they head higher. Meredith Davis | Reuters People look at AGCO equipment as they attend National Farm Machinery show in Louisville, Kentucky, February 12, 2016. The radical rally in the stock market ever since Election Day is powered by stocks like Agco Corporation, Cramer says. Unless you watch "Mad Money" on a consistent basis or own a farm, you may not even know Agco. It is an agriculture company that is a mixture of brands like Fendt, Massey-Ferguson and GSI. CEO Martin Richenhagen has been steering his company quietly to accumulate castoff businesses and spend money to revitalize them. Agco has also been quietly buying back its stock on a bet that the cycle of agriculture was ready to turn. "Martin's stock is going to go higher because he freakin' bought the heck out of it when it was much lower, and now there is no supply," Cramer said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer provided his opinion on various stocks from callers: Western Digital: "Western Digital is at $70 and I think it goes to $85. When we had management on they made me feel even better about the stock than had going in because I like flash memory. I like the Sandisk acquisition, I like them." Ferrellgas Partners: "There are forces going on in the propane business right now that trade day-to-day ... It is too hard. I would not sell it down here, but you have to understand that the cross-currents in that business are insane."

Politics played a role in many of their advances. Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Jan 6, 2017 at 3:02PM Compared against historical standards, 2016 was a better-than-average year for the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI), which advanced 15% on the year.  But a select few did lots of the heavy lifting for the index, helping it gain over 2,330 points. Two energy and materials companies -- Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) -- joined two banks -- Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) -- as four of the top five Dow Jones stocks of 2016. United Healthcare (NYSE:UNH) rounded out the list of this year's top performers. ^DJI data by YCharts. A nice election bump for the banks If we dig a little deeper, we can easily see that both Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan -- while not having awful years before the presidential election -- saw huge swings in their fortunes after the election of Donald Trump as the country's next president. In fact, between Election Day and the end of the year, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan saw their stocks advance 34% and 24%, respectively. Investors should be careful about reading too much into these moves since the companies themselves reported no substantial news to warrant such advances. Instead, investors viewed the election of Trump as a sign that regulations might be eased on large banks, and that interest rates would finally move upwards after years at near-historic low levels. While only time will tell if the former comes to fruition, the latter has already begun in earnest, with the Federal Reserve deciding to raise interest rates in December. Image credit: Getty Images. A recovery in the energy sector While the banks' advances were political in nature, Caterpillar and Chevron had been trending upwards for most of the year -- though they too benefited from the post-election bump. Chevron suffered its first quarterly loss in over a decade earlier in the year, and things weren't looking too bright when the price of a barrel of crude oil fell below $30 in February. But since then, the landscape has shifted -- albeit slightly. The company's cost-cutting measures and restrained capital spending, combined with the fact that oil jumped to over $50 per barrel, helped it return to profitability by the end of the third quarter. Caterpillar was buoyed by optimism throughout the year, but as fellow Fool Daniel Miller has shown, it's difficult to understand why. Energy, transportation, and machine retail divisions at the company are continuing to show weaknesses. The company has a large employee benefit payment coming due in 2017, and management has openly said that analyst estimates for the year are overly optimistic. Rising energy prices are likely helping the company, as well as its current dividend yield of 3.3%. What will healthcare look like? Finally, we have UnitedHealth. The company has already announced it would be leaving most of the states where it was offering individual coverage under the Affordable Care Act, but the election of Trump -- and his promise to make serious changes to the law -- may make the point moot. Even without the Affordable Care Act, UNH is easily the largest health insurer in the country, with over 48 million individuals enrolled with the company. That's a big deal, because it gives UNH bargaining power with healthcare providers to lower prices, which makes its ecosystem even more appealing for those seeking health insurance. During 2016, the growth of the company's Optum division was the real star. While growth rates in the division -- especially OptumRx -- may have slowed, it still provides the best margins in the business. Looking ahead to 2017, I caution investors not to read too much into these gains. Advances by banks and healthcare companies were predicated on assumed changes in how our government approaches these industries -- which can be blind optimism at best. And while it's hard to envision a future where oil and energy prices don't eventually rise, no one knows which direction those prices will head either. My main point: Forces that these companies have little control over could be huge catalysts in 2017 and beyond. Stay diversified and stay invested so you can roll with the punches over time.

The stock keeps hitting it and bouncing up. This tells smart investors and traders to stay away from shorting the overbought financial stock until it breaks the trend line to the downside. Then investors and traders can short JPMorgan Chase heavily for big profits. Once the trend line breaks, it will collapse down to $80. The trend line break will occur at any daily close below $85.75.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Business News | Sat Jan 7, 2017 | 1:37am EST Indonesia plans regulation to ensure bond dealers produce 'factual' research By Hidayat Setiaji and Gayatri Suroyo | JAKARTA JAKARTA Indonesia is planning regulation to ensure primary bond dealers produce only "factual" research, senior government officials said, in a move that is likely to add to bankers' concerns about a growing backlash over negative investment commentary. The officials' remarks came after the Indonesian government cut its business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) following a November downgrade by the U.S. bank in its Indonesian stocks recommendation to "underweight" from "overweight". While Indonesia has subsequently sought to reassure banks and research firms that they will not be sanctioned for their assessment of the country as long as it is "credible", some Jakarta-based analysts at foreign banks have said they were becoming more cautious. Suahasil Nazara, the Finance Ministry's head of fiscal policy office, said on Friday that primary bond dealers have to ensure their assessments of Indonesia are based on facts and do not cause a disruption to the financial system. "The point is, the analysis has to be credible and correspond to factual data," Nazara said in a text message. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov. 25. The regulation will "hopefully" be released next week and will govern the accountability of analysis or the release of information, Robert Pakpahan, director-general of budget financing and risk management, said in a text message. "The publication of analysis and opinion that is inaccurate, speculative in nature and not based on facts will not be allowed," Pakpahan said, adding that the regulation has to be approved by the finance minister. In the JPMorgan case, the Finance Ministry dropped the U.S. bank's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. JPMorgan said in response that the impact on its clients was minimal and that it continued to operate its business as usual in Indonesia. FOREIGN OWNERSHIP Indonesia's sensitivity to negative commentary is likely enhanced due to the relatively high foreign ownership of its sovereign bonds and broader concerns over potential capital outflows, analysts have said. Emerging markets, including Indonesia, are vulnerable to potentially disruptive capital outflows as expectations of faster U.S. interest rate hikes and President-elect Donald Trump's promise of fiscal stimulus push the dollar higher. More protectionist trade policies under Trump could intensify that pressure. Foreigners hold more than 37 percent of Indonesia's government bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for the Southeast Asian nation. Foreign investors sold 20.15 trillion rupiah ($1.5 billion) of Indonesian government bonds in the three weeks after Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. JPMorgan's skirmish with the Indonesian government also highlights the conflicts that banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or a company. Banks ranging from Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in China to Banco Santander (SAN.MC) in Brazil have faced rows with governments in emerging markets, although the pressure has usually been less explicit than faced by JPMorgan in Indonesia. In some cases that had led to a chilling effect where analysts cut back on even run-of-the-mill research, leaving investors in the dark as to any risks or opportunities. David Sumual, chief economist at PT Bank Central Asia Tbk (BCA), said the "fire-wall" between the bank's business and research divisions had been reinforced since the global financial crisis in 2008. Sumual said his research is based on the data that is available to him, but "there's still a disclaimer that this can change from time to time and the ultimate decision still lies with the investors." BCA (BBCA.JK) is Indonesia's biggest bank by market value and one of the country's primary dealers.

The finance ministry may ask top management at global banks which hold primary dealerships in Indonesian sovereign bonds to sign pledges to refrain from issuing research that could destabilize local financial markets, according to Loto Srinaita Ginting, the ministry’s director of government securities. The proposal was discussed with some primary bond dealers at a meeting in mid-December, according to a person familiar with the matter. It would require approval by Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, another person said. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Indonesia this week said it stopped using JPMorgan as a primary dealer and underwriter of sovereign bonds, a retaliation for a November report downgrading the country’s equities to “underweight” from “overweight” following Donald Trump’s U.S. election victory. Commenting on the decision to cut government ties with JPMorgan, Mulyani said Tuesday that banks should take responsibility for economic reports that "could influence fundamentals and psychology." Global banks which hold primary dealerships in Indonesian government bonds include Standard Chartered Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc, Deutsche Bank AG and Citigroup Inc. HSBC Indonesia’s head of communications, Daisy Primayanti, declined to comment on the proposed curbs, as did representatives of the other three banks. Other Warnings Official attempts to deter critical research are nothing new in developing economies. In July, Turkey’s banking regulator issued an industry-wide warning to avoid negative reports. In 2014, then Brazil President Dilma Rousseff chastised an analyst for suggesting her election would hurt the economy. As money managers around the world pull capital from developing economies on concerns over rising U.S. interest rates and a stronger dollar, policy makers are becoming especially sensitive to critical analyst opinions, according to Medley Global Advisors. Foreign investors sold a net $2.8 billion of Indonesian stocks and bonds last quarter as investors dumped emerging-market assets following Trump’s victory. That drove the rupiah lower, forcing policy makers to intervene to stabilize the currency. JPMorgan’s business in Indonesia continues to operate as normal and the bank is working with the finance ministry to resolve the matter, it said in e-mailed statement Tuesday. The November research report issued by the bank was not “accurate or credible,” Robert Pakpahan, the Indonesian finance ministry’s director-general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters in Jakarta. Bond Offerings The biggest U.S. bank was part of a underwriting syndicate when Indonesia sold 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) of bonds in June. The lender wasn’t listed as a member of syndicates for two more recent offerings denominated in yen and U.S. dollars, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan provides investment and commercial banking services to the public and private sectors in Indonesia, according to the bank’s website. It obtained an Indonesian banking license in 1968 in the name of Chase Manhattan, and opened a branch in Jakarta, followed by a representative office in 1978.

McAdams May 16, 2016 My President Was Black Ta-Nehisi Coates Dec 13, 2016 Conor Friedersdorf Jan 6, 2017 Politics Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Wells Fargo. JPMorgan Chase. Fidelity Investments. Prudential PLC. Vanguard Group. These are among the major financial institutions that own business debt held by Donald Trump, according to an investigation just published by the Wall Street Journal. While the president-elect’s finances remain murky, due largely to his refusal to release his tax returns, the newspaper reports that he owes at least hundreds of millions of dollars, that the debt is held by more than 150 institutions, and that some of it is backed by his personal guarantee. “As a result, a broader array of financial institutions now are in a potentially powerful position over the incoming president,” it states. “If the Trump businesses were to default on their debts, the giant financial institutions that serve as so-called special servicers of these loan pools would have the power to foreclose on some of Mr. Trump’s marquee properties or seek the tens of millions of dollars that Mr. Trump personally guaranteed on the loans.” One wonders whether to be more worried about Big Finance using its leverage to influence the president or the president abusing his power in order to thwart his creditors. Either way, Trump’s decision to hold on to his opaque business empire while president, rather than liquidating his interests to focus on the good of the country, has created unprecedented conflicts of interest that even a saint would have difficulty navigating in office. In a prior column, I noted a New York Times investigation into a portion of Trump’s business dealings in foreign countries, arguing that in India, China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, and other countries besides, there will be countless occasions where the interests of the United States and the interests of the Trump organization diverge. If the Times story was the best look we’ve gotten at specific conflicts of interest abroad, the Wall Street Journal article is the domestic analog, highlighting facts like this: Wells Fargo & Co., for example, runs at least five mutual funds that own portions of Trump businesses’ securitized debt, according to an analysis of mutual-fund data conducted by Morningstar Inc. for the Journal. The bank also is a trustee or administrator for pools of securitized loans that include $282 million of loans to Mr. Trump. And Wells acts as a special servicer for $950 million of loans to a property that one of Mr. Trump’s companies partly owns, according to securities and property filings. Wells Fargo is currently facing scrutiny from federal regulators surrounding its fraudulent sales practices and other issues. Once he takes office, Mr. Trump will appoint the heads of many of the regulators that police the bank. The article lists other specific conflicts. And then there’s this alarming detail: “It is impossible to identify all the firms or individuals that now hold Trump businesses’ securitized debt, as these investments often don’t have to be disclosed.” As a result, it is easy to imagine Trump covertly benefitting or punishing one of his creditors (depending on his analysis of what’s preferable). He needn’t be in a position to directly appoint regulators to do so. He often posts tweets that laud or vilify corporations with huge consequences for their stockholders. How many corporate leaders would quietly forgive debt if the stock of their biggest competitor would be tanked, rather than their own? This should concern even Americans who voted for Donald Trump. The underlying case here isn’t that he is unusually corrupt, but that the extreme power of the presidency requires a responsible country to put anyone who rises to the position under a microscope. Trump’s unusually big business conflicts create even more problems than usual, temptations to which the vast majority of humans might succumb. If Trump merely behaves as most people would, the country will lose, bigly. Tens of millions of people will be harmed. Trump is nevertheless offering less transparency than any predecessor in the modern era, and entering office with both houses of Congress controlled by Republicans who show no inclination to fulfill their responsibility to scrutinize his conflicts. Until members of Congress launch a full probe into Trump’s financial assets and debts, so that at the very least they can understand where his interests and America’s interests diverge, there is no way that they can adequately represent their constituents. And it is particularly ironic that their historic abdication of responsibility is rooted in partisanship, given that it will benefit a man with no loyalty to the Republican Party.

Twitter Email previousThe Desire to Live-Stream ViolencenextPutin and the Populists Most Popular Presented by Chelsea Beck Seeking an Escape Hatch From Trump’s America Emma Green Why some Americans are withdrawing from mainstream society into “intentional communities”—and what the rest of the country can learn from them VIRGINIA— For the last eight years, Nicolas and Rachel Sarah have been slowly weaning themselves off fossil fuels. They don’t own a refrigerator or a car; their year-old baby and four-year-old toddler play by candlelight rather than electricity at night. They identify as Christian anarchists, and have given an official name to their search for an alternative to consumption-heavy American life: the Downstream Project, with the motto to “do unto those downstream as you would have those upstream do unto you.” As it turns out, exiting the system is a challenging, time-consuming, and surprisingly technical process. Here in the Shenandoahs and central Virginia, a handful of tiny communities are experimenting with what it means to reject the norms of contemporary life and exist in a radically different way. They seem to share Americans’ pervasive sense of political alienation, which arguably reached an apotheosis with the election of Donald Trump: a sense of division from their peers, a distrust of government. The challenges of modern politics—dealing with issues like climate change, poverty, mass migration, and war on a global scale—are so vast and abstract that it’s difficult not to find them overwhelming. But instead of continuing in passive despair, as many Americans seem to do, the people in these communities decided to overhaul their lives. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Goodbye, American Apparel Bourree Lam The 19-year old company has been purchased for $88 million, which may be the brand’s last great marketing feat. It’s finally over for American Apparel, the trendy turned-scandal plagued clothing brand whose first store opened in 1997. On Thursday, a bankruptcy court in Delaware approved an $88 million sale of the brand’s intellectual property and manufacturing equipment to Gildan, a Canadian apparel company that focuses on wholesale. Gildan will pay an additional $15 million to acquire American Apparel’s purchase orders and inventory, effectively giving the buyer all the tools it needs to launch a new clothing line from the ruins of the now defunct brand. Millennials—especially those who identify with the term hipsters—likely remember a time in the early naughts when American Apparel’s snug, expensive t-shirts were emblematic of made-in-America cool. The company’s marketing blended the feel-good altruistic mission of making things in America while its advertising featured over-the-top sex appeal of one of America’s favorite traits: youth. Continue Reading Bettmann / Getty The Curse of Econ 101 James Kwak When it comes to basic policy questions such as the minimum wage, introductory economics can be more misleading than it is helpful. In a rich, post-industrial society, where most people walk around with supercomputers in their pockets and a person can have virtually anything delivered to his or her doorstep overnight, it seems wrong that people who work should have to live in poverty. Yet in America, there are more than ten million members of the working poor: people in the workforce whose household income is below the poverty line. Looking around, it isn’t hard to understand why. The two most common occupations in the United States are retail salesperson and cashier. Eight million people have one of those two jobs, which typically pay about $9–$10 per hour. It’s hard to make ends meet on such meager wages. A few years ago, McDonald’s was embarrassed by the revelation that its internal help line was recommending that even a full-time restaurant employee apply for various forms of public assistance. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism, disagreeableness, grandiosity—a psychologist investigates how Trump’s extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers—the Gap Band’s “Outstanding”—was older than she was. Continue Reading Mike Segar/Reuters Will Mike Pence Be Trump’s Bridge to Democrats? Alex Wagner Indiana Democrats weigh in on their experience with the former governor. Though he has not yet been installed in the Oval Office, Donald Trump has already made life fairly complex for his Republican brethren in Congress. Most recently, in an interview with the New York Times this week, Trump singlehandedly threw the GOP’s Obamacare repeal process into chaos, insisting that a repeal vote would come “probably some time next week” and a replacement “very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter.” Neither was correct, but especially the replacement timeline: Congressional Republicans  are quietly insisting that it will be weeks before a replacement bill is ready—maybe even months (or years!).   The only person in the administration who seemed willing to acknowledge this reality is Vice President-elect Mike Pence.  In a press conference earlier this month, following a meeting with Republican lawmakers, Pence said: “The architecture of the replacement of Obamacare will come together, as it should, through the legislative process in the weeks and months ahead.” Continue Reading Paul Windle Machiavelli Was Right Michael Ignatieff The shocking lesson of The Prince isn’t that politics demands dirty hands, but that politicians shouldn’t care. You remember the photograph: President Obama hunched in a corner of the Situation Room with his national-security staff, including Hillary Clinton with a hand over her mouth, watching the live feed from the compound in Pakistan where the killing of Osama bin Laden is under way. This is a Machiavellian moment: a political leader taking the ultimate risks that go with the exercise of power, now awaiting the judgment of fate. He knows that if the mission fails, his presidency is over, while if it succeeds, no one should ever again question his willingness to risk all. It’s a Machiavellian moment in a second sense: an instance when public necessity requires actions that private ethics and religious values might condemn as unjust and immoral. We call these moments Machiavellian because it was Niccolò Machiavelli’s The Prince, written in 1513, that first laid bare the moral world of politics and the gulf between private conscience and the demands of public action. Continue Reading Morgan Heim / Day’s Edge Production The Hermit Who Inadvertently Shaped Climate-Change Science J. Weston Phippen Billy Barr moved to the Rocky Mountains four decades ago, got bored one winter, and decided to keep a notebook that has become the stuff of legend. It was a year into his life alone in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains when Billy Barr began his recordings. It started as a curiosity, a task to busy his mind during the winter. By no means, Barr told me, having skied down from his cabin to use the nearest phone, did he set out to make a vital database for climate change scientists. “Hell no!” he said. “I didn’t know anything about climate change at the time.” In 1973 Barr had dropped out of college and made his home an abandoned mining shack at the base of Gothic Mountain, a 12,600-foot stone buttress. The cold winds blew through the shack’s wood slat walls as if they didn’t exist; he shared the bare dirt floor with a skunk and pine marten, his only regular company for much of the year. Barr had moved from the East Coast to the Rocky Mountains precisely because of the solitude, but he couldn’t escape boredom. Especially that first winter. So he measured snow levels, animal tracks, and in spring the first jubilant calls of birds returning. He filled a notebook with these observations; then another notebook. This has continued now for 44 years. Continue Reading Beth J. Harpaz / AP Flesh-Eating Worms Reach Florida's Mainland Sarah Zhang A massive eradication effort wiped out screwworms in the U.S. 35 years ago—but then they reappeared. The stray dog came with bad news. This week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that a dog near Homestead, Florida—a city 15 miles north of the Florida Keys—was found with wounds infested with screwworms, the much dreaded flesh-eating pest. If you’re not familiar with screwworm, it’s because the U.S. poured millions of dollars into eradicating them back in 1982. But last fall, it reemerged in the Florida Keys, catching almost everyone by surprise. Wildlife biologists eventually found several deer on the archipelago with the parasite. Screwworms lay eggs in open wounds, burrowing into the flesh of pets and occasionally even humans. Livestock, historically, was the big economic concern. Florida still sends hundreds thousands of young calves to herds around the country each year, so a screwworm infestation could do some real damage. Continue Reading WIkimedia Commons Why More Writers Should Talk About Money Joseph Frankel A new collection of essays and interviews breaks one of the biggest taboos of the literary world. Money makes people anxious—perhaps even more so with writers. The relationship between commerce and writing is commonly sketched out in caricatures: the starving artist, the hapless student, the privileged few who “make it.” More often, it’s not addressed at all. In the past few years, some writers have begun to more openly approach questions of class. The internet has seen a profusion of such pieces: A writer who is “sponsored” by her husband calls on other writers to be more transparent about where their money comes from. Another outlines the clear advantages that being born rich, connected, and able to attend expensive schools furnishes to becoming a successful writer. In another case, a woman who wrote a well-received debut novel details how she went broke after a single advance.

 The biggest healthcare investor conference starts this week — here are the 5 things we expect to get out of it Lydia Ramsey Jan. 9, 2017, 10:03 AM 4,332 facebook linkedin twitter email print Wikimedia Commons The second week of January is a busy time for drug companies.  Starting Monday, thousands of pharmaceutical industry executives, investors, bankers, and analysts will swarm into San Francisco for the JPMorgan healthcare conference. Now in its 35th year, the conference has ballooned from a small event with 150 attendees that was essentially the "birth of biotech," to an event attended by everyone from the biggest pharma company to the smallest biotech. It's a spot for these companies to meet with investors and each other, and can be the starting point for takeovers or other deals.  "If there's a place to be selling yourself, this is the place," said Jamie Streator, managing director of healthcare investment banking at Cowen and Co. It's also a great venue for deals to be announced — as has already happened with the $5.2 billion takeover of Ariad Pharmaceuticals. But it's not just M&A that people will be wondering about. From the political environment to the "next big thing" in treatments, here are some of the key themes we'll be asking about this week.  What cycle we're on: the year of gene therapies One of the biggest questions we have going into 2017 is what's going to be the buzziest technology or disease area for 2017. That answer might be something that's been heard before. Conference veterans told Business Insider that the biggest topics tend to come in big waves.  "Pharma companies are lemmings. When they see something that's cool, they all jump on it and say I gotta have it," Doug MacDougall, managing partner at MacDougall Biomedical Communications told Business Insider. That doesn't always pan out right away, though. Sometimes, the treatments don't work, and it takes a few more missteps before a company can figure out how to get it right. Or, alternatively, the new technology or treatment could be early days.  Last year, companies using the gene-editing technology CRISPR were the big deal from an emerging technology perspective. But even as fast as the development's going right now, we're still a few years from seeing how well it can work in humans. This year is gearing up to be a big one for cell and gene therapies — in which genes that cause diseases are replaced or turned off, 2017 could finally yield some good news. Development of these was stalled in 1999 following the death of an 18-year-old who was taking part in an experimental trial. CAR T-cell therapy, which is short for "chimeric antigen receptor" T-cell therapy, meanwhile, takes a person's own cells, takes them out of the body, reengineers them, then puts the cells back in the body where they can attack a particular cancer cell. Two companies have said they plan to submit their cell therapies to the FDA in 2017.  The inescapable conversation of drug pricing After the US presidential election, investors were relieved. Biotechnology stocks rose 13.3% by the end of the week following the election. Investors had been skittish about what a Hillary Clinton presidency would mean for regulation of drug development and pricing, and she often sent drugmakers' stocks falling with her comments on Twitter. Donald Trump, on the other hand, had been less clear about his thoughts on drug pricing. In December, Trump cleared that up in an interview with Time magazine, saying, "I’m going to bring down drug prices. I don’t like what’s happened with drug prices." The biotech index was down about 3% that day on the news, but has since bounced back. Google Finance With Trump calling out companies on Twitter, there is some concern that he might do the same to drugmakers. It's just a question of how companies will respond when that happens, and if any legislation will happen that take on drug price hikes.  It will also be interesting to see if more companies start to consider alternatives to routinely increasing prices, or if more will commit to capping price increases to less than 10%, as Novo Nordisk and Allergan have.  Where is all the M&A? 2016 wasn't exactly a blockbuster year for mergers and acquisitions — at least compared with years past. Bloomberg reports there was $91 billion worth of M&A that happened in 2016, down from $118 billion the year before.  But deals between drugmakers don't always entail the sale of entire companies. More often, especially as the appetite for big ticket purchases wane, companies partner up on the development or commercialization of a promising drug.  "What's happened in the evolution of the conference over the last 15, 20 years is it's really become more of a business development conference than just an investment conference," MacDougall said.  Tonix Pharmaceuticals CEO Seth Lederman, whose company is developing a drug for PTSD, said he is heading to San Francisco with the hope of finding a partner that will help them commercialize the drug, which is gearing up for a phase 3 trial, as opposed to acquiring the company outright. Of course, such a deal could lead to a sale later, he says. "I like the term, 'rent to buy,'" he said.   Basically, the ideal situation is that the commercial partner ends up becoming the company that acquires smaller biotech. In some cases, (take: Pharmacyclics' sale to AbbVie rather than its partner Johnson & Johnson), that's not how things play out, but Lederman said, that could be a good thing if the pharma partner is low-balling the smaller biotech.  The drug pipeline Drugmakers are in need of a jump start to 2017 after a somewhat disappointing 2016. In 2016, 22 new drugs got approved by the FDA, down from 45 the year before.  And big pharma's track record for developing new drugs is increasingly getting worse. According to a report released last month by Deloitte, research and develop returns for big pharmaceutical companies are declining, down in 2016 to 3.7% from 10.1% back in 2010. The answer, however, might not be to get even bigger through M&A (since, as Deloitte found, bigger companies had a negative relationship with returns on R&D investments). Finding the right partnerships with development-stage companies will be crucial to changing up pharma's track record. But we'll be interested in hearing how pharma plans to adapt from relying on blockbusters and routine price hikes to innovative, new treatments in potentially uncharted areas.  Going public? 2016 was a relatively quiet year for biotech IPOs, in part because the biotech sector was down 21.47% overall, compared to the 10.78% rise the S&P 500 index last year.  2017 is off to a hopeful start with an IPO filing from cancer drugmaker Jounce Therapeutics already in the bag, and  Silicon Valley Bank is predicting 28-32 biopharma IPO deals in 2017, calling the environment "healthy." In particular, SVB noted that medical device IPOs will double in 2017 (in 2016, there were just 3).   SEE ALSO: A startup that wants to create a simple blood test for every form of cancer is trying to raise at least $1 billion DON'T MISS: A new kind of cancer treatment works remarkably well for some patients but not others — and researchers want to know why NOW WATCH: A Harvard business professor explains a legal form of 'insider trading' in America Loading video...

The JPMorgan Global PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index), compiled by Markit, indicated that the expansion in worldwide business conditions in the fourth quarter was the strongest since the third quarter of 2015. The latest data signal a welcome improvement from the lacklustre growth seen earlier last year. However, a side effect of greater growth momentum was intensifying inflationary pressures. Average cost burdens faced by businesses rose by the greatest extent in over five years during December. Especially large increases in input prices were observed in manufacturing, reflecting higher commodity and raw material prices, especially for oil and industrial metals. In many cases, the stronger US dollar was reportedly behind sharply faster imported inflation. At the same time, the latest Caixin PMI showed a sustained upturn in China’s business conditions during the final quarter in 2016, which helped to limit job cuts. However, the improvement has yet to be accompanied by stronger growth in private investment, suggesting that businesses remain cautious. Expectations of slowing support from fiscal and monetary policies, as well as uncertainties concerning global trade growth, are among the economic headwinds in China this year. We’ll look for confirmation in official data this week, which include US inflation and retail sales numbers, Euro-area industrial output, as well as China’s latest data on inflation, credit growth, and trade. This is important because affirmation of the view that global growth is gathering momentum alongside rising prices will be hawkish for global monetary policy, especially for the US central bank. But another area of concerns that emerged is the extent to which the PMI surveys point to only weak increases in prices charged by businesses, suggesting that profit margins are being squeezed. This situation was particularly pronounced in emerging markets where the companies are facing higher oil prices and a weaker local currency against the US dollar. Tighter margins adversely influence companies’ hiring plans. Employment levels across emerging markets continued to fall, as firms prioritised cost management over staff expansion. On the foreign exchange front, daily midpoint fixes for the yuan will be closely monitored, as it may impact dollar movements. Although expectations of a steeper US rate hike trajectory and fiscal stimulus have been key drivers for dollar strength, PBOC’s move on the yuan hinted at concerns over a resurgence of large capital outflows.

Emerging markets, including Indonesia, are vulnerable to potentially disruptive capital outflows as expectations of faster US interest rate hikes and President-elect Donald Trump’s promise of fiscal stimulus push the dollar higher. More protectionist trade policies under Trump could intensify that pressure. Foreigners hold more than 37 per cent of Indonesia’s government bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for the Southeast Asian nation. Primary bond dealers have to ensure their assessments of Indonesia are based on facts and do not cause a disruption to the financial system, said Suahasil Nazara, the Finance Ministry’s head of fiscal policy office. “The point is, the analysis has to be credible and correspond to factual data,” Nazara said in a text message. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of November 25. The officials’ comments came after Indonesia cut business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co following a November downgrade by the US bank in its Indonesian stocks recommendation to “underweight” from “overweight”. The Finance Ministry dropped JPMorgan’s services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The regulation will “hopefully” be released next week and will govern the accountability of analysis or the release of information, Robert Pakpahan, director general of budget financing and risk management, said in a text message. “The publication of analysis and opinion that is inaccurate, speculative in nature and not based on facts will not be allowed,” Pakpahan said, adding that the regulation has to be approved by the finance minister. Foreign investors sold 20.15 trillion rupiah (RM6.8 billion) of Indonesian government bonds in the three weeks after Trump won the US presidential election on November 8. JPMorgan’s skirmish with the Indonesian government highlights the conflict banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or a company. Banks ranging from Morgan Stanley in China to Banco Santander in Brazil have faced rows with governments in emerging markets, although the pressure has usually been less explicit than faced by JPMorgan in Indonesia. In some cases that had led to a chilling effect where analysts cut back on even run of the mill research, leaving investors in the dark as to any risks or opportunities. David Sumual, chief economist at PT Bank Central Asia Tbk (BCA), said the “fire-wall” between the bank’s business and research divisions had been reinforced since the global financial crisis in 2008. Sumual said his research is based on the data that is available to him, but “there’s still a disclaimer that this can change from time to time and the ultimate decision still lies with the investors.” BCA is Indonesia’s biggest bank by market value and one of the country’s primary dealers. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week World’s eight richest as wealthy as half of humanity, Oxfam tells Davos Trump threatens BMW with border tax on cars built in Mexico Job cuts, fewer flights?

Another test for the rally will be the start of fourth-quarter earning seasons, and first up are financials, the leaders of the Trump rally with a near 18 percent gain since Nov. 8. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, PNC Financial and others report Friday. Earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to increase by 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter, but the S&P financial sector earnings are expected to have the biggest gains, with earnings up 15.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. The sector has bounced hard on the prospect of higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve, which would help bank profitability. The stocks also are rising on Trump's vow to end excess regulation. Besides banks, names like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are in that financial group and both are trading at near decade highs. Goldman is up 35 percent since the election, and has been leading the Dow. "I suspect earnings are going to be pretty darn good, but the problem is expectations are going up too," said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital. "Given the movement in some of these stock prices, you better hope they're outperforming expectations." President-elect Trump has been credited with being a major catalyst behind the market's rally since election day, though some analysts say the market and economy were already poised for improvement. "Right now the market has been floating on the illusion of optimism, and does that turn into a false sense of security?" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. Redler said Trump sparked the rally when he spoke in the early hours of Nov. 9. That victory speech has been credited with turning collapsing stock futures into a two-month rally. Trump focused on the pro-growth programs, like infrastructure spending and corporate tax breaks, that Wall Street has latched on to. He did not dwell on tariffs or trade proposals that had made Wall Street nervous before the election and are still a concern for some strategists. "All eyes will be on [President Barack] Obama's farewell speech Tuesday and then President-elect Trump's first press conference on Wednesday," said Redler. "We'll be trying to figure out what his tone is like. It will be a kind of pre-game for the inauguration. Traders would like the tone to be like he had in his election speech when he was claiming victory, versus what we've seen in the last few sessions." In the past week, Trump has repeatedly doubted the intelligence community's findings on Russian interference with the election. The intelligence findings concluded that President Vladimir Putin ordered an "influence campaign" but it turned into a "clear preference" for Trump. After a briefing with U.S. intelligence officials Friday, Trump said other nations like Russia and China are consistently attempting cyber break-ins against U.S. institutions, and he would form a team to combat these attacks. He also said there was no impact on the outcome of the election. In some of his first dealings with Congress in the past week, he called Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York "head clown" in a tweet. He has also criticized car companies, including Toyota, this past week. He warned the Japanese company in a tweet that it will face hefty taxes at the border if it tries to import cars into the U.S. from a new plant in Mexico. "I'd be more worried about his tweets than his press conference," said Paulsen, adding the press briefing is "going to capture more attention. We've never had one since he's been elected president." Besides the news conference, there will be confirmation hearings for the Trump Cabinet, including former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. Wall Street economists and strategists have been trying to handicap the Trump agenda, and put time frames around when his programs could start spurring more growth. Expectations vary on when there will be some impact. They also want to see a timeline on the tax overhaul, since companies will be more inclined to start spending and taking other action if they see a concrete plan. Because of the unknowns, some economists do not forecast much impact at all this year, yet the stock market has run higher on the prospect of positive change. "I would think there would be a lot of questions as to what his agenda is, what he looks to accomplish in his first 100 days. It could have some short-term impact, in terms of what he chooses precisely. I don't think this is going to have much lasting impact, but it could create some volatility," Paulsen said. Besides earnings, there are also a few key economic reports including retail sales, consumer sentiment and producer price inflation data, also all on Friday. Stocks hit some bumps in the first week of the new year but finished strong. The Dow came within 0.37 of a point of Dow 20,000 on Friday. It ended the session at 19,963 and a gain of 1 percent for the week. The S&P 500 was up 1.7 percent for the week at 2276, after hitting a new all-time high of 2,282 intraday. The Nasdaq gained a solid 2.5 percent to 5,521 as some big tech, like Amazon.com, played catch up. China could also be a big influence in the week ahead. Traders will continue to watch the volatility in the yuan, which had a swift run-up in the past week before pulling back. "The big thing is China's reserves. They're trying to thread a pretty small needle in trying to keep the exchange rate stable, trying to keep reserves at around $3 trillion as a confidence thing and to have flexibility in policy," said Robert Sinche, chief global strategist at Amherst Pierpont. Reserves data were to be reported over the weekend, but there is also trade data on Friday. Sinche said the market will be looking to see if exports are gaining any momentum. "The market thinks they're going to be losing some momentum in December," he said. "[But] there's definite signs things have improved across the Asian region." "I think the world's come to the realization that growth has picked up at the end of the year. Some of the data coming out of Europe is pretty robust," he said. "The question is going to be how much inflation is there going to be in the system. It looks like so far it's primarily an energy measurement phenomena. Except in the U.S., where I think there are some capacity pressures and pressures on wages." Inflation has become a bigger theme for markets and was very apparent in the December hourly wages growth of 0.4 percent, providing the biggest boost in year-over-year wage growth since 2009. Economists expect wages to continue to rise. They also expect to see a blip higher in inflation in the next several months because oil and gasoline prices are much higher than they were at the same time last year.

"I expect the drug stocks will be a mixed bag, but the banks should be in hog heaven," the "Mad Money" host said. Before diving into bank earnings on Friday, Cramer will have his eye on the drug stocks, kicking the week off with the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Usually conferences aren't powerful enough to move the tape, but the JPMorgan conference is the biggest and most important of its kind and could provide powerful insight to the drug stocks. Cramer will be focused specifically on the drug stocks that can break news. With this in mind, he reviewed the stocks and events on his radar next week: Time to bet on Trump stocks? Monday: Celgene, Amgen Celgene: Investors are looking for the company to guide up numbers. The real question is how much. In an era of Trump tweets, Cramer was willing to bet that Trump will put any drug company under the microscope that raises the price of its cancer treatment. Thus, he'll have his eye on how Celgene handles its best-selling Revlimid anti-cancer franchise. Amgen: Watch this stock, Cramer said. The company just snuffed Sanofi and Regeneron in a patent case on its new anti-cholesterol drug. It also has a large amount of cash overseas, which could be good news if Trump can enact relief on repatriation. "I think Amgen can go much higher, perhaps on comments coming out of this healthcare conference," Cramer said. Tuesday: Bristol-Myers Squibb, Valeant Bristol-Myers: Cramer is looking to find out if there will be job cuts surrounding its Opdivo anti-cancer franchise that failed to hit some key clinical trial endpoints. Valeant: With $30 billion in debt, it needs to do something to boost its cash flow. Cramer will be waiting to see if it announces a sale of a division or will roll back some of its unpopular price hikes. Wednesday: KB Home Unfortunately, KB Home is one of the most despised home builders out there for investors. But Cramer doesn't hate it, and wants to see what it has to say about orders with mortgage rates rising. Thursday: Delta Delta is one of the cheapest of the airline options among the group. Known for its transparency, Cramer wants to see what could be moving the stock. Friday: Bank earnings In Cramer's 37 years of investing, he's never seen a good rally with staying power unless it's being led by the banks. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report, and they are all winners of Trump's anticipated lowered regulation and rising interest rates. Cramer is most interested in Wells Fargo, and believe it or not, he thinks it could have a very good quarter. Questions for Cramer?

Bonus Season Nightmares! And Goldman Sachs Is Doing Just Fine! Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Levin Report Millennials Fear Wall Street Is a Dumpster Fire! Bonus Season Nightmares! And Goldman Sachs Is Doing Just Fine! Plus: Dow 19,963.80, a trader tries the “used-car salesman” defense, and JPMorgan says bring on the immigrants. by Bess LevinJanuary 6, 2017 4:00 pm Email Facebook Twitter Left, by Mark Walheiser, right, from Bloomberg, both from Getty Images. For a few fleeting moments today, it looked as though the Dow was going to finally hit 20,000, which would have meant the people wearing Dow 20,000 hats could stop feeling like their headgear was making a mockery of them. CNBC, for its part, stopped going to commercials out of the absolute blood-curdling fear that it might be on break when the historic-ish moment went down. Alas it it was not to be. The world is a cruel dark place, and we finished today at 19,963.80. The Goldman rally continues Before Donald Trump was elected president on November 8, Goldman Sachs C.E.O. Lloyd Blankfein said the idea of that guy having his “finger on the button blows my mind.” Shortly after November 8, Blankfein changed his tune. Now, in addition to the fact that the president-elect has stocked his inner circle with top Goldman brass, Blankfein has another reason to suddenly be all about the Donald: according to an analysis by UBS, the most gilded bank in all the land, after rallying 35 percent since Trump’s election, is set to get even more rich: The potential for Goldman Sachs to deliver better-than-expected earnings over the next two years should prompt investors to get behind the stock, according to analysts at UBS, who boosted their 12-month price forecast on the shares Friday. “We believe we are entering a period where earnings power may inflect for bulge bracket investment banks due to lesser regulatory constraints,” equity analyst Brennan Hawken wrote in a note to clients. So, that’s nice for them. Unfortunately, in news Trump probably won’t print out and add to his scrapbook, millennials think he’s going to destroy the economy: In the days following the election, Country Financial Group, an insurance and investment firm, conducted its annual financial security index and found that the score was lowest for millennials, defined as those between 18 and 34 years old, at 60.9 (the highest score is 100). Asked about economic outlook, millennials were the only generation to predict 2017 would be worse than 2016. Generation X wasn't too optimistic, with 34 percent of those polled saying this year would be better than the last, compared to 31 who felt the opposite. What do millennials know that the rest of Wall Street doesn’t? Perhaps they’re paying attention to China, which is not-so-casually signaling that Trump had better check himself before he wrecks himself, or bilateral trade relations, anyway: China is prepared to retaliate should President-elect Donald Trump take punitive measures against Chinese goods and trigger a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies, according to people familiar with the matter. Options include subjecting well-known U.S. companies or ones with large Chinese operations to tax or antitrust probes, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. Other possible measures include anti-dumping investigations and scaling back government purchases of American products, the people said. Bad news for bonuses This month, Wall Street banks will inform employees what they can expect for bonuses, with the money hitting their accounts in February. So far, Morgan Stanley is not making any friends here. Per Bloomberg: Morgan Stanley, Wall Street’s biggest stock-trading firm by revenue, is cutting its global bonus pool for the equities division by as much as 4 percent and dismissing some employees after the industry’s results flagged last year, according to people with knowledge of the plans. If anyone is thinking about complaining, know that C.E.O. James Gorman has, historically, not wanted to hear it. Donald “Benito Mussolini” Trump? Donald Trump reminds a lot of people of a lot of things: a petulant child who kicks and screams when he doesn’t get what he wants; a high-school bully who stuffs ”nerds” in lockers; the figure that’s not yet walking upright on one of those “evolution of man” t-shirts. According to legendary bond manager Bill Gross, the next president of the United States also calls to mind Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. ”Some of these pre-term policies, where he’s cajoling companies to move production back into the United States—that’s fine—but it reminds me to some extent of policies in Italy long ago associated with Mussolini and government control of corporate interests,” Gross said in an interview Friday on Bloomberg Radio. ”I don’t want it to go too far.” Wells Fargo tries to move on Before the Trump election maelstrom overshadowed every other scandal, a little bank called Wells Fargo was in a bit of hot water over the small matter of creating 2 million fake accounts in customers’ names. Management, which initially tried to paint the issue as the fault of just 5,300 rogue employees, eventually took a small measure of blame itself and conceded that its impossibly high sales goals (eight financial products per household) might have been a small part of the problem. So, they’re changing things up in 2017. While the details have not yet been revealed, the overarching theme is to get to a place wherein employees don’t feel compelled to take actions that make Wells look really, really bad. Per The Wall Street Journal: Wells Fargo & Co. is planning to roll out a new retail-banking compensation structure next week in an attempt to fix what many believe was one cause of its sales-tactics scandal, people familiar with the matter said. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo is in the process of completing the final parts of the new plan, which will focus on customer service, customer usage and growth in primary balances, some of these people said. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Mary Eshet said the bank’s priority is to share with employees the new plan, which “eliminates sales goals, measures performance based on customer experience and adds more oversight and risk” management. She added that the prior sales goals drove the bank’s culture, and that changes will take time to filter through the workforce. You say “used-car salesman” like it’s a bad thing Jesse Litvak is a former Jefferies bond trader, currently being retried on securities-fraud charges. The way the prosecution sees it, Litvak misled customers by inflating “the price he paid for residential mortgage-backed bonds,” causing them to overpay and ultimately “bilking” them out of $2 million. According to Litvak’s legal team, stuff like this happens all the time and Litvak’s clients—hedge funds and other professional investment managers—should have been sophisticated enough to know what they were getting into. To our absolute delight, this is how the people defending him kicked off the new trial: “Working it for you, bro,” an attorney for Mr. Litvak said to the jury during his opening remarks, reading from messages the attorney said Mr. Litvak sent while negotiating a trade. “I’m riding my seller like Seabiscuit,” the attorney, Dane Butswinkas, continued. “Winner, bro.” In Mr. Butswinkas’s telling, the messages reflected tactics that verged on pathetic—attempts to hoodwink savvy institutional investors whose “special, secret, computer-driven” ways to calculate their desired prices always overrode whatever Mr. Litvak told them. Mr. Litvak’s techniques, Mr. Butswinkas said, were akin to those of “your local used-car salesman. The kind of statements we have learned—and these sophisticated investment companies have learned—to take with a grain of salt.” Never have we ever more wished for highlights of a securities-fraud trial to be available on YouTube. Vous êtes viré! As you may have heard, the U.K.’s decision to leave the European Union is not only sad for liberals who would prefer not see their quaint island nation transformed into an isolationist wasteland, but also deeply inconvenient for a lot of banks. Companies with lots of employees in London—which is to say, every big bank—are now considering where to move, with Frankfurt, Dublin, and Paris all putting on the hard sell. What could help tip the odds in the City of Light‘s favor? Promising to make it easy for banks to fire people, for one: Since mid-September, senior executives from banks in the U.S., Asia and the Persian Gulf have held confidential talks with French government officials about relocating some businesses after Brexit, according to the people familiar with the matter. During the meetings, U.S. banking executives shared their concerns about the country’s strict labor laws, which would make it hard for them to hire and fire high-paid bankers and traders, according to these people. One option, a French official said, would involve allowing banks to easily fire employees that fall into certain European Banking Authority classifications. “It’s necessary if we want to be attractive,” the official said. Elsewhere: JPMorgan says bring on the immigrants. (CNBC) Theranos, or what’s left of it, has laid off another 41 percent of its workforce, or 155 people.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 06, 2017 1:37pm   Comments Share: In 1963, there were less than 300 candidates to sit for the CFA exam. Now, with CFA salaries soaring, there are expected to be more than 180,000 candidates sitting for these exams in the coming years, as more and more people try to get jobs at big banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), UBS Group AG (NYSE: UBS) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC).  The CFA Institute membership can be seen as a microcosm of the global investment profession, with virtually every type of professional at every type of firm represented. People holding the CFA designation can be found working as portfolio managers, research analysts, and chief level executives.  Based on density of job offerings, here are the best cities to work in if you have a CFA designation.  New York City Considered the financial capital of the world, NYC is the beginning for many CFA professionals. We're currently seeing demand in the financial service, healthcare, nonprofit, real estate, advertising/media, retail, and insurance industries. Many of the largest investment banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), JP Morgan, and Merrill Lynch are headquartered there. Nearly every large, global financial institution has an office in New York. The city has lost a large number of jobs due to the credit crisis, but Wall Street is still the place to be. London, England London is the finance capital of the United Kingdom and some would say the European world. Home to nearly all of the large international banks and brokerage firms, London is particularly strong in currency trading, commanding more than twice the market share of its closest rivals. Boston, Massachusetts  Boston is known for its asset-management business and large money managers, such as Fidelity Investments and Putnam Investments. The job market for asset management tends to be relatively more stable than that for investment banking or trading. This makes Boston a relatively appealing financial job market during economic recessions or market pullbacks. Dallas, Texas The Big D’s core industries (energy and anything relating to it) have a heavy need for CFAs. And, energy companies can hire two to three times the accounting and finance staff a non-energy client would be able to. Currently, all sectors within energy are trending, including oil and gas, production and exploration, shale plays, energy trading, utilities, oilfield service, and energy-related technology. San Francisco, California San Fran’s unique advantage is that its technology innovative environment is balanced by many privately-held “traditional” financial and professional service firms. This provides the foundation for high-risk companies to thrive and an aggressive job market. This city has some of the highest salaries in the nation. There are many brokerage and banking firms with offices in the San Francisco area, and companies such as Charles Schwab and Franklin Templeton Investments have their headquarters there. As the gateway to Silicon Valley, San Francisco has a particular focus on the technology sector. Dubai, United Arab Emirates As one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, Dubai is rapidly increasing in importance as a financial capital of the Middle East. Many global financial institutions are rushing to open and staff regional offices here. Even if you don’t speak Arabic, many international applicants are able to find a job here.  Tokyo, Japan As the capital of the world’s third largest economy, Tokyo is the headquarters for most Japanese financial institutions as well as the regional headquarters for many international firms. Tokyo rivals New York for the title of world financial capital. While there are opportunities available, Tokyo is a difficult place to get a job if you don't speak the language.  Houston, Texas Houston has a large concentration of Fortune 500 companies across a diverse set of industries, especially in the energy sector, including oil and gas, and real estate. As with Dallas, the city is extremely livable, with many attracted to its relatively low cost of living. Frankfurt, Germany Argued to be the finance capital of mainland Europe, Frankfurt is home to many large German companies such as Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE: DG). Many international firms also keep their European headquarters in Frankfurt. Frankfurt may be the destination for banks and other financial institutions that are relocating from London after the Brexit vote. Zurich, Switzerland Zurich is a great place to find a wide variety of finance jobs for CFAs. As the capital of the Swiss banking industry, global giants like UBS and Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE: CS) have their headquarters here. Zurich is known for wealth management and private banking. You will have more success if you speak some German or French.

Morgan Chase, BlackRock and Vanguard are among the institutions that own portions of Trump businesses’ securitized debt Reuters U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. By JeanEaglesham LisaSchwartz The debts of President-elect Donald Trump and his businesses are scattered across Wall Street banks, mutual funds and other financial institutions, broadening the tangle of interests that pose potential conflicts for the incoming president’s administration. Hundreds of millions of dollars of debt attached to Trump’s properties, some of them backed by Trump’s personal guarantee, were packaged into securities and sold to investors over the past five years, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of legal and property documents. Trump has previously disclosed that his businesses owe at least $315 million to 10 companies. According to the Journal’s analysis, Trump businesses’ debts are held by more than 150 institutions. They bought the debt after it was sliced up and repackaged into bonds—a process known as securitization, which has been used for more than $1 billion of debt connected to Trump’s companies. As a result, a broader array of financial institutions now are in a potentially powerful position over the incoming president. If the Trump businesses were to default on their debts, the giant financial institutions that serve as so-called special servicers of these loan pools would have the power to foreclose on some of Trump’s marquee properties or seek the tens of millions of dollars that Trump personally guaranteed on the loans.

The JPMorgan Global PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index), compiled by Markit, indicated that the expansion in worldwide business conditions in the fourth quarter was the strongest since the third quarter of 2015. The latest data signal a welcome improvement from the lacklustre growth seen earlier last year. However, a side effect of greater growth momentum was intensifying inflationary pressures. Average cost burdens faced by businesses rose by the greatest extent in over five years during December. Especially large increases in input prices were observed in manufacturing, reflecting higher commodity and raw material prices, especially for oil and industrial metals. In many cases, the stronger US dollar was reportedly behind sharply faster imported inflation. At the same time, the latest Caixin PMI showed a sustained upturn in China’s business conditions during the final quarter in 2016, which helped to limit job cuts. However, the improvement has yet to be accompanied by stronger growth in private investment, suggesting that businesses remain cautious. Expectations of slowing support from fiscal and monetary policies, as well as uncertainties concerning global trade growth, are among the economic headwinds in China this year. We’ll look for confirmation in official data this week, which include US inflation and retail sales numbers, Euro-area industrial output, as well as China’s latest data on inflation, credit growth, and trade. This is important because affirmation of the view that global growth is gathering momentum alongside rising prices will be hawkish for global monetary policy, especially for the US central bank. But another area of concerns that emerged is the extent to which the PMI surveys point to only weak increases in prices charged by businesses, suggesting that profit margins are being squeezed. This situation was particularly pronounced in emerging markets where the companies are facing higher oil prices and a weaker local currency against the US dollar. Tighter margins adversely influence companies’ hiring plans. Employment levels across emerging markets continued to fall, as firms prioritised cost management over staff expansion. On the foreign exchange front, daily midpoint fixes for the yuan will be closely monitored, as it may impact dollar movements. Although expectations of a steeper US rate hike trajectory and fiscal stimulus have been key drivers for dollar strength, PBOC’s move on the yuan hinted at concerns over a resurgence of large capital outflows. ― TODAY                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week World’s eight richest as wealthy as half of humanity, Oxfam tells Davos Trump threatens BMW with border tax on cars built in Mexico Job cuts, fewer flights?

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 7 January 2017 | MYT 8:45 PM Indonesia plans regulation to ensure bond dealers produce "factual" research JAKARTA: Indonesia is planning regulation to ensure primary bond dealers produce only "factual" research, senior government officials said, in a move that is likely to add to bankers' concerns about a growing backlash over negative investment commentary. The officials' remarks came after the Indonesian government cut its business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co following a November downgrade by the U.S. bank in its Indonesian stocks recommendation to "underweight" from "overweight". While Indonesia has subsequently sought to reassure banks and research firms that they will not be sanctioned for their assessment of the country as long as it is "credible", some Jakarta-based analysts at foreign banks have said they were becoming more cautious. Suahasil Nazara, the Finance Ministry's head of fiscal policy office, said on Friday that primary bond dealers have to ensure their assessments of Indonesia are based on facts and do not cause a disruption to the financial system. "The point is, the analysis has to be credible and correspond to factual data," Nazara said in a text message. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov. 25. The regulation will "hopefully" be released next week and will govern the accountability of analysis or the release of information, Robert Pakpahan, director-general of budget financing and risk management, said in a text message. "The publication of analysis and opinion that is inaccurate, speculative in nature and not based on facts will not be allowed," Pakpahan said, adding that the regulation has to be approved by the finance minister. In the JPMorgan case, the Finance Ministry dropped the U.S. bank's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. JPMorgan said in response that the impact on its clients was minimal and that it continued to operate its business as usual in Indonesia. FOREIGN OWNERSHIP Indonesia's sensitivity to negative commentary is likely enhanced due to the relatively high foreign ownership of its sovereign bonds and broader concerns over potential capital outflows, analysts have said. Emerging markets, including Indonesia, are vulnerable to potentially disruptive capital outflows as expectations of faster U.S. interest rate hikes and President-elect Donald Trump's promise of fiscal stimulus push the dollar higher. More protectionist trade policies under Trump could intensify that pressure. Foreigners hold more than 37 percent of Indonesia's government bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for the Southeast Asian nation. Foreign investors sold 20.15 trillion rupiah ($1.5 billion) of Indonesian government bonds in the three weeks after Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. JPMorgan's skirmish with the Indonesian government also highlights the conflicts that banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or a company. Banks ranging from Morgan Stanley in China to Banco Santander in Brazil have faced rows with governments in emerging markets, although the pressure has usually been less explicit than faced by JPMorgan in Indonesia. In some cases that had led to a chilling effect where analysts cut back on even run-of-the-mill research, leaving investors in the dark as to any risks or opportunities. David Sumual, chief economist at PT Bank Central Asia Tbk (BCA), said the "fire-wall" between the bank's business and research divisions had been reinforced since the global financial crisis in 2008. Sumual said his research is based on the data that is available to him, but "there's still a disclaimer that this can change from time to time and the ultimate decision still lies with the investors." BCA is Indonesia's biggest bank by market value and one of the country's primary dealers.

Stocks ended the week sharply higher as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03%  advanced 1% for the week but came up just short of touching the 20,000 mark; while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.18% finished up 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.48%  rallied 2.6%, both closing at fresh records on Friday. Since banks provided earnings growth in the third quarter—8% earnings growth for the sector compared with 3.1% S&P 500, according to FactSet data—investors are eager to see on how banks plan to remain a driver of the economy as well as the stock market. “The market is going to be expecting leadership going into the first quarter,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, in an interview. “But if they get cautious about a higher dollar or a rise in yields, you have to watch out for that.” Top banks reporting on Friday include Dow component J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.53% along with Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +1.49%  and Bank of America Corp. BAC, +0.39%   S&P 500 earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to grow by about 3% from the year-ago period, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet. Probably the biggest boost will come from the financial sector, which is projected to see growth of 13.8% That, however, will be helped by comparisons with “unusually low” earnings from both Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +0.19%  and American International Group Inc. AIG, +0.15%  in the year-ago quarter, Butters said. Excluding those companies, earnings for the sector is expected to grow 4.4%, he said. Two key areas to look for in bank earnings are trading revenues and loan growth, Pavlik said. A promise of deregulation by president-elect Donald Trump, if fulfilled, could boost trading activity, while the prospect of a faster pace of rate increases by the Federal Reserve may generate higher loan demand as borrowers seek to lock in interest rates while they are still low. Another earnings highlight will be Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, +0.67%  given the recent run-up in the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, +0.63% which was led in part by airlines. While the retail sector is not reporting earnings for another few weeks, retailers will be in focus Friday as December retails sales figures are released. Last week, retail stocks took a hit after Kohl’s Corp. KSS, -1.26% and Macy’s Inc. M, -0.33%  reported a weak holiday season, pressuring shares of traditional retailers and department stores across the board.

President-elect Donald Trump's personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image.  (DAMON WINTER / The New York Times)   By Thomas Black Frederic TomescoBloomberg Sat., Jan. 7, 2017 Ever since the U.S. presidential election, Ed Dahlberg has pretty much had a smile on his face. He brokers the sale of private jets, and already he’s seeing interest pick up and used-aircraft prices starting to firm up. The sale of a single-engine turboprop aircraft that he recently handled went for about 5 per cent more than anticipated. “My phone is ringing off the hook” from people interested in buying used jets, said Dahlberg, president of Emerald Aviation in the Washington suburb of Manassas, Virginia. “Just the business climate feels like it’s getting better.” The era of Donald Trump, a man long associated with conspicuous consumption, figures to be good to a whole range of luxury-goods industries. But perhaps nowhere is that excitement greater than in the private-aircraft business. Not only is Trump, whose personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image, seen as someone who will advocate for the industry, but he replaces a president who so often criticized private-air travel that he turned it into a taboo symbol of inequality and helped prolong an almost-decade-long sales slump. Article Continued Below “You’ll see more people not being gun shy or embarrassed or apologetic for operating a corporate jet,” said Steve Varsano, founder of broker The Jet Business. Demand for private jets is far from the heady days of more than 1,000 deliveries in 2007 and 2008, before the recession hit. In 2016, manufacturers were set to ship 655 jets, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimate, lower than 689 in both 2014 and 2015 after an oil boom that had boosted sales among drillers went bust. Used jet prices have tumbled 12 per cent since November 2015, the bank said. It’s far too early to see any sales pickup, of course, and the industry buzz of a comeback is just that at the moment. But investors are encouraged. Shares of private jet manufacturers have soared on Trump’s victory. Since Nov. 9, Textron gained 19 per cent, General Dynamics rose 12 per cent and Bombardier jumped 22 per cent. Aircraft sales amount to about 30 per cent of their revenue. “The Trump win looks positive for bizjet demand given the post-election stock surge, economic stimulus from an expected lower tax rate and less regulation, and shift away from Obama’s anti-bizjet rhetoric,” Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., wrote in a report earlier this month. Alain Bellemare, chief executive officer of Canadian planemaker Bombardier, said in an interview that in Trump he sees “somebody understanding the value of business aircraft and what it creates.” “Anybody who is pro-business, pro-growth, who will foster investment in infrastructure — it’s all good for our business,” he said. “So I hear the tone now and I’m optimistic.” Most of the manufacturing jobs to produce corporate jets are in North America, Bellemare said. That fits in with Trump’s theme of keeping factory workers in the U.S. Both Bombardier and Textron’s Cessna unit make aircraft in Wichita, Kansas. Bombardier also makes turboprop planes at its Downsview factory in Toronto. Gulfstream, the corporate jet unit of General Dynamics, has its factories in Savannah, Georgia. Even Brazilian jet producer Embraer SA manufactures planes in Melbourne, Florida. Trade groups have long argued that private aircraft are business tools that help executives save time and make multi-city visits they otherwise couldn’t with commercial flights. For security, some companies mandate their top officers fly on the corporate plane. That message was lost when auto executives flew to Washington in their private planes to request bailout money in November 2008, sparking a backlash as the economy careened into recession. A call from a Treasury Department official in 2009 persuaded Citigroup, which was getting U.S. government rescue funds, to drop plans to take delivery of a $50 million Falcon 7X aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation. In a 2011 press conference, Obama called out private jet owners six times to bash a tax break that allows corporate planes to be depreciated over five years instead of seven years for commercial airliners. The National Business Aviation Association sent the president a letter expressing “disappointment with the way you mischaracterized and disparaged business aviation.” But that was then, as broker Dahlberg sees it. “I’ve noticed that while there’s still a huge amount of inventory, people just don’t keep dropping the price every week,” he said. “You can really feel the floor in the market right now.” Read more about: Donald Trump, United States The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

 GLOBAL MARKETS-World stocks rise; dollar dips on U.S. labor data, yuan surge Reuters Jan. 5, 2017, 4:41 PM 29 facebook linkedin twitter email print * Amazon leads Nasdaq to record; S&P off on banks, retail * U.S. Treasury debt yields drop for third straight session * Chinese numbers add to upbeat factory data in Europe, U.S. * Dollar falls after unimpressive U.S. labor data, yuan surge * Oil rebounds as Saudi output cuts offset U.S. products build (Updates to U.S. market close) By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Global equity prices shrugged off weakness on Wall Street to cling to gains after hitting their highest level since mid-2015 on Thursday, bolstered by strong Chinese data that added to optimism about global growth and inflation. The dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies after U.S. inflation and unemployment data failed to reverse a downtrend that followed some of the biggest gains on record for China's yuan. U.S. Treasury debt yields slipped as investors grew risk-averse amid uncertainty about the incoming Trump administration. MSCI's world index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, rose 0.55 percent for a third straight day of gains. The index has been riding a wave of upbeat factory and service sector surveys out of the United States, Europe and Asia this week. Growth in China's services sector accelerated to a 17-month high in December, a private sector survey showed. The index, however, got little support from Wall Street as the S&P 500 closed slightly lower, weighed by financial shares and as investors dumped traditional retailers Macy's and Kohl's on dismal holiday sales numbers. Amazon powered the Nasdaq Composite to a record closing high. The S&P 500 financial index fell 1.02 percent due to declines in JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. "Financials coming down probably had something to do with bond yields coming down. A lot of the post-election rally was predicated on yields moving higher," said Jimmy Chang, chief investment strategist at Rockefeller & Co. Adding to the downbeat sentiment was a report by a payrolls processor which showed that U.S. private employers added fewer jobs than expected in December even as the U.S. labor market remained solid. Thursday's ADP report precedes Friday's nonfarm payrolls data, which includes hiring in both private and public sectors. "Overall it looks like investors will be in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the Labor Department report tomorrow," said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 42.87 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 19,899.29, the S&P 500 lost 1.75 points, or 0.08 percent, to finish at 2,269 and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.93 points, or 0.2 percent, to finish at 5,487.94. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.12 percent at 1,445.57. U.S. Treasury debt yields dropped broadly, falling for a third straight session. Yields should rise again despite weakness early in the year, although for the next few weeks they likely will be range-bound as investors wait to see results from the incoming Trump administration, said Justin Lederer, interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. "There's a lot of uncertainty until the next administration takes place," Lederer said. "We'll be in ranges until we know more about the Trump presidency." Buying in Treasuries also accelerated after the disappointing private sector payrolls data. The U.S. 10-year note was up 29/32 in price to yield 2.348 percent, compared with 2.452 percent late on Wednesday. The dollar slipped to a three-week low against a basket of currencies. China stepped into both its onshore and offshore yuan markets to shore up the faltering yuan, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 1.26 percent to 101.41. The dollar's retreat helped push gold to its highest in a month. Spot gold rose 1.43 percent to $1,180.01 an ounce. Oil prices rose in a choppy session, lifted by news that Saudi Arabia had cut production to meet OPEC's agreement to cut output. Prices had fallen earlier on data showing a surprisingly large increase in U.S. gasoline and distillate inventories. Brent crude settled up 43 cents, or 0.76 percent, at $56.89 a barrel, and U.S. crude settled up 50 cents, or 0.94 percent, at $53.76.

In a stark contrast to the relative inertia of white-collar law enforcement in Europe, Washington most recently brought the hammer down on Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, which sold junk-filled, mortgage-backed securities ahead of the 2008 financial meltdown. Deutsche Bank has agreed on a payout of $7.2 billion, while Credit Suisse settled for $5.3 billion to resolve American authorities’ allegations and avoid the lengthy headache of a trial. Instead of dragging financial firms to court, the US has taken them to the cashier. American giants have not been spared: JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America collectively have shelled out $40 billion to settle cases linked to toxic, crisis-era financial products. “There’s a kind of fundamentalism to US law,” said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel and the Washington-based Peterson Institute. “If you break the law, punishment comes down.” To be sure, British authorities have taken action over the Libor interest rate manipulation scandal but such retribution remains rare in the rest of Europe. “It isn’t so much a difference in the rules as in the manner in which they are applied. Things are much more severe in the United States,” Veron told AFP, adding that European countries “do not dare” punish their national flagship companies. The American legal framework nevertheless offers the United States the means to extend the long arm of the law well beyond its borders. In the most recent cases, the United States imposed $2.6 billion in criminal penalties on the Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht — most of which will be paid to Brazil — and a half billion on the Israeli generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical. Both the matters involved corruption occurring outside the United States. The United States pioneered the prosecution of such foreign bribery cases, adopting the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 1977 in the wake of the Watergate scandal, which allows US officials to hunt down corrupt payments abroad when the companies involved are traded on Wall Street or are otherwise exposed to US jurisdiction. In the decades since, member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have adopted similar laws but do not enforce them with the same vigor or frequency. Given the means and opportunity to apply its laws “extraterritorially” with such regularity, the United States has become a kind of worldwide anticorruption police force, and buttressed its geopolitical influence. “There’s a real nexus between economics and foreign affairs,” said Aaron Klein, head of the center on regulation and markets at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “The next war is more likely to be fought with bonds than with bombs.” In a different kind of case, Volkswagen’s sprawling emissions-cheating scandal also has shown the might of the US legal system and its ability to bring major companies to task. To compensate drivers and repair damage to the environment, the giant German automaker has agreed to pay out more than $15 billion so far, and doubtless will have to pay more before putting the scandal behind it. But the company still could face criminal charges. In Europe, authorities have also opened investigations into Volkswagen but by their own admission, the results will be much less spectacular. “In the European Union, the way to damages is more complicated than in the United States,” EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said in September. In the United States, authorities can be supported in their actions by so-called class-action lawsuits brought collectively by groups of private individuals who have been wronged, which can ratchet up pressure on companies. But this option does exist in Europe. European authorities meanwhile have not been completely dormant in dealing with major companies. They have opened numerous anti-trust investigations and intensified their pursuit of tax avoidance and evasion by multinational companies. Making perhaps its biggest splash till date, the European Commission at the end of August directed the iPhone maker Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($13.5 billion) in back taxes to Ireland, drawing the ire of a sizeable player: the United States.

The officials' remarks came after the Indonesian government cut its business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co following a November downgrade by the U.S. bank in its Indonesian stocks recommendation to "underweight" from "overweight". While Indonesia has subsequently sought to reassure banks and research firms that they will not be sanctioned for their assessment of the country as long as it is "credible", some Jakarta-based analysts at foreign banks have said they were becoming more cautious. Suahasil Nazara, the Finance Ministry's head of fiscal policy office, said on Friday that primary bond dealers have to ensure their assessments of Indonesia are based on facts and do not cause a disruption to the financial system. "The point is, the analysis has to be credible and correspond to factual data," Nazara said in a text message. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov. 25. The regulation will "hopefully" be released next week and will govern the accountability of analysis or the release of information, Robert Pakpahan, director-general of budget financing and risk management, said in a text message. "The publication of analysis and opinion that is inaccurate, speculative in nature and not based on facts will not be allowed," Pakpahan said, adding that the regulation has to be approved by the finance minister. In the JPMorgan case, the Finance Ministry dropped the U.S. bank's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. JPMorgan said in response that the impact on its clients was minimal and that it continued to operate its business as usual in Indonesia. FOREIGN OWNERSHIP Indonesia's sensitivity to negative commentary is likely enhanced due to the relatively high foreign ownership of its sovereign bonds and broader concerns over potential capital outflows, analysts have said. Emerging markets, including Indonesia, are vulnerable to potentially disruptive capital outflows as expectations of faster U.S. interest rate hikes and President-elect Donald Trump's promise of fiscal stimulus push the dollar higher. More protectionist trade policies under Trump could intensify that pressure. Foreigners hold more than 37 percent of Indonesia's government bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for the Southeast Asian nation. Foreign investors sold 20.15 trillion rupiah ($1.5 billion) of Indonesian government bonds in the three weeks after Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. JPMorgan's skirmish with the Indonesian government also highlights the conflicts that banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or a company. Banks ranging from Morgan Stanley in China to Banco Santander in Brazil have faced rows with governments in emerging markets, although the pressure has usually been less explicit than faced by JPMorgan in Indonesia. In some cases that had led to a chilling effect where analysts cut back on even run-of-the-mill research, leaving investors in the dark as to any risks or opportunities. David Sumual, chief economist at PT Bank Central Asia Tbk (BCA), said the "fire-wall" between the bank's business and research divisions had been reinforced since the global financial crisis in 2008. Sumual said his research is based on the data that is available to him, but "there's still a disclaimer that this can change from time to time and the ultimate decision still lies with the investors."

File Picture: REUTERS/ALY SONG Tokyo — Asian shares recovered to four-week highs on Friday as a surge in the dollar and its borrowing costs sparked by Donald Trump’s election eased, with the US 10-year yield slipping to one-month lows. The US dollar stayed near three-week lows against a basket of currencies though it bounced back a tad as the Chinese yuan gave up some of its massive gains made during the previous two days following Friday’s midpoint fixing by China’s central bank. "The market appears to be on risk-on mode. It could be because of stabilising US yields. It could be signs of stability in Europe, or a recovery in oil. Anything that has been battered by higher US rates is coming back," said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. MSCI’s gauge of the world’s stock markets hit its highest levels in a year and a half, having risen 1.8% since the start of year, helped by this week’s generally upbeat economic indicators in the US and China. In Asia, MSCI’s ex-Japan Asia-Pacific shares index rose 0.25% to its highest in four weeks. In contrast, Japan’s Nikkei, one of the best performers since Republican Trump won the US presidential election, dropped 0.4% as the yen gained versus the dollar. Trump’s victory sparked a major realignment in markets. Expectations that his administration will bring tax cuts, higher spending and deregulation have boosted US bond yields and the dollar, to the detriment of many emerging economies that have benefited from cheap dollar funding and had attracted trillions of dollars from investors shunning low US yields. "What’s going on is a correction of the ‘Trump trade’ since the election. The markets have been trying to fully price in his policies just based on hopes," said Koichi Yoshikawa, executive director of finance at Standard Chartered Bank in Tokyo. "From now on, it’s not going to be a simple one-way bet," he said. Already under pressure from profit taking as the Trump rally wanes, the dollar extended losses on Thursday as China stepped up efforts to support the yuan, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Trump’s January 20 inauguration. The cost of borrowing the yuan in Hong Kong, the main offshore yuan trading centre, sky-rocketed, making it too costly for speculators to sell the yuan against the dollar. The offshore yuan gained more than 2% in the last two sessions, the biggest two-day gain on record, to a two-month high of 6.7833 per dollar before it eased back about 0.5% in Asia on Friday to 6.8208. The dollar also slumped to a three-week low of ¥115,21, having shed 1.6% on Thursday, its biggest fall in five months. It bounced back 0.4% on Friday to ¥115.80. The euro also posted its biggest gain in seven months, of 1.1%, on Thursday and last fetched $1.0588. The dollar’s index against a basket of six major currencies tumbled to 101.30, falling more than 2% from its 14-year high of 103.82 set on Tuesday. Investors also rushed out of their selling positions in US bonds, one of the most convincing plays since the election, because Trump’s policies are seen as stoking inflation. The 10-year US Treasuries yield hit a one-month low of 2.344%, having fallen about 30 basis points from its two-year high of 2.641% touched on December 15. Investors also scaled back their expectations of the Fed’s rate hikes this year, with Federal Funds rate futures pricing in two rate hikes compared with two and a half at the peak in December. Markets largely shrugged off US economic data published on Thursday which was generally strong. The increase in private payrolls was on the weaker side of market expectations, however, raising some concerns about the upcoming jobs data due at 1.30pm GMT. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 Index dipped 0.1% as retailers such as Macy’s and Kohl’s slumped on weak holiday sales. Financials were also hit by a fall in US bond yields, but hi-tech shares, which have underperformed since Trump’s victory, partly on concerns about his rocky relationship with Silicon Valley, shone. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2% to hit a record high, led by gains in online retailer Amazon.com. Oil prices held firm, supported by news that Saudi Arabia had cut production to meet oil cartel Opec’s agreement to reduce output. International benchmark Brent crude futures stood at $56.89 a barrel, flat on the day and up 3.1% on the week. Reuters Please login or register to comment.

The US dollar stayed near three-week lows against a basket of currencies though it bounced back a tad as the Chinese yuan gave up some of its massive gains made during the previous two days following Friday’s midpoint fixing by China’s central bank. “The market appears to be on risk-on mode.

Average hourly earnings jumped by 2.9 percent in the 12 months through December, the most since the last recession ended in June 2009, according to the Labor Department's employment report released Friday in Washington. Workers in almost every category, from mining and construction to retail and education, saw paychecks rise from November. The 4.7 percent jobless rate remains close to a nine-year low, even with a tick up last month. Job and wage prospects would improve even more following any successful legislation aimed at stirring growth, such as tax cuts and infrastructure investment, as President-elect Donald Trump has promised. "The trend is clearly moving toward firmer wage growth," said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York. "The labor market is tight and getting tighter. I expect to see continued acceleration in wages this year." The encouraging news on worker pay underscores the next stage of the labor-market recovery, which was defined by years of wage stagnation amid strong growth in payrolls. Now, the economy is adding jobs at a slower pace and measures of slack are diminishing, meaning labor shortages may become more common. That makes a sustained acceleration in paychecks critical to boosting household income and supporting spending. Some cooling in the job market was apparent in the latest report. Payrolls climbed by 156,000 in December after 204,000 in November, and the participation rate increased to 62.7 percent, which may continue as more people are drawn into the labor force and find work. Other measures of slack improved, including a drop in the number of Americans working part-time who would rather have a full-time position. Calendar Quirk The December increase in wages followed a 2.5 percent advance the prior month. The improvement may have, in part, reflected the unwinding of a calendar quirk that muffled the November tally. Since the 15th of the month fell within the employment survey week, increases in bi-monthly pay are more likely to have been captured. Even so, year-over-year hourly earnings have accelerated in three of the past four months, and wages were up 0.4 percent from November, matching the fastest pace since last January. Among industries that posted the biggest hourly wage gains were mining and logging, rising 0.8 percent from the previous month, and retail, up 0.6 percent. Construction workers saw earnings increase 0.4 percent, as did Americans in leisure and hospitality. Production Workers Not everyone is getting excited just yet. Barclays Plc economists Rob Martin and Michael Gapen pointed out the more modest 2.5 percent year-over-year December gain in earnings for production and non-supervisory workers, which exclude managers. "Although the solid wage numbers in December are welcome, this month's data followed several months of relatively weak prints and do not change our view on wage growth," Martin and Gapen said in a note. "We continue to expect modest wage gains over the next year, as we see little slack in labor markets and expect the unemployment rate to continue its long-term trend decline." The pickup in wages, sustained over time, would also feed into broader price pressures. That would be consistent with the view that inflation continues to move toward the goal of the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates last month and expects to lift them three times this year. The strong wage gain for 2016 "strengthens the position of policy makers that think the Fed needs to get on with its normalization of official rates," Joe Carson, director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein LP, wrote in a note. Potential fiscal stimulus from Congress and the new administration in 2017 "should raise expectations of more wage and price gains. In short, the Fed is falling behind the curve and even more so if fiscal stimulus is enacted soon," he said.   ---   Bloomberg's Michelle Jamrisko and Patricia Laya contributed.

The reserves were enough to finance 8.8 months of retained imports and were 1.3 times the short-term external debt, said Bank Negara. The reserve levels took into account adjustments for forex revaluation and were supported by the current account surplus and inflows of foreign direct investment.

Business Higher wages lift stocks to record highs; Dow almost touches 20,000 New York Stock Exchange Richard Drew / Associated Press The Wall Street entrance of the New York Stock Exchange in 2014. The Wall Street entrance of the New York Stock Exchange in 2014. (Richard Drew / Associated Press) Associated Press The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. The Standard & Poor's 500 index and the Nasdaq composite rose to new record highs. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Read more: U.S. economy creates a modest 156,000 jobs in December » Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. Sam Stovall, a U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ, said there was good news for most industries. That's because workers are being paid more, but not enough to push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates quickly to stave off inflation. “Consumers are earning a bit more and as a result can spend more,” he said. “But people are not too worried the Fed will have to slam on the brakes.” The Dow peaked at 19,999.63 but then lost steam. It finished up 64.51 points, or 0.3%, at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4%, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6%, to 5,521.06. The small-cap Russell 2000 index slid 4.65 points, or 0.3%, to 1,367.28. Stocks finished the week with a big gain as investors remained optimistic about the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7%. That was a marked change from the first week of last year, when the index lost 6% as the market got off to its worst opening week in history. Neiman Marcus won't go public after all Shan Li High-end retailer Neiman Marcus has backed out of an initial public offering. The Dallas chain initially filed in 2015 to go public, but later said it would delay its plans until 2016. On Friday, Neiman Marcus said it has abandoned an IPO altogether after deciding that “it is not in its best interests.”... High-end retailer Neiman Marcus has backed out of an initial public offering. The Dallas chain initially filed in 2015 to go public, but later said it would delay its plans until 2016. On Friday, Neiman Marcus said it has abandoned an IPO altogether after deciding that “it is not in its best interests.”... (Shan Li) The biggest gains went to companies that stand to benefit from higher wages and greater spending by consumers. Among technology companies, Facebook rose 2.3% to $123.41 and Apple rose 1.1% to $117.91. Amazon had its second big gain in a row, climbing 2% to $795.99, and travel website TripAdvisor jumped 3.2% to $50.77. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the November election, also fared well. Machinery and equipment maker Honeywell rose 1.5% to $118.53. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.42% from 2.35%. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which enable banks to make more money on lending. Investment banks and other financial firms did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. SunTrust Banks rose 1.1% to $55.53 and Goldman Sachs climbed 1.5% to $244.90. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies and real estate investment trusts, lagged behind the overall market as bond yields rose. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T fell 2% to $41.32 and Crown Castle International fell 2% to $85.50. Amgen climbed 2.5% to $156.78, Sanofi fell 2.8% to $40.32 and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals sank 5.8% to $358.68 after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron's cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they would appeal the ruling, which came in U.S. District Court in Delaware. ICU Medical slumped 10.5% to $131.88 after the San Clemente maker of medical devices said sales at a business it is buying are still falling. Gap ticked up 0.4% to $23.34 after the San Francisco clothier reported improved sales in November and December.

The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. Sam Stovall, a U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ, said there was good news for most industries. That's because workers are being paid more, but the report won't push the Fed to raise rates quickly in order to stave off inflation. "Consumers are earning a bit more and as a result can spend more," he said. "But ... people are not too worried the Fed will have to slam on the brakes." At about 12:40 p.m. the Dow peaked at 19,999.63, but later lost steam. It finished up 64.51 points, or 0.3 percent, at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06. The small-cap Russell 2000 index slid 4.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,367.28. Stocks finished the week with a big gain as investors remained optimistic about the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7 percent. That was a marked change from last year, when the index lost 6 percent as the market got off to its worst opening week in history. The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, which was solid but slightly disappointing. However the government said hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from December 2015, the biggest monthly increase in seven years. Overall, job growth remained steady in 2016 but slowed a bit from 2015. The biggest gains went to companies that stand to benefit from higher wages and greater spending by consumers. Among technology companies, Facebook rose $2.74, or 2.3 percent, to $123.41 and Apple gained $1.30, or 1.1 percent, to $117.91. Amazon had its second big gain in a row and added $15.54, or 2 percent, to $795.99 while travel website TripAdvisor picked up $1.57, or 3.2 percent, to $50.77. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election two months ago, also fared well. Machinery and equipment maker Honeywell rose $1.77, or 1.5 percent, to $118.53. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.42 percent from 2.35 percent. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money on lending. Investment banks and other financial firms did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. SunTrust Banks rose 63 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $55.53 and Goldman Sachs jumped $3.58, or 1.5 percent, to $244.90. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies and real estate investment trusts, lagged the market as bond yields rose. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T gave up 84 cents, or 2 percent, to $41.32 and Crown Castle International fell $1.74, or 2 percent, to $85.50. Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron's cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling, which came from U.S. District Court in Delaware. Amgen stock gained $3.80, or 2.5 percent, to $156.78 while Regeneron slid $22.24, or 5.8 percent, to $358.68 and Sanofi lost $1.18, or 2.8 percent, to $40.32. The dollar rose to 117.02 yen from 115.62 yen after a dip Thursday. The euro slipped to $1.0532 from $1.0590. U.S. crude oil rose 23 cents to close at $53.99 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 21 cents to close at $57.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slipped less than 1 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.70 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1 cent to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $7.90 to $1,173.40 an ounce. Silver sank 12 cents to $16.52 an ounce. Copper rose 1 cent to $2.55 a pound. The FTSE 100 index in Britain inched up 0.2 percent. It's risen nine days in a row and is at all-time highs. Germany's DAX edged up 0.1 percent and the CAC-40 of France rose 0.2 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3 percent while the Kospi in South Korea added 0.4 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng advanced 0.2 percent.

The Telegraph reports that the boss of Wall Street giant JP Morgan has warned the French president that the country is unlikely to lure banking jobs away from London after Brexit unless the nation overhauls employment legislation. Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan’s respected chief executive, is said to have told Francois Hollande in October that France must loosen its tight labour laws, which currently make it difficult for banks to recruit and shed staff, if Paris is to rival London as a financial hub. Dimon is believed to have been seeking a change of legislation specifically regarding the employment of high-paid staff at financial firms. The comments were made in a meeting between Mr Hollande, Mr Dimon, and a host of advisers to JP Morgan. They are significant as competition is now hotting up among cities around the world to attract financial services jobs away from the City in the wake of the June vote for the UK to leave the European Union.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The Dow Jones industrial average is trading closer than ever to the 20,000 mark Friday as U.S. stock indexes close in on all-time highs following a shaky start. The federal government's December jobs report showed that wages jumped by the largest amount in seven years, though hiring was a bit weaker than expected. Technology and industrial companies are making the biggest gains. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 88 points, or 0.4 percent, to 19,987 as of 12:50 p.m. Eastern time. It traded above 19,999 earlier. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,280. The Nasdaq composite jumped 42 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,530. All three indexes are on pace for record closes. The small-cap Russell 2000 index added 2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,373. US JOBS: The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, slightly less than analysts expected. That follows a private payrolls report Thursday that also didn't quite meet expectations. However the government said hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from December 2015, the biggest increase in seven years. Overall, job growth remained steady in 2016 but slowed a bit from 2015. LEADING: Big names in technology moved higher after an initial stumble. Facebook rose $2.81, or 2.3 percent, to $123.48 while Apple gained $1.39, or 1.2 percent, to $118. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election two months ago, also fared well. General Electric rose 20 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $31.72 and Honeywell rose $1.76, or 1.5 percent, to $118.52. Johnson Controls climbed $1.04, or 2.5 percent, to $42.98. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.41 percent from 2.35 percent. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money on lending. Banks did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. JPMorgan Chase added 39 cents to $86.50. Among other financial firms, Goldman Sachs jumped $4, or 1.7 percent, to $245.32. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies, utilities and household goods makers, lagged the market. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T gave up 69 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $41.47 and Wal-Mart fell 92 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $68.29. DAY IN COURT: Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron's cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling, which came from U.S. District Court in Delaware. Amgen stock gained $5.20, or 3.4 percent, to $158.18 while Regeneron slid $21.62, or 5.7 percent, to $39.30 and Sanofi lost $1.07, or 2. percent, to $40.43. ICU FALLING: Medical device maker ICU Medical sank as the company said a business it is buying continues to weaken. It agreed to buy an infusion systems business from Pfizer in October. ICU will pay less money, but it said the division's sales are still falling, so it expects less profit from the deal. Its stock lost $14.50, or 9.8 percent, to $132.85. INTO THE GAP: Gap climbed after reporting that its sales improved over the holidays. The company said sales at older Gap and Old Navy stores both improved in December and said its annual profit should be a bit higher than it expected. The stock rose 31 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $23.56. Gap and other retailers slumped Thursday after Macy's and Kohl's posted weak November and December sales and cut their forecasts. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 116.97 yen from 115.62 yen after a dip on Thursday. The euro slipped to $1.0542 from $1.0590. The stronger dollar sent precious metals prices a bit lower. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 25 cents to $54.01 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 18 cents to $57.07 a barrel in London. OVERSEAS: Germany's DAX edged up 0.1 percent and the FTSE 100 in Britain inched up 0.2 percent. It's risen nine days in a row and is at all-time highs. The CAC-40 of France was 0.1 percent lower. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3 percent while the Kospi in South Korea added 0.4 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng advanced 0.2 percent.   © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

You will now receive the Pursuits newsletter Average hourly earnings jumped by 2.9 percent in the 12 months through December, the most since the last recession ended in June 2009, according to the Labor Department’s employment report released Friday in Washington. Workers in almost every category, from mining and construction to retail and education, saw paychecks rise from November. The 4.7 percent jobless rate remains close to a nine-year low, even with a tick up last month. Job and wage prospects would improve even more following any successful legislation aimed at stirring growth, such as tax cuts and infrastructure investment, as President-elect Donald Trump has promised. “The trend is clearly moving toward firmer wage growth,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York. “The labor market is tight and getting tighter. I expect to see continued acceleration in wages this year.” The encouraging news on worker pay underscores the next stage of the labor-market recovery, which was defined by years of wage stagnation amid strong growth in payrolls. Now, the economy is adding jobs at a slower pace and measures of slack are diminishing, meaning labor shortages may become more common. That makes a sustained acceleration in paychecks critical to boosting household income and supporting spending. Some cooling in the job market was apparent in the latest report. Payrolls climbed by 156,000 in December after 204,000 in November, and the participation rate increased to 62.7 percent, which may continue as more people are drawn into the labor force and find work. Other measures of slack improved, including a drop in the number of Americans working part-time who would rather have a full-time position. The December report revealed that the uptick in the unemployment rate was a positive: More Americans joined the labor force but had not yet found jobs, according to the government’s labor flows data. The number of people who were jobless and gave up looking for work declined to a three-month low. One caveat: fewer people who were already in the labor force but unemployed were able to find jobs. Calendar Quirk The December increase in wages followed a 2.5 percent advance the prior month. The improvement may have, in part, reflected the unwinding of a calendar quirk that muffled the November tally. Since the 15th of the month fell within the employment survey week, increases in bi-monthly pay are more likely to have been captured. Even so, year-over-year hourly earnings have accelerated in three of the past four months, and wages were up 0.4 percent from November, matching the fastest pace since last January. Among industries that posted the biggest hourly wage gains were mining and logging, rising 0.8 percent from the previous month, and retail, up 0.6 percent. Construction workers saw earnings increase 0.4 percent, as did Americans in leisure and hospitality. Production Workers Not everyone is getting excited just yet. Barclays Plc economists Rob Martin and Michael Gapen pointed out the more modest 2.5 percent year-over-year December gain in earnings for production and non-supervisory workers, which exclude managers. “Although the solid wage numbers in December are welcome, this month’s data followed several months of relatively weak prints and do not change our view on wage growth,” Martin and Gapen said in a note. “We continue to expect modest wage gains over the next year, as we see little slack in labor markets and expect the unemployment rate to continue its long-term trend decline.” The pickup in wages, sustained over time, would also feed into broader price pressures. That would be consistent with the view that inflation continues to move toward the goal of the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates last month and expects to lift them three times this year. The strong wage gain for 2016 “strengthens the position of policy makers that think the Fed needs to get on with its normalization of official rates,” Joe Carson, director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein LP, wrote in a note. Potential fiscal stimulus from Congress and the new administration in 2017 “should raise expectations of more wage and price gains. In short, the Fed is falling behind the curve and even more so if fiscal stimulus is enacted soon,” he said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

U.S. stocks are dipping Friday, Jan. 6, 2017, after a solid but unspectacular hiring report for the month of December. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Posted: Friday, January 6, 2017 11:39 am | Updated: 7:27 am, Sat Jan 7, 2017. Higher wages push stocks to records, but Dow misses 20,000 Associated Press | 0 comments NEW YORK (AP) — So close! The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. Sam Stovall, a U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ, said there was good news for most industries. That's because workers are being paid more, but the report won't push the Fed to raise rates quickly in order to stave off inflation. "Consumers are earning a bit more and as a result can spend more," he said. "But ... people are not too worried the Fed will have to slam on the brakes." At about 12:40 p.m. the Dow peaked at 19,999.63, but later lost steam. It finished up 64.51 points, or 0.3 percent, at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06. The small-cap Russell 2000 index slid 4.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,367.28. Stocks finished the week with a big gain as investors remained optimistic about the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7 percent. That was a marked change from last year, when the index lost 6 percent as the market got off to its worst opening week in history. The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, which was solid but slightly disappointing. However the government said hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from December 2015, the biggest monthly increase in seven years. Overall, job growth remained steady in 2016 but slowed a bit from 2015. The biggest gains went to companies that stand to benefit from higher wages and greater spending by consumers. Among technology companies, Facebook rose $2.74, or 2.3 percent, to $123.41 and Apple gained $1.30, or 1.1 percent, to $117.91. Amazon had its second big gain in a row and added $15.54, or 2 percent, to $795.99 while travel website TripAdvisor picked up $1.57, or 3.2 percent, to $50.77. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election two months ago, also fared well. Machinery and equipment maker Honeywell rose $1.77, or 1.5 percent, to $118.53. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.42 percent from 2.35 percent. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money on lending. Investment banks and other financial firms did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. SunTrust Banks rose 63 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $55.53 and Goldman Sachs jumped $3.58, or 1.5 percent, to $244.90. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies and real estate investment trusts, lagged the market as bond yields rose. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T gave up 84 cents, or 2 percent, to $41.32 and Crown Castle International fell $1.74, or 2 percent, to $85.50. Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron's cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling, which came from U.S. District Court in Delaware. Amgen stock gained $3.80, or 2.5 percent, to $156.78 while Regeneron slid $22.24, or 5.8 percent, to $358.68 and Sanofi lost $1.18, or 2.8 percent, to $40.32. The dollar rose to 117.02 yen from 115.62 yen after a dip Thursday. The euro slipped to $1.0532 from $1.0590. U.S. crude oil rose 23 cents to close at $53.99 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 21 cents to close at $57.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slipped less than 1 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.70 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1 cent to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $7.90 to $1,173.40 an ounce. Silver sank 12 cents to $16.52 an ounce. Copper rose 1 cent to $2.55 a pound. The FTSE 100 index in Britain inched up 0.2 percent. It's risen nine days in a row and is at all-time highs. Germany's DAX edged up 0.1 percent and the CAC-40 of France rose 0.2 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3 percent while the Kospi in South Korea added 0.4 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng advanced 0.2 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay © 2017 The Associated Press.

Ever since the U.S. presidential election, Ed Dahlberg has pretty much had a smile on his face. He brokers the sale of private jets, and already he's seeing interest pick up and used-aircraft prices starting to firm up. The sale of a single-engine turboprop aircraft that he recently handled went for about 5 percent more than anticipated. "My phone is ringing off the hook" from people interested in buying used jets, said Dahlberg, president of Emerald Aviation in the Washington suburb of Manassas, Virginia. "Just the business climate feels like it's getting better." The era of Donald Trump, a man long associated with conspicuous consumption, figures to be good to a whole range of luxury-goods industries. But perhaps nowhere is that excitement greater than in the private-aircraft business. Not only is Trump, whose personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image, seen as someone who'll be an advocate for the industry but he replaces a president who so often criticized private-air travel that he turned it into a taboo symbol of inequality and helped prolong an almost-decade-long sales slump. "You'll see more people not being gun shy or embarrassed or apologetic for operating a corporate jet," said Steve Varsano, founder of broker The Jet Business. Demand for private jets is far from the heady days of more than 1,000 deliveries in 2007 and 2008, before the recession hit. In 2016, manufacturers were set to ship 655 jets, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimate, lower than 689 in both 2014 and 2015 after an oil boom that had boosted sales among drillers went bust. Used jet prices have tumbled 12 percent since November 2015, the bank said. It's far too early to see any sales pickup, of course, and the industry buzz of a comeback is just that at the moment. But investors are encouraged. Shares of private jet manufacturers have soared on Trump's victory. Since Nov. 9, Textron gained 19 percent, General Dynamics rose 12 percent and Bombardier jumped 22 percent. Aircraft sales amount to about 30 percent of their revenue. "The Trump win looks positive for bizjet demand given the post-election stock surge, economic stimulus from an expected lower tax rate and less regulation, and shift away from Obama's anti-bizjet rhetoric," Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., wrote in a report earlier this month. Alain Bellemare, chief executive officer of Canadian planemaker Bombardier, said in an interview that in Trump he sees "somebody understanding the value of business aircraft and what it creates." "Anybody who is pro-business, pro-growth, who will foster investment in infrastructure -- it's all good for our business," he said. "So I hear the tone now and I'm optimistic." Most of the manufacturing jobs to produce corporate jets are in North America, Bellemare said. That fits in with Trump's theme of keeping factory workers in the U.S. Both Bombardier and Textron's Cessna unit make aircraft in Wichita, Kansas. Gulfstream, the corporate jet unit of General Dynamics, has its factories in Savannah, Georgia. Even Brazilian jet producer Embraer SA manufactures planes in Melbourne, Florida. Trade groups have long argued that private aircraft are business tools that help executives save time and make multi-city visits they otherwise couldn't with commercial flights. For security, some companies mandate their top officers fly on the corporate plane. That message was lost when auto executives flew to Washington in their private planes to request bailout money in November 2008, sparking a backlash as the economy careened into recession. A call from a Treasury Department official in 2009 persuaded Citigroup, which was getting U.S. government rescue funds, to drop plans to take delivery of a $50 million Falcon 7X aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation. In a 2011 press conference, Obama called out private jet owners six times to bash a tax break that allows corporate planes to be depreciated over five years instead of seven years for commercial airliners. The National Business Aviation Association sent the president a letter expressing "disappointment with the way you mischaracterized and disparaged business aviation." But that was then, as broker Dahlberg sees it. "I've noticed that while there's still a huge amount of inventory, people just don't keep dropping the price every week," he said. "You can really feel the floor in the market right now." × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

FILE - This Thursday, Oct. 2, 2014, file photo shows the Wall Street entrance of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are dipping Friday, Jan. 6, 2017, after a solid but unspectacular hiring report for the month of December. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK – The Dow Jones industrial average is trading closer than ever to the 20,000 mark Friday as U.S. stock indexes close in on all-time highs following a shaky start. The federal government’s December jobs report showed that wages jumped by the largest amount in seven years, though hiring was a bit weaker than expected. Technology and industrial companies are making the biggest gains. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 88 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 19,987 as of 12:50 p.m. Eastern time. It traded above 19,999 earlier. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 12 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,280. The Nasdaq composite jumped 42 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 5,530. All three indexes are on pace for record closes. The small-cap Russell 2000 index added 2 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 1,373. US JOBS: The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, slightly less than analysts expected. That follows a private payrolls report Thursday that also didn’t quite meet expectations. However the government said hourly pay jumped 2.9 per cent from December 2015, the biggest increase in seven years. Overall, job growth remained steady in 2016 but slowed a bit from 2015. LEADING: Big names in technology moved higher after an initial stumble. Facebook rose $2.81, or 2.3 per cent, to $123.48 while Apple gained $1.39, or 1.2 per cent, to $118. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election two months ago, also fared well. General Electric rose 20 cents, or 0.6 per cent, to $31.72 and Honeywell rose $1.76, or 1.5 per cent, to $118.52. Johnson Controls climbed $1.04, or 2.5 per cent, to $42.98. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.41 per cent from 2.35 per cent. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money on lending. Banks did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. JPMorgan Chase added 39 cents to $86.50. Among other financial firms, Goldman Sachs jumped $4, or 1.7 per cent, to $245.32. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies, utilities and household goods makers, lagged the market. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T gave up 69 cents, or 1.6 per cent, to $41.47 and Wal-Mart fell 92 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $68.29. DAY IN COURT: Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron’s cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling, which came from U.S. District Court in Delaware. Amgen stock gained $5.20, or 3.4 per cent, to $158.18 while Regeneron slid $21.62, or 5.7 per cent, to $39.30 and Sanofi lost $1.07, or 2. per cent, to $40.43. ICU FALLING: Medical device maker ICU Medical sank as the company said a business it is buying continues to weaken. It agreed to buy an infusion systems business from Pfizer in October. ICU will pay less money, but it said the division’s sales are still falling, so it expects less profit from the deal. Its stock lost $14.50, or 9.8 per cent, to $132.85. INTO THE GAP: Gap climbed after reporting that its sales improved over the holidays. The company said sales at older Gap and Old Navy stores both improved in December and said its annual profit should be a bit higher than it expected. The stock rose 31 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $23.56. Gap and other retailers slumped Thursday after Macy’s and Kohl’s posted weak November and December sales and cut their forecasts. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 116.97 yen from 115.62 yen after a dip on Thursday. The euro slipped to $1.0542 from $1.0590. The stronger dollar sent precious metals prices a bit lower. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 25 cents to $54.01 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 18 cents to $57.07 a barrel in London. OVERSEAS: Germany’s DAX edged up 0.1 per cent and the FTSE 100 in Britain inched up 0.2 per cent. It’s risen nine days in a row and is at all-time highs. The CAC-40 of France was 0.1 per cent lower. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3 per cent while the Kospi in South Korea added 0.4 per cent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng advanced 0.2 per cent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

The federal government’s December jobs report showed that wages jumped by the largest amount in seven years, though hiring was a bit weaker than expected. Technology and industrial companies are making the biggest gains. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 88 points, or 0.4 percent, to 19,987 as of 12:50 p.m. Eastern time. It traded above 19,999 earlier. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,280. The Nasdaq composite jumped 42 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,530. All three indexes are on pace for record closes. The small-cap Russell 2000 index added 2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,373. US JOBS: The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, slightly less than analysts expected. That follows a private payrolls report Thursday that also didn’t quite meet expectations. However the government said hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from December 2015, the biggest increase in seven years. Overall, job growth remained steady in 2016 but slowed a bit from 2015. LEADING: Big names in technology moved higher after an initial stumble. Facebook rose $2.81, or 2.3 percent, to $123.48 while Apple gained $1.39, or 1.2 percent, to $118. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election two months ago, also fared well. General Electric rose 20 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $31.72 and Honeywell rose $1.76, or 1.5 percent, to $118.52. Johnson Controls climbed $1.04, or 2.5 percent, to $42.98. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.41 percent from 2.35 percent. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money on lending. Banks did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. JPMorgan Chase added 39 cents to $86.50. Among other financial firms, Goldman Sachs jumped $4, or 1.7 percent, to $245.32. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies, utilities and household goods makers, lagged the market. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T gave up 69 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $41.47 and Wal-Mart fell 92 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $68.29. DAY IN COURT: Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron’s cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling, which came from U.S. District Court in Delaware. Amgen stock gained $5.20, or 3.4 percent, to $158.18 while Regeneron slid $21.62, or 5.7 percent, to $39.30 and Sanofi lost $1.07, or 2. percent, to $40.43.

ICU will pay less money, but it said the division’s sales are still falling, so it expects less profit from the deal. Its stock lost $14.50, or 9.8 percent, to $132.85.

U.S. stocks are dipping Friday, Jan. 6, 2017, after a solid but unspectacular hiring report for the month of December. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Share story By MARLEY JAY The Associated Press NEW YORK (AP) — So close! The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. Sam Stovall, a U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ, said there was good news for most industries. That’s because workers are being paid more, but the report won’t push the Fed to raise rates quickly in order to stave off inflation.

It finished up 64.51 points, or 0.3 percent, at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06. The small-cap Russell 2000 index slid 4.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,367.28. Stocks finished the week with a big gain as investors remained optimistic about the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7 percent. That was a marked change from last year, when the index lost 6 percent as the market got off to its worst opening week in history. The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, which was solid but slightly disappointing. However the government said hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from December 2015, the biggest monthly increase in seven years. Overall, job growth remained steady in 2016 but slowed a bit from 2015. The biggest gains went to companies that stand to benefit from higher wages and greater spending by consumers. Among technology companies, Facebook rose $2.74, or 2.3 percent, to $123.41 and Apple gained $1.30, or 1.1 percent, to $117.91. Amazon had its second big gain in a row and added $15.54, or 2 percent, to $795.99 while travel website TripAdvisor picked up $1.57, or 3.2 percent, to $50.77. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election two months ago, also fared well. Machinery and equipment maker Honeywell rose $1.77, or 1.5 percent, to $118.53. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.42 percent from 2.35 percent. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money on lending. Investment banks and other financial firms did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. SunTrust Banks rose 63 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $55.53 and Goldman Sachs jumped $3.58, or 1.5 percent, to $244.90. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies and real estate investment trusts, lagged the market as bond yields rose. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T gave up 84 cents, or 2 percent, to $41.32 and Crown Castle International fell $1.74, or 2 percent, to $85.50. Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron’s cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling, which came from U.S. District Court in Delaware.

The company said sales at older Gap and Old Navy stores both improved in December and said its annual profit should be a bit higher than it expected.

That is fourth-quarter earnings results. While the true benefits of the Trump administration initiatives are yet to be realized, the increase in interest rates is a positive, and any increase in overall business could push earnings above current expectations. In a new Deutsche Bank research report from Matt O’Connor and his outstanding team, they make the case that a strong finish to the year in both fixed-income trading and the debt capital markets could present upside possibilities, versus management comments made last month. We screened the Deutsche Bank bank research universe and found four companies that may be just the kind of institutions that could benefit from a solid debt-trading scenario. All are rated Buy at Deutsche Bank. Goldman Sachs This continues to be the gold standard of Wall Street banks and trades at a reasonable 13 times estimated 2017 earnings. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) has a gigantic institutional equity, debt and derivatives business, an ultra-high net worth clientele, top investment banking and capital markets expertise. The bank continues to be a dominant force around the world and is one of the most sought after in the world. And it is one of the very few that dictate who can be a client at the firm. In investment banking, the company has the preeminent client franchise. Goldman Sachs advised on more than $1.5 trillion of announced mergers and acquisitions transactions last year, the highest level the bank has ever recorded. It also has maintained a leading market share over the past 25 years. It maintained a market position when merger and acquisition activity was dominated by technology in 1999, by financials in 2008 and by natural resources in 2014. The bottom line is, regardless of where market strength is in any given year, Goldman Sachs is up to the task. Goldman Sachs reported third-quarter numbers that hammered analysts’ estimates. And an improving capital market bodes well for a firm that is a leader in the IPO world. Goldman Sachs shareholders receive a 1.09% dividend. The Deutsche Bank price target for the stock is $255, and the Wall Street consensus target is $227.12. The stock closed Thursday at $241.32 JPMorgan This stock trades at a reasonable 13.3 times estimated 2017 forward earnings and could respond well in a rising rate scenario. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) is expected to continue to benefit from commercial loan growth and an upturn in capital spending. Wall Street analysts agree that the stock seems attractively valued on estimated price-to-earnings and a very solid price-to-book value. Some on Wall Street have cautioned that last year’s divestiture of the physical commodities business could provide earnings headwinds throughout this year. The company also reported outstanding third-quarter results, and top Wall Street analysts think the results are sustainable going forward. The Deutsche Bank estimates for the bank are above the Wall Street consensus number. Despite being a crowded trade, many analysts feel that the bank’s superior earnings growth should continue stock outperformance. Improvement in loan growth, terrific equity capital markets and a steady increase in deposits will be a solid plus. Trading at a discount to many of the large cap banks on 2016 earnings estimates helps upside potential as well. With $2.6 trillion in assets on a worldwide basis, and one of Wall Street’s savviest leaders in Jamie Dimon, the stock is a solid buy for investors. Last year, Dimon put his money where his mouth was and reportedly bought a stunning 500,000 shares of JPMorgan stock for a massive $26 million. That brought his total holdings in the bank to 6.7 million shares, worth over $360 million. Investors receive a 2.25% dividend. The $90 Deutsche Bank price target compares with the consensus target of $80.45. Shares closed yesterday at $86.11.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo    5408979 Wells Fargo is the latest multinational bank to announce that it is raising its minimum wage for U.S. workers, according to recent reports. Wells Fargo is upping its minimum wage from $12 an hour to $13.50, and this change will take effect Sunday. The increase will initially impact 25,000 mid-to-entry level employees, including bank tellers, phone bankers, and customer service representatives. Minimum pay will range from just over $13 an hour, and go as high as $17 an hour. Wells Fargo’s old pay range is between $12 and $16, the Charlotte Observer reports. Many big banks are making the move towards higher minimum wages, in hopes to retain talent in an industry that is both ultra-competitive and becoming increasingly mechanized. JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon announced in July that the firm would raise minimum pay for 18,000 low-tier employees somewhere “between $12 and $16.50 an hour for full-time, part-time and new employees, depending on geographic and market factors.” Dimon hopes the raise will “attract and retain talented people.” Bank of America also plans to raise its minimum wage to $15, up from $13.50 an hour. (RELATED: The Death Of The Banker) Wells Fargo insists the pay raise is not in any way a public relations response to recent scandals. “This is part of our normal course of business where we understand what’s happening in the competitive landscape and how we retain and attract top talent,” a Wells Fargo spokeswoman told reporters. Wells Fargo made a big splash when news broke that the firm may have committed fraud against thousands of customers nationwide. Bank employees issued 565,000 lines of credit and opened 1.5 million bank accounts for customers without their consent between 2011-2014, and sometimes created false email addresses to sign them up for banking services in order to pad numbers. Some 14,000 of those credit accounts accrued over $400,000 in fees alone. (RELATED: DOJ Demands Wells Fargo Whistleblower Testify In Formal Investigation) Initially, Wells Fargo was slapped by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) with a $185 million fine — the largest ever imposed by the federal agency — after finding the practices in question were rampant and pervasive throughout Wells Fargo’s business model in the years since 2011. After undergoing through a lengthy investigatory process, the bank settled the scandal by removing former chief executive John Stumpf. In recent weeks, the bank launched a campaign to make good with customers and with the public.

The officials' remarks came after the Indonesian government cut its business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co following a November downgrade by the U.S. bank in its Indonesian stocks recommendation to "underweight" from "overweight". While Indonesia has subsequently sought to reassure banks and research firms that they will not be sanctioned for their assessment of the country as long as it is "credible", some Jakarta-based analysts at foreign banks have said they were becoming more cautious. Suahasil Nazara, the Finance Ministry's head of fiscal policy office, said on Friday that primary bond dealers have to ensure their assessments of Indonesia are based on facts and do not cause a disruption to the financial system. "The point is, the analysis has to be credible and correspond to factual data," Nazara said in a text message. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov. 25. The regulation will "hopefully" be released next week and will govern the accountability of analysis or the release of information, Robert Pakpahan, director-general of budget financing and risk management, said in a text message. "The publication of analysis and opinion that is inaccurate, speculative in nature and not based on facts will not be allowed," Pakpahan said, adding that the regulation has to be approved by the finance minister. In the JPMorgan case, the Finance Ministry dropped the U.S. bank's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. JPMorgan said in response that the impact on its clients was minimal and that it continued to operate its business as usual in Indonesia. FOREIGN OWNERSHIP Indonesia's sensitivity to negative commentary is likely enhanced due to the relatively high foreign ownership of its sovereign bonds and broader concerns over potential capital outflows, analysts have said. Emerging markets, including Indonesia, are vulnerable to potentially disruptive capital outflows as expectations of faster U.S. interest rate hikes and President-elect Donald Trump's promise of fiscal stimulus push the dollar higher. More protectionist trade policies under Trump could intensify that pressure. Foreigners hold more than 37 percent of Indonesia's government bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for the Southeast Asian nation. Foreign investors sold 20.15 trillion rupiah ($1.5 billion) of Indonesian government bonds in the three weeks after Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. JPMorgan's skirmish with the Indonesian government also highlights the conflicts that banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or a company. Banks ranging from Morgan Stanley in China to Banco Santander in Brazil have faced rows with governments in emerging markets, although the pressure has usually been less explicit than faced by JPMorgan in Indonesia. In some cases that had led to a chilling effect where analysts cut back on even run-of-the-mill research, leaving investors in the dark as to any risks or opportunities. David Sumual, chief economist at PT Bank Central Asia Tbk (BCA), said the "fire-wall" between the bank's business and research divisions had been reinforced since the global financial crisis in 2008. Sumual said his research is based on the data that is available to him, but "there's still a disclaimer that this can change from time to time and the ultimate decision still lies with the investors." BCA is Indonesia's biggest bank by market value and one of the country's primary dealers.

By Monica Eaton-Cardone January 6, 2017 - 10:30 am Share: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Google+ Email During 2015, UK online retailers took over £114bn in sales, a figure expected to rise to £126bn by the end of 2016. Convenience to pay and shop almost anywhere and anytime is fuelling unprecedented levels of online spending. But beneath the rose-tinted façade of such huge growth, what is happening to internet retailers behind the scenes? It’s well known that fraudsters are attracted to opportunity, and with billions to play for, it’s no surprise that internet retailing has become one of the most attractive areas to target. The threat of chargebacks: who is in danger? According to JP Morgan Chase, retailers saw 7% transaction growth last year, but chargebacks increased by a massive 20%. Aité Group reports that this results in more than £30 billion in losses for the retail industry and banking sector. However, chargebacks affect each merchant differently. Rates can fluctuate based on a business’s policies and operations, as well as the products or services being offered. Despite overall trends, when it comes to individual industries, there is still a distinct pattern. At Chargebacks911, we’ve analysed our global data across industries, enabling us to decipher the problem areas in UK retail when it comes to chargebacks. Digital goods: Following global trends, the digital goods sector is the hardest hit in the UK. Our data revealed that as much as 24% of all UK digital purchases over the final three months of 2015 were hit by chargebacks. Diet and nutrition: Chargebacks affected over 13% of purchases in the diet and nutrition product sector in the same period. Beauty: In the beauty industry, 12.1% of purchases resulted in a chargeback. These statistics are alarming. Considering card networks take punitive action when chargeback rates exceed a mere 1% of total sales, retailers in these industries can quickly breach allotted thresholds. This means that merchants will not only lose significant amounts of revenue, they’ll also pay excessive fees and suffer other processing restrictions. It is imperative for merchants to understand the causes for chargebacks and create a customised mitigation plan. Mitigating chargebacks and maintaining revenue Effective chargeback management requires both long-term and short-term aims. To achieve industry-wide results, retailers and other industry members must work together to modify current consumer behaviours. Abuse of the chargeback process through the use of illegitimate transaction disputes is a growing concern for retailers around the globe. Half of all cardholders who succeed in securing an illegitimate chargeback will seek another within 90 days. By disputing these illegitimate chargebacks, merchants challenge the faulty consumer behaviour and reduce future risks for everyone involved. In the short-term though, merchants can address chargeback threats on an individual level; it is possible to make simple yet effective process changes that demonstrably help to reduce unnecessary chargeback losses. Adhere to business best practices: it may sound obvious, but it is important to always adhere to business best practices. This involves everything from ensuring the customer receives the correct product to answering emails in a timely fashion. Learn from your experience: stay informed on the reasons behind chargebacks so that you can challenge them when appropriate. Learn from each experience to prevent future risk and respond more effectively. Be available at all times: ecommerce is a 24-hours-a-day business. If customers cannot contact you when they want, they will contact their bank instead—which often is far easier. Honour cancellation and refund requests promptly: returns may be a costly and time-consuming process, but they are actually superior in many ways to chargebacks. Prominently display your refund policies and contact information to help reduce the risk of chargebacks. Then, act in accordance with your policy and refund qualified transactions quickly to avoid unnecessary chargebacks. Make your case with the banks: keep detailed records up-to-date, from the order to the delivery confirmation. Provide necessary information to the bank promptly if a chargeback claim is initiated. Clearly outline terms of service: it is especially important for merchants who process recurring payments to outline all billing information prior to completing the sale. Communicate to maintain loyalty: in today’s age of instant gratification, consumers are often more loyal to convenience than they are to actual brands. Loyalty programs, special offers, and even regular communications help maintain satisfaction and prevent chargebacks. Create a dynamic mitigation strategy: card network rules are constantly changing and a lack of standardisation means processes vary among banks. Meanwhile, consumer behaviours evolve over time too. If you are using an automated management tool or submit one-size-fits-all disputes, it is imperative that you devise a more dynamic approach that takes advantage of agile solutions. Otherwise, you’ll be left using static, incomplete data to address the wrong problems – which will obviously produce below-par results. Effective and comprehensive strategies are available to liberate in-house resources. The mindset of “chargebacks are just a cost of doing business” is no longer true. Taking such an approach in the online world could be the death knell for any retailer. No matter what industry you are in, it is possible to benefit from increased transaction volumes as ecommerce continues to boom. Chargebacks needn’t be a deterrent any longer.

The GBI-EM Global Diversified index is tracked by investment funds managing $185 billion, and Argentina will have an estimated 1.16 percent weight when it enters at the end of February, JPM said in a note to clients late on Thursday. That implies fairly significant inflow from index-tracking funds to Argentina which, according to JPM, will be the first country in four years to enter the GBI-EM. The news will be welcomed by Argentina's government which has struggled to attract investment, despite sweeping reforms by centre-right President Mauricio Macri who took office at the end of 2015 with a vow to revive an economy in crisis. Argentina fought a long legal battle with hedge funds over unpaid debt resulting from its record $100 billion default in 2002, which locked it out of global debt markets for years. That dispute was settled last year. But while Macri has also floated the peso, removed capital curbs and brought Argentina back to the global bond market, it remains mired in recession with 40 percent inflation. Macri sacked his finance minister last month. New Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne took fresh steps this week to revive investment, removing a mandatory 120-day holding period for foreigners wanting to repatriate funds from Latin America's third biggest economy. JPM said peso-denominated bonds maturing 2021, 2023 and 2026 would join the GBI-EM "following a series of measures implemented recently to facilitate access to the FX and government bond market for foreign investors". Argentine debt will also be eligible for inclusion in JPM's GBI-EM (Narrow) Diversified and the GBI-EM Broad Diversified series with estimated weights of 3.34 and 0.78 percent respectively, JPM said. "(Index entry) is a significant move for Argentina and it will help bring down borrowing costs. It will also provide support for the peso," said Jakob Christensen, head of emerging markets research at Danske Bank. "It's been cut out of financial markets for many years so it hasn't been able to leverage itself as (much) as other emerging markets, which is a good thing." JPM now plans to assess Argentine peso non-deliverable forwards for eligibility to enter its ELMI Plus index of emerging currency short-term rates. If the currency derivative meets liquidity and transparency criteria, Argentina will have a 1.4 percent weight in the ELMI Plus. Separately, Argentine stocks could also re-join the most widely used emerging equity benchmark from MSCI, which is tracked by around $1.4 trillion in funds. MSCI had moved Argentina out of that index to the smaller frontier market index in 2009 due to curbs on capital movement but it has proposed reclassifying the country as an emerging market again, with the outcome due to be announced in June.

Traders rejoiced as the FTSE 100 hit a record high, but will the glory be short-lived? Credit: Spencer Platt/Getty Images Laura Suter 6 January 2017 • 8:30am Britain’s blue-chip index may have started the year by reaching a succession of highs - six record closes mark its longest winning streak in two decades - but how solid are those gains? In 2016, the FTSE 100 ended the first week in January on 5,912 points, in the first week of this year it scaled to 7,208 points - a rise of 22pc. While many investors will see the record levels as reason to rejoice, the underlying causes are not so cheering. The fall in sterling is particularly significant: around 70pc of FTSE 100 companies’ earnings are made overseas and any fall in the pound makes them more valuable in sterling terms. During 2016 the FTSE 100 rose by more than 19pc. However, in US dollar terms – stripping out the positive impact of sterling’s fall – the index actually fell, by 0.2pc. The rise of the index in 2016 also hides enormous divergence. Looking at the index sector by sector shows that there were some large risers and some steady fallers. Oil and gas producers rose by 61pc last year, while the FTSE 350 mining index rose by 100pc. Basic materials, which includes the mining and refining of metals, chemical producers and forestry products, rose by 90pc, while the construction and materials industry rose by 49pc. On the other hand, retailers fell by nearly 14pc, while the telecoms sector was down 12pc and food producers lost 9pc. Real estate was hit the hardest, falling by 32pc in the year.

Capital at risk Jason Hollands from Tilney Bestinvest, the fund shop, said: “Currency moves rescued markets for UK investors last year. If you were cautious a year ago, with concerns about the uncertain geopolitical outlook, then this year has similar warnings.” He pointed to a “marathon” of European elections and the potential unpredictability of Donald Trump’s presidency. 2016 sector breakdown Chris Wyllie, chief investment officer at Connor Broadley, the wealth management firm, said he did not have concerns about the valuations of British companies but advised investors to be discerning and to “buy the dips”. “There are going to be some bloodbath sectors for medium-sized firms, retail being one. More businesses will be going to the wall,” he said. Mr Wyllie pointed to the example of Next, which this week issued a profit warning after slower Christmas sales, and said: “If Next is feeling it, what are the less good businesses out there going to be doing?” Next Plc However, investors also need to separate the fortunes of the FTSE 100 index from their feelings about the domestic economy. “The UK stock market is not that reflective of the UK economy. Investors’ view on the UK economy is not a particularly positive one,” said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. There are some big question marks hanging over Britain in 2017, said Tom Stevenson from Fidelity, the asset manager. The first is domestic earnings. “Economic growth in the UK is probably going to slow down significantly because inflation is likely to rise and that means real consumer purchasing power is going to diminish,” he said. It wouldn't surprise me to see inflation of 3-4pc later this year, which will put a squeeze on consumer spendingBen Yearsley, Wealth Club Inflation will hit the price of any goods imported, hurting UK consumers' pockets, said Ben Yearsley, investment director at Wealth Club, an investment service. "UK inflation is still relatively benign with retail prices index running at 2.2pc. As we import many goods into the UK, the depreciation in sterling will start pushing the costs of goods we import up, thus forcing inflation up. "It wouldn't surprise me to see inflation of 3-4pc later this year, which will put a squeeze on consumer spending. Normally the Bank of England would raise rates to combat inflation, but this might not happen this time," he said. The other big risk to British shares is Brexit and the associated uncertainty. Mr Bell said the fall in sterling had priced in a “hard Brexit” that might not materialise. “If so, sterling will rally and that could reverse some of the gains that we have seen as a result of its fall,” he said.

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2USZiU0 ALSO READ Asian shares, dollar wobble as investors brace for Fed outcome Asian shares on the defensive as U.S. yields, dollar rise Asian shares slip, dollar nurses losses as U.S. election looms Asian shares shaky as Trump bets keep emerging markets pressured Global stocks, dollar roiled by tightening U.S. election race By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares recovered to four-week highs on Friday as a surge in the dollar and its borrowing costs sparked by Donald Trump's election eased, with the U.S. 10-year yield slipping to one-month lows. The U.S. dollar stayed near three-week lows against a basket of currencies though it bounced back a tad as the Chinese yuan gave up some of its massive gains made during the previous two days following Friday's midpoint fixing by China's central bank. "The market appears to be on risk-on mode. It could be because of stabilising U.S. yields. It could be signs of stability in Europe, or a recovery in oil. Anything that has been battered by higher U.S. rates is coming back," Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. MSCI's gauge of the world's stock markets hit its highest levels in a year and a half, having risen 1.8 percent since the start of year, helped by this week's generally upbeat economic indicators in the U.S. and China. In Asia, MSCI's ex-Japan Asia-Pacific shares index rose 0.25 percent to its highest in four weeks. In contrast, Japan's Nikkei, one of the best performers since Republican Trump won the Nov. 8 election, dropped 0.4 percent as the yen gained versus the dollar. Trump's victory had sparked a major realignment in markets. Expectations that his administration will bring tax cuts, higher spending and deregulation have boosted U.S. bond yields and the dollar, to the detriment of many emerging economies that have benefitted from cheap dollar funding and had attracted trillions of dollars from investors shunning low U.S. yields. "What's going on is a correction of the 'Trump trade' since the election. The markets have been trying to fully price in his policies just based on hopes," said Koichi Yoshikawa, executive director of finance at Standard Chartered Bank in Tokyo. "From now on, it's not going to be a simple one-way bet," he said. Already under pressure from profit taking as the Trump rally wanes, the dollar extended losses on Thursday as China stepped up efforts to support the yuan, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. The cost of borrowing the yuan in Hong Kong, the main offshore yuan trading centre, sky-rocketed, making it too costly for speculators to sell the yuan against the dollar. The offshore yuan gained more than 2 percent in the last two sessions, their biggest two-day gain on record, to a two-month high of 6.7833 per dollar before it eased back about 0.5 percent in Asia on Friday to 6.8208. The dollar also slumped to a three-week low of 115.21 yen, having shed 1.6 percent on Thursday, its biggest fall in five months. It bounced back 0.4 percent on Friday to 115.80 yen. The euro also posted its biggest gain in seven months, of 1.1 percent, on Thursday and last fetched $1.0588. The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies tumbled to 101.30, falling more than two percent from its 14-year high of 103.82 set on Tuesday. Investors also rushed out of their selling positions in U.S. bonds, one of the most convincing plays since the election because Trump's policies are seen as stoking inflation. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield hit a one-month low of 2.344 percent, having fallen about 30 basis points from its two-year high of 2.641 percent touched on Dec. 15. Investors also scaled back their expectations of the Fed's rate hikes this year, with Federal Funds rate futures pricing in two rate hikes compared with two and a half at the peak in December. Markets largely shrugged off U.S. economic data published on Thursday which was generally strong. The increase in private payrolls was on the weaker side of market expectations, however, raising some concerns about the upcoming jobs data due at 1330 GMT. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 Index dipped 0.1 percent as retailers such as Macy's and Kohl's slumped on weak holiday sales. Financials were also hit by a fall in U.S. bond yields but hi-tech shares, which have underperformed since Trump's victory partly on concerns about his rocky relationship with Silicon Valley, shone. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 percent to hit a record high, led by gains in online retailer Amazon.com. Oil prices held firm, supported by news that Saudi Arabia had cut production to meet OPEC's agreement to reduce output. International benchmark Brent crude futures stood at $56.89 a barrel, flat on the day and up 3.1 percent on the week.

Reuters Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Asian shares rise as US interest rates ease, China steps up yuan defence By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares recovered to four-week highs on Friday as a surge in the dollar and its borrowing costs sparked by Donald Trump's election eased, with the U.S. 10-year yield slipping to one-month lows. The U.S. dollar stayed near three-week lows against a basket of currencies though it bounced back a tad as the Chinese yuan gave up some of its massive gains made during the previous two days following Friday's midpoint fixing by China's central bank. "The market appears to be on risk-on mode. It could be because of stabilising U.S. yields. It could be signs of stability in Europe, or a recovery in oil. Anything that has been battered by higher U.S. rates is coming back," Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. MSCI's gauge of the world's stock markets hit its highest levels in a year and a half, having risen 1.8 percent since the start of year, helped by this week's generally upbeat economic indicators in the U.S. and China. In Asia, MSCI's ex-Japan Asia-Pacific shares index rose 0.25 percent to its highest in four weeks. In contrast, Japan's Nikkei, one of the best performers since Republican Trump won the Nov. 8 election, dropped 0.4 percent as the yen gained versus the dollar. Trump's victory had sparked a major realignment in markets. Expectations that his administration will bring tax cuts, higher spending and deregulation have boosted U.S. bond yields and the dollar, to the detriment of many emerging economies that have benefitted from cheap dollar funding and had attracted trillions of dollars from investors shunning low U.S. yields. "What's going on is a correction of the 'Trump trade' since the election. The markets have been trying to fully price in his policies just based on hopes," said Koichi Yoshikawa, executive director of finance at Standard Chartered Bank in Tokyo. "From now on, it's not going to be a simple one-way bet," he said. Already under pressure from profit taking as the Trump rally wanes, the dollar extended losses on Thursday as China stepped up efforts to support the yuan, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. The cost of borrowing the yuan in Hong Kong, the main offshore yuan trading centre, sky-rocketed, making it too costly for speculators to sell the yuan against the dollar. The offshore yuan gained more than 2 percent in the last two sessions, their biggest two-day gain on record, to a two-month high of 6.7833 per dollar before it eased back about 0.5 percent in Asia on Friday to 6.8208. The dollar also slumped to a three-week low of 115.21 yen, having shed 1.6 percent on Thursday, its biggest fall in five months. It bounced back 0.4 percent on Friday to 115.80 yen. The euro also posted its biggest gain in seven months, of 1.1 percent, on Thursday and last fetched $1.0588. The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies tumbled to 101.30, falling more than two percent from its 14-year high of 103.82 set on Tuesday. Investors also rushed out of their selling positions in U.S. bonds, one of the most convincing plays since the election because Trump's policies are seen as stoking inflation. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield hit a one-month low of 2.344 percent, having fallen about 30 basis points from its two-year high of 2.641 percent touched on Dec. 15.

REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK NEW YORK Stocks overcame early weakness and the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields rallied on Friday after data showed U.S. wages rose in December even as hiring slowed, setting the economy up for further interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve this year. The stronger greenback weighed on dollar-denominated commodity prices, but oil rose slightly on increased buying ahead of the weekend. Nonfarm payrolls rose less than expected in December, the Labor Department said, but a rebound in wages highlighted sustained labor market momentum that points to stronger growth and could drive the Fed to consider raising rates as early as the first quarter. "There's still improvement to be made, especially with the labor force participation rate being low, but conditions seem to be close to what the Fed might be happy with," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. MSCI's world index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 46 countries, erased most of its earlier losses to trade little changed. U.S. stocks advanced and the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI came within one point of hitting 20,000 for the first time ever. U.S. equities have risen sharply since Donald Trump won the U.S. election in November and while Friday's gains suggested the rally is not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. "The market's advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency," said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. "But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don't think this time will be any different." The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 64.51 points, or 0.32 percent, to close at 19,963.8, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 7.98 points, or 0.351697 percent, to finish at 2,276.98 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 5,521.06. Apple (AAPL.O) shares climbed 1.1 percent after Canada's Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence the iPhone maker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. European shares rallied from the day's lows after the U.S. jobs data. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 finished little changed at 1,444.97. The dollar rose, boosted by the solid U.S. jobs report, after tumbling the day before on mixed U.S. economic data and apparent action by Chinese authorities to shore up the yuan. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, was up 0.66 percent to 102.19. In bond markets, U.S. Treasury debt yields rose across the board. Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose from a five-week trough, while those on 30-year bonds recovered from a seven-week low following the jobs data. "We definitely think rates are going to continue to climb from here," said Justin Tabellione, senior fixed income portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management America in Chicago. "I would not be surprised to see 10-year yields closer to 3 percent some time this year as soon as the summer, once we get clarity on what's going to happen on the fiscal stimulus plan." In late trading, the U.S. 10-year note US10YT=RR was down 13/32 in price, yielding 2.419 percent, compared with 2.368 percent late on Thursday. Meanwhile, the stronger dollar weighed on dollar-denominated commodities. Gold prices slipped from the previous day's one-month high as the dollar strengthened. Spot gold XAU= fell 0.68 percent to $1,172.33 an ounce. Palladium however remained on track for its largest weekly gain since March on record high U.S. car sales. Oil rose slightly, ending the week higher, but gains were limited by the stronger dollar and lingering doubts about whether OPEC producers would stick to a deal to cut crude output. Brent crude LCOc1 settled up 21 cents, or 0.37 percent, at $57.10 a barrel, and U.S. crude CLc1 settled up 23 cents, or 0.43 percent, at $53.99.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon Enlarge Caption  Email More A A LONDON: World stocks held near 1-1/2 year highs and the dollar moved up from a three-week low on Friday, with investors looking to upcoming U.S. jobs data to provide clues on the pace of U.S. interest rate rises this year. MSCI's gauge of the world's stock markets hit its highest since July 2015, taking its gains so far this year to 1.7 percent, helped by this week's generally upbeat economic readings in the U.S., China and Europe. Asian shares recovered to four-week highs, while the pan-European STOXX 600 dipped 0.2 percent, just 0.6 percent off a 1-year high hit this week. A Reuters survey of economists signaled that U.S. employers were likely to have maintained a solid pace of hiring in December while raising wages, putting the economy on a path to stronger growth and further interest rate increases this year. Non-farm payrolls probably increased by 178,000 jobs last month, the survey showed. Federal Reserve minutes from December released this week showed that almost all Fed policymakers thought the economy could grow more quickly because of fiscal stimulus and many were eyeing faster interest rate rises than previously expected. Despite this, investors have scaled back expectations for the number of rate rises this year since December, and the dollar is down from this week's 14-year high. The currency slumped 1.6 percent on Thursday to a three-week low of 115.04 yen , its biggest fall for five months. It bounced back 0.6 percent on Friday to 116 yen. Weaker-than-expected private-sector ADP payrolls data on Thursday contributed to the dip in the dollar, despite strong data elsewhere. Investors were looking to today's jobs figures to see if the bounceback for the dollar could be sustained. "It's likely that a stronger jobs number will, in the shorter term, strengthen the dollar. But (soon) people will start questioning how much of a strong dollar the Fed can stomach," ETF Securities' head of research and investment strategy, James Butterfill, said. "Given the sell-off in the dollar, there could be appreciation over the next few weeks, but in the coming few months we could see further dollar weakness." The recent surge in the dollar and its borrowing costs sparked by Donald Trump's election victory has eased, with the U.S. 10-year yield slipping to one-month lows. The dollar did bounce back slightly against the yuan , which gave up some of the massive gains made in the previous two days despite Friday's strong midpoint fixing by China's central bank. In Asia, MSCI's ex-Japan Asia-Pacific shares index touched a four-week high, while Japan's Nikkei , one of the best performers since Trump's win on Nov. 8, dropped 0.3 percent. "What's going on is a correction of the 'Trump trade' since the election. The markets have been trying to fully price in his policies just based on hopes," Standard Chartered's executive director of finance, Koichi Yoshikawa, said. "From now on, it's not going to be a simple one-way bet." Trump's victory had sparked a major realignment in markets. Expectations that his administration will bring tax cuts, higher spending and deregulation have boosted U.S. bond yields and the dollar, to the detriment of many emerging economies that have benefited from cheap dollar funding and had attracted trillions of dollars from investors shunning low U.S. yields. Already under pressure as the Trump rally wanes, the dollar extended losses on Thursday as China stepped up efforts to support the yuan, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. The cost of borrowing the yuan in Hong Kong, the main offshore yuan trading center, sky-rocketed, making it too costly for speculators to sell the yuan against the dollar. The offshore yuan has gained more than 2 percent in the last two sessions, its biggest two-day gain on record, to a two-month high of 6.7833 per dollar before it eased back about 1 percent in Asia on Friday to 6.8610. Having posted its biggest gain for 7 months, of 1.1 percent, in the previous session, it fetched US$1.0589 on Friday. The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies was up 0.1 percent at 101.640, down more than two percent from Tuesday's 14-year high of 103.82. Investors also closed short positions in U.S. bonds, one of the most popular plays since the election because Trump's policies are seen as stoking inflation. Oil prices were steady as Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi stared promised supply cuts, but doubts that all producers will implement output reductions agreed in a landmark OPEC deal last year kept markets from rising further. International benchmark Brent crude futures traded up 0.2 percent at US$56.97 per barrel.

European shares were expected to be little changed, with financial spreadbetters expecting a flat to 0.1 per cent rise in Britain's FTSE and a flat to slightly weaker opening in Germany's DAX. The US dollar stayed near three-week lows against a basket of currencies though it bounced back slightly as the Chinese yuan gave up some of its massive gains made in the previous two days despite Friday's strong midpoint fixing by China's central bank. "The market appears to be on risk-on mode. It could be because of stabilising US yields. It could be signs of stability in Europe, or a recovery in oil. Anything that has been battered by higher US rates is coming back," Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. MSCI's gauge of the world's stock markets hit its highest levels in a year and a half, taking its gains since the start of the year to 1.7 per cent, helped by this week's generally upbeat economic readings in the United States, China and Europe. In Asia, MSCI's ex-Japan Asia-Pacific shares index hit four-week high before paring gains to stand little changed. It has gained 2.7 per cent in the first week of 2017. In contrast, Japan's Nikkei, one of the best performers since Republican Trump won the Nov. 8 election, dropped 0.3 per cent as the yen gained versus the dollar. "What's going on is a correction of the 'Trump trade' since the election. The markets have been trying to fully price in his policies just based on hopes," said Koichi Yoshikawa, executive director of finance at Standard Chartered Bank in Tokyo. "From now on, it's not going to be a simple one-way bet," he said. Trump's surprise victory had sparked a major realignment in markets. Expectations that his administration will bring tax cuts, higher spending and deregulation have boosted US bond yields and the dollar, to the detriment of many emerging economies that have benefitted from cheap dollar funding and had attracted trillions of dollars from investors shunning low US yields. Already under pressure from profit taking as the Trump rally wanes, the dollar extended losses on Thursday as China stepped up efforts to support the yuan, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. "Chinese authorities might be wary because of rising possibility that the US President-elect Trump might impose restrictions on trade with China," said Takahiko Sasaki, market economist at Mizuho Bank. While there are many hurdles for designating China as a currency manipulator or slapping on a higher tariff, Washington could impose more anti-dumping duties, he added. Trump has said he would name China as a currency manipulator and slap a punitive 45 per cent tariff. The cost of borrowing the yuan in Hong Kong, the main offshore yuan trading centre, sky-rocketed, making it too costly for speculators to sell the yuan against the dollar. The offshore yuan gained more than 2 per cent in the last two sessions, its biggest two-day gain on record, to a two-month high of 6.7833 per dollar before it eased back about 0.5 per cent in Asia on Friday to 6.8120. The dollar also slumped to a three-week low of 115.21 yen , having shed 1.6 per cent on Thursday, its biggest fall in five months. It bounced back 0.4 per cent on Friday to 115.80 yen. The euro also posted its biggest gain in seven months, of 1.1 per cent, on Thursday and last fetched $1.0588. The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies tumbled to 101.30, falling more than two per cent from its 14-year high of 103.82 set on Tuesday. Investors also rushed out of their selling positions in US bonds, one of the most convincing plays since the election because Trump's policies are seen as stoking inflation. The 10-year US Treasuries yield hit a one-month low of 2.344 per cent, having fallen about 30 basis points from its two-year high of 2.641 per cent touched on Dec. 15. Investors also scaled back their expectations of the Fed's rate hikes this year, with Federal Funds rate futures <0#FF:> pricing in two rate hikes compared with two and a half at the peak in December. Markets largely shrugged off US economic data on Thursday which was generally strong. The increase in private payrolls was on the weaker side of market expectations, however, raising some concerns about the upcoming jobs data due at 1330 GMT. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 Index dipped 0.1 per cent as retailers such as Macy's and Kohl's slumped on weak holiday sales. Financials were also hit by a fall in US bond yields, but hi-tech shares shone. They have underperformed since Trump's victory partly on concerns about his rocky relationship with Silicon Valley. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to hit a record high, led by gains in online retailer Amazon.com . Oil prices were steady as the start of supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi supported the market, but doubts that all producers will implement output reductions agreed in a landmark deal last year kept markets from rising further. International benchmark Brent crude futures traded at $56.76 per barrel, down 0.2 cents from their close the previous day. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

(JPM) Stock for Earnings Riches View All Posts The turn of the year brings hope for new themes and trends to strike the Street. But if you’re a financial stock lover, more of the same will do just fine, thank you very much. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) closed out 2016 in bullish fashion with bank stocks from Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) soaring into the Christmas season. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr BAC stock closed out the year with an impressive 31% gain. What’s more, BofA scored the entirety of the gains after the November election. The first 10 months of the year were a bust for the entire financial sector. With higher rates and deregulation on the horizon, the denizens of the Street are buying up bank stocks with abandon. Bank of America has now climbed to an eight-year high. Indeed, the $20 level (which was breached during the post-election buying binge) has sat untouched since BAC shares plunged beneath it during the 2008 meltdown. With mega-resistance now shattered, BAC stock holders are hoping a new bull market has begun — one with the mustard to carry shares higher for years to come. At a minimum, spectators have to admit the weekly price chart of BofA looks better than at any time over the past decade.

Of course, the recent chop can’t be too surprising given how overbought the stock had become following the financial stock explosion. The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New Year Fortunately for would-be buyers, a lower-risk entry is now in the offing. How to Trade BAC Stock Here If you think the good times keep rolling for Bank of America, consider grabbing the BAC April 22 calls for $1.68 or better. Fear has fled in the wake of the rousing rally. And that means options can now be snatched up on the cheap. Your max loss is limited to the initial $1.68 and will be forfeited if BAC stock sits below $22 at expiration. The max gain is unlimited, which means you can continue banking coin on the back of BofA bulls. As of this writing, Tyler Craig owned bullish positions on XLF.

(JPM), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Ford Motor Company (F) Options activity provides a look at expectations on JPM, VZ and F By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jan 4, 2017, 9:14 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Monday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and AT&T Inc.

(AAPL) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCAU) 2 Trades to Play the Exxon Mobil (XOM) Stock Breakout (or Breakdown) View All Posts U.S. stock futures are on the rise again this morning, as Wall Street is once again on Dow 20K watch. The Dow Jones Industrial Average crept back above the 10,900 mark yesterday, and if investors like what they see in today’s release of last month’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, we could see the Dow challenge 20,000. What’s more, December auto sales will also begin to leak onto the Street today. Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.18%, S&P 500 futures have gained 0.19% and Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.15%. On the options front, volume finally returned to normal levels on Tuesday, with roughly 15.9 million calls and 11.2 million puts changing hands. The heavy skew toward call activity bled over into the CBOE, where the single-session equity put/call volume ratio hit retreated from one-week high to rest at 0.69. The 10-day moving average held at a one-month high of 0.67. Turning to Tuesday’s volume leaders, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) saw record short-term options volume on Tuesday ahead of today’s ex-dividend date and next Friday’s earnings report. Elsewhere, put activity ramped up on Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) despite Citigroup’s upgrade to “buy,” while Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) received a bullish lift in sentiment after it cancelled its plans for a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) JPM stock trades ex-dividend today, with shareholders of record as of the close last night receiving a payout of 48 cents per share on Jan. 31. As with all ex-dividend dates, JPM stock was flooded with deep-in-the-money call activity as traders implemented dividend capture strategies. The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New Year That said, some of yesterday’s VZ options volume may have been geared toward next week’s quarterly earnings report. Verizon is expected to post a profit of $1.42 per share on Friday next week, with revenue seen coming in at $23.87 billion. EarningsWhispers.com places the whisper number at $1.47 per share, though given President-elect Donald Trump’s promise of decreased regulation and the Federal Reserve’s threat of three interest rate hikes in 2017, guidance may well be the real driver for JPM stock next week. Still, don’t expect to see options volume similar to yesterday’s activity, where roughly 2.1 million contracts traded with calls snapping up 95% of the day’s take.

For banks there have been ten lean years. Subprime-loan defaults started to rise in February 2007, causing a near-collapse of the industry in America and Europe. Next came bail-outs from governments, then years of grovelling before regulators, mass firings of staff and quarter after quarter of poor results that left banks’ shareholders disappointed. Now, a decade later, the moneylenders are quietly wondering if 2017 is the year in which their industry turns a corner. Over the past six months the FTSE index of global bank shares has leapt by 24%. American banks have led the way, with the value of Bank of America rising by 67%, and that of JPMorgan Chase by 39%. In Europe BNP Paribas’ market value has risen by 52%. In Japan shares in the lumbering Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group—the rich world’s biggest bank by assets—have behaved like those of a frisky internet startup; they are up by 57%. Predictions about global banks’ future returns on equity have stopped falling, note analysts at UBS, a Swiss bank. Some of the biggest casualties of the financial crisis are even expanding. On December 20th Lloyds, bailed out by British taxpayers in 2009 at a cost of $33bn, said it would buy MBNA, a credit-card firm, for $2bn. The excitement can be explained by three Rs: rates, regulation and returns. Consider interest rates first. The slump in rates has been terrible for banks. Between 2010 and 2015, the net interest income of the rich world’s 100 biggest banks fell by $100bn, or about half of 2010 profits. When rates across the economy rise, by contrast, banks can expand margins by charging borrowers more, while passing on only some of the benefit of higher rates to depositors. So bankers have been watching the bond market with barely concealed joy. Ten-year government yields have risen by one percentage point in America, and by 0.30-0.64 points in the big euro-zone economies and Japan over the last six months. Investors are talking about a Trump-inspired “reflation”: the president-elect promises to embark on a public-spending boom. In Germany inflation is at a three-year high of 1.7%. Banks’ CEOs are also chipper because they think that regulation has peaked. In America the new administration is likely either to repeal the Dodd-Frank act, an 848-page law from 2010, or to prod regulators to enforce it less zealously. Bank-bashing fatigue seems to have set in among the public. True, when firms misbehave, there is still a firestorm of outrage. John Stumpf, the boss of Wells Fargo, quit in October after his bank admitted creating fake accounts. But many people can see that power has migrated from banking to the technology elite in California. The brew of high pay, monopolistic tendencies and huge profits that attracts populist resentment is now more to be found in Silicon Valley than in Wall Street or the City of London. Global supervisors are still cooking up new rules, known as “Basel 4” (see article), but are unlikely to demand a big rise in the safety buffer the industry holds in the form of capital. The strongest banks are signalling that they will lay out more in dividends and buy-backs, rather than hoard even more capital (today, the top 100 rich-world banks pay out about 40% of their profits). A third reason for optimism in bank boardrooms is returns. Global banking’s return on equity (ROE) has crept back towards a respectable 10%. The worst of the fines imposed by American regulators are over. So far, “fintech” startups that use technology to compete with rich-world banks have not won much market share; banks have used technology to boost efficiency. They have also got better at working out which of their activities create value after adjusting for risk and the capital they tie up. Barclays, once known for cutting corners, says it can calculate the ROE generated by each of its trading clients. It is ditching 7,000 of them. Given the giddy mood, the big danger starts with a C, for complacency. Regulators believe that banks now pose less of a threat to taxpayers. American lenders have $1.2trn of core capital, more than twice what they held in 2007. Citigroup, the most systemically important bank to be bailed out, now has three times more capital than its cumulative losses in 2008-10. European banks’ capital buffers have risen by 50% since 2007, to $1.5trn. Yet there are still plenty of weak firms that could cause mayhem. Deutsche Bank, several Italian lenders and America’s two state-run mortgage monsters, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are examples. Mega-banks may simply be too big for any mortal to control. For every dollar of assets that General Electric’s Jeff Immelt manages, Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan Chase looks after $5. Once bitten And banks still lack a post-crisis plan beyond cost-cutting. Despite their surging shares, most are valued at around the level they would fetch if their assets were liquidated, which hardly indicates optimism about their prospects. Before the crisis, they inflated their profits by expanding in unhealthy ways. They captured rents from state guarantees, created ever more layers of debt relative to GDP, and grew their balance-sheets by means of heavy over-borrowing. They have reversed much of this expansion over the past decade but that strategy cannot go on for ever. In 2017 banks will need to articulate a new growth mission and show that they can expand profits without prompting public outrage or a regulatory backlash. One area of promise is the drive to raise rich-world productivity. That would boost economies broadly, and their own profits. There is plenty that banks could do: get more credit to young firms, improve payments systems so that a higher proportion of midsized firms can engage in cross-border e-commerce, and harness technology to make banking as cheap and easy to use as a smartphone app. Forward-thinking bank bosses are already emphasising such goals. If they could achieve them over the next decade, they might even realise a fourth R—redemption. twitter icon facebook icon more iconMore linkedin icon googleplus icon mail icon print icon purchase-rights icon Be the first to comment Editors’ picks Manufacturing industryPoliticians cannot bring back old-fashioned factory jobs They don’t make ’em like that any more Non-stick NarendraIndia’s prime minister has a knack for shrugging off embarrassmentAsia Battling for survivalThe French left faces a grim election yearEurope A walk across WashingtonA tour of a changing capitalCulture Latest Updates Special no moreAn end to wet foot, dry foot Americas The faith of Barack ObamaA president with a feel for the spiritual who was hated by the pious Erasmus Police forceChicago’s police regularly use excessive force, says the Department of Justice Democracy in America The ElbphilharmonieA new concert hall is worth the wait, and the cost, for Hamburg Daily chartThe curious case of high blood pressure around the world Graphic detail England’s National Health ServiceNo more money for the NHS, says Philip Hammond Britain Something nasty from the tail pipeAmerican regulators accuse Fiat Chrysler of emissions cheating Business and finance Pistols at 30,000 feetThousands of flyers have been caught trying to smuggle loaded guns onto American planes Gulliver Podcast: The week aheadHacks, leaks and videotape International Swimming together, living togetherThe meaning of a European court verdict on Muslim girls and school swimming lessons Erasmus The Netanyahu tapesA new scandal rocks Israel’s prime minister Middle East and Africa The Economist explainsWhy Indonesia is unlikely to ban booze The Economist explains Global exchange rates, to goThe Big Mac index Graphic detail Special educationThe Supreme Court considers what states owe to disabled students Democracy in America Daily chartHuman and pet health-cost trends are strikingly similar Graphic detail Contracts in American footballHow to lose quarterbacks and alienate people Game theory Resurrecting JFKNew York’s airports may finally be upgraded Gulliver Podcast: The Economist asksShould education last a lifetime?

Lucas Jackson, Reuters NEW YORK - Global equity prices shrugged off weakness on Wall Street to cling to gains after hitting their highest level since mid-2015 on Thursday, bolstered by strong Chinese data that added to optimism about global growth and inflation. The dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies after US inflation and unemployment data failed to reverse a downtrend that followed some of the biggest gains on record for China's yuan. US Treasury debt yields slipped as investors grew risk-averse amid uncertainty about the incoming Trump administration. MSCI's world index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, rose 0.55 percent for a third straight day of gains. The index has been riding a wave of upbeat factory and service sector surveys out of the United States, Europe and Asia this week. Growth in China's services sector accelerated to a 17-month high in December, a private sector survey showed. The index, however, got little support from Wall Street as the S&P 500 closed slightly lower, weighed by financial shares and as investors dumped traditional retailers Macy's and Kohl's on dismal holiday sales numbers. Amazon powered the Nasdaq Composite to a record closing high. The S&P 500 financial index fell 1.02 percent due to declines in JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. "Financials coming down probably had something to do with bond yields coming down. A lot of the post-election rally was predicated on yields moving higher," said Jimmy Chang, chief investment strategist at Rockefeller & Co. Adding to the downbeat sentiment was a report by a payrolls processor which showed that US private employers added fewer jobs than expected in December even as the US labor market remained solid. Thursday's ADP report precedes Friday's non-farm payrolls data, which includes hiring in both private and public sectors. "Overall it looks like investors will be in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the Labor Department report tomorrow," said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 42.87 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 19,899.29, the S&P 500 lost 1.75 points, or 0.08 percent, to finish at 2,269 and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.93 points, or 0.2 percent, to finish at 5,487.94. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.12 percent at 1,445.57. US Treasury debt yields dropped broadly, falling for a third straight session. Yields should rise again despite weakness early in the year, although for the next few weeks they likely will be range-bound as investors wait to see results from the incoming Trump administration, said Justin Lederer, interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. "There's a lot of uncertainty until the next administration takes place," Lederer said. "We'll be in ranges until we know more about the Trump presidency." Buying in Treasuries also accelerated after the disappointing private sector payrolls data. The US 10-year note was up 29/32 in price to yield 2.348 percent, compared with 2.452 percent late on Wednesday. The dollar slipped to a three-week low against a basket of currencies. China stepped into both its onshore and offshore yuan markets to shore up the faltering yuan, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 1.26 percent to 101.41. The dollar's retreat helped push gold to its highest in a month. Spot gold rose 1.43 percent to $1,180.01 an ounce. Oil prices rose in a choppy session, lifted by news that Saudi Arabia had cut production to meet OPEC's agreement to cut output. Prices had fallen earlier on data showing a surprisingly large increase in U.S. gasoline and distillate inventories. Brent crude settled up 43 cents, or 0.76 percent, at $56.89 a barrel, and U.S. crude settled up 50 cents, or 0.94 percent, at $53.76.

But the participants in our annual Investors' Roundtable said there could also be some pain along the way.  By Patrick Kennedy Star Tribune January 7, 2017 — 4:28pm Investors Roundtable, L to R: Roger Sit, Sit Investments; Jim Paulsen, Wells Financial; Carol Schleif, Abbot Downing; Lisa Kopp, U.S. Bank; Mark Henneman, Mairs & Power; David Joy, Ameriprise; Biff Robillard, Bannerstone Capital; Craig Johnson, Piper Jaffray; Martha Pomerantz, Evercore Wealth Management.

But the participants in our annual Investors’ Roundtable said there could also be some pain along the way. One likened the president-elect’s campaign and behavior since the election to “creative destruction,” the cost of unorthodox thinking that spurs beneficial results. That’s one reason they are less bullish overall than they were a year ago, forecasting a 3.6 percent jump in the S&P 500. Our nine panelists were more united in outlook this year, with an 11 percentage-point difference between the highest and lowest forecast. Last year, there was a 29 percentage point difference in their forecasts. One area of agreement was how to invest in the early Trump years — in energy, infrastructure and banks. There has been a 35-year bull run in the bond market and an eight-year run in the equity market. How far can these markets run? David Joy: Well, I would say on the bond side there’s probably a pretty good chance that the bull market is over. We don’t expect bond yields to be rising dramatically from here, because we don’t see inflation as a big problem, but some inflationary pressure is building over time. On the stock side, I think it has a little more room to run here, especially if we get some policy initiatives next year that are favorable in terms of tax reform and some fiscal stimulus. I think stocks can again move higher in that environment. Roger Sit: I would agree with that, but on the stock market side, I think it will move higher for different reasons. The last eight years, the equity markets have really moved higher both in the U.S. as well as abroad, because of quantitative easing and extremely low interest rates. Going forward, we are going to shift from an environment where those have juiced the whole market up to an environment where it’s going to be stock picking, where fundamentals are going to matter, because fundamentals will allow for stock price appreciation and sustaining that price appreciation. Carol Schleif: Back to the fixed-income piece, the death of the bond [market] has been in process for many years, and a lot of us have been positioning and trying to call for it much sooner than it is. I would suspect by the time this prints, your readers will be seeing losses in their bond holdings for the first time in many of their experiences. Jim Paulsen: This is a very calendar-old recovery, being now in its eighth year. But I think it’s character-young. I really do. If I go through recession risk — economic policies have not yet turned negative anywhere in the world, and since 1970, when the Fed starts to tighten the funds rate, it’s, on average, four years until the next recession, so we haven’t even begun the process. Because we never generated confidence in this recovery, it’s been a recovery without confidence in the future. I think before it’s over, we’ll get that. Our experts best prediction for 2016 The S&P 500 index closed Friday, Dec. 30th at 2,238.83. The best prediction for 2016 was Abbot Downing’s Carol Schleif whose prediction of 2,235 was nearly spot on. To what degree will the market’s post-election rally encourage President Trump to focus on growth rather than take some of the steps he’s talked about that might limit it? Sit: As long as the administration does something that pushes you in the direction where you think — and I want to emphasize where we all think that it’s good for growth — then it’s going to continue the bull market, and it’s going to continue the bull market in more cyclical stock, even though they’re not necessarily cheap. But with that said, he’s going to get a grace period, six to 12 months from when he takes office, to show he’s moving in that direction. If it doesn’t move in that direction, then all bets are off. Biff Robillard: I have an interesting statistic. If stocks peaked in the first quarter of 2000 and you just calculate — it was 1,400 something on the S&P, and it’s 2,200 on the S&P today. Excluding dividends, the compounded growth rate is 2½ percent for 17 years. So that’s an amazing number, and it seems really low to me. So if you look at a secular peak in the stock market in 2000 — and we’ve gone through this tremendous sideways — I think that’s very relevant to what will happen next with stocks. Paulsen: I think that Trump is like the tail, and the dog in this fight is the fundamentals of the economy, and, quite frankly, a lot of these trends that we now associate with the Trump election were in place starting in the summer. But I would say that Trump exacerbated those trends with hope. I’ve been critical throughout this recovery about the leadership not treating confidence. To me this forevermore is going to be the destructive confidence recovery. I think it’s because the leaders have chronically told us that we’re this close to the second coming of the Great Depression every day, and our Federal Reserve, without saying a word, is screaming, ‘We’re very scared about the future, and you should be too,’ in their actions. And here’s this guy with this big cap that says let’s make things great again, and he’s screaming about how great we’re going to grow, 8, 9, 10 percent, whatever else, and I’m sure it’s all pie over the moon, but the initial impact of rising rates and inflation is positive. Sit: [Trump is] also smart enough to realize he doesn’t want to fail, and he knows if he starts doing stupid things on trade, stupid things on competitiveness, he is going to fail, and that is his probably biggest nightmare. So he has surrounded himself — if you look at the cabinet picks so far — with people who understand and have been successful, because he knows he can’t afford to fail. Craig Johnson: President Trump does not want to fail, but certainly there’s going to be more volatility. You go all the way back to the 1920s and you look at the annual trading range for stock, for the S&P 500, on average it’s been about 27 percent, from the open to the high to the drawdown, etc. I would suspect that you’re going to get an above-average year in terms of volatility, which I think will be very good for active managers. If we are at a market inflection point is this a time for investors to think more widely about how they should rebalance their portfolios? Mark Henneman: I think that the strategy for success over the long term is to pick your process and stick with it. Sit: Well, I would argue that you should always be attentive to your asset allocation at all times, not only by sectors but by passive vs. active. I think there’s a time you can be invested in passive instruments, and there’s a time you can be invested in active. Passive works very well when there’s very low volatility. Now, to what everybody is saying here, I think it’s consensus that volatility is going to probably pick up, because the question is, is how successful will President-elect Trump be? And so with that increased volatility, it tends to be a better environment for active vs. passive. Martha Pomerantz: The bottom line is, is [people] should have an asset allocation that works for their particular circumstances. And now we’re just talking about making tactical shifts at periodic points in time, but when you think about wholesale rebalance, I don’t think any of us would argue that you should take all of your bonds and you should put them into stocks right now. What should readers know about trade agreements going forward, especially in the new administration? Robillard: It’s clarified my thinking to get familiar with the term globalism in contrast to globalization. Globalism is sort of a political movement that we’ve been living for 20 or 30 or 40 years, which is sort of the E.U., when you think about it. Globalization I think of as purely an economic phenomenon. And so you have a candidate [and also] Brexit, which sounds like an anti-globalization campaign — but I think the markets and capitalists are hearing an anti-globalism message. So this weird thing is what looks like more protectionism may be a much more market-driven trading, sort of putting economic interests behind the social interests. You know, it may be surprisingly pro-trade. Paulsen: I come back to this idea — these trade issues and Trump issues are the tail, and then there’s the dog, and the dog is a bigger beast. And while maybe Trump restricts trade to the United States, the bigger dog issue is the fact that all trade is going up. So even if our trade gets restricted, we might still see more of it just because global trade is going up. I just noticed for the 13 top economies, the last six-month leading indicator is up in all 13. This is the first time we’ve ever had that happen in the entire recovery. Even if we have restrictions here in the United States, we might still see more trade. Joy: You know, one of the issues on the Trans-Pacific Partnership is that it appears to be stalled at maybe best, dead at maybe worst. But we have never signed it. This is not a trade agreement that’s in effect, so we’re not losing anything in that respect. And what Trump has been saying is we want smart trade. We all want better deals. So if you take him at face value, there’s been a lot of groundwork that’s been done that might be valuable, but let’s take a fresh look at it with a new set of eyes. And the new Commerce Secretary nominee [Wilbur Ross] has some experience, at least, with trade. So that might get revived down the road. It might surprise us all. Lisa Kopp: If you look back to the nature of trade agreements, something that people don’t actually realize is it’s not just about barriers to entry. Today’s trade agreements have less to do with actually taking away tariffs or barriers to entry and more about regulating the structure of patent agreements and sort of how you play — for example, child labor laws. So, yes, we may lose some great things, if it doesn’t go through — and, again, it looks like it’s not going to go through, given Trump’s bent — but it may actually have less impact on trade than people would assume. Are we going to see more or less business regulation going forward? Henneman: That’s the one part of the Trump trade I’d be willing to bet on, that regulation is going to decrease. The pendulum has swung too far, and this is the catalyst we need to get it swinging back the other way. Sit: I agree with that. And let’s take, for example, the banks. I mean, Dodd-Frank, it’s a one-size-fits-all. There’s no differentiation being made between JPMorgan, Bank of America, versus a smaller regional bank. They’re the same regulations. I think there’s overregulation that they need to re-examine and say, OK, what really makes the most sense for the situation versus one size fits all? Talk about some sectors where people can be excited about allocating their investments. Pomerantz: I think consumer stocks are going to do better. There are so many things that are going on here — repatriation, more money comes back, tax rates go down, more money in consumers’ pockets, people feel better about things. I think already you’re seeing some impact to that early on. Schleif: In the environment we’re in now, if you’re going to spend on infrastructure, you’re going to spend on technology as well. There were over 70 voter-led referendums that generated over $70 billion worth of municipal bond issuance that’s set to come in the next few years. [Look at the new 35W bridge.] It’s got a lot of technology in that bridge that got put back up. Also from a capitalization standpoint, one of the biggest beneficiaries of bringing individual and corporate tax rates down would be small and mid-cap stocks. You’ve seen them rally hugely. Johnson: From my perspective in terms of where to be positioned for 2017, we’re overweight, and have been since about August, in energy, we’re overweight in basic materials, and we’re also overweight in tech, because that should be a natural beneficiary. We’re underweight in the interest-sensitive areas, such as more of the bond proxy areas, utilities, consumer staples and our communication media group. Joy: I would agree on the energy front. Another area within industrials I would say is defense spending, probably going to be a big beneficiary of increased spending at the federal government level. Sit: You have to look at some companies that have a lot of overseas cash, because if they can repatriate that at even a 10 percent rate, that’s a lot of capital that they can use for further growth, share buybacks, whatever, and that should be helpful for their stock prices. On top of that, I think we’ve got to look for companies that have a higher corporate tax rate right now, because if there is a change in the corporate tax laws and you can bring down that tax rate, there is more money flowing to the bottom line for those companies as well. Kopp: We actually believe that there’s a broader opportunity next year than there may have been coming into 2016, and the reason why is you have some sectors that we thought were already attractive — like the consumer discretionary and health care and technology that were attractive both on some of their bottom up opportunities for innovation, but also some of the top down tailwinds like the aging consumer or e-commerce. But in addition to that, you have had a change in the environment with the reflation trade and with the lowering of tax rates, things that should help some of the cyclicals, like the industrials and the materials and the financials. So we actually see that there may be more groups, potentially, that could do well in the next year. Henneman: I think, to Roger’s point, that it’s going to be a stock pickers’ market, is right on, and making sector bets is not something you really need to do when you’re in that environment. We’ve got a long-term overweight in industrials, but we’re not adding new money there, but there’s individual names, and they can be just kind of anywhere, and we’re seeing Medtronic and Hormel just as really attractive right here. There’s really no theme to that. It’s just finding opportunities of great companies when they’re on sale. The S&P 500 closed 2016 at 2,239. What are your S&P 500 predictions for 2017? Henneman: I’m 2,250, just kind of the impacts of full valuation, rising dollar. We’ll see about that. I don’t know where it’s going, but I do know it’s high right now, and I’ve got those comps coming at me, which, frankly, I think is just fine. Sit: 2,300. I’m assuming we get about a 5 percent earnings growth. And like I said earlier several times, I think it’s going to be based on fundamentals. It’s going to be a stock pickers’ market. Pomeranz: I’m going to say 2,375. I think it will be a good year. I honestly think in the last two years we’ve sort of come back to even. Two years ago, the market was essentially flat. This year, we’re up 10 percent, so we’re up 5 percent over two years. I don’t think this is an egregious amount. I think taxes will come down. I think earnings will improve. I think consumer sentiment and investor sentiment will be favorable. I think it will turn out to be an average year for us next year. Paulsen: I’m going to go 2,325. I think it’s going to be a wild year that has echoes of 1987. I don’t think it will be near the magnitude, but I think some of the character will be similar. We get pretty excited about stuff, and for a while we trade up on higher inflation, higher rates, it’s all good, cyclical led, and then we have a little bit of an air pocket at some point in the year, and we end up not that much higher, 5 percent or something, from where we started. Robillard: I’m going to say unchanged, 2,190. I’m with Jim, much higher and then about the same for a while. It’s the first year of President-elect Trump’s deal. Johnson: Perhaps I’ll be the high-water person on the Street, but we’re looking for 2,424 for next year. We’re also looking for 3 to 3¼ on the 10-year bond yield. Joy: We’re at 2,350. We think earnings growth is going to be around 9 percent, and economic growth in the U.S. improved to about 2½ percent. I think the Fed raises only twice, and so multiples don’t come under real pressure, and that gets us to 2,350. Schleif: I’ll be the odd one out. I’m going to say 2,317. We do think that volatility will be increased, and wouldn’t be surprised to see sharp upticks and downticks. I do think inflation most likely will surprise on the upside. Overall, I think the sentiment has turned, and we are optimistic about business confidence and where the markets could end the year. Kopp: We were going to come in at 2,350, so now maybe I have to say 2,349. We’re assuming, basically, a similar multiple to today, but we are assuming some decent earnings growth, and so we’re thinking somewhere in the single mid-digits is going to happen, and it’s really based on the fact that we see some good bottom-up opportunities with companies. Top down still looks OK. GDP is coming in at decent, maybe slightly accelerating, and the overseas economies are doing all right.

So was I when I went back through the columns I had written this year about the consumer issues that confused or annoyed me most. What I found was a pleasant surprise: In several cases, things had actually gotten at least a little better in the months since I’d visited the topic. So let us return to airline baggage fees, the general unpleasantness of the rental car industry, banks that use scare tactics to try to keep you from using new apps, and price transparency in college shopping. Glimmers of optimism are appropriate in each case, but so is vigilance. Our need to call companies out when they’re not meeting our needs continues unabated. LUGGAGE FEE REFUNDS When you pay to check your bags and they don’t arrive until a day after you do, you ought to get your money back. Seems logical, and airlines don’t always disagree, as I wrote in April. But the process is deliberately tedious — and it can end with vouchers for future travel instead of refunds to your credit card. In a rare bit of bipartisan legislative action, Congress delivered in July the reauthorization act for the Federal Aviation Administration. It promises that by July 2017, all air carriers must “promptly” provide an “automated refund” of checked baggage fees if they fail “to deliver” a bag 12 hours after the arrival of a domestic flight or 15 hours after an international one. There will still need to be a round of Department of Transportation rule-making on the specifics, which worries me some. Kathy Allen, a spokeswoman for the trade group Airlines for America, didn’t want to say much beyond pointing me to a statement about the dangers of regulation. She added, via email, that she didn’t think “there’s any way to speculate at this point about the future administration.” So I took my skeptical questions — How “automated” is automated? Can a voucher count as a refund? How exactly are we to define “deliver”? — to Charles Leocha, the founder of the advocacy group Travelers United. Mr. Leocha believes that every airline will have to offer a refund to your credit card but may be able to extend a voucher as an option, too. So be ready to ask for your “automatic” refund and check a box for a true refund to your credit or debit card. Airlines prefer vouchers because of the “breakage” — the fancy industry term for people forgetting all about them. Normally when bags are many hours late, the airline hires a company to deliver them to you. So here’s a cynical question to ponder: Will the airlines start the clock for refund purposes when you land and then stop it when your bags merely arrive at the airport, long after you’ve given up and left? Or will they do the right thing and not stop the clock until the delivery company shows up with your bag, many hours after the bag may have arrived at the airport? Mr. Leocha would not rule out the possibility that the airlines might try to default to the first scenario, noting that there’s usually some kind of battle during the rule-making process. NEW BLOOD AT HERTZ This month, I channeled years of frustration and bile into a column about the rental-car industry. By my analysis, the leading companies seemed to have set a team of user-experience geeks loose with the goal of making car rentals so painful that every last one of us would flee to Lyft or Uber. A few days later, Hertz announced that its chief executive was retiring as of Jan. 3 and that his replacement, Kathryn V. Marinello, would come from outside the company. Even better: She has deep experience in the payments industry from her time at General Electric and First Data. Hertz has an obnoxious practice of charging customers for toll transponders, even on days when the vehicles don’t pass through tolls. This isn’t necessary. Competitors like Enterprise don’t charge on days when the gear is idle, while Silvercar doesn’t charge at all for the transponder. Will Ms. Marinello rid us of this scourge? A Hertz spokeswoman, Karen Drake, did not reply to my request to have a chat with the new boss. MY PAL JAMIE DIMON Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase chief executive, used his annual shareholders letter in April to try to scare consumers who use some third-party apps and services that help manage and move money. In a May column with the headline “Jamie Dimon Wants to Protect You From Innovative Start-Ups,” I tried to take the measure of his security concerns, which seemed to have been directed at companies like Yodlee, Mint, Acorns and Penny. Later that month, when Recode’s Kara Swisher asked him about the headline, which she described as “not a very nice” one, he dismissed it with an unprintable phrase. Time will tell if he intends to erect barriers that will keep new companies from helping his customers improve their financial lives in ways the bank hasn’t thought of yet. I hope he doesn’t. Since then, there have been no big breaches that we know of at start-ups and services like these. Last month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a welcome, industrywide call for comments on third-party data access and possible additional safeguards. We’ll see if the bureau can issue recommendations before our elected officials begin their promised defanging of the agency. I do want to thank Mr. Dimon on behalf of credit-card reward junkies everywhere for giving us the Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card in 2016. By next month, I’ll have extracted over $2,100 in value in exchange for my $450 annual fee. At that point, we’ll put my card aside, my wife will get her own, and we’ll do the same thing all over again. All those perks for customers will reduce the bank’s profit by $200 million to $300 million in the fourth quarter, Mr. Dimon told investors this month, according to a Bloomberg report. But the investment could pay off handsomely if people stick with the card for a long time and carry balances that are multiples of the rewards they extract. COLLEGE COST TRANSPARENCY In 2016, schools like the California Institute of Technology, Harvard and Princeton continued to block College Abacus, a nifty tool for families to estimate the true cost of attendance at a college or university and to compare it with other institutions. The tool can’t compare costs if it can’t access the universities’ calculators, so the schools erect barricades that block it. As I wrote in a January column, the schools’ representatives either blew me off when I asked them why they were doing this or offered explanations that didn’t stand up to scrutiny. So let me explain what I think is actually going on here. Most colleges are already in a quiet price war, haggling on financial aid offers in April or throwing discounts at families earlier in the season and calling it merit aid or some other euphemistic term. Any tool like the one at College Abacus, which bluntly pits schools against one another, reinforces the idea that cost ought to be a big factor in any family’s decision making. Once you put down the pictures of leafy campuses and start in on the spreadsheet, however, you discover that there isn’t much data that can help you figure out whether the school with the $65,000 annual bill for tuition, room and board is better than the school that offers $45,000 (including a $20,000 discount). Or whether the $25,000 flagship state university would be just fine (or worse than two years of community college first). So a tip of the cap to unafraid administrators at Drew University, which unblocked College Abacus’s search software this year. Here’s hoping that more schools will do the same in 2017, a year in which I intend to ask plenty more questions about how and what to pay for college.

Ogg January 5, 2017 12:45 pm EST Print Email Tweet As the year gets off to a start, it is important to think about where the markets came from in 2016 and where they stand at the start of 2017 in order to make assumptions about how the markets will perform throughout the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed out 2016 up 13.4% at 19,762.60, outperforming the 2016 gains of 9.5% for the S&P 500 and 7.5% for the Nasdaq. 24/7 Wall St. evaluates each of the 30 Dow components at the start of each year to come up with a forecast for the year ahead. Our bull-bear case pointed toward 19,700 for 2016, and that was without ever mentioning or considering the names Trump and Clinton in the outlook at that time. There does seem to be a path to Dow 22,000 that could come late in 2017, but it could also easily not come until 2018. Using the Thomson Reuters consensus analyst price targets (mean) and taking total returns from dividends and past performance have to be given consideration. There are also internal business developments to consider on each company, and the technology sector is always in a state of change. For how the Dow can rise beyond 20,000, we have looked at three tech stocks having a singular role: IBM, Intel and Cisco. Cisco Systems Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) ended the quarter down almost 4%, but the annual gain of 15.13% took shares to a year-end close of $30.22. Cisco is the largest dividend yield in the Dow’s tech giants, and it was even in the top five yields in the 2017 Dogs of the Dow. Cisco’s consensus analyst price target from Thomson Reuters was $33.11 at the start of 2017. While this implied simple upside of 9.6%, the 3.4% dividend yield would make for an implied total return of 13.0% in 2017, if the analysts are correct. Unfortunately for Cisco’s relation to the Dow, the reality is that it is the smallest weighted component at just 1.03% of the whole index. That means that Cisco shares could double, and if the rest of the Dow stocks were flat it would hardly make a difference to the Dow. Still, on its own it has above-average implied upside expectations and Cisco’s dividend remains solid for tech investors. Valuations remain compelling for Cisco, and it is well-known that Cisco loves buying back stock. If the company is able to repatriate overseas cash, CEO Chuck Robbins even said directly that more stock would be purchased. Its earnings per share of $2.36 in 2016 is expected to rise to $2.49 in 2018 and $2.60 in 2019. That slow of earnings growth may be capping upside. Still, Cisco is valued at less than 13 times expected 2017 earnings expectations. Imagine if Cisco can deliver serious earnings upside after its years of restructuring efforts. Cisco has been changing its model in recent years. It remains more focused on sales and enterprise-wide sales opportunities where it can offer networking, data center and security from the top to the bottom. One issue holding back Cisco is that many of the core growth markets (emerging markets) have been growing far less than their potential. China also has been a huge effort, even if domestic companies in China would rather get sales locally than letting Cisco get them. In mid-December, JPMorgan’s tactical options team warned that Cisco was near a peak price and valuation with limited catalysts and unfavorable sector rotation. They recommend that shareholders buy protection (put options). The firm recently maintained only a $29 price target and emphasized a negative view. Also in December, Credit Suisse maintained its Underperform rating and a below-consensus target price of $25. UBS took the more bullish side of the coin in December, addressing secular challenges but going at other issues around earnings weakness. UBS kept its Buy rating alive, as well as its price target of $35. That target was based upon 14 times expected 2017 earnings, and the firm thinks Cisco has superior margins over rivals in tech. UBS even called Cisco inexpensive on a free-cash-flow basis by almost one-third. The firm sees Cisco ONE as the first step to the company generating more recurring revenue from its core networking franchise Cisco shares have a 52-week trading range of $22.46 to $31.95. The market cap is $153 billion, and the dividend yield is 3.4%. Intel Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) generated a return of almost 9% in 2016, with its year-end closing price being $36.27. Intel’s consensus price target of $39.89 suggests gains of almost 10%, and the 2.9% dividend yield would make for an implied gain of 12.9% on a total return basis in 2017, if analysts are accurate here. The semiconductor and processor giant has a problem of its weighting in the Dow that is similar to Cisco, in that it is ranked quite low. Its low share price gives Intel just a 1.25% weighting in the Dow, making it ranked 27th out of the 30 Dow stocks. Similar to Cisco, Intel could double and it would hardly move the Dow’s index level, if the other components somehow did not participate.

Sonia Legg reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript 1.05 billion Swiss francs ($1.2bln) is today's daily digit - Credit Suisse's net profit for the second quarter. The Swiss bank's slimmed down investment arm was largely responsible. Its net profit doubled, contributing to an overall jump of a third. Like its Wall Street rivals it benefitted from strong trading in stocks and bonds. At least it did until the U.S. Federal Reserve raised the prospect of cutting back stimulus. The bank hopes a rise in interest rates will offset that although Robert Cole from Reuters BreakingViews warns against complacency. (SOUNDBITE) (English): ROBERT COLE, REUTERS BREAKINGVIEWS, SAYING: "On one level rising interest rates does some favours for banks but at the same time it changes the competitive dynamics of this and while it might be good for Credit Suisse it might be better for somebody else who plays that market more effectively." Angeline Ong says Starmine data - which looks at equity performance - also suggests it's going to be tough. (SOUNDBITE) (English): REUTERS REPORTER ANGELINE ONG, SAYING: "In terms of return on equity, which measures a firm's profitability, Credit Suisse comes in at 7.4 paling in comparision to Goldman Sach's 10.3 and JP Morgan Chase's 11.5. Same story when we look at their ARM scores - Gold and JPMorgan Chase bth80 and 91, But Credit Suisse only gets 29 out of a best possible scores of 100." Shares fell 2% - in contrast to a 13% rise over the the past three weeks. A global crackdown on Swiss bank secrecy hasn't helped. European clients have been withdrawing money to avoid tax probes rattling Credit Suisse's normally stable wealth management arm.

News Morgan Stanley To Fire Equities Personnel, Cut Bonus Pool Bonuses are being cut at Wall Street mainstay Morgan Stanley in the wake of flagging results. (imagebroker/Stefan Kiefer/Newscom) BLOOMBERG NEWS 1/06/2017 Reprints Morgan Stanley (MS), Wall Street's biggest stock-trading firm by revenue, is cutting its global bonus pool for the equities division by as much as 4% and dismissing some employees after the industry's results flagged last year, according to people with knowledge of the plans. The firm, which is set to pay annual bonuses next month, has been fine-tuning calculations for pay packages since November, according to the people, who asked not to be identified describing the deliberations. Traders and salespeople across the investment bank were terminated this week as part of an annual performance review, the people said. Wall Street firms that have been cost-cutting to improve profits in the wake of the financial crisis are set to focus on equities personnel after new issuances decreased in 2016. Stock traders and salespeople around the world may see compensation for the year fall 9%, the first drop since 2012, according to a November report from recruiting firm Options Group. Meanwhile, fixed-income personnel should see the first increase since 2012 after political events set off a frenzy of transactions, according to the report. Morgan Stanley's equities revenue dropped 3.5% to $6.08 billion in the first nine months of 2016. Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs Group (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) all suffered declines of 12% to 14% in that business, while the biggest European investment banks all reported decreases of more than 20% on a dollar basis. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) posted the smallest drop, about 1%. Bank of America set aside about 5% less for equities traders' bonuses, as fees have dwindled along with a decline in stock issuances, people with knowledge of the matter said. The decline also reflects the impact of fewer employees in the business, the people said. "Morgan Stanley and other U.S. banks can afford to cut bonuses, since they face reduced competition thanks to European banks being lame ducks due to European regulations on bonuses," said Jason Kennedy, chief executive officer of recruitment firm Kennedy Group in London. Morgan Stanley cut compensation costs at its investment banking and trading unit by 11% in the first nine months of 2016, as revenue dropped 12%. The firm is set to announce its full-year pay expenses later this month. Ted Pick, who led Morgan Stanley's equities business to the top spot in the years after the financial crisis, was put in charge of all the company's trading in October 2015. Last year, Pick tapped stock-trading executive Sam Kellie-Smith to help turn around the firm's fixed-income unit, while Peter Santoro was elevated to head of equity trading.

Sleep. Trump tells German paper: NATO is ‘obsolete’ MORE’s surprise victory in November, many observers were left wondering what a his presidency would mean for the financial regulatory environment, given his repeated campaign promises to significantly roll-back many recent financial regulations. Will President Trump and his administration lean back on his business and Wall Street ties to enact financial deregulation policies focused on boosting banking profits at the expense of excessive risk taking? Or will President Trump take a more measured approach to financial deregulation with an end-goal of job creation through reduction of compliance burdens and return to pro-business, credit-friendly environs? With election night in our collective rear view mirror and the inauguration less than three weeks away, an examination of the president-elect’s transition advisers, early cabinet and agency nominees, and industry reaction provides insight to how financial deregulation will unfold in the early stages of a Trump presidency. None is more telling than the lead up to the president-elect’s announcement of Jay Clayton as his nominee for chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We can start by looking at billionaire investor Carl Icahn, one of Trump’s primary advisers on this nomination. Icahn, who was an early supporter and key advisor to Trump during the campaign, became an early member of his transition team and was recently named special advisor to the president on regulatory reform, with an emphasis on regulations that are in the purview of the SEC. Icahn played a central role in evaluating candidates for the SEC chairmanship, meeting with most of the candidates on behalf of the president-elect. As a well-known activist investor, Icahn has skin in the game in terms of the SEC’s direction under the next administration. Activist investors and their clashes with corporate boards are heavily monitored and controlled by the SEC, with business groups urging the agency to require activist investors to more quickly disclose their stakes following acquisition. Icahn has also been less critical of recent targets of deregulation focus, having been generally positive about the Dodd-Frank Act, and in particular, the Volcker rule’s ban on proprietary trading, which is one of the financial reform law’s signature initiatives. Icahn has acknowledged that the Volcker rule has reduced the role of banks in securities markets, which opponents criticize as reducing the number of buyers and sellers in a crisis market. Icahn, while debating BlackRock CEO Laurence Fink at a conference in 2015, said that regulations weren’t to blame for this market weakness. Rather, he said the vast role that large asset managers like BlackRock play in the markets by introducing high-risk investment funds are to blame, as they would inevitably have difficulty meeting investor redemptions in a crisis—much like how the most recent financial crisis unfolded. We can expect Icahn to be a powerful voice in shaping the direction of the SEC in this area of what will likely be adjustments to Dodd-Frank, rather than an outright appeal. This is a preference expressed by several the largest bank executives. Icahn’s well-known advocacy of better corporate governance standards for boards of directors and executive management will also likely be pushed by the Trump administration. This brings us to Trump’s nomination of veteran Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton, a partner at prominent New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, as the next chairman of the SEC. Many had expected the president-elect to nominate former U.S. Attorney Debra Wong Yang, whose background is more closely aligned to that of outgoing SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor. Clayton is more of a conventional choice than was expected under an Icahn-advised president-elect, but he is consistent with Republican ideals in terms of dealmaking with Wall Street rather than vilifying it. He is more consistent with pre-crisis nominees of the administrations of Bill ClintonBill ClintonDem boycotts of inauguration grow Dems 'outraged' with Comey after House briefing Poll: Trump enters office with historically low approval rating MORE and George W. Bush. Clayton has a wealth of large Wall Street banking deals under his belt, including assisting Barclays in acquiring significant Lehman Brothers assets in bankruptcy and facilitating the sale of Bears Stearns to JPMorgan Chase in the early days of the financial crisis. He has extensive experience in raising capital, having counseled Goldman Sachs on Warren Buffett’s $5 billion investment in the bank during the financial crisis, and advised several significant initial public offerings. ADVERTISEMENT In his role at the SEC, Clayton will likely focus his deregulatory efforts to loosen the fundraising rules and compliance requirements, particular for small to middle market companies, which is in line with Trump’s mantra of job creation through capital investment. Given Clayton’s close ties to private-equity firms and several prominent Wall Street executives, private-equity firm oversight and executive compensation limitations will likely be rolled back. If confirmed, Clayton will take over the SEC at a time when congressional Republicans are pressuring the agency to loosen fundraising rules for smaller public companies, lighten its oversight of private-equity firms, and repeal executive-compensation rules opposed by corporations. Much of president-elect Trump’s deregulation policy is yet to unfold. Beyond targeting Dodd-Frank for a repeal or rewrite, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2004—enacted after the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals—may be in the crosshairs of the Trump administration and Republican-controlled Congress. Nominations such as that of Clayton certainly indicate that deregulation will be aggressive in the hopes of making it easier for the commercial banking and private-equity sectors to do business.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) AP Higher wages push stocks to records, but Dow misses 20,000 By MARLEY JAY AP Markets Writer Jan 6, 2017 0 Richard Drew FILE - This Thursday, Oct. 2, 2014, file photo shows the Wall Street entrance of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are dipping Friday, Jan. 6, 2017, after a solid but unspectacular hiring report for the month of December. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK (AP) — So close! The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. Sam Stovall, a U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ, said there was good news for most industries. That's because workers are being paid more, but the report won't push the Fed to raise rates quickly in order to stave off inflation. "Consumers are earning a bit more and as a result can spend more," he said. "But ... people are not too worried the Fed will have to slam on the brakes." At about 12:40 p.m. the Dow peaked at 19,999.63, but later lost steam. It finished up 64.51 points, or 0.3 percent, at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06. The small-cap Russell 2000 index slid 4.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,367.28. Stocks finished the week with a big gain as investors remained optimistic about the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7 percent. That was a marked change from last year, when the index lost 6 percent as the market got off to its worst opening week in history. The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, which was solid but slightly disappointing. However the government said hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from December 2015, the biggest monthly increase in seven years. Overall, job growth remained steady in 2016 but slowed a bit from 2015. The biggest gains went to companies that stand to benefit from higher wages and greater spending by consumers. Among technology companies, Facebook rose $2.74, or 2.3 percent, to $123.41 and Apple gained $1.30, or 1.1 percent, to $117.91. Amazon had its second big gain in a row and added $15.54, or 2 percent, to $795.99 while travel website TripAdvisor picked up $1.57, or 3.2 percent, to $50.77. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election two months ago, also fared well. Machinery and equipment maker Honeywell rose $1.77, or 1.5 percent, to $118.53. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.42 percent from 2.35 percent. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money on lending. Investment banks and other financial firms did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. SunTrust Banks rose 63 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $55.53 and Goldman Sachs jumped $3.58, or 1.5 percent, to $244.90. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies and real estate investment trusts, lagged the market as bond yields rose. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T gave up 84 cents, or 2 percent, to $41.32 and Crown Castle International fell $1.74, or 2 percent, to $85.50. Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron's cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling, which came from U.S. District Court in Delaware. Amgen stock gained $3.80, or 2.5 percent, to $156.78 while Regeneron slid $22.24, or 5.8 percent, to $358.68 and Sanofi lost $1.18, or 2.8 percent, to $40.32. The dollar rose to 117.02 yen from 115.62 yen after a dip Thursday. The euro slipped to $1.0532 from $1.0590. U.S. crude oil rose 23 cents to close at $53.99 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 21 cents to close at $57.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slipped less than 1 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.70 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1 cent to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $7.90 to $1,173.40 an ounce. Silver sank 12 cents to $16.52 an ounce. Copper rose 1 cent to $2.55 a pound. The FTSE 100 index in Britain inched up 0.2 percent. It's risen nine days in a row and is at all-time highs. Germany's DAX edged up 0.1 percent and the CAC-40 of France rose 0.2 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3 percent while the Kospi in South Korea added 0.4 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng advanced 0.2 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) AP Higher wages push stocks to records, but Dow misses 20,000 By MARLEY JAY AP Markets Writer Jan 6, 2017 0 Richard Drew FILE - This Thursday, Oct. 2, 2014, file photo shows the Wall Street entrance of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are dipping Friday, Jan. 6, 2017, after a solid but unspectacular hiring report for the month of December. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK (AP) — So close! The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. Sam Stovall, a U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ, said there was good news for most industries. That's because workers are being paid more, but the report won't push the Fed to raise rates quickly in order to stave off inflation. "Consumers are earning a bit more and as a result can spend more," he said. "But ... people are not too worried the Fed will have to slam on the brakes." At about 12:40 p.m. the Dow peaked at 19,999.63, but later lost steam. It finished up 64.51 points, or 0.3 percent, at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06. The small-cap Russell 2000 index slid 4.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,367.28. Stocks finished the week with a big gain as investors remained optimistic about the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7 percent. That was a marked change from last year, when the index lost 6 percent as the market got off to its worst opening week in history. The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, which was solid but slightly disappointing. However the government said hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from December 2015, the biggest monthly increase in seven years. Overall, job growth remained steady in 2016 but slowed a bit from 2015. The biggest gains went to companies that stand to benefit from higher wages and greater spending by consumers. Among technology companies, Facebook rose $2.74, or 2.3 percent, to $123.41 and Apple gained $1.30, or 1.1 percent, to $117.91. Amazon had its second big gain in a row and added $15.54, or 2 percent, to $795.99 while travel website TripAdvisor picked up $1.57, or 3.2 percent, to $50.77. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election two months ago, also fared well. Machinery and equipment maker Honeywell rose $1.77, or 1.5 percent, to $118.53. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.42 percent from 2.35 percent. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money on lending. Investment banks and other financial firms did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. SunTrust Banks rose 63 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $55.53 and Goldman Sachs jumped $3.58, or 1.5 percent, to $244.90. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies and real estate investment trusts, lagged the market as bond yields rose. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T gave up 84 cents, or 2 percent, to $41.32 and Crown Castle International fell $1.74, or 2 percent, to $85.50. Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron's cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling, which came from U.S. District Court in Delaware. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Amgen stock gained $3.80, or 2.5 percent, to $156.78 while Regeneron slid $22.24, or 5.8 percent, to $358.68 and Sanofi lost $1.18, or 2.8 percent, to $40.32. The dollar rose to 117.02 yen from 115.62 yen after a dip Thursday. The euro slipped to $1.0532 from $1.0590. U.S. crude oil rose 23 cents to close at $53.99 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 21 cents to close at $57.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slipped less than 1 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.70 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1 cent to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $7.90 to $1,173.40 an ounce. Silver sank 12 cents to $16.52 an ounce. Copper rose 1 cent to $2.55 a pound. The FTSE 100 index in Britain inched up 0.2 percent. It's risen nine days in a row and is at all-time highs. Germany's DAX edged up 0.1 percent and the CAC-40 of France rose 0.2 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3 percent while the Kospi in South Korea added 0.4 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng advanced 0.2 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Tags Wire Business General News Currency Markets Job Trends Stock Markets Financial Markets Intellectual Property Violations Intellectual Property Crime Patents Careers Government Finance Government Business And Finance Government And Politics Commodity Markets Technology Leading Economic Indicators Economy Corporate Stock Corporate News Government Pay Industrial Machinery And Equipment Industrial Products And Services Economic Policy Government Policy Banking And Credit Financial Services Labor Economy × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

In a note to clients Friday, Lee issued a 12-month price target of 2,275 for the S&P 500 index, the lowest forecast among Wall Street strategists tracked by CNBC. The new price target implies a gain of 0.3 percent from Thursday's close. Lee, who is head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, an independent research boutique firm he founded two years ago after a long career at JPMorgan, says there are many risks in 2017. Among those risks, the strategist believes President-elect Donald Trump may have a difficult time passing his pro-growth policies, an outcome that could lead to investors' disappointment and a potential market reversal.

Morgan Stanley, Wall Street’s biggest stock-trading firm by revenue, is cutting its global bonus pool for the equities division by as much as 4 percent and dismissing some employees after the industry’s results flagged last year, according to people with knowledge of the plans. The firm, which is set to pay annual bonuses next month, has been fine-tuning calculations for pay packages since November, according to the people, who asked not to be identified describing the deliberations. Traders and salespeople across the investment bank were terminated this week as part of an annual performance review, the people said. Wall Street firms that have been cost-cutting to improve profits in the wake of the financial crisis are set to focus on equities personnel after new issuance decreased in 2016. Stock traders and salespeople around the world may see compensation for the year fall 9 percent, the first drop since 2012, according to a November report from recruiting firm Options Group. Meanwhile, fixed-income personnel should see the first increase since 2012 after political events set off a frenzy of transactions, according to the report. Morgan Stanley’s equities revenue dropped 3.5 percent to $6.08 billion in the first nine months of 2016. Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp. all suffered declines of 12 percent to 14 percent in that business, while the biggest European investment banks all reported decreases of more than 20 percent on a dollar basis. JPMorgan Chase & Co. posted the smallest drop, about 1 percent. BofA Cuts Bank of America set aside about 5 percent less for equities traders’ bonuses, as fees have dwindled along with a decline in stock issuances, people with knowledge of the matter said. The decline also reflects the impact of fewer employees in the business, the people said. “Morgan Stanley and other U.S. banks can afford to cut bonuses, since they face reduced competition thanks to European banks being lame ducks due to European regulations on bonuses,” said Jason Kennedy, chief executive officer of recruitment firm Kennedy Group in London. Morgan Stanley cut compensation costs at its investment banking and trading unit by 11 percent in the first nine months of 2016, as revenue dropped 12 percent. The firm is set to announce its full-year pay expenses later this month. Ted Pick, who led Morgan Stanley’s equities business to the top spot in the years after the financial crisis, was put in charge of all the company’s trading in October 2015. Last year, Pick tapped stock-trading executive Sam Kellie-Smith to help turn around the firm’s fixed-income unit, while Peter Santoro was elevated to head of equity trading.
