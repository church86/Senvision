There are three reasons to conclude that JPMorgan Chase is a good stock for dividend investors. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 1, 2016 at 9:40AM The Chase Tower in Phoenix, Arizona. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. If you're a dividend investor, then you should consider owning shares of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). There are multiple reasons that the nation's biggest bank by assets is a good stock for dividend investors. An above-average yield The first is that JPMorgan Chase's shares yield more than the average stock. Its investors, therefore, get a larger check each quarter relative to the price of their shares than they would get by investing in a stock with an ordinary yield. The typical stock on the S&P 500 yields 2.1%. That's meaningfully below JPMorgan Chase's 2.7% yield. The story is similar, though not to the same extent, if you look at other major bank stocks. The average yield on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks 23 of the biggest banks in the country, is 2.5%. Stock/Index Dividend Yield JPMorgan Chase 2.7% KBW Bank Index* 2.5% S&P 500* 2.1% *Average. Data sources: YCharts.com, The Wall Street Journal. A reasonable payout ratio When a stock yields more than the broader market, or more than other stocks in the same industry, the first thing to check is if the company pays out a larger share of earnings each year than its peers do. It isn't necessarily bad if that's the case, but it would explain why the yield is higher. A stock with a high payout ratio, moreover, has less room to raise its dividend going forward. Let's say, for instance, that a company pays out only 30% of its annual earnings each year. That leaves plenty of space to increase the payout. But if the company already distributes 90% of its net income to shareholders, there's a limit to how much more that can grow. JPMorgan Chase distributes 34% of its earnings. That's right in line with other blue chip bank stocks. The median stock on the KBW Bank Index sports a payout ratio of 34%. While JPMorgan Chase's payout ratio is thus on par for big bank stocks, it's nevertheless low enough to allow JPMorgan Chase to consistently grow its payout in the future. A history of dividend raises Just because a bank has a reasonable payout ratio doesn't mean that it will, in fact, boost its dividend on a regular basis. The best way to determine this is to look, instead, at a bank's history of doing so. The chart that shows this in JPMorgan Chase's case seems, at first, to be all over the board. Prior to the financial crisis, it paid out around $0.35 per share each quarter. That dropped to $0.05 per share when the crisis struck, fueled by the need to boost capital and satisfy regulators that the bank had enough fire power to survive the downturn. JPM Dividend data by YCharts. But the important thing to take away from the chart isn't what happened during the crisis, it's rather what has happened to JPMorgan Chase's dividend since then. Namely, the $2.5 trillion bank has raised it every year since 2010, bumping it up most recently to $0.48 per share. The net result is that JPMorgan Chase not only yields more than the average stock, while paying out a similar share of its earnings, but the New York City-based bank has also demonstrated convincingly that it's committed to raising its dividend on a regular basis, if not yearly. It's for these three reasons, then, that I believe JPMorgan Chase is a good stock for dividend investors. John Maxfield has no position in any stocks mentioned.

"The thing that keeps me up at night: I think there is more inflationary pressure in the system than a lot of people really appreciate," the global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management said in an interview with CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Friday. "I think the labor market is tight. I think wages are going to start picking up into the end of the year. And I think that there is a risk that next year we could find ourselves in an inflation environment — it's not hyperinflation — and the Fed finds itself a little bit behind the curve." The Federal Reserve passed on raising interest rates at its September meeting, but indicated it may hike before the end of the year. It hasn't increased rates since its first post-easing hike in December 2015. Colin Anderson | Getty Images Lebovitz said if the central bank tries to start catching up on rate increases at the same time that rising wages are putting downward pressure on corporate margins, it would be a "toxic cocktail" for the market. Inflationary pressure will also put the fixed income market at risk, Lebovitz said. He believes the bull market in fixed income has ended, but the bear market hasn't started yet. "Inflation is going to be the missing link there," Lebovitz noted. That said, there is a lot weighing on the overall market in the next three months, including the presidential election, the Fed meetings and a referendum in Italy. Therefore, Lebovitz advocates investors keep a balanced portfolio that includes stocks and bonds. "I wouldn't be abandoning fixed income yet. I would just be cognizant of some of the risks that are on the horizon."

The sector has taken a hit thanks to low interest rates, pressure from regulators and the scrutiny surrounding Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo. The KBW Nasdaq Bank index is off almost 3 percent in 2016, and financials as a whole are the second-worst performer on the S&P 500. "When I look at the markets globally, the one pocket of value that is left is financials," the global market strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management said in an interview with "Power Lunch." Lebovitz said that for those using valuation as a guide to investing, there are opportunities in the sector. He thinks U.S. names look more attractive than their European counterparts and noted that relative to 2008, globally banks are looking much healthier. Banks may become a dividend play, now that the Federal Reserve has given them clearance to start raising dividends, he added. "I think you might see financials start to catch a bid on the back of this low volatility, high dividend trade that's been in place for the better part of this year," Lebovitz said. However, he cautioned that sometimes stocks are cheap for a reason. "There is a lot of headline risk right now and I think the biggest thing investors need to be cognizant of is the ability for contagion, for sentiment to deteriorate around these names and really push the market lower," he said. — CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

 Deutsche Bank has a 'fundamental business problem' beyond its immediate crisis Bob Bryan Sep. 30, 2016, 10:05 AM 4,868 facebook linkedin twitter email print Eric Thayer/Reuters Deutsche Bank has had a wild two weeks. The German bank reportedly may be on the hook for $14 billion in fines for a settlement with US regulators over bad investment products from the financial crisis era. The steep fine has led to speculation over a government bailout and a possible decrease in exposure by hedge funds, signaling no confidence in the bank. Add all of this up, and Deutsche Bank now has its lowest share price ever and a US market cap smaller than Twitter. According to the Kian Abouhossein, a European bank analyst at JPMorgan, the problems at Deutsche Bank go much deeper than its current conundrum and don't appear to be going away anytime soon. Essentially, said Abouhossein, the bank has been unable to become leaner on the cost side — as many other banks have — at a time when many investment banks are bringing in lower revenues. Here's his assessment (emphasis added):  "Judging from its track record DB seems to have an inability to cut net costs and generate operating leverage independent of management in charge. Even under new CEO John Cryan, who we rate highly, DB has been unable to illustrate cost savings on a net basis so far. The inability to adjust the business model to a declining revenue environment is a major problem for an IB-geared bank and has led to the inability to generate retained earnings and hence capital generation in our view." Going deeper, Abouhossein noted that the tangible book value per share, essentially a measure of the real assets that the bank holds, has dropped 8% between 2012 and 2015 and the bank's average return on equity has been under 4% over the last six years. The firm's own goals for cost savings to counterbalance this declining profitability are also lackluster, according to the JPMorgan analyst. "DBK has reiterated its cost target of €26.5 billion for 2016 which is flat year over year despite clean revenues declining -13% year over year in our estimates," said the note to clients on Friday. "We see this as unambitious as DBK has €0.4 billion year over year decline in comp expense from deferred compensation amortization alone." Put another way, Deutsche has no real plans to decrease costs to offset lower profits even though there are clear ways to do so, which Abouhossein referred to as a "fundamental business problem" for the bank. "We think a bank with €26.5 billion of costs and 101,000 employees plus an estimated 30,000 consultants should be able to show more cost flexibility to generate book value growth," said Abouhossein. As for the current situation, Abouhossein said that he doesn't actually expect Deutsche to settle for the full $14 billion, but more likely will negotiate penalties in the $3 billion to $4 billion range, more in line with other settlements for allegations of similar nature. However, noted Abouhossein, the bank has $9.4 billion in money set aside for litigation and around $5.4 billion is needed for other settlements, so anything above $4 billion would require a capital raise from the bank, which would be dilutive to shares and send the stock lower. So there is some danger now, though not as great as recent price moves and commentary might imply. But without serious underlying changes to the bank, the same problems Deutsche currently faces will continue to bubble up.

Annie Korkki, 37, who works for JP Morgan Chase in Denver, and Robin Korkki, 42, a trader from Chicago, were found motionless in their bed by hotel staff last week. Facebook 7 Annie (left) and Robin (right) have been found dead at their luxury Seychelles villa after drinking throughout the day on Wednesday Facebook 7 Heartbroken relatives of the girls, seen above on their trip, is searching for answers into what led to their sudden deaths They were seen drinking all day and had to be escorted back to their room by staff at Maia Luxury Resort and Spa a week into their vacation on the popular holiday island. The sisters, who had been on holiday on the tropical island off the coast of Africa since September 15, were found unresponsive and were later pronounced dead at the scene by a doctor. A post-mortem carried out on Wednesday found that the girls died from had excess fluid in their lungs, while Annie also had fluid on the brain. Facebook Maia Luxury Resort & Spa 7 The sisters were found dead inside their luxury resort villa at the Maia Luxury Resort and Spa Medics said drug overdoses or alcohol poisoning can cause the fluid, but it could also have come from a viral infection. Dr Patrick Lank, a Northwestern Medicine assistant professor of emergency medicine in Chicago, said: “Two people at the same time is odd. It suggests more of a toxicologic or environmental cause, or a potential infection if they’re travelling together.” A preliminary examination conducted by police indicated there were no signs of violence or aggression on the women’s bodies, The Seychelles Nation reported. The women had been drinking throughout the day on Wednesday and were helped to their room by resort staff around 8.15pm that night. It was the last time they were seen alive.

Brother Chris Korkki, of Minnesota, said: “They were kind and generous and compassionate, and were wonderful people that had a positive impact on a huge number of people.” Authorities in Seychelles were called to the scene after a butler assigned to the villa arrived to find the sisters unresponsive on the same bed. There was no disturbance in the room, police said. While their bodies did not show any signs of trauma, certain medications were confiscated from the room by police as part of their investigation, authorities said. Facebook 7 Annie (above) and her sister had shared photos of their stay in Seychelles on Facebook The Korkki sisters’ stay at the resort was originally set to end on September 22, but they had extended it to September 24. They had been touring Africa since September 1 and visited Kenya, Tanzania and Zanzibar before arriving in Seychelles on September 16, according to an itinerary found at the hotel. Both sisters had shared photos of their stay in Seychelles on Facebook, with many showing the resort, where an ocean panoramic villa costs upwards of £1,300 per night. In one photo on September 17 appearing to show the beautiful view from their villa, Annie wrote in the comment section calling it ‘the best place ever’. In another, Annie said their trip was ‘indescribable.’ Facebook Maia Luxury Resort & Spa 7 ‘The best place ever’ ..the Seychelles is located more than 900 miles off Africa’s east coast Annie, who lived in Denver, worked at JP Morgan Chase, according to her Facebook page. Her sister Robin lived in Chicago and is the Head of FX and Metals at Allston Trading. Both are described as healthy women and experienced travellers. “The family is in shock,” brother Chris told KMSP. “Everyone is trying to understand and come to terms with what happened.” Their mother Sue and brother Mike, who both live in Colorado, are currently in Seychelles, pressing local and US officials for answers, The Star-Tribune reported. They are also making arrangements to bring the women back home, Chris told the newspaper. He also noted that at this time, his family has limited information on what led to his sisters’ deaths. Facebook 7 Annie (above) and her sister were both described as adventurous women “At this point, the only details we know are the articles flying around online,” he said. “My mum has been talking with people from the U.S. Embassy. I don’t think they’ve provided her with any information.” The sisters’ bodies are in a mortuary as authorities await autopsy results to determine the cause of death. Local police have been working with the American embassy in Mauritius during their investigation, according to The Seychelles Nation. Facebook 7 The sisters were frequent travellers and had been touring Africa since September 1 The Seychelles is located more than 900 miles off Africa’s east coast and is a tourist destination with its beaches, natural reserves, warm weather and coral reefs. The Maia Luxury Resort and Spa is a twelve-acre property on the secluded Anse Louis located on the island of Mahe. The five-star hotel’s 30 suites, ten ocean-front villas and 20 panoramic villas, each offers guests private pools, a 24-hour personal butler and views of the Indian Ocean, according to its website. The Maia hotel released a statement confirming the sisters were found by a hotel employee who tried to wake them.

At 10:21 a.m. in Johannesburg, the rand dropped 0.4 percent to 13.9520 per dollar, trimming its quarterly and monthly gain to 5.2 percent. The government’s 10-year rand-denominated bond weakened for a third day, with yields climbing six basis points to 8.73 percent, the highest on a closing basis since Sept. 9. Emerging-market assets declined amid anxiety over the wider implications of Deutsche Bank AG’s capital troubles. “Some rand weakness is justified given the Deutsche Bank-inspired global risk-off environment,” John Cairns, strategist at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in a note. “Emerging markets might have been impacted by the reweighting in the JPMorgan Global Bond Index. As we understand it, South Africa’s weight will drop 0.45 basis point to 9.7 percent today, implying around $1 billion in outflows.” About 10 hedge funds that do business with Deutsche Bank have reduced their financial exposure to Germany’s largest lender, Bloomberg News reported. The dollar was boosted Thursday by economic data that strengthened the case for the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, trimming appetite for riskier assets.

The rand is also outperforming global currencies against the euro and the pound. Foreigners were were net sellers of 1.1 billion rand ($79 million) of South African bonds on Thursday and sold a net 6.8 billion rand of shares, offloading local stocks for an eighth day, data from the Johannesburg stock exchange shows.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    It’s been low-hanging fruit for decades: buy stocks when the leaves start to turn in the Northeast, and get ready to harvest gains. This year the crop looks spoiled. That’s going by forecasts from Wall Street strategists, whose trepidation about everything from election politics to interest rates and valuations has left them in an unusually bearish mood before this year’s holidays. Among 19 surveyed by Bloomberg, the average estimate calls for the S&P 500 Index to end 2016 at 2,171, about 0.6 percent above where the gauge traded by 10 a.m. in New York. Since 1970, the S&P 500’s best quarter has been the fourth, on average, with the trend particularly prominent during the bull market that began in 2009. The benchmark gauge has climbed an average 6.7 percent from Sept. 30 through the end of the year during the 7 1/2-year run, more than twice the increase of the next-best quarter. “You’ve got to have a reason to put money to work, and portfolio managers are sitting on what they have without taking direction,” said Tony Dwyer, co-head of U.S. equity research at Canaccord Genuity Inc. in New York. He has a target of 2,175 for the S&P 500. “You need to get changing fundamentals, some kind of oversold condition or further economic data to get anybody jumping out.” Seldom have strategists been less bullish than they are now. They’ve called for gains in the equity market 82 percent of the time during the past decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yet even amid an 18 percent recovery in the S&P 500 since its low on Feb. 11, strategists have held their target price largely unchanged. That doesn’t mean they’re bereft of optimism. A slew of upbeat revisions in recent weeks pushed their average estimate up from a low of 2,146 in August, and among the four that have made projections for next year, the average target calls for a 7.9 percent rally. Analysts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Bank of Montreal and HSBC Securities USA Inc. raised 2016 expectations in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s decision last week to keep rates lower for longer, but it hasn’t been enough to paint a rosier picture for the market’s last leg of the year. The more bullish outlooks by JPMorgan and HSBC for 2,100 and 2,000, respectively, still fall below the current level of the S&P 500. “We’re fundamentally in a very range-bound market and a little over our skis here, and that makes us vulnerable,” Ben Laidler, global equity strategist at HSBC, said in a phone interview. “Earnings remain very lackluster. All this money you’ve made this year is from multiple expansion, with the market getting more and more expensive.” Both Laidler and JPMorgan’s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of U.S. equity strategy and global quant research, cite elevated stock valuations as a reason for limiting gains through the end of the year. The gap between current and future earnings is the widest since the start of the bull market, with the S&P 500 trading at 20.3 times annual earnings, near the highest since the financial crisis. Corporate profits are expected to contract 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. “While we do not expect significant re-rating in market multiple from here given the aged business cycle and potentially rising rates, the case for considerable de-rating is also not likely given that rates are likely to remain low on an absolute basis,” Lakos-Bujas wrote in a Sept. 23 note to clients. And of course there is the U.S. presidential election. Volatility will likely increase in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 8 vote, according to Lakos-Bujas. Indeed, equity volatility in the November of presidential election years has historically been 22 percent above the average for all months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “The political calendar remains heavy around the world,” said Laidler. “That may be a potential catalyst, but my personal favorite is the business cycle. When I look at the leading indicators there’s nothing out there to tell me the business cycle is getting any better.”   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

Morgan Chase (JPMCC) Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2016-JP3 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates: --$45,932,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$97,274,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$16,726,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$300,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$342,359,000 class A-5 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$49,955,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$970,952,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$56,309,000a class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$118,706,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$56,309,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$50,222,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$105,009,000ab class X-C 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$54,787,000b class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$22,828,000b class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable; --$15,219,000b class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable. a) Notional amount and interest only. b) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A. Fitch does not rate the $47,177,696a class NR. The ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as of Sept. 7, 2016. The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the trust, primary assets of which are 52 loans secured by 62 commercial properties having an aggregate principal balance of $1,217,494,697 as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JP Morgan Chase Bank, National Association, Benefit Street Partners CRE Finance LLC, and Starwood Mortgage Funding VI LLC. Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, including site inspections on 89.4% of the properties by balance, asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool, and cash flow analysis of 81.4% of the pool. KEY RATING DRIVERS Lower Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are lower than those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. The pool's Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.25x and 101.2%, respectively, are better than the YTD 2016 average Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.18x and 106.5%, respectively. Excluding credit-opinion loans, the pool's Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV are 1.20x and 108.1%, respectively. Comparatively, the YTD 2016 average DSCR and LTV of Fitch-rated deals excluding credit-opinion and co-op loans is 1.14x and 110.2%. Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: The largest loan in the pool and the sixth largest loan in the pool, 9 West 57th Street (8.2% of the pool) and Westfield San Francisco Centre (4.9% of the pool), have investment-grade credit opinions. The 9 West 57th Street senior note contributed to the trust has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'AAAsf*' on a stand-alone basis. Westfield San Francisco Centre has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'Asf*' on a stand-alone basis. The two loans have a weighted average Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.60x and 55.5%, respectively. More Diverse Pool by Loan Concentration: The top 10 loans comprise 49.8% of the pool, as compared to the YTD 2016 average of 55.3%. The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) is 356, which is below the YTD 2016 average of 428. However, the resulting sponsor concentration index (SCI) delta compared to the LCI is 30.3%, which is above the YTD 2016 average delta of 16.8%. RATING SENSITIVITIES For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 7.9% below the most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMCC 2016-JP3 certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could occur. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could occur. The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities on page 13. USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 Fitch was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (Form 15E) as prepared by Ernst & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence described in Form 15E focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and it did not have an impact on Fitch's analysis or conclusions. Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report.

This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security.

Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

Homegrown banks grab more market share Market share among banks in Chicago is shifting in favor of homegrown lenders as acquisitions fuel their growth. Wintrust Financial's deposits grew 17 percent to $18.9 billion in the year ending June 30, further cementing the Rosemont-based bank's status as fifth-largest deposit holder in Chicago's fragmented banking market, according to data released today by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Market share rose to 4.9 percent from 4.2 percent in 2015 for Wintrust, which has been actively gobbling up small community banks in the market. Meanwhile, Chicago-based MB Financial would have leaped to No. 6 from No. 10 in 2015 if its acquisition of one of the largest privately held local banks, Schaumburg-based American Chartered Bank, were included. That deal closed in late August, too late to be included in the FDIC's annual deposit-share snapshot. But the two banks combined had $13.8 billion in deposits, good for a 3.5 percent share of the market. That's the first time since Bank One (now part of New York-based JPMorgan Chase) and LaSalle Bank (now part of Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America) dominated the local banking scene more than a decade ago that two Chicago-based commercial banks have been so high in the rankings. It demonstrates how locally based lenders have taken advantage of disruption from big-bank dealmaking and the ravages of the financial crisis to grab a bigger share of the market. The top ranks remain unchanged from a year ago. JPMorgan Chase remains the biggest local deposit holder, with $84.5 billion, or 21.7 percent, down slightly from a year before. BMO Harris Bank, the U.S. arm of Toronto-based BMO Financial Group, remains No. 2, with $52.5 billion, or 13.5 percent, up from $47.8 billion, or 12.4 percent, the year before. Bank of America stays No. 3, with $41.4 billion, or 10.6 percent—about the same as last year. The biggest decline among top 10 banks was posted by Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bank, which dropped from the sixth-largest retail bank in Chicago to eighth (or ninth, if MB Financial's American Chartered deal is taken into account). Fifth Third's Chicago-market deposits fell 13 percent to $12.9 billion from $14.9 billion in 2015. Its market share fell to 3.2 percent from 3.9 percent. Sometimes such big year-over-year fluctuations are due to shifting large corporate deposits among different markets for larger banks that have big presences elsewhere. But those changes usually can be seen in main-branch deposits, which often house those corporate deposits. And Fifth Third's deposits dropped even more dramatically—18 percent—after excluding main-branch totals at 222 S. Riverside Plaza, its headquarters here. A Fifth Third spokesman declined to comment today, saying the bank needed time to review the data. Rounding out the rest of the top 10 were Chicago-based Northern Trust at No. 4, Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank at No. 7, Chicago-based PrivateBank & Trust at No. 8 and Citibank at No. 10. Banks continued to prune their branch networks as more customers conduct routine transactions online. The total number of branches in the Chicago metropolitan statistical area fell 4 percent to 2,857 as of June 30, 2015. Meanwhile, total deposits in the market rose just 1 percent to $389 billion from $384 billion, a smaller increase than in recent years, signaling that consumers and businesses aren't hoarding cash as much and are investing more aggressively than in previous years.

 Deutsche Bank has a 'fundamental business problem' beyond its immediate crisis Bob Bryan Sep. 30, 2016, 10:05 AM 4,868 facebook linkedin twitter email print Eric Thayer/Reuters Deutsche Bank has had a wild two weeks. The German bank reportedly may be on the hook for $14 billion in fines for a settlement with US regulators over bad investment products from the financial crisis era. The steep fine has led to speculation over a government bailout and a possible decrease in exposure by hedge funds, signaling no confidence in the bank. Add all of this up, and Deutsche Bank now has its lowest share price ever and a US market cap smaller than Twitter. According to the Kian Abouhossein, a European bank analyst at JPMorgan, the problems at Deutsche Bank go much deeper than its current conundrum and don't appear to be going away anytime soon. Essentially, said Abouhossein, the bank has been unable to become leaner on the cost side — as many other banks have — at a time when many investment banks are bringing in lower revenues. Here's his assessment (emphasis added):  "Judging from its track record DB seems to have an inability to cut net costs and generate operating leverage independent of management in charge. Even under new CEO John Cryan, who we rate highly, DB has been unable to illustrate cost savings on a net basis so far. The inability to adjust the business model to a declining revenue environment is a major problem for an IB-geared bank and has led to the inability to generate retained earnings and hence capital generation in our view." Going deeper, Abouhossein noted that the tangible book value per share, essentially a measure of the real assets that the bank holds, has dropped 8% between 2012 and 2015 and the bank's average return on equity has been under 4% over the last six years. The firm's own goals for cost savings to counterbalance this declining profitability are also lackluster, according to the JPMorgan analyst. "DBK has reiterated its cost target of €26.5 billion for 2016 which is flat year over year despite clean revenues declining -13% year over year in our estimates," said the note to clients on Friday. "We see this as unambitious as DBK has €0.4 billion year over year decline in comp expense from deferred compensation amortization alone." Put another way, Deutsche has no real plans to decrease costs to offset lower profits even though there are clear ways to do so, which Abouhossein referred to as a "fundamental business problem" for the bank. "We think a bank with €26.5 billion of costs and 101,000 employees plus an estimated 30,000 consultants should be able to show more cost flexibility to generate book value growth," said Abouhossein. As for the current situation, Abouhossein said that he doesn't actually expect Deutsche to settle for the full $14 billion, but more likely will negotiate penalties in the $3 billion to $4 billion range, more in line with other settlements for allegations of similar nature. However, noted Abouhossein, the bank has $9.4 billion in money set aside for litigation and around $5.4 billion is needed for other settlements, so anything above $4 billion would require a capital raise from the bank, which would be dilutive to shares and send the stock lower. So there is some danger now, though not as great as recent price moves and commentary might imply. But without serious underlying changes to the bank, the same problems Deutsche currently faces will continue to bubble up.

This year the crop looks spoiled. That's going by forecasts from Wall Street strategists, whose trepidation about everything from election politics to interest rates and valuations has left them in an unusually bearish mood before this year's holidays. Among 19 surveyed by Bloomberg, the average estimate calls for the S&P 500 Index to end 2016 at 2,171, about 1 percent below where the gauge closed on Thursday. Since 1970, the S&P 500's best quarter has been the fourth, on average, with the trend particularly prominent during the bull market that began in 2009. The benchmark gauge has climbed an average 6.7 percent from Sept. 30 through the end of the year during the 7 [1/2]-year run, more than twice the increase of the next-best quarter. "You've got to have a reason to put money to work, and portfolio managers are sitting on what they have without taking direction," said Tony Dwyer, co-head of U.S. equity research at Canaccord Genuity Inc. in New York. He has a target of 2,175 for the S&P 500. "You need to get changing fundamentals, some kind of oversold condition or further economic data to get anybody jumping out." Seldom have strategists been less bullish than they are now. They've called for gains in the equity market 82 percent of the time during the past decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yet even amid an 18 percent recovery in the S&P 500 since its low on Feb. 11, strategists have held their target price largely unchanged. That doesn't mean they're bereft of optimism. A slew of upbeat revisions in recent weeks pushed their average estimate up from a low of 2,146 in August, and among the four that have made projections for next year, the average target calls for an 8.2 percent rally. Analysts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Bank of Montreal and HSBC Securities USA Inc. raised 2016 expectations in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision last week to keep rates lower for longer, but it hasn't been enough to paint a rosier picture for the market's last leg of the year. The more bullish outlooks by JPMorgan and HSBC for 2,100 and 2,000, respectively, still fall below the current level of the S&P 500. "We're fundamentally in a very range-bound market and a little over our skis here, and that makes us vulnerable," Ben Laidler, global equity strategist at HSBC, said in a phone interview. "Earnings remain very lackluster. All this money you've made this year is from multiple expansion, with the market getting more and more expensive." Both Laidler and JPMorgan's Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of U.S. equity strategy and global quant research, cite elevated stock valuations as a reason for limiting gains through the end of the year. The gap between current and future earnings is the widest since the start of the bull market, with the S&P 500 trading at 20.3 times annual earnings, near the highest since the financial crisis. Corporate profits are expected to contract 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. "While we do not expect significant re-rating in market multiple from here given the aged business cycle and potentially rising rates, the case for considerable de-rating is also not likely given that rates are likely to remain low on an absolute basis," Lakos-Bujas wrote in a Sept. 23 note to clients. And of course there is the U.S. presidential election. Volatility will likely increase in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 8 vote, according to Lakos-Bujas. Indeed, equity volatility in the November of presidential election years has historically been 22 percent above the average for all months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. "The political calendar remains heavy around the world," said Laidler. "That may be a potential catalyst, but my personal favorite is the business cycle. When I look at the leading indicators there's nothing out there to tell me the business cycle is getting any better."     Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed.

At 10.21am in Johannesburg, the rand dropped 0.4 percent to 13.9520 per dollar, trimming its quarterly and monthly gain to 5.2 percent. The government’s 10-year rand-denominated bond weakened for a third day, with yields climbing six basis points to 8.73 percent, the highest on a closing basis since September 9. Emerging-market assets declined amid anxiety over the wider implications of Deutsche Bank AG’s capital troubles. “Some rand weakness is justified given the Deutsche Bank-inspired global risk-off environment,” John Cairns, strategist at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in a note. “Emerging markets might have been impacted by the re-weighting in the JPMorgan Global Bond Index. As we understand it, South Africa’s weight will drop 0.45 basis point to 9.7 percent today, implying around $1 billion in outflows.” About 10 hedge funds that do business with Deutsche Bank have reduced their financial exposure to Germany’s largest lender, Bloomberg News reported. The dollar was boosted on Thursday by economic data that strengthened the case for the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, trimming appetite for riskier assets. The rand is still set to be the biggest gainer in September among more than 140 world currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The rand is also outperforming global currencies against the euro and the pound. Foreigners were were net sellers of R1.1 billion ($79 million) of South African bonds on Thursday and sold a net R6.8 billion of shares, offloading local stocks for an eighth day, data from the Johannesburg stock exchange shows.

This year the crop looks spoiled. That’s going by forecasts from Wall Street strategists, whose trepidation about everything from election politics to interest rates and valuations has left them in an unusually bearish mood before this year’s holidays. Among 19 surveyed by Bloomberg, the average estimate calls for the S&P 500 Index to end 2016 at 2,171, about 0.6 percent above where the gauge traded by 10 a.m. in New York. Since 1970, the S&P 500’s best quarter has been the fourth, on average, with the trend particularly prominent during the bull market that began in 2009. The benchmark gauge has climbed an average 6.7 percent from Sept. 30 through the end of the year during the 7 1/2-year run, more than twice the increase of the next-best quarter. “You’ve got to have a reason to put money to work, and portfolio managers are sitting on what they have without taking direction,” said Tony Dwyer, co-head of U.S. equity research at Canaccord Genuity Inc. in New York. He has a target of 2,175 for the S&P 500. “You need to get changing fundamentals, some kind of oversold condition or further economic data to get anybody jumping out.” Seldom have strategists been less bullish than they are now. They’ve called for gains in the equity market 82 percent of the time during the past decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yet even amid an 18 percent recovery in the S&P 500 since its low on Feb. 11, strategists have held their target price largely unchanged. That doesn’t mean they’re bereft of optimism. A slew of upbeat revisions in recent weeks pushed their average estimate up from a low of 2,146 in August, and among the four that have made projections for next year, the average target calls for a 7.9 percent rally. Analysts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Bank of Montreal and HSBC Securities USA Inc. raised 2016 expectations in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s decision last week to keep rates lower for longer, but it hasn’t been enough to paint a rosier picture for the market’s last leg of the year. The more bullish outlooks by JPMorgan and HSBC for 2,100 and 2,000, respectively, still fall below the current level of the S&P 500. “We’re fundamentally in a very range-bound market and a little over our skis here, and that makes us vulnerable,” Ben Laidler, global equity strategist at HSBC, said in a phone interview. “Earnings remain very lackluster. All this money you’ve made this year is from multiple expansion, with the market getting more and more expensive.” Both Laidler and JPMorgan’s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of U.S. equity strategy and global quant research, cite elevated stock valuations as a reason for limiting gains through the end of the year. The gap between current and future earnings is the widest since the start of the bull market, with the S&P 500 trading at 20.3 times annual earnings, near the highest since the financial crisis. Corporate profits are expected to contract 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. “While we do not expect significant re-rating in market multiple from here given the aged business cycle and potentially rising rates, the case for considerable de-rating is also not likely given that rates are likely to remain low on an absolute basis,” Lakos-Bujas wrote in a Sept. 23 note to clients. And of course there is the U.S. presidential election. Volatility will likely increase in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 8 vote, according to Lakos-Bujas. Indeed, equity volatility in the November of presidential election years has historically been 22 percent above the average for all months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “The political calendar remains heavy around the world,” said Laidler. “That may be a potential catalyst, but my personal favorite is the business cycle. When I look at the leading indicators there’s nothing out there to tell me the business cycle is getting any better.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

NEW YORK — Stocks climbed Friday as banks made a rapid recovery following a steep fall a day ago. Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany's largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon following reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management, said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are causes for concern, including the health of Italy's banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. That didn't stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.59 and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world's oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to $102.92 and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.7 percent, to $96.71. Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.52, or 1.7 percent, to $89.75 and Wal-Mart rose $1.39, or 2 percent, to $72.12. Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the information technology consulting and outsourcing firm said it's investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it's looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. The stock fell $7.37, or 13.4 percent, to $47.63. Major stock indexes set records this quarter thanks mostly to tech stocks. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months. Apple, the most valuable company in the S&P 500, surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Microsoft, the next-largest company, rose 13 percent and another tech giant, Google parent Alphabet, leaped 14 percent. Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. More Business Cozy retirement?

More than 60 million millennials — about 80% of the generation — will become parents in the next decade, according to a study by marketing platform Crowdtap. Millennials currently spend $170 billion a year and are projected to spend $200 billion annually starting in 2017 and $10 trillion in their lifetimes, according to a study by Exponential.

Cohen says that traditional retailers will have to evolve to newly casual consumers.  "This is no longer a trend — it is now a lifestyle that is too comfortable, for consumers of all ages, for it to go away anytime soon," he said.  It's likely millennials will pass their fashion preferences on to their children too.  Hayley Peterson contributed to this story.  NOW WATCH: What this symbol that’s on nearly half of your food actually means More From Business Insider What it’s like to eat at the McDonald’s of the Philippines that people wait in 8-hour long lines to try Starbucks is testing an entirely new way to bring you your iced latte A Trump presidency holds a terrifying risk for restaurants and retailers Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to read next Ex-Goldman director Gupta seeks reversal in insider trading case | Reuters Firstpost Contenders for key jobs in Trump administration The Hindu Friday Flashback: "Wouldn't marry Anil Kapoor, he is hypersensitive": Madhuri's 1989 Interview is entertaining!

CNBC One man in Georgia might have been inflating chicken prices nationwide A weekly bulletin released by the Georgia Department of Agriculture might've swayed billions of dollars in chicken purchases. Newsy Volkswagen shedding 30,000 jobs FRANKFURT, Germany — Automaker Volkswagen said Friday it will shed 30,000 jobs to cut costs as it tries to recover from its diesel emissions scandal and invests more in electric-powered vehicles and digital services. Company officials said that 23,000 of the job cuts will come in Germany. It said the measures will save some 3.7 billion euros ($4 billion) a year from 2020. Around 11 million cars worldwide have the deceptive software. CEO Matthias Mueller said it was "the biggest reform package in the history of our core brand."

Quotes in the article JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 77.69 -0.33 -0.42% The better comparison for a worst-case scenario is probably Bear Stearns. The two stories, both at the crux of the 2008 financial crisis, are important to understanding why the market tends to freak out every time a big bank hits rough waters. Bear Stearns was the story of a bank that had suffered a crisis in confidence, leading it to be shunned by hedge funds, and which saw JPMorgan Chase (JPM) swallow up the investment bank in a deal that's still controversial. Lehman, conversely, was a firm that not only had seen confidence evaporate but also had core solvency problems that made a rescue, at the time at least, impossible. Deutsche is not insolvent or even close. Though it is heavily in debt compared with its equity position, for the bank to go under it would take a cataclysmic series of events, not the least of which being a decision by European banking authorities to simply wash their hands and let the continent's biggest bank fail. That doesn't mean, though, that Deutsche is out of the woods completely or that its troubles still can't have market-shaking impacts. Friday's relief rally put the market at ease for the moment, but there remain mountainous challenges ahead.© Provided by CNBC At the core of this week's investor angst is a word that came up during Bear's demise — "novation," or a request by hedge funds that deal with the bank to have others take their place in derivatives trades. In the case of Bear Stearns, word in March 2008 that Goldman Sachs had refused a novation request spread panic through Wall Street. A few days later, the erstwhile Wall Street institution was no more. Though Bear was loaded with toxic assets, it was essentially a rapid crisis of confidence that had done in the firm. That's why Thursday's news that a couple hedge funds doing business with Deutsche were trimming their sales caused such a ruckus in the market. A Bloomberg report indicated that threehedge funds that do business with Deutsche were trimming their positions, causing afternoon market hyperventilation that the funds were losing confidence in the bank. Buzz quickly flew around a nervous Street that more troubles could be ahead. "Once investors question their confidence in a financial institution, they've already lost their confidence in it," one Wall Streeter emailed me. "This gets worse before it gets better." There also was another element to the blood-in-the-water nature of the Deutsche story. A former Deutsche Bank trader, in a conversation earlier this week, used the word "arrogance" to describe why the bank had found itself in trouble. (This person also cited negative interest rates and a looming U.S. Justice Department settlement.) There also was a joke circling around social media: "What's the Greek word for 'schadenfreude'?" The latter reference is an allusion to the heavy-handed approach Germany took toward bailing out Greece during the latter's sovereign debt crisis, contrasted against a German bank's possible need now for a bailout that would be engineered by European Union authorities. (Schadenfreude, of course, is the German term for the delight some take in watching others fail.) When Bear Stearns began its rapid and precipitous decline, speculation swirled that one of the reasons there were so few banks willing to lend a hand was because Bear itself had opted not to participate in the 1998 Long Term Capital Management bailout. Schadenfreude? Perhaps. But comparing one crisis to another is often futile, particularly in the financial industry. While they all involve debt to some extent, each has its own causes and solutions. In the case of Deutsche, what stands out most is the abundance of escape valves and backstops a troubled bank has these days. A repeat of either the Bear or Lehman situations is unlikely. That doesn't mean, though, that there still won't be difficult times ahead.

It's more like Bear Stearns CNBC @CNBC2 months ago CNBC @CNBC2 months ago                                                                               The two stories, at the crux of the financial crisis, are important to understanding why the market freaks out every time a bank hits rough waters. Market watchers are probably correct in assuming that the problems with Deutsche Bank are not leading to a Lehman Brothers moment . The better comparison for a worst-case scenario is probably Bear Stearns. The two stories, both at the crux of the 2008 financial crisis, are important to understanding why the market tends to freak out every time a big bank hits rough waters . Bear Stearns was the story of a bank that had suffered a crisis in confidence, leading it to be shunned by hedge funds, and which saw JPMorgan Chase swallow up the investment bank in a deal that's still controversial. Lehman, conversely, was a firm that not only had seen confidence evaporate but also had core solvency problems that made a rescue, at the time at least, impossible. Deutsche is not insolvent or even close. Though it is heavily in debt compared with its equity position, for the bank to go under it would take a cataclysmic series of events, not the least of which being a decision by European banking authorities to simply wash their hands and let the Continent's biggest bank fail. That doesn't mean, though, that Deutsche is out of the woods completely or that its troubles still can't have market-shaking impacts . Friday's relief rally put the market at ease for the moment , but there remain mountainous challenges ahead. At the core of this week's investor angst is a word that came up during Bear's demise — "novation," or a request by hedge funds that deal with the bank to have others take their place in derivatives trades. In the case of Bear Stearns, word in March 2008 that Goldman Sachs had refused a novation request spread panic through Wall Street. A few days later, the erstwhile Wall Street institution was no more. Though Bear was loaded with toxic assets, it was essentially a rapid crisis of confidence that had done in the firm. That's why Thursday's news that a couple of hedge funds doing business with Deutsche were trimming their sales caused such a ruckus in the market. A Bloomberg report indicated that threehedge funds that do business with Deutsche were reducing their positions, causing afternoon market hyperventilation that the funds were losing confidence in the bank. Buzz quickly flew around a nervous Street that more troubles could be ahead. "Once investors question their confidence in a financial institution, they've already lost their confidence in it," one Wall Streeter emailed me. "This gets worse before it gets better." There also was another element to the blood-in-the-water nature of the Deutsche story. A former Deutsche Bank trader, in a conversation earlier this week, used the word "arrogance" to describe why the bank had found itself in trouble. (This person also cited negative interest rates and a looming U.S. Justice Department settlement.) There also was a joke circling around social media: "What's the Greek word for 'schadenfreude'?"

(7-14-16) TidewaterBiz Magazine cover profile. Anne Conner is the first board chairwoman of the Mariners' Museum and is an executive with TowneBank. She lives in Seaford. Photos of her in front of the Mariners' Museum in Newport News. (7-14-16) (Joe Fudge / Daily Press) Tara BozickContact Reportertbozick@dailypress.com Privacy Policy When Anne Conner commits to a project or organization, she's all in. "It's just in me," the Seaford native and resident said. "I am blessed with a lot of energy. It's probably why I keep my plate so full all the time. I don't like to sit still. I am never bored." That all-in attitude was why past Mariners' Museum board leaders John Lawson and Alan Diamonstein asked the TowneBank executive to join the Mariners' Museum board back in 2008. Conner intended to decline because of other nonprofit commitments, but she found she had a hard time turning the two men down when they sent a letter thanking her for accepting the role. In January, she became The Mariners' Museum's first board chairwoman in its more than 80-year history. As someone who is passionate about empowering women, Conner thought that a woman finally getting into that position of leadership was pretty awesome for the community. "People want to follow her, and that makes her very effective," Lawson said, who has worked in various capacities with Conner through board service. Conner brings an open mind, a great contact list and experience in finance, Lawson said, adding one of the most important committees in any organization is the finance committee. Plus, the current Mariners' Museum board member said Conner dives deep into an organization to get good feedback from the bottom. Hampton Roads jobless number remains flat from July to August Tara Bozick Williamsburg was the only greater Peninsula locality to see an improvement in its unemployment rate from July to August, according to the latest Virginia Employment Commission numbers. The Hampton Roads unemployment rate ticked up from 4.6 percent in July to 4.7 percent in August, according to... Williamsburg was the only greater Peninsula locality to see an improvement in its unemployment rate from July to August, according to the latest Virginia Employment Commission numbers. The Hampton Roads unemployment rate ticked up from 4.6 percent in July to 4.7 percent in August, according to... (Tara Bozick) At the museum, she led a strategic planning process for a year and headed the search for a new museum president after Elliott Gruber stepped down at the end of April. Howard H. Hoege III was named the president and CEO in September, Conner said, after serving as a consultant for the strategic planning and then as the interim CEO. "Her enthusiasm and energy are infectious, and you can really see that reflected in the culture of our museum," Hoege said. "Anne has this excellent blend of a strong vision of excellence for the museum, high expectations that we execute well against that vision and a deep commitment to and real affection for the staff and volunteers — the people — that make our team go." Before Conner joined the board in late 2008, she hadn't been intimately familiar with the museum, but as a daughter and granddaughter of a waterman, she said her life has been tied to the Chesapeake Bay. She joined the board right when the Great Recession was taking hold, just as the stock market hit its low point in March 2009, taking the museum's endowment with it. But the banker who'd spent a career serving nonprofit clients with Bank of America wasn't deterred and became one of the museum's biggest advocates. And fortunately, the economy and endowment recovered. Struggles Like every museum, The Mariners' Museum is facing new challenges to remain relevant and re-energize itself in the modern era. Conner envisions the museum capitalizing on its comprehensive and unrivaled maritime collections by making it easier for researchers, scholars and students to access the images, documents and objects. "We must ensure the next 80 years in the museum's life," Conner said. Raising awareness about the international scope of the museum and finding advocates in folks with a passion for maritime history could help increase donations, including gifts or artifacts to the museum, she added. The museum is strategizing on how best to renovate to put more of its 32,000-object collection on display since only a small percentage is currently out. The Monitor Center holds more than 200 tons of artifacts from the Civil War ironclad, and Conner would like to see what other roles the center might have in conservation and preservation. Conner also wants to get the word out to folks on how they can access digitized images, documents and maps from the museum's library collection online. The collection totals more than 1.75 million items, including rare books and manuscripts. "The collection at the museum is second to none in the Western Hemisphere," Conner said. "It's an amazing place." When J.P. Morgan Chase representatives came for a tour, Conner showed off the museum's videoconferencing studio classrooms that allow staff to teach from the museum and reach classrooms across the country. Collections staff explained how the museum loans out objects, including rare paintings, to other museums all over the world. "I just want people to understand what an extraordinary treasure we have in The Mariners' Museum, not only in Hampton Roads, but far beyond," Conner said. "Our collection is not Hampton Roads-based waterways. Our collection is international in scope." So what does Conner bring to the table in helping the museum accomplish all these goals? "I'm a great cheerleader. I think I'm a great motivator. I think people can feel good when they link arms with me and we accomplish something together," Conner said. 'Insightful executive' After two years at Virginia Commonwealth University, a 19-year-old Conner fell in love with the service aspect of banking when she took a job as a new accounts representative at Sovran Bank, a predecessor to Bank of America. In fact, she kept working and didn't return to college. But her bank's area manager, Mel Causey, saw potential in her and encouraged her to get her degree to further her career, she said about her "first real mentor." She continued working part-time while earning her bachelor's degree in finance from what is now Christopher Newport University. She kept advancing at Bank of America, eventually becoming a senior vice president, and found her niche with nonprofit clients, growing that portfolio more than tenfold from 1995 to 2004. Having been CNU's banker, Conner caught the eye of Paul Trible, who had a vision for a new CNU. The CNU president said he asked then-Gov. Mark Warner to appoint Conner to a four-year term on the CNU Board of Visitors, which he did in 2003. Trible convinced Conner to lead CNU's real estate foundation, heading up a strategic planning process and executing a restructuring of its debt portfolio to enhance its ability to redevelop the area around the campus. She also served on the educational foundation board. Conner, along with her beloved mentor the late Walter Segaloff — the visionary behind An Achievable Dream schools, helped the foundation assemble 42 properties along the Warwick Boulevard campus over a number of years. Conner was instrumental in packaging the initial financing for the acquisition and construction of those properties that give us the CNU we see today, Trible said. "She is an insightful executive who can see beyond the numbers to arrive at creative solutions in a very complex situation," Trible said. And while she's determined and disciplined, she's also just a lot of fun, Trible said, adding, "She's full of life and energy and spirit. She loves life and makes the most of every day." Soon enough, a growing TowneBank decided it needed Conner to expand into Williamsburg. In 2005, she became the first female regional president for TowneBank. TowneBank's Williamsburg headquarters opened in 2006, and under Conner's leadership, moved from No. 7 to No. 2 in deposit market share. "She attacks projects with such vigor and enthusiasm," said J. Morgan Davis, TowneBank's president and chief banking officer and Conner's boss. In 2013, TowneBank wanted to make use of Conner's experience with nonprofit lending and tapped her to lead a new public finance and community investment division, covering TowneBank's footprint from Richmond to the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Conner deals with a complicated lending program that includes tax-exempt bond financing and making equity investments in commercial real estate projects that produce federal tax credits. The redevelopment of Whittaker Memorial Hospital in downtown Newport News is an example of the type of project that could benefit from the program. It's in this type of community impact — providing financing for affordable homes, municipal buildings such as schools or the new Princess Anne YMCA — that Conner loves, she says, because it improves the quality of life in the community. Because of Conner's work, Davis said, that portfolio accounts for a quarter of a billion dollars in loans at the bank. "She's taken something and built it into an empire," Davis said. "Anne is formidable, she really is. She radiates positive energy." In her 11 1/2 years at TowneBank, Davis said Conner has not only made the bank stronger on the Peninsula, but has polished the company's brand. Her involvement on boards, her commitment to nonprofits and the generosity of her time and energy all represent TowneBank in a positive way, Davis said. "She's a dynamo," Davis said. As vice chairwoman of the WHRO board, Conner works late nights and will go on air to help raise money during the capital campaign, said WHRO President and CEO Bert Schmidt, who considers Conner a friend. "Anne is one of my favorite people," Schmidt said, calling her a "big advocate." Small businesses Conner still makes time to devote to the startup scene in Hampton Roads. She's chairwoman of the board of ivWatch in Hampton, and has helped raise more than $20 million in equity for the new medical device firm since 2010. She's a founding board member of 757 Angels, which was established in late 2014 as a mechanism to match investors with high-potential startups in Hampton Roads to help diversify the local economy. The group has invested nearly $10 million in local small businesses so far. Conner has brought a number of companies to the attention of the angel investors and is always willing to step up and help, said Paul Hirschbiel, 757 Angels board chairman. "Clearly, her business acumen is stellar," Hirschbiel said. "As we vet companies, she is just remarkably able to weed through all the material we get and really focus in on the important ingredients." For folks looking to get involved, she said what's led to her success is doing her best to do what she says she's going to do, demonstrating integrity and being as caring as she can be. "I believe in good karma, I absolutely do," Conner said. "And if you put that out as much as you can, then it's going to come back to you." Bozick can be reached by phone at 757-247-4741.

"A heart of gold," she said, adding she's been blessed to be mentored by genuinely authentic deeply caring people. Combine that loving nature with savvy and intellect and that is the very definition of leadership, she added. "It means you have the trust and respect of your peers and really the greater community," Conner said. How others think Anne Conner is a leader: Paul Hirschbiel, board chairman of 757 Angels: "Anne listens well. She's not one to strike out when a question may arise. She's going to listen to the arguments people bring forward, and No. 2, her ego doesn't get in the way of her decision-making, which I think is really important for a leader." Bert Schmidt, president and CEO of WHRO: "She's just really one of those good people in our community who puts the community first." Paul Trible, president of Christopher Newport University: "She really possesses a passion for making the world a better place. Christopher Newport University is all about leadership, honor and service and those are virtues that really define Anne Conner's life." Buddy David, longtime Mariners' Museum attorney and community leader: "No one has ever turned to Anne because she was a woman. Her involvement was sought because of her passion, reliability, knowledge, and most of all, because she delivers." John Lawson II, developer and Mariners' Museum trustee: "She's smart and she gets things done and her attitude is always so positive, it's infectious. It causes people to also be enthusiastic." J. Morgan Davis, TowneBank's president and chief banking officer and Conner's boss: "I think she's a good leader because she's humble. She's thinking about other people contributing not what she's contributing. It's called servant leadership. You don't have the power. The people around you give you the power to lead." G. Robert Aston Jr., TowneBank chairman and CEO: "I think that Anne has a real passion for serving the community and I think that sets a standard for what she does each day."

The shares closed at €11.57, up 6.4%, the biggest gain since April. Agence France-Presse reported that the lender is nearing a settlement with the DOJ in a probe tied to residential mortgage-backed securities, citing an unidentified person familiar. Spokesmen for the Frankfurt-based lender and the DOJ declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. Deutsche Bank’s stock and debt have been under pressure after the DOJ last month requested $14bn to settle an investigation into residential mortgage-backed securities. READ NEXT Firms lose Luas court appeal “The amount would be very good news, below what consensus expects now,” said Jerome Legras, an investor at Axiom Alternative Investments, who holds a short position on the lender. “Deutsche Bank has dropped so much as there is so much speculation circulating — at some point people just want to make a profit on short positions.” Analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co wrote in a note to clients earlier this month that a US settlement of $3bn to $3.5bn would leave the German lender room to settle other legal issues. Any additional $1bn in litigation charges would erode capital by 24 basis points. The bank’s common equity Tier 1 ratio stood at 10.8% at the end of June. In a memo to staff yesterday, chief executive John Cryan said he is taking DOJ settlements with other banks “as a benchmark”, echoing previous remarks that he expects US authorities to scale back their initial request. Ms Cryan rushed to shore up confidence in his beleaguered lender after concern some clients are reducing exposure to the company pushed the shares to record lows earlier yesterday. The bank’s balance sheet is safer than at any point in the past two decades, Mr Cryan told staff in a memo yesterday. “Trust is the foundation of banking. Some forces in the markets are currently trying to damage this trust,” he said. Analysts also came to the bank’s defence. Stuart Graham at Autonomous Research LLP wrote that Deutsche Bank has enough readily available funds on hand to weather more than two months of severe stress, including trading clients pulling back. Goldman Sachs Group analysts led by Jernej Omahen said the lender can also access backstops from the European Central Bank. “Deutsche has many problems, but liquidity is not one of them,” Mr Graham said in a note. “There can be no doubt that Deutsche could access significant additional liquidity from the ECB, should it ever need it.” Deutsche Bank has long struggled to adapt to an era of tougher capital requirements and diminished trading revenue. Mr Cryan has already said that the lender may fail to be profitable this year, calling it a peak restructuring year, as he eliminates thousands of jobs and cuts risky assets. The shares had been pushed to a fresh record low earlier yesterday after Bloomberg News reported that some hedge fund clients had reduced their financial exposure to the bank. Deutsche Bank has lost about 49% of its market value this year.

The Maximum Tender Offer was made pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase dated September 19, 2016 (the “Offer to Purchase”). As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 30, 2016 (the "Early Tender Date"), as reported by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the tender and information agent for the Maximum Tender Offer, the principal amounts of the Notes listed in the table below had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn.             Security (CUSIP No.) Initial Principal Amount Acceptance Priority Level Principal Amount Tendered 7.875% Notes due October 1, 2029 (023551AF1) $700,000,000 1 $196,004,000 7.300% Notes due August 15, 2031 (023551AJ3) $750,000,000 2 $185,455,000 7.125% Notes due March 15, 2033 (023551AM6) $600,000,000 3 $117,498,000   The applicable total consideration for the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offer will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 3, 2016. Holders of such Notes will be eligible to receive the total consideration for any such Notes, including the applicable early tender payment specified in the Offer to Purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, October 4, 2016, the expected settlement date of the Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date. The Maximum Tender Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on October 17, 2016, unless extended or earlier terminated.

U.S. stocks are falling Monday morning and following Asian and European indexes lower. (AP Photo/Richard US stocks are bouncing back Friday morning after a steep loss late the previous day. Strong earnings from Costco are giving consumer stocks a lift. Banks, too, are recovering from a sharp drop as Deutsche Bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Energy companies are also trading higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 117 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 18,260 as of 10:10 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 10 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,161. The Nasdaq composite rose 19 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 5,288. BANKS BOUNCE BACK: Banks made some of the largest gains. The stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon as investors again worried about the health of Deutsche Bank, the largest lender in Germany, following reports that some hedge funds are moving their business out of the bank. Late Thursday CEO John Cryan tried to calm investors. In a letter to Deutsche Bank employees, he said the bank has $241 billion in reserves and is meeting its capital requirements. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed stock rose 71 cents, or 6.2 per cent, to $12.20. Its stock has been pummeled this year and is trading at all-time lows. Among US banks, JPMorgan Chase added 68 cents, or 1 per cent, to $66.33 and Citigroup gained 61 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $46.41. OIL: Benchmark US crude rose 7 cents to $47.90 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international benchmark, remained at $49.81 a barrel in London. Oil prices have surged this week after the nations of Opec, which collectively produce more than third of the world's oil, agreed to a small cut in production in a surprise decision. While the gains for oil prices have slowed, investors were still optimistic that energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Hess jumped 87 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to $53.02 and Spectra Energy rose 67 cents, or 1.6 per cent, to $42.99. Continued below.

BIG SALE: Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.65, or 3.8 per cent, to $153.14 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.37, or 1.6 per cent, to $89.60 and Wal-Mart rose $1.29, or 1.8 per cent, to $72.02. CHIPPING IN: Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors continued to climb on reports the companies might combine. The Wall Street Journal said Qualcomm is in talks to buy its rival, and NXP gained $6.37, or 6.6 per cent, to $102.49 and Qualcomm picked up $1.95, or 2.9 per cent, to $69.40.That followed a bigger move a day ago. COGNIZANT CEO: Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the technology consulting company said President Gordon Coburn resigned. It named Rajeev Mahta, the former head of its IT Services business, as its new president. The stock fell $7.47, or 13.6 per cent, to $47.53. More Economy The Economy Hub Business Videos Business Toolbox More Liam Dann TECH TRIUMPHANT: Major stock indexes set records this quarter, and tech stocks were by far the biggest reason. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 per cent over the last three months, its best result since the end of 2013. Apple surged 18 per cent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Apple is the most valuable publicly-traded company in the world. The second-largest tech company, Microsoft, is up 12 per cent this quarter and Google parent Alphabet leaped 14 per cent. BONDS: Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 1.56 per cent. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 101.21 yen from 101.07 yen. The euro remained at $1.1216. OVERSEAS: Britain's FTSE 100 fell 1.1 per cent while France's CAC 40 sank 1.7 per cent and Germany's DAX lost 1.6 per cent. Japan's Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 per cent and South Korea's Kospi fell 1.2 per cent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index sank 1.9 per cent.

The Maximum Tender Offer was made pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase dated September 19, 2016 (the "Offer to Purchase").

Allhands: Will Arizona lead the maternity leave revolution? Joanna Allhands Joanna Allhands , The Republic | azcentral.com 2:17 p.m. MST September 30, 2016 75 Shares Twelve percent of workers nationwide have access to paid family leave time.  (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Glenda Frantz is the envy of mothers everywhere. The Tempe resident is about to have Baby No. 2, and when she does, she'll have 16 weeks of paid time off to recover and adjust. Bank of America, her employer, just extended its paid leave by four weeks to anyone who's been with the company for more than a year. That's on top of the 10 weeks unpaid time it offers, meaning workers could take half the year off and still come back to a job. The time is available for moms and dads, for birth as well as adoption. And it's flexible -- employees can take the 16 paid weeks all at once or in chunks during the first year of the child's life. That's a sweet benefit (seriously, I'm jealous). And it has big implications for Arizona. When companies compete for workers Bank of America employs 9,500 in the state, making it one of Arizona's largest employers. Wells Fargo, which announced a similar 16-week paid family leave policy last week, employs more than 14,000 in Arizona. Benito Almanza, Bank of America's Arizona president, acknowledges that flexible benefits are a key part of keeping employees for the long haul. "We know that supporting the physical, financial, and emotional wellness of our employees in their personal life also supports them in their work life, so they can be the best at work and at home," he said in an emailed statement. Competition also is undoubtedly a factor. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have offered 16 paid weeks for a while, and JPMorgan Chase announced its 16-week policy in January. We saw the same thing in the tech industry last year: Google, Microsoft and others rushed to offer more generous benefits once Netflix announced a full year of paid family leave. What about the other 88 percent? Glenda Frantz was given 16 weeks paid leave when she gave birth to her second child.  (Photo: handout) The extra paid time will make life a lot easier for Frantz. She plans to use her time all at once, so she can be off when her older son, Cooper, starts kindergarten in the fall. But she loves the flexibility, knowing that she could use the extra time later if the craziness of life with a newborn demanded it. "It's priceless to be able to bond with a new one," she said. "To me, it's as important to have these benefits as pay. They understand we all need work-life balance." So far, though, the rising benefit tide only seems to be lifting boats in skilled industries. Only 12 percent of workers nationwide are offered paid leave through their employers. And many workers in lower-paid jobs can't afford to take the 12 unpaid weeks offered to them under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act. FMLA doesn't even apply to part-time workers or businesses with fewer than 50 workers. That's why some cities and states are stepping in to mandate family leave. San Francisco just approved six weeks of fully paid time off for new parents (California law already allows parents to recoup 55 percent of their pay for six weeks). New York now requires businesses to offer workers partial pay for up to three months off. At least 20 other states are considering legislation or studying the issue. Don't expect an Arizona mandate (yet) Arizona isn't one of them. Gov. Doug Ducey and lawmakers have threatened to take cities' state-shared revenue if they pass their own employment laws. They argue that mandating benefits is bad for business. But what happens if some of the state's biggest players willingly choose to offer these benefits? (Let's not forget that Banner Health, the state's largest employer, offers 12 weeks of paid family leave.) Will their leadership help convince other companies to do the same? Maybe not yet. But eventually, the demographics will. Millennials are a critical part of the workforce. They work long hours, but they value time off as much as pay. And many of them are starting families. They expect the time and financial breathing room to learn how to juggle everything in their lives. A recent survey found that 86 percent of Millennials (workers 18 to 33 years old) would be less likely to quit their job if paid family leave were offered. Google also cut attrition by 50 percent when it extended and paid for family leave. If employers want to keep the young workers they need in jobs, they're going to have to adapt.

(NASDAQ: NTNX) entered the market with a bang. The company priced its 14 million shares at $16, above the expected pricing range of $13 to $15 per share, with an overallotment option for an additional 2.1 million. At this price, entire offering is valued up to $257.6 million. Despite pricing there, the stock actually entered the market at $26.50, a premium of 65.6% above the expected price. The underwriters for the offering are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, RBC Capital Markets, Baird, Needham, Oppenheimer, Pacific Crest, Piper Jaffray, Raymond James, Stifel and William Blair. This company provides a leading next-generation enterprise cloud platform that converges traditional silos of server, virtualization and storage into one integrated solution and can also connect to public cloud services. Its software-driven platform delivers the agility, scalability and pay-as-you-grow economics of the public cloud, while addressing enterprise requirements of application mobility, security, data integrity and control. Nutanix has combined advanced web-scale technologies with elegant consumer-grade design to deliver a powerful enterprise cloud platform that elevates IT organizations to focus on the applications and services that power their businesses. Nutanix refers to its platform as “invisible infrastructure” because it provides constant availability and low-touch management, enables application mobility across computing environments and reduces inefficiencies in IT planning. A few of the highlights the company noted in the filing: Average billings growth of 20% on a quarterly basis for the last eight fiscal quarters, which grew from $60.8 million in the three months ended October 31, 2014 to $206.6 million in the three months ended July 31, 2016. Average revenue growth of 17% on a quarterly basis for the last eight fiscal quarters, which grew from $46.1 million in the three months ended October 31, 2014 to $139.8 million in the three months ended July 31, 2016.
