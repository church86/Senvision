Combined stockpiles in warehouses tracked by exchanges in Shanghai, London and New York have fallen 9.6 percent from a three-year high in mid-March, while money managers boosted their bullish bets on copper traded on the London Metal Exchange for a fourth straight week. Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up Inventories are declining as scrap-metal supply begins to slow after a deluge that offset output disruptions at mines. The outlook for demand is improving after China’s official factory gauge climbed to the highest in almost five years, signaling increasing economic momentum in the world’s largest user of the metal. Michael Widmer, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch has maintained his bullish copper price target, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts are advising clients to take long positions in the July LME copper contract. “Demand has been pretty good,” Peter Thomas, a Chicago-based senior vice president at metals broker Zaner Group LLC, said by telephone, recalling buy orders he’s seen from Chinese clients coming in this week. “They were on a shopping spree.” Widmer kept his copper target for mid-year at $6,600 a metric ton, higher than Monday’s price of about $5,770 for the contract for delivery in three months on the LME, citing anecdotal signs of demand for wires and cables picking up. The metal will claw back some of its losses to average $6,000 in the second quarter, JPMorgan analysts forecast in April 7 note. Prices have faltered since reaching a 20-month high of $6,204 on Feb. 13, amid concerns a flood of scrap will keep the market in surplus even after a prolonged strike at the Escondida mine and a contractual dispute at the Grasberg mine curbed global output. While JPMorgan analysts see copper ending near $5,000, they expect a short-term lift as seasonal rebound in demand helps erode stockpiles. Thomas, a 30-year veteran in metals trading, closed two-thirds of his clients short positions or bearish bets on copper after seeing an onslaught of orders to buy the metal from Chinese clients. He had earlier advised his clients -- including metal recyclers, miners and copper users -- to hedge against price declines. “While we think scrap will in all likelihood remain an overhang, there are early signs that the easing in availability has started to subside,” Widmer wrote in an April 3 report. Also boosting the outlook are plans to develop a new economic zone near Beijing and the prospect of double-digit growth in India, Codelco Chief Executive Officer Nelson Pizarro said in an interview on Wednesday. Slowing mine supply growth will also help the metal to trend higher longer-term, Bank of America analysts wrote in a separate report April 6. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump.However, bank stocks have retreated of late as investors question lofty valuations and Trump's ability to swiftly introduce simpler regulations and other policies following the failure of a healthcare reform bill. The S&P 500 financial sector was off 0.56 percent, dragged down by Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. "The financial sector has been a darling performer since the election and we've seen some of that performance retreat in the last couple of weeks," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis."So, what the banks report and what their guidance is will be the primary driver for equity prices over the next week or two." Earnings of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year. The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Geopolitical tensions added to investor unease. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons were a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that "a response is likely" if they pose a danger.At 12:12 p.m. ET (1612 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 33.22 points, or 0.16 percent, at 20,622.88, the S&P 500 was down 2.98 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,352.56. The Nasdaq Composite was down 7.95 points, or 0.14 percent, at 5,869.86. Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Four of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with energy leading with a 0.94 percent gain, supported by higher oil prices. [O/R]Technology was off 0.13 percent, led by declines in Intel and Nvidia. Shares of Amazon.com was the top stock on the S&P and the Nasdaq, rising 1.2 percent to $905.92. The world's largest online retailer was upgraded to "buy" at Needham, according to a trader. Straight Path Communications surged nearly two-fold to $89.71 after AT&T offered a huge premium to buy the owner of wireless spectrum licenses. Swift Transportation jumped 21.7 percent to $24.36 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation. Knight's shares were up 12 percent.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,665 to 1,141. On the Nasdaq, 1,433 issues fell and 1,281 advanced.The S&P 500 index showed seven 52-week highs and two lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 55 highs and 25 lows.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks ended a choppy session slightly higher on Monday as gains in energy shares offset losses in financials ahead of quarterly corporate earnings later this week. Geopolitical tensions added to the choppiness. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons were a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that "a response is likely" if they pose a danger. With trading slow at the beginning of a holiday-shortened week, volume was the lightest of the year so far. The S&P energy index , up 0.8 percent, was the day's best-performing S&P 500 sector, following gains in oil prices. Investors prepared for the start of quarterly profit reports, with earnings of S&P 500 companies estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Energy companies, hit by a selloff in oil prices last year, are expected to show the greatest strength with a 600 percent year-over-year earnings increase. "The key will be oil stocks given how volatile oil has been since the election," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which has about US$50 million in assets under management. The energy index is down 6 percent for the year to date. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.92 points, or 0.01 percent, to 20,658.02, the S&P 500 gained 1.62 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,357.16 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.11 points, or 0.05 percent, to 5,880.93. Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Just 5.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday. The daily average for the past 20 trading days is 6.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. JPMorgan , Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. Bank stocks have retreated recently as investors question lofty valuations and Trump's ability to swiftly introduce simpler regulations and other policies following the failure of a healthcare reform bill. The S&P 500 financial sector was off 0.3 percent. Traders attributed a stock dip around noon to unverified rumors stemming from weekend news related to North Korea. "You've had a lot of geopolitical news that could have driven this market a lot lower, and I think it's a huge relief that the market has held up so well," Dollarhide said. Whole Foods Market was the S&P 500's biggest percentage gainer on the day, rising 10 percent after activist investor Jana Partners LLC disclosed an 8.3 percent stake in the company as it looks to shake up the company's board. Swift Transportation jumped 23.7 percent to US$24.77 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation . Knight's shares were up 13.4 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 68 new highs and 38 new lows.

What’s interesting is that their contretemps is over an acronym that most Americans have never heard of, but one that may be central to preventing another recession. TLAC, which is pronounced TEE-lack, is something you need to know about if you want to judge the sparring between Dimon, the well-coiffed chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Kashkari, the very bald man who ran for governor of California on the Republican ticket and is now president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Neel Kashkari Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg On April 6, Kashkari went after Dimon in a way that circumspect central bankers ordinarily don’t. In an essay published on Medium and republished on the Minneapolis Fed website, he challenged Dimon’s assertion in his annual letter to shareholders that 1) there’s no longer a risk that taxpayers will be stuck with the bill if a big bank fails, and 2) banks have too much capital (meaning an unnecessarily thick safety cushion).  Wrote Kashkari: “Both of these assertions are demonstrably false.” This is where TLAC comes in, so bear down for a bit of bank accounting. TLAC stands for total loss-absorbing capacity. The more capacity that a bank has to absorb losses, the smaller the risk that it will require a taxpayer-funded government bailout. So lots of TLAC is good. But not all TLAC is created equal. Kashkari argues that a lot of what Dimon calls TLAC on paper wouldn’t be available to absorb losses in a real-world crisis. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Imagine that a whale swims up the Thames River and beaches itself in the City of London, causing billions of dollars in losses to Bank X. If the loss is really big or Bank X is weak (unlike JPMorganChase, which most emphatically is not weak), then one such hit could push it into insolvency. The first thing that happens is that the price of the stock falls to zero. Shareholders, in other words, are the first to absorb losses. That’s fair: Shareholders get all the profit that a bank makes after paying its expenses, so they should have to take the hit when the bank’s profit is wiped out unexpectedly. The fight between Dimon and Kashkari is over who absorbs the rest of the loss. According to Dimon, it’s the unsecured bondholders. (Unsecured meaning they don’t have a legal claim to any specific asset on the bank’s balance sheet.) Unsecured bondholders are informed that, sorry, there’s been a loss. They’re not going to get their interest payments anymore, and their bonds are being converted into common shares. Now they’re at the back of the line with the rest of the bank’s shareholders; they’ll get paid only if the bank starts making a profit again. The beauty of the system outlined by Dimon is that taxpayers aren’t exposed to risk because if a bank gets in trouble it has a great, big escape hatch: It simply wipes out its bondholders, thus conserving its money. “It sounds like an ideal solution,” Kashkari writes. “The problem is that it almost never actually works in real life.” In a financial crisis, regulators worry about contagion. If bondholders of one bank are defaulted on, those of other banks will worry they’re next and yank their support, causing a downward spiral of confidence that crashes the economy. So the regulators make sure bondholders keep getting paid. “Indeed,” Kashkari writes, “the most recent crisis showed that even some debt holders who had been explicitly told that they would take losses during a crisis got bailed out.” Kashkari argues that regulators and bankers should stop acting as if bonds are part of TLAC (which, remember, stand for total loss-absorbing capacity), because when push comes to shove, bondholders will absorb few if any losses. Taxpayers will be forced to step up and make sure they keep getting paid. Kashkari also disses Dimon’s argument that banks’ safety cushions are needlessly thick. Dimon wrote to shareholders that if the Federal Reserve standards weren’t so tough, “banks probably would have been more aggressive in making some small business loans, lower-rated middle market loans, and near-prime mortgages.” Kashkari’s response? “Mr. Dimon argues that the current capital standards are restraining lending and impairing economic growth, yet he also points out that JPMorgan bought back $26 billion in stock over the past five years. If JPMorgan really had demand for additional loans from creditworthy borrowers, why did it turn those customers away and instead choose to buy back its stock?” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Outperformance has been tough during the 8-year-old bull market amid high stock correlations. Investors continue to pour money into passive funds, which saw a record-breaking start to the year. Jeff Cox | @JeffCoxCNBCcom 15 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters What investing has to do with the Beatles    Wednesday, 22 Mar 2017 | 7:55 PM ET | 02:23 After years of languishing, maybe 2017 finally will be the year that active managers reassert their place in the investment community. As a whole, stock-picking fund managers got off to a solid start this year, with 52 percent of fundamental equity managers beating their Russell 1000 index benchmarks, according to research from JPMorgan Chase. The 50 percent barrier for a single quarter has been broken only a handful of times since the bull market began in March 2009. The stronger performance comes amid a decline in the tendency of stocks to move up and down together, a trend referred to as correlation. Lower correlations limit opportunities for active managers to find stocks that are mispriced and thus more likely to exceed broader market gains. In addition, the level of dispersion, or the difference in returns among broad sectors within the market, also has been on the upswing. The same principle applies — greater disparity in sectors provides active managers better opportunities to find cheap areas in which to invest. Indeed, it was a particularly strong quarter for value managers, who search for companies and sectors that may be depressed but are expected to break out. Strategies focused on value showed a 67 percent outperformance rate. To be sure, the news wasn't as good elsewhere. Growth managers had just a 41 percent beat rate. Small-cap managers generally speaking also had a weak quarter, with just 34 percent topping the Russell 2000. However, the trend particularly in large-cap is moving in the right direction. Investors, though, are continuing to flock from active funds. The first quarter saw a record amount of money pile into passive strategies, with exchange-traded funds pulling in a net $132 billion in fresh investor cash, according to the State Street Global Advisors. Equity, or stock-based, ETFs drew the greatest share, hauling in $96.6 billion. ETFs trace indexes such as the S&P 500 or broad sectors and don't employ professional managers to pick individual stocks. They also generally carry much lower fees than mutual funds and trade like stocks. JPMorgan analysts estimate that more than one in three — 35 percent — investor dollars now is in the hands of passive management, up from 15 percent a decade ago. In terms of sectors, investors favored "Trump trade" areas that would benefit from reflation that would come with President Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda getting implemented. Materials, financials and energy attracted the most investor cash, while the defensive yield-generating utilities sector was the only one to see outflows, JPMorgan said.

Psychologist Daniel Kahneman won a 2002 Nobel Prize for his behavioral-economics research, and Michael Lewis recently published The Undoing Project, a best-selling book that has rocked efficient-market theorists to their core.

Subscribe on iTunes http://apple.co/2eX6Eay ... Visit the online home of Playbook http://politi.co/2f51Jnf THE MEETING OF THE WEEK -- Congress is gone. Passover begins tonight. D.C. will be unnaturally quiet this week, save the ongoing wars in President Donald Trump’s West Wing. This week’s headliner is a White House visit by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Wednesday. Trump hasn’t been shy when it comes to NATO, saying that the United States shoulders too much of the financial burden for the 28-nation alliance. Story Continued Below ONE THOUGHT FROM INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE -- One West Winger tells us that PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP seems willing to give the Bannon-Kushner-Priebus detente time to try to take hold before making any drastic staff changes. Of course, no one truly knows what the president is thinking or what he will do, because his decision-making process is, well, unconventional. But this White House insider said the Syria bombing gave Trump some momentum, and with Congress out of town, Trump could be poised for another good week. **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh SHANE GOLDMACHER GETS INSIDE THE ROOM -- THE 100-DAY MARKER APPROACHES -- “One hundred days is the marker, and we’ve got essentially two-and-a-half weeks to turn everything around,’ said one White House official. ‘This is going to be a monumental task.’ … More than 30 Trump staffers piled into a conference room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building adjoining the White House, according to a half-dozen attendees who described the Tuesday meeting. “Mike Dubke, Trump’s communications director, and his deputy, Jessica Ditto, kicked off the discussion of how to package Trump’s tumultuous first 100 days by pitching the need for a ‘rebranding’ to get Trump back on track. ... Staffers, including counselor Kellyanne Conway, were broken into three groups, complete with whiteboards, markers and giant butcher-block-type paper to brainstorm lists of early successes. One group worked in the hallway. ‘It made me feel like I was back in 5th grade,’ complained another White House aide who was there. ‘That’s the best way I could describe it.’ … "Dubke, who did not work on the campaign, told the assembled aides that international affairs would present a messaging challenge because the president lacks a coherent foreign policy. … ‘There is no Trump doctrine,’ Dubke declared. Some in the room were stunned by the remark. ‘It rubbed people the wrong way because on the campaign we were pretty clear about what he wanted to do,’ said a third White House official in the room, ‘He was elected on a vision of America First. America First is the Trump doctrine.’ “One of the administration officials lamented, ‘We’ve got a comms team supposedly articulating the president’s message [that] does not appear to understand the president’s message.’ Dubke told POLITICO he was disappointed White House staff would complain in the press rather than in real time. ‘It was a brainstorming session and I really wish they had spoken up in the room so that we could have had an open and honest conversation,’ he said. ‘It is unproductive adjudicating internal discussions through the media.’” http://politi.co/2nZvKpT -- A FEW THOUGHTS: This story by Shane is stunning for several reasons, not least because the White House communications director said the president doesn't have a coherent foreign policy. Also, don't expect much between now and the 100-day marker. Congress is gone for the next two weeks. The Republican health-care plan is on life support. And even the White House is getting wise that tax reform could be many months away. Funding the government and signing executive orders could be all Trump has to talk about. It’s a pretty striking contrast to past presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who both passed significant pieces of legislation in their first 100 days. SCOOP -- “Trump makes nice with Koch brothers,” by Ken Vogel and Josh Dawsey: “President Donald Trump on Saturday night had a friendly chat at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach with twin mega-donor brothers David and Bill Koch, whose family had clashed with Trump during the campaign. Three people familiar with the interaction said it occurred when Trump stopped by as the billionaire brothers were eating dinner with conservative media entrepreneur Chris Ruddy, a friend of the president who is a member of Mar-a-Lago and is known to hold court with his guests at the membership-only club. The sources describe the chat as agreeable, but did not disclose the subject of the conversation. While Bill Koch supported Trump during the general election, David Koch and his older brother Charles Koch sidelined their massive political machine during the presidential campaign in protest of Trump.” http://politi.co/2ohjjs4 -- SOMETHING TO WATCH: Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently elevated prosecutor Steven Cook to his inner circle to help him undo President Barack Obama’s Justice Department policies, which could include criminal justice reform, a major priority for the Koch brothers. (http://wapo.st/2op8STH) So this detente could just be temporary. -- WE HEARD … That President Trump and Melania were eating with Steve and Christine Schwarzman Saturday night at Mar-a-Lago. And Ruddy was also dining with Media General heiress Talbott Maxey and Miguel Forbes. ****** “A lack of economic growth and opportunity has led to deep and understandable frustration among so many Americans,” writes JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Learn more about why we need “coherent, consistent, comprehensive and coordinated policies that help fix these problems” in his Letter to Shareholders: http://politi.co/2oaMj4Q ****** JMART SPECIAL FROM ATLANTA -- “As Georgia Vote Nears, G.O.P. Asks if Ideological Purity Matters Anymore”: “Mr. Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party has blurred the bright-line ideological distinctions that defined the right for the past eight years. Driven more by personal loyalty and a ravenous appetite to win than by any fixed political philosophy, the deal-cutting president has been received warmly by some mainstream conservatives. At the same time, even ideological hard-liners who share the president’s pugilism but not his pragmatism have stuck by him because Mr. Trump has made the right enemies — and gleefully ridiculed them with public insults rarely heard from a president. “These loyalties have upended the Tea Party-versus-establishment divide, which has dominated fratricidal primary seasons since 2010 but increasingly has the air of fins on the back of a car, a quaint relic from an earlier era. With Mr. Trump in charge, the political market for purity on the right has been devalued. … The shifting conservative fault lines are on display in the affluent and mall-dotted northern suburbs of Atlanta, which were at the front end of the South’s political realignment in the 1970s when they turned away from their Democratic roots and elected a loquacious young college professor named Newt Gingrich to Congress.” http://nyti.ms/2op7yA4 -- JUST TO RECAP … Republicans are worried about this Georgia seat. The special election for CIA Director Mike Pompeo’s Wichita, Kansas-based seat has also turned competitive. And the DCCC is already sending senior staffers to California to try to knock off some Republicans there. http://lat.ms/2oWRNRB One thought on the California play: why don’t Democrats try to win some seats in cheaper media markets! Southern California will cost the party some serious coin. PETER BAKER in the NYT, “For Obama, Syria Chemical Attack Shows Risk of ‘Deals With Dictators’”: “When it came time to make his case for the judgment of history, President Barack Obama had a ready rebuttal to one of the most cutting critiques of his time in office. Although friends and foes alike faulted him for not following through on his threat to retaliate when Syria gassed its own people in 2013, Mr. Obama would counter that he had actually achieved a better result through an agreement with President Bashar al-Assad to surrender all of his chemical weapons. After last week, even former Obama aides assume that he will have to rethink that passage in his memoir.” http://nyti.ms/2oWjZEa --AP at 5:34 a.m.: “Israel shuts Egypt border crossing following terror warning”: “Israel closed its Taba border crossing to Egypt Monday following a warning by its anti-terrorism office of an ‘imminent’ militant attack there. The closure comes hours before the start of the Passover holiday, when Sinai is a popular destination for many Israelis. Soon after the announcement, sirens wailed in parts of southern Israel alerting residents to a rocket attack. The military said a rocket fired from Sinai exploded in an open field, causing no injuries. Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz said in a statement Monday there was intel regarding a potential ‘terror attack’ against tourists in the Sinai peninsula. The crossing remains open for those wanting to return from Egypt.” http://apne.ws/2nwTaqs TRUMP'S MONDAY -- The president is attending a swearing in ceremony for Neil Gorsuch, and will meet with OMB Director Mick Mulvaney. THE JUICE … -- MOVEON.ORG is ramping up its activity in the Georgia special election, launching a six-figure TV and digital ad buy backing Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff. The ads focus on drawing a contrast between Ossoff and Trump and the Republican health care plan. The group is also mobilizing 15,000 of its members in the district to volunteer and vote and reports that its members have contributed more than $260,000 to his campaign since their endorsement.

Everytown for Gun Safety, founded and funded by the billionaire former New York City mayor, is hiring several new top staffers and turning much of its attention to state legislatures, while moving to a defensive posture in Washington as it tries to stop what’s known as ‘concealed carry reciprocity’ from becoming law. … Brynne Craig, most recently Hillary Clinton’s deputy director of state campaigns, is joining as Everytown’s managing director of external affairs and civic engagement. … Eric Schultz will oversee Everytown’s communications and political strategy while continuing his role as a senior adviser to former President Barack Obama.” http://politi.co/2oQLob6 --“TV ads slam Republicans over would-be Obamacare repeal,” by Kyle Cheney: “Save My Care, a coalition of left-leaning health care advocacy groups fighting to preserve Obamacare, is launching a seven-figure TV ad buy in seven competitive House districts across the country. … The ads target five Republican lawmakers from districts won by Hillary Clinton, including [Darrell] Issa, whose Orange County district Clinton carried by eight points. Other Republicans in Clinton-won districts include Arizona’s Martha McSally, Colorado’s Mike Coffman and Florida’s Carlos Curbelo and California’s David Valadao.” http://politi.co/2pkVzkz … The ad against Issa http://bit.ly/2op6QTs SPORTS BLINK -- “Sergio Garcia completes his transformation by winning the Masters,” by WaPo’s Barry Svrluga in Augusta, Georgia: “In Sergio Garcia’s folded knees and collapsing legs and in his bend at the waist that could not be controlled was everything from the past two decades, self-doubt and self-loathing and all the pain both can bring. He has been — pick a phrase because over the years we have used them all — star-crossed and whiny, unlucky and unsure, talented and tortured. Each applies. But Sunday night, so much of his life changed. … And so, this: a downhill putt on Augusta’s 18th green, one that curled ever so delicately into the bottom of the cup. It’s a putt he has missed his whole career. Heck, it’s a putt he missed not a half an hour earlier — not from the same spot but with the same stakes. This one that finally, gloriously went in? It came on the first extra hole of the 81st Masters. It settled in for birdie. It beat Englishman Justin Rose. It made him a Masters champion.” http://wapo.st/2oQM3cr Playbook Reads PHOTO DU JOUR: A woman writes a message on a wooden plank at the department store Ahlens in Stockholm, Sweden on April 9. A hijacked truck was driven into a crowd of pedestrians and crashed into a department store on April 7. | Markus Schreiber/AP Photo JEFFREY TOOBIN in The New Yorker, “The Conservative Pipeline to the Supreme Court: With the Federalist Society, Leonard Leo has reared a generation of originalist élites. The selection of Neil Gorsuch is just his latest achievement”: “Leo has for many years been the executive vice-president of the Federalist Society, a nationwide organization of conservative lawyers, based in Washington. Leo served, in effect, as Trump’s subcontractor on the selection of Gorsuch ... Leo’s role in the nomination capped a period of extraordinary influence for him and for the Federalist Society. During the Administration of George W. Bush, Leo also played a crucial part in the nominations of John Roberts and Samuel Alito. Now that Gorsuch has been confirmed, Leo is responsible, to a considerable extent, for a third of the Supreme Court.” http://bit.ly/2oioKoM BANNON WATCH -- “How Bannon’s multimedia machine drove a movement and paid him millions,” by WaPo’s Shawn Boburg and Robert O’Harrow Jr.: “A Washington Post examination found that [Steve] Bannon was able to produce more than a dozen conservative documentaries over the past decade by drawing on a network of two dozen nonprofit organizations and private companies. Bannon helped arrange donations from wealthy Republicans to the nonprofits that paid him for films and other work, documents show. At the same time, Bannon and his firms took in at least $2 million from the nonprofits and an additional $5 million from the private companies, records show. “Bannon, who had already made millions on Wall Street, often was paid in multiple ways for each project — a common practice in Hollywood, where he had worked as an entertainment financier. Because he was paid through the nonprofit and private companies, which have limited obligations to disclose details about their activities, the total pay to Bannon remains unknown ... Bannon, the White House and Schweizer did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Tax specialists told The Post that some of Bannon’s activities raise questions about compliance with Internal Revenue Service restrictions against using tax ­exempt charities to attack a political candidate or for excessive personal financial benefit.” http://wapo.st/2oWqqqS COMING ATTRACTIONS -- “W.H. considers order that could lead to more tariffs,” by CNN’s Daniella Diaz: “President Donald Trump’s administration is drafting an executive order to investigate the extent to which the unfair dumping and subsidization of certain imports adds to the US trade deficit. If the results of the investigation show an impact, it could lead to more tariffs on imported goods, an administration official told CNN. The investigation could result in ‘everything from no action at all to the levying of supplemental duties,’ the official said.” http://cnn.it/2nZBIXG THE GLOBAL POLITICO: TRUMP’S MEDIA WAR: After President Trump called her “Hillary Clinton’s P.R.

And President Trump is not the only reason,” by NYT’s John Koblin: “One of the most surprising turnaround stories in recent television history began on one of the most surprising nights in political history. On Nov. 8, Stephen Colbert was hosting a live election night special for CBS’s sister cable network, Showtime. A program that was built around an expected Hillary Clinton victory went off the rails almost as soon as it went on the air at 11 p.m. As election returns came in, audience members, who had been asked to shut off their phones an hour earlier, gasped as it became clear that Donald J. Trump could very well become president. Mr. Colbert looked dumbstruck. Sensing the gravity of the moment, Chris Licht, the executive producer of ‘The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,’ walked over to Mr. Colbert’s desk during a musical performance. ‘Stop being funny and go and just be real,’ Mr. Licht told the host. … “Mr. Licht, 45, had created a hit as the founding executive producer of MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe’ and then accomplished something no one had done before him: He created a morning show on CBS that actually drew some ratings.” http://nyti.ms/2oXnszI -- “Political talk helping ‘The View’ to comeback,” by AP’s David Bauder: “The unquenchable thirst for chatter about President Donald Trump has changed the dynamics of a fierce daytime television competition much as it has in late-night TV. ‘The View’ has spent more time talking politics with the arrival of a new administration, stopping the momentum of its rival ‘The Talk,’ which sticks to pop culture. It’s a turnabout similar to Stephen Colbert supplanting Jimmy Fallon as the new king of late-night, only it has received little attention in comparison. … Since the beginning of this year, the average audience for ‘The View’ has increased by 1 percent over 2016 while ‘The Talk’ is down 6 percent, the Nielsen company said. ‘The View’ regularly beats its rival now.” http://apne.ws/2oQAlPb -- “21st Century Fox will investigate L.A. radio host’s sexual harassment claim against Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly,” by L.A. Times’ Stephen Battaglio: “A Los Angeles radio personality’s claim that she was sexually harassed by Fox News host Bill O’Reilly in 2013 is being investigated by the cable channel’s parent company, 21st Century Fox. Lisa Bloom, the lawyer representing KFI talk radio host Wendy Walsh, told CNN on Sunday that 21st Century Fox attorneys say they will look into the claim that Walsh was denied an opportunity to become a contributor to Fox News because she rebuffed sexual advances made by O’Reilly. A representative for 21st Century Fox confirmed that the company is having the incident investigated by the law firm that fielded harassment complaints at Fox News last year following the lawsuit filed by former anchor Gretchen Carlson.” http://lat.ms/2nThQ7D -- MAEGAN VAZQUEZ promoted at IJR to White House reporter – Alex Skatell emails the staff: “Before coming to IJR, Maegan gained a wealth of experience across the cable news spectrum from MSNBC to CNN to FNC ...

Trump to keep Obama Passover custom alive with Seder Monday,” by The Times of Israel’s Eric Cortellessa: “US President Donald Trump will host a White House Passover seder Monday night, an administration official told The Times of Israel on Sunday, confirming that the new administration will continue a tradition started by former president Barack Obama. ... The White House Seder began as an annual tradition under former president Barack Obama, who hosted the first such event in 2009, in the Old Family Dining Room. ... Beyond his immediate family, Trump has several Jewish administration officials who could partake in the dinner, including Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn, Special Envoy for International Negotiations Jason Greenblatt, and Senior Adviser Stephen Miller.” http://bit.ly/2nwP3uj (Jewish Insider scooped that Trump was hosting the Seder).

Without calling out Donald Trump by name, the letter outlines several key criticisms of the president’s most newsworthy policies — including a prescient warning about how war affects the nation’s economy. Plenty of business leaders have offered their own critiques of Trump, but the JPMorgan shareholder letter stands out because Dimon is not just any top exec. His name was floated for Treasury Secretary shortly after Election Day, and he was included in Trump’s much-publicized Strategy and Policy Forum: a high-profile gathering of leading executives designed to establish Trump’s A-list business cred in the earliest days of the new administration. Dimon vs. Trump: Round 1 Pundits who are shocked by the content of the new Dimon shareholder letter should go back and recall some recent history. Dimon’s 2016 shareholder letter also included several not-so-veiled jabs at leadership styles that critics would say describe Trump. Here’s the headline from Quartz, almost exactly one year ago, on April 7, 2016: “JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon delivers an epic takedown of Donald Trump without even naming him.” Quartz writer Jake Flanagin zeroed-in on a section about leadership that closes out the letter, and he picked out a Jamie Dimon laundry list of “what doesn’t work:” “Treating every decision like it is binary — my way or your way.” “Drawing straw men or creating scapegoats.” “Denigrating a whole class of people or society.” “Equating perception with reality.” “Treating someone’s comments as if they were complaints.” Sound familiar? Flanigan also sliced out Dimon’s take on what works: “Collaborating and compromising.” “Listening carefully to each other.” “Constantly, openly, and thoroughly reviewing institutions, programs, and policies. Analyze what is working and what is not working, and then figure out — together — how we can make it better.” Dimon vs. Trump: Round 2 To be clear, the bulk of the 2017 shareholder letter lays out a position on regulatory issues and government relations to be expected from a global financial institution. However, Dimon raised more than a few eyebrows with several relatively brief passages that seem aimed squarely at the Trump target. Fortune magazine’s Jen Wieczner, for example, highlighted at least five hot-button issues Dimon pushed: immigration, the environment and climate change, national defense, and trade relations with Mexico and China. The national defense issue is especially newsworthy considering the recent U.S. missile strike on a Syrian air base. The passage on national defense comes up in a section of the letter in which Dimon discusses several “non-economic” factors that could account for slow growth, wage stagnation and the shrinkage of economic opportunity. Here it is in full: “Over the last 16 years, we have spent trillions of dollars on wars when we could have been investing that money productively. (I’m not saying that money didn’t need to be spent; but every dollar spent on battle is a dollar that can’t be put to use elsewhere.)” The Trump administration would like to position the Syria operation as a decisive reaction to the use of chemical weapons on civilians by the Syrian government, but questions about the missile strike are already dominating the media narrative. That’s partly because the U.S. reportedly tipped off Russia and/or Syria long before the missiles were launched, a forewarning that minimized loss of life — and equipment — at the air base. The base reportedly went back into action quickly, and as of this writing at least one additional air attack has struck the same site where chemical weapons were deployed. As per Dimon’s letter, attention is also quickly focusing on the cost of the operation. MarketWatch, for example, reports that the replacement cost of the 59 Tomahawk missiles deployed against Syria adds up to roughly $60 million. Media attention is also beginning to focus on the potential benefit to Trump’s personal finances. Reportedly the president owns stock in Raytheon, the manufacturer of those missiles. Raytheon’s stock jumped after the missile launch. Dimon’s criticism of defense spending is also especially relevant in the context of Trump’s proposed federal budget, which would greatly boost defense spending while cutting other programs. More jabs at Trump Dimon also appeared to target Trump with three brief but pointed passages on immigration. One occurs near the beginning of the letter. Dimon begins a section on geopolitical risks by promising that “I’m not going to write about immigration in this letter –,” but he concludes the very same sentence with this observation: “We have always supported proper immigration – it is a vital part of the strength of America, and, properly done, it enhances the economy and the vitality of the country.” The second reference occurs later in that section, when Dimon links economic globalization and immigration while defending NAFTA: “Mexico is a long-standing peaceful neighbor, and it is wholly in our country’s interest that Mexico be a prosperous nation. This actually reduces immigration issues.” Dimon brings up a third reference to immigration in the same “non-economic” category as national defense: “It is alarming that approximately 40 percent (this is an astounding 300,000 students each year) of those who receive advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering and math at American universities are foreign nationals with no legal way of staying here even when many would choose to do so. We are forcing great talent overseas by not allowing these young people to build their dreams here.” Jobs, jobs and more jobs… Another area of focus in the Dimon letter is workforce development. In that regard he presents a powerful counterpoint to Trump’s focus on bringing back traditional jobs in coal and other fossil industry sectors, including pipeline construction. As Dimon described, JPMorgan is leading by example in this area, with more than $325 million in “demand-driven” workforce initiatives globally. Broadly described, coal jobs could fit into this initiative: “Our programs build stronger labor markets that create economic opportunity, focusing on middle-skill jobs – positions that require a high school education, and often specialized training or certifications, but not a college degree.” However, the devil is in the details. JPMorgan sees workforce demand in other areas that “offer good wages and the chance to move up the economic ladder:” “…surgical technologists, diesel mechanics, help desk technicians and more … Our goal is to increase the number of workers who have access to career path-ways, whether they are adults looking to develop new skills or younger workers starting to prepare for careers during high school and ending with postsecondary degrees or credentials aligned with good-paying, high-demand jobs. Workforce development in the U.S. is strongly related to another “non-economic” factor Dimon said inhibits growth: the criminal justice system: “Felony convictions for even minor offenses have led, in part, to 20 million American citizens having a criminal record – and this means they often have a hard time getting a job. (There are six times more felons in the United States than in Canada.)” To be clear, Dimon did not examine the racial aspect of felony convictions for minor offenses. However, in a lengthy passage earlier in the letter, he connects the dots between education and opportunity with a reference to “inner city schools” that presumably refers to ethnic and racial minority youth, who are vulnerable to profiling and sentencing disparity: “Whether they graduate from high school, vocational or training school or go on to college, our students can and should be adequately prepared for good, decent-paying jobs…Career and technical education specifically can give young people the skills they need for decent-paying roles in hundreds of fields, including aviation, robotics, medical science, welding, accounting and coding – all jobs that are in demand today.” Once again, coal jobs fail to make the cut.

But JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon must be No. 2, because he certainly is trying harder. Mr. Dimon, America’s most admired or vilified banker depending on your point of view, dropped a 46-page epistle on his handsomely rewarded shareholders last week. The opus is chock full of his pride in the institution and its many accomplishments: record 2016 earnings of $24.7 billion; record results in six out of the last seven years; and a stock that has outperformed the S&P 500 and its banking peers since the Great Recession and “the extraordinarily difficult legal, regulatory and political environments that followed,” the CEO wrote. “The regulatory environment is unnecessarily complex, costly, and sometimes confusing,” Mr. Dimon lamented, writing that he supports “thoughtful, effective regulation, not simply more or less.” While he believes “America today is probably stronger than ever before,” Mr. Dimon said our nation confronts some serious problems besides its harsh regulatory climate. Among them: health care costs that are about twice as much per capita as most other developed nations and onerous taxes that prompt American companies to invest overseas, where they can earn more in countries with lower corporate tax rates. Mr. Dimon’s diagnosis and prescription require some context. First, his compensation jumped 49 percent last year to $27.2 million, bringing his three-year haul to $73.2 million. So he has more of a vested interest in lower taxes than, say, 99 percent plus of Americans. More importantly, JPMorgan Chase has paid $28.7 billion in regulatory penalties since 2010, according to Good Jobs First. The fines eclipse the bank’s record profits last year. The Washington, D.C., research group, which keeps tabs on corporate behavior as well as government subsidies, said the bank has been fined $13.5 billion for toxic securities abuses and $5.4 billion for mortgage abuses over that period. Most recently, the bank paid $264 million to settle federal civil and criminal charges for hiring hundreds of friends and relatives of potential Chinese clients in order to win business in that country. Can “complex, costly and sometimes confusing” regulations be the cause of JPMorgan Chase’s tarnished regulatory record? Could these extra costs of doing business have something to do with Mr. Dimon’s dim view of the regulatory climate? You make the call. ◊ ◊ ◊   The Trump administration’s decision to push back the impending implementation of a standard that would require more investment advisers to put their clients’ interests ahead of their own has spawned a “retirement ripoff counter” that is tracking how much the delay is costing those saving for retirement. On Tuesday, the U.S. Labor Department delayed implementation of the so-called fiduciary standard for 60 days while it considers rewriting the rule. The proposal has been sharply criticized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Investment Company Institute and other interest groups in the investment business that believe the standard will harm investors. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, and two consumer groups started the counter the next day. They estimate the conflicted advice that investment advisers can offer because of the delay will cost Americans $46 million a day, $1.9 million per hour, and $532 per second. The projections are based on estimates the White House Counsel of Economic Advisers made under then-President Barack Obama. Proponents of the standard say that without it, investment advisers can safely steer clients to more costly, poorer performing investments that pose greater risks and reward advisers with larger commissions. Over 30 years, the conflicted advice means a retiree will run out of money five years sooner than someone who received unconflicted advice, proponents of the measure says.  Wherever the truth lies in this regulatory ruckus, it’s all the more reason to be careful out there. Always ask your adviser what they are collecting for the help they are giving you.

The São Paulo-based company, known as VMH, is seen completing a three-stage IPO preparation plan by September, according to one of the people. Toronto and New York appear to be the favored destinations for a VMH listing, the person said. Talks with investment banks are at an advanced stage, with Bank of America Corp, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co among those said to be vying for underwriting spots, two of the people said. The four people spoke under condition of anonymity because the transaction remains private. They did not detail a tentative structure and timetable for the transaction or give an estimated value for VMH. The IPO would give VMH access to a wide base of investors betting on a long-term recovery in zinc, copper, lead and silver prices, the first person said. Proceeds may come in handy for parent Votorantim, Brazil's largest diversified industrial group, which is growing in energy, pulp and agribusiness while cutting a 14.7 billion-real ($4.7 billion) debt burden, the people added. Contacted on Sunday, media officials at parent Votorantim, which is controlled by Brazil's billionaire Ermirio de Moraes family, declined to comment on "market speculation." Bank of America did not have any immediate comment. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan declined to comment. EQUITY OFFERINGS VMH is the latest addition to a long list of Brazilian companies pursuing IPOs in coming months to rebalance their capital structure and pave the way for future expansion. Some large Brazilian groups are taking advantage of a revival in capital markets activity this year to list some subsidiaries or exit businesses, as well as to raise cash to bring down debt. Bankers expect up to one-fourth of planned Brazilian company listings for this year to happen overseas. The local subsidiary of France's Carrefour SA, as well as airline Azul SA and N2com Internet SA, known by the online shoe retailing brand Netshoes, are seeking to list their operations domestically or overseas. With a presence in Brazil and Peru, where it holds a majority stake in Cia Minera Milpo SA, VMH operates five industrial compounds in Brazil's state of Minas Gerais, and in Cajamarquilla in Peru. VMH also has sales offices in Houston and Luxembourg. Last year, investments in zinc and byproducts represented 11 percent of Votorantim's capital spending of about $3 billion. Those investments included efforts to extend the working life of the Vazante mine in Brazil for another 10 years. Net revenue at Votorantim's zinc and byproducts division came in at 6.386 billion reais last year, with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 1.328 billion reais. EBITDA, as the gauge of operational profits is commonly known, reached 21 percent of revenue, making the zinc and byproducts division the most profitable activity among parent Votorantim's five business segments in last year's financial results.

The London bank said Monday it had also launched its own investigation into the matter. Authorities are probing Mr. Staley's actions in trying to identify the source of an anonymous letter that criticized the hiring of Tim Main, who was named in 2016 as head of the financial institutions group at Barclays, according to people with knowledge of the events. The letter also raised questions about Mr. Staley's dealings with him when they worked together at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. The U.K.'s Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority are probing both Mr. Staley and the bank over its treatment of whistleblowers Barclays said in a statement. The bank added that it had issued a formal reprimand to Mr. Staley and would make a "significant" cut to his bonus. It is also conducting its own review into Barclays's controls. The New York State Department of Financial Services, which regulates Barclays in the U.S., is also investigating the matter, according to people familiar with the probe. "I have apologized to the Barclays board, and accepted its conclusion that my personal actions in this matter were errors on my part," Mr. Staley said in a statement. Mr. Main was brought in from Evercore Partners to run Barclays's financial institutions group. Mr. Main, who is based in New York, had previously worked with Mr. Staley at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. He declined to comment through a Barclays spokesman. In June 2016, Barclays's board and a senior executive received anonymous letters raising "concerns of a personal nature" about Mr. Main, as well as Mr. Staley's "knowledge of and role in dealing with those issues at a previous employer," the bank said. Mr. Staley initially asked Barclays's internal security team to try to identify the authors of the letters, believing them to be an "unfair personal attack," the bank said. He was told that it wasn't appropriate to do so, the bank said. But in July he followed up on the request, and the security team asked a U.S. law-enforcement agency to try to help, the bank said. The whistleblower's identity was never revealed, the bank said. Messrs. Main and Staley rose through the ranks in J.P. Morgan's investment-banking division together. They both spent time in the bank's equity capital-markets division, and Mr. Main went on to be global co-head of the bank's financial-institutions group, reporting to Mr. Staley. He then joined Evercore in 2011. People familiar with the matter said the whistleblower's complaint related to concerns that Mr. Main had a substance-abuse problem while at J.P. Morgan. Mr. Staley thought the complaint was unfair and sought to defend Mr. Main, these people added. Mr. Main declined to comment through a Barclays spokeswoman. The issue is another stumble for Barclays as it tries to overhaul its image after years of scandals. Mr. Staley has trumpeted the bank's values and brought in executives to upgrade its controls. "This latest revelation represents a very significant embarrassment for the board as it tries to rebuild the group's reputation," said Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital. Mr. Staley's actions came amid an upgrade of U.K. regulations meant to protect whistleblowers. The rules had been approved in October 2015 and came into effect the following March and September. They require big U.K. banks to appoint a "whistleblowing champion" among their senior managers and for a report on whistleblowing to be presented to the board every year. The regulations also say banks must permit employees to raise issues in confidence, and that actions "to the detriment of a whistleblower" could threaten a bank or executive's regulatory fitness. U.K. law also prohibits employers from retaliating against whistleblowers. Proper handling of internal complaints is a widespread issue in banking. Wells Fargo & Co., for instance, has been contending with its own allegations of whistleblower retaliations, which the bank has said it is investigating but hasn't yet spotted a pattern. A Barclays employee flagged the attempted unmasking to the bank's board in early 2017, the bank said. The board then commissioned its own probe and shared its findings with the U.K. regulators. Barclays said an internal investigation into Mr. Staley's actions concluded that he honestly, but mistakenly, believed that it was permissible to identify the author of the letter. The probe is expected to take several months, according to people familiar with the matter. Punishments could range from a verbal warning to Mr. Staley's being barred from undertaking regulated activity, a step that would prevent him from remaining CEO. Barclays's board will await the regulators' findings before docking a chunk of his 2017 bonus. Last year, Mr. Staley was paid GBP4.2 million ($5.2 million). Since his arrival in late 2015, Mr. Staley has refreshed the bank's management team, bringing in a series of new executives. Many of them were from his alma mater, J.P. Morgan. He has replaced Barclays's chief risk officer, chief operating officer and the head of its investment bank. Some within Barclays have grumbled that Mr. Staley wasn't giving insiders a fair chance and was leaning too heavily on J.P. Morgan, where he spent more than three decades, holding a portfolio of roles including running its investment bank. Mr. Staley left J.P. Morgan in 2013 after a management reshuffle. He joined BlueMountain Capital, a hedge fund that had profited a year earlier from the "London whale" debacle, which left J.P. Morgan with more than $6 billion in losses. Barclays investors have warmed to Mr. Staley's plan to reinforce Barclays's investment-banking franchise and refocus the lender on its U.S. and U.K. operations. The bank's share price has risen 43% this year. Barclays Chairman John McFarlane said in a statement that he is "personally very disappointed" in Mr. Staley, but the board nonetheless said it supports his reappointment at the bank's annual shareholder meeting next month.

Isaac Lieberman Photographer: Christopher Goodney/Bloomberg There’s nothing nefarious afoot here, to be clear. It’s just that at a time when many currency-trading firms don’t know what to do when extreme price fluctuations hit, Lieberman’s brought together a bunch of military and tech gurus to form a firm -- Aston Capital Management -- that’s designed to thrive at those moments. When others shut down, it gears up. “We get very excited about flash events because it gives us data to work with that’s very hard to come by,” Lieberman said in an interview at Aston’s office on the 85th floor of New York’s Freedom Tower. “You can’t simulate things like this.” Violent shifts in the $5.1-trillion-a-day foreign-exchange market have become more common in recent years. New players such as Aston, which began in 2014, have emerged as electronic market makers. They offer to buy and sell currencies to customers even during the hairiest price swings and hope to profit when prices bounce back. Aston’s techies analyze price patterns and create computerized strategies to predict where markets will move. They also measure the company’s performance during the events and adapt its algorithms. “A flash crash or an event could be an opportunity for a currency manager” who specializes in volatility, said Alison Romano, senior investment officer at Florida’s State Board of Administration, which manages the state pension plan. “I want my managers to be taking advantage of that.” Dealer Gap Aston and firms including XTX Markets, Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial are stepping into a gap left by traditional dealers. Stricter regulation enacted since the 2008 financial crisis has prompted some banks to withdraw from the market and cut staff. That’s created a vacuum which makes it more difficult for customers to trade when they want to, at the prices they want to. Newcomers have also disrupted other assets. Citadel Securities, Virtu, Global Trading Systems and IMC Financial Markets have shaken up how stocks are bought and sold in the U.S., overseeing almost all trading on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange now. And in bonds, JPMorgan Chase & Co. last year agreed to outsource some of its Treasuries business to Virtu. The new era of turbulence began in 2015 when the Swiss National Bank jolted foreign-exchange markets by abandoning its cap on the franc, triggering a rally of about 41 percent in 20 minutes. Most recently, the euro surged 1.6 percent over several minutes during Asian trading in December. Before that, in October, the pound slumped about 9 percent in a matter of seconds, prompting a review by the world’s biggest central banks. The South African rand and New Zealand dollar also took similar roller-coaster rides. Lieberman said Aston traded $500 million in 90 seconds during the pound’s plunge.

Lieberman’s challenge, when he started the firm with his own money after leaving JPMorgan Chase, was to put together a team willing to risk their shirts. Frustrated by competition for engineers and mathematicians in New York, Lieberman said he found a tech whiz through his East Side synagogue. With the help of Roi Klein, an ex-army major from the elite 8200 intelligence unit of the Israel Defense Forces, he recruited a team in Tel Aviv. Some of Lieberman’s employees had military or tech experience, but scant knowledge of financial markets. So he said he got a white board and started drawing. One of his first examples was a grid of numbers, or an order book, listing bids and offers that traders use as a sort of shopping list. From there, the company created software to make money when big shocks hit the market. During a flash crash, “what we like to understand is when it hits the wall, which is the hardest to find, but the most opportune to trade into,” Lieberman said in his three-man office with a view of the Statue of Liberty. “At a certain point, it simply stops and prices start to go back to fair value.” Rising Returns While many of the ex-army quants who helped build Aston have since moved on, the systems they built are still working. The firm handles an average of $1 billion to $2 billion dollars a day -- they’re not just a flash-crash shop, of course -- and it returned more than 22 percent last year through November, according to a company performance report. Foreign-exchange trading volumes are shrinking, and prices are swinging more wildly, according to a December report by the Bank for International Settlements. Unexpected events such as the pound’s flash crash will probably happen again and it’s hard to predict where and when, said Chris Salmon, executive director for markets at the Bank of England. For many in the market, flash events are a time to play it safe. Dori Levanoni, a partner at First Quadrant, a Pasadena-based hedge fund that manages about $12.6 billion in currency strategies, said that portfolio managers and traders can hit the pause button and wait for better market conditions before placing orders. This is Lieberman’s cue to spring into action. “We try to put together a collage, a story of what happened,” he said, “so we can understand it.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters data.JPMorgan (JPM.N), Citigroup (C.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump.However, bank stocks have retreated of late as investors question lofty valuations and Trump's ability to swiftly introduce simpler regulations and other policies following the failure of a healthcare reform bill. The S&P 500 financial sector .SPSY was off 0.56 percent, dragged down by Bank of America (BAC.N), JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. "A lot of the rally that's occurred since the election has been predicated on the 10-year Treasury yield rising and a steepening yield curve. Over the past few months, we've flattened," said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut."The banks in general still have the post-election gain, but the catalyst behind that seems to be reversing, so that could be a risk here." At 2:53 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 48.86 points, or 0.24 percent, to 20,704.96, the S&P 500 .SPX had gained 6.7 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,362.24 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC had added 14.51 points, or 0.25 percent, to 5,892.32. Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday.Geopolitical tensions added to investor unease. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons were a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that "a response is likely" if they pose a danger.Traders attributed a stock dip around noon to unverified rumors stemming from weekend news related to North Korea. A U.S. official told Reuters over the weekend that a U.S. Navy strike group will be moving toward the western Pacific Ocean near the Korean peninsula as a show of force, as concerns grow about North Korea's advancing weapons program.Straight Path Communications (STRP.A) surged nearly two-fold to $89.71 after AT&T (T.N) offered a huge premium to buy the owner of wireless spectrum licenses. Swift Transportation (SWFT.N) jumped 23.6 percent to $24.73 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation (KNX.N). Knight's shares were up 13.8 percent.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.62-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 66 new highs and 34 new lows.

The S&P energy index, up 1.1 percent, was the best-performing S&P 500 sector in late-day trading, following gains in oil prices. Investors prepared for the start of quarterly profit reports, with earnings of S&P 500 companies estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year. The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters data. JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the US banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. However, bank stocks have retreated of late as investors question lofty valuations and Trump's ability to swiftly introduce simpler regulations and other policies following the failure of a healthcare reform bill. The S&P 500 financial sector was off 0.56 percent, dragged down by Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. "A lot of the rally that's occurred since the election has been predicated on the 10-year Treasury yield rising and a steepening yield curve. Over the past few months, we've flattened," said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.  "The banks in general still have the post-election gain, but the catalyst behind that seems to be reversing, so that could be a risk here." At 2:53 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 48.86 points, or 0.24 percent, to 20,704.96, the S&P 500 had gained 6.7 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,362.24 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 14.51 points, or 0.25 percent, to 5,892.32. Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Geopolitical tensions added to investor unease. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons were a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that "a response is likely" if they pose a danger. Traders attributed a stock dip around noon to unverified rumors stemming from weekend news related to North Korea. A US official told Reuters over the weekend that a US Navy strike group will be moving toward the western Pacific Ocean near the Korean peninsula as a show of force, as concerns grow about North Korea's advancing weapons program. Straight Path Communications surged nearly two-fold to $89.71 after AT&T offered a huge premium to buy the owner of wireless spectrum licenses. Swift Transportation jumped 23.6 percent to $24.73 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation. Knight's shares were up 13.8 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.62-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 66 new highs and 34 new lows.     Copyright Reuters, 2017  Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Mail Print the author Shoaib Ur Rehman Siddiqui Previous Dollar down as investors wary of geopolitical risk; await consumer data Next CBOT wheat futures settle up on technical buying, short covering Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Financials, which was the best-performing sector after the election, is the worst-performing sector over the last month. Traders are expecting even more volatility for the space as bank earnings begin to roll out later this week. Nearly half of the XLF, the financials ETF, will be reporting earnings before April options expiration on Friday, April 21 — with Citigroup, JPMorgan, PNC and Wells Fargo kicking off the reports before the bell on Thursday. The options market is implying a nearly 3 percent move in either direction for Citigroup, while JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are both expected to move about 2.25 percent, and PNC has an implied move of 2 percent. "Year to date, the S&P is up about 5 percent, and the XLF is only up about 2 percent. [It's showing] very poor relative performance," Dan Nathan, of RiskReversal.com, said Friday on CNBC's "Options Action." To play for a move lower, Nathan suggested buying the XLF April 23.5 put for 27 cents. This is a bearish bet that the XLF will fall below $23.23 by April expiration. "This looks like a dollar cheap way to make a near-term bearish bet ... I think there's a good chance that between now and April 21, you're going to have a 1 percent down day," Nathan added. From a chart perspective, Carter Worth of Cornerstone Macro agreed that the run in the financials may be out of steam. "[The] financials outperformance peaked in December. It doesn't look like it's going to get any better [for the financials] ... it's just a bad place to be," he said Friday on "Options Action." The XLF was trading in the $23.53 range on Monday.

Morgan earnings: Expect strong trading results, talk of regulations and tax reform By Ciara Linnane Published: Apr 10, 2017 4:18 p.m. ET Share Analysts are expecting higher interest rates and improving capital markets activity to boost numbers Reuters J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon By CiaraLinnane Corporate news editor The biggest bank in the U.S., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., will kick off the first-quarter earnings season on Thursday and investors are expecting a bounce in trading results after a weak 2016. “The year-over-year rebound in capital markets activity, net interest margins and asset prices are benefiting the big-5 banks, insurers and asset management companies,” RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a Monday note. J.P. Morgan JPM, -0.35%  Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has said his bank has benefited in fixed-income trading from the exit from that business by many European banks that are struggling with new capital requirements that have made some businesses unprofitable. Fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading all rebounded in 2016 after a long period of weakness that led many to cut staff on trading desks. The big U.S. banks were key gainers immediately after the surprise election of President Donald Trump in November, partly fueled by expectations his administration will roll back some of the rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis to avoid a repeat. But bank stock gains have been pared in recent months as those same expectations have been scaled back. The pullback “is solely a function of policy uncertainty out of Washington, with market participants tempering expectations for tax and regulatory reform in the wake of the health care standoff,” said Sheraz Mian, research director at Zacks. “This reaction likely makes sense. But we do want to point out that the overall backdrop for this industry remains very favorable, particularly given the Fed’s monetary policy stance.” Why the bank of the future will look like an Apple store(1:31) As e-banking technology has improved, the number of bank branches is expected to fall by a third in the next decade. But rather than get rid of branches altogether, banks are trying to give them makeovers to get customers to still come in. In his annual shareholder letter published last week, Dimon called for simpler and better-coordinated rules that would encourage lending and promote growth. Dimon said it would be unwise “to throw out the entirety of Dodd-Frank or other rules” but said it would be “appropriate to open up the rulebook.” Dimon is a member of Trump’s business council of 16 top executives.

He also argued against the “gold plating” of international standards, referring to the stricter rules demanded of U.S. banks compared with their international peers, which he said would free up more capital for lending without damaging the safety of the system.

And analysts are expected to seek commentary on other Trump agenda items, including corporate tax reform, as well as the geopolitical outlook following last week’s missile strike on a Syrian air base.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks ended a choppy session slightly higher on Monday as gains in energy shares offset losses in financials ahead of quarterly corporate earnings later this week. Geopolitical tensions added to the choppiness. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons were a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that "a response is likely" if they pose a danger. With trading slow at the beginning of a holiday-shortened week, volume was the lightest of the year so far. The S&P energy index , up 0.8 percent, was the day's best-performing S&P 500 sector, following gains in oil prices. Investors prepared for the start of quarterly profit reports, with earnings of S&P 500 companies estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Energy companies, hit by a selloff in oil prices last year, are expected to show the greatest strength with a 600 percent year-over-year earnings increase. "The key will be oil stocks given how volatile oil has been since the election," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which has about US$50 million in assets under management. The energy index is down 6 percent for the year to date. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.92 points, or 0.01 percent, to 20,658.02, the S&P 500 gained 1.62 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,357.16 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.11 points, or 0.05 percent, to 5,880.93. Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Just 5.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday. The daily average for the past 20 trading days is 6.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. JPMorgan , Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. Bank stocks have retreated recently as investors question lofty valuations and Trump's ability to swiftly introduce simpler regulations and other policies following the failure of a healthcare reform bill. The S&P 500 financial sector was off 0.3 percent. Traders attributed a stock dip around noon to unverified rumors stemming from weekend news related to North Korea. "You've had a lot of geopolitical news that could have driven this market a lot lower, and I think it's a huge relief that the market has held up so well," Dollarhide said. Whole Foods Market was the S&P 500's biggest percentage gainer on the day, rising 10 percent after activist investor Jana Partners LLC disclosed an 8.3 percent stake in the company as it looks to shake up the company's board. Swift Transportation jumped 23.7 percent to US$24.77 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation . Knight's shares were up 13.4 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Morgan earnings: Expect strong trading results, talk of regulations and tax reform By Ciara Linnane Published: Apr 10, 2017 4:18 p.m. ET Share Analysts are expecting higher interest rates and improving capital markets activity to boost numbers Reuters J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon By CiaraLinnane Corporate news editor The biggest bank in the U.S., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., will kick off the first-quarter earnings season on Thursday and investors are expecting a bounce in trading results after a weak 2016. “The year-over-year rebound in capital markets activity, net interest margins and asset prices are benefiting the big-5 banks, insurers and asset management companies,” RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a Monday note. J.P. Morgan JPM, -0.35%  Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has said his bank has benefited in fixed-income trading from the exit from that business by many European banks that are struggling with new capital requirements that have made some businesses unprofitable. Fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading all rebounded in 2016 after a long period of weakness that led many to cut staff on trading desks. The big U.S. banks were key gainers immediately after the surprise election of President Donald Trump in November, partly fueled by expectations his administration will roll back some of the rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis to avoid a repeat. But bank stock gains have been pared in recent months as those same expectations have been scaled back. The pullback “is solely a function of policy uncertainty out of Washington, with market participants tempering expectations for tax and regulatory reform in the wake of the health care standoff,” said Sheraz Mian, research director at Zacks. “This reaction likely makes sense. But we do want to point out that the overall backdrop for this industry remains very favorable, particularly given the Fed’s monetary policy stance.” Why the bank of the future will look like an Apple store(1:31) As e-banking technology has improved, the number of bank branches is expected to fall by a third in the next decade. But rather than get rid of branches altogether, banks are trying to give them makeovers to get customers to still come in. In his annual shareholder letter published last week, Dimon called for simpler and better-coordinated rules that would encourage lending and promote growth. Dimon said it would be unwise “to throw out the entirety of Dodd-Frank or other rules” but said it would be “appropriate to open up the rulebook.” Dimon is a member of Trump’s business council of 16 top executives. Read: White House’s Cohn backs return to Glass-Steagall law: report Essentially, “too big to fail has been solved,” he wrote, “taxpayers will not pay if a bank fails.” He argued for a winding back of capital constraints that he said are tying up money that could support billions of dollars in loans. He also argued against the “gold plating” of international standards, referring to the stricter rules demanded of U.S. banks compared with their international peers, which he said would free up more capital for lending without damaging the safety of the system.

And analysts are expected to seek commentary on other Trump agenda items, including corporate tax reform, as well as the geopolitical outlook following last week’s missile strike on a Syrian air base.

Geopolitical tensions added to the choppiness. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons were a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that "a response is likely" if they pose a danger. With trading slow at the beginning of a holiday-shortened week, volume was the lightest of the year so far. The S&P energy index .SPNY, up 0.8 percent, was the day's best-performing S&P 500 sector, following gains in oil prices. Investors prepared for the start of quarterly profit reports, with earnings of S&P 500 companies estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Energy companies, hit by a selloff in oil prices last year, are expected to show the greatest strength with a 600 percent year-over-year earnings increase. "The key will be oil stocks given how volatile oil has been since the election," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which has about $50 million in assets under management. The energy index is down 6 percent for the year to date. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 1.92 points, or 0.01 percent, to 20,658.02, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.62 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,357.16 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 3.11 points, or 0.05 percent, to 5,880.93. Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Just 5.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday. The daily average for the past 20 trading days is 6.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. JPMorgan (JPM.N), Citigroup (C.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. Bank stocks have retreated recently as investors question lofty valuations and Trump's ability to swiftly introduce simpler regulations and other policies following the failure of a healthcare reform bill. The S&P 500 financial sector .SPSY was off 0.3 percent. Traders attributed a stock dip around noon to unverified rumours stemming from weekend news related to North Korea. "You've had a lot of geopolitical news that could have driven this market a lot lower, and I think it's a huge relief that the market has held up so well," Dollarhide said. Whole Foods Market (WFM.O) was the S&P 500's biggest percentage gainer on the day, rising 10 percent after activist investor Jana Partners LLC disclosed an 8.3 percent stake in the company as it looks to shake up the company's board. Swift Transportation (SWFT.N) jumped 23.7 percent to $24.77 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation (KNX.N). Knight's shares were up 13.4 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 68 new highs and 38 new lows.

Anoop Singh For years, Wall Street has complained that restrictions placed on industry—on capital, leverage and stress testing, especially on the largest financial institutions—after the financial crisis were too costly. Photo: Bloomberg Despite the failure of the Donald Trump administration to repeal Obamacare (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act), financial markets and corporate America are waiting for the economic agenda. Corporate tax reform is high on this agenda, and so is the rollback of financial regulation. President Trump has signed an executive order to “do a number” on Dodd-Frank, the 2010 landmark law on US financial regulation that implemented many of the reforms proposed by Basel III. What is at stake, and what are the global implications of such a rollback in the US? The context is clear. For years, Wall Street has complained that restrictions placed on industry—on capital, leverage and stress testing, especially on the largest financial institutions—after the financial crisis were too costly. Globally, the G-20 has also recognized concerns about excessive regulation, and the Financial Stability Board has been asked to assess and address their “unintended consequences”. Even Daniel Tarullo of the US Federal Reserve, the lead American regulator, agrees that it is time for a “healthy debate” on the regulatory system—cautioning, however, against any weakening that would shift risk back to taxpayers. While the US debate is well under way, it is worth noting that the US economy is now booming, and the financial industry has helped move it to full employment and rising inflation. Despite the restrictions, the relative strength of US banks—with higher capital, liquidity, and risk management positions—has allowed them to expand their lending to a pace similar to that in pre-crisis years. As for the largest banks—a key focus of regulatory reform—JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo now hold significantly higher assets compared with 2008, and their heads are not consistently pushing for change. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has said, “We’re not asking for wholesale throwing out of Dodd-Frank,” and this sentiment has been echoed by others, who appear to have adjusted to the new regime. This helps, because it will be politically difficult to roll back legislated components of Dodd-Frank. It is composed of hundreds of regulations in thousands of pages, issued by multiple agencies, and its reworking will require the approval of several federal agencies. More likely will be administrative refinements to simplify the framework that can be worked out by new regulators, rather than by new legislation. Let’s look at where the debate is currently. Among the most controversial components has been the Volcker Rule that aims to prevent large, federally insured banks from speculative financial bets. Will this be reversed? On this, even treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin recently told the Senate banking committee: “I support the Volcker Rule, but there needs to be proper definition around the Volcker Rule so banks can understand what they can do and what they can’t do.” Making it easier to distinguish between speculative activities (“proprietary trading”), which the rule intends to limit, and other types of “market-making” activities in which banks trade for clients, is likely to be the prime focus of change. The debate also focuses on the size thresholds established for various regulations, such as the Volcker Rule. Arguably, Dodd-Frank should limit its application to the large financial institutions—its primary concern—and remove its restrictions on the smaller banks—especially the community banks—that don’t raise similar systemic risks. Hence, the emerging opinion is to raise the threshold for enhanced prudential standards well above its current level of $50 billion in assets, to $250 billion—the level above which institutions face annual stress tests. There is equal political resistance to the measures adopted for the “too big to fail” financial institutions, which seek to follow Basel III standards for handling their failure. Among these, Dodd-Frank seeks to eliminate bailouts, through its Titles I and II, and transform the bankruptcy framework from courts to regulators—on the grounds that the large, complex financial firms raise global instability issues beyond the reach of the traditional courts. In particular, political pressure now focuses on the Congress repealing Title II, which created the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA), with the power to unwind a systemically important firm, and give emergency credit, during a financial emergency. Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke has argued that repealing Title II would be a major mistake as it would again raise the risks of overall financial instability with global implications. Regarding federal financial agencies established by Dodd-Frank, the debate goes well beyond the OLA to include restructuring or abolish others. Among these is the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), composed of financial regulators, and responsible for deciding which company is treated as a “systemically important” (or “too big to fail”) financial institution. Similarly, there is widespread resistance to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has developed hundreds of new rules for mortgage lenders, banks, and other financial institutions to protect the consumer. How the US adjusts its regulatory regime through staffing changes, executive action and legislation will have global implications for Basel III standards and international financial cooperation. While US banks are much stronger now, after building the quantity and quality of capital, European banks are not there yet. Significantly altering the trade-off between regulation and risk could change the global playing field for financial competition before the recovery from the financial crisis is complete.

ET Bank ETFs: Can Earnings Brighten A Dim 2017? By Johanna Bennett So far 2017 hasn’t been a great year for bank stocks. As we head into a the start of the first quarter earnings season — kicking off this week with Citigroup (C) and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) posting results on Thursday — the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) and the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) are down 4.5% and 3.5% respectively since the start of the year. J.P. Morgan analyst Vivek Juneja weighed in on the big-cap names in a note published today, that addresses worries about C&A loan growth, namely concerns about a possible slowdown. Juneja notes that C&I loans have been hurt by a drop in M&A activity, and noted worries that the slowdown in C&I loans indicates economic weakening. There is concern whether the C&I loan slowdown is an indication of economic weakening or potential recession, as a delayed reaction to banks tightening lending standards per the Fed loan officer survey a year ago. What we learned from the banks is that they had only tightened in a couple of areas in the last 12-24 months, which was energy and leveraged lending. There is no other sector where lending standards were tightened, so that should not lead to a recession. And we are not seeing any other macro indicators that are suggesting an imminent recession. If a recession is imminent, the Fed would not have raised rates in March. There is optimism about the outlook, but companies have not been willing to step up and invest in capex yet – everyone is waiting. Offsetting these headwinds, banks will likely see upside to net interest margin (NIM) driven by both recent and potential rate hikes. Looking at small- and mid-cap banks, J.P. Morgan analyst Steven Alexopoulos sees net interest margins reaching an inflection point and a credit cycle ripe for a turn. …2016 was another fairly strong year for industry balance sheet growth. Loan balances increased at ~10% annual pace and deposit growth remained strong. However, growth continued to be partially offset by further declines in NIM, although the pace of compression decelerated on the back of the 2015 rate hike, and now with the December 2016 and March 2017 hikes we are likely to see a positive inflection point in NIMs while at the same time efficiency ratios have been showing gradual improvements. On the credit front, we had another year of “low for long” as trends have continued below historical norms, but we think banks are increasingly vulnerable to see credit costs normalize from here given where we are in the economic cycle. Putting the pieces together, the industry ROTE remained in the 11-12% range for the year and we see upside from here, particularly with our view that deposit betas are expected to remain low. On the M&A front, while the number of deals came in lighter than in 2015, the average deal size and average assets acquired increased notably. banks, SPDR S&P Bank ETF, SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF « Previous ETF Flyers: Pharmaceuticals Next » Do ETFs Own More GM and Ford or Tesla?

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad US STOCKS-Wall St in the red as banks slip ahead of earnings By Reuters Published: 12:42 EDT, 10 April 2017 | Updated: 12:42 EDT, 10 April 2017 e-mail By Yashaswini Swamynathan April 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks reversed course to trade lower on Monday as losses in financial stocks, ahead of quarterly earnings later this week, offset a boost from energy shares. JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. However, bank stocks have retreated of late as investors question lofty valuations and Trump's ability to swiftly introduce simpler regulations and other policies following the failure of a healthcare reform bill. The S&amp;P 500 financial sector was off 0.56 percent, dragged down by Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. "The financial sector has been a darling performer since the election and we've seen some of that performance retreat in the last couple of weeks," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. "So, what the banks report and what their guidance is will be the primary driver for equity prices over the next week or two." Earnings of S&amp;P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year. The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Geopolitical tensions added to investor unease. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons were a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that "a response is likely" if they pose a danger. At 12:12 p.m. ET (1612 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 33.22 points, or 0.16 percent, at 20,622.88, the S&amp;P 500 was down 2.98 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,352.56. The Nasdaq Composite was down 7.95 points, or 0.14 percent, at 5,869.86. Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Four of the 11 major S&amp;P sectors were higher, with energy leading with a 0.94 percent gain, supported by higher oil prices. Technology was off 0.13 percent, led by declines in Intel and Nvidia. Shares of Amazon.com was the top stock on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq, rising 1.2 percent to $905.92. The world's largest online retailer was upgraded to "buy" at Needham, according to a trader. Straight Path Communications surged nearly two-fold to $89.71 after AT&amp;T offered a huge premium to buy the owner of wireless spectrum licenses. Swift Transportation jumped 21.7 percent to $24.36 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation. Knight's shares were up 12 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,665 to 1,141. On the Nasdaq, 1,433 issues fell and 1,281 advanced. The S&amp;P 500 index showed seven 52-week highs and two lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 55 highs and 25 lows.

Beacon Rail has since expanded, winning deals to finance new rolling stock for UK operators and acquiring Ascendos Rail Leasing last year.  Its portfolio now includes EMD Class 66/77, Vossloh/Stadler Euro 4000 and Class 68 UKLight and Siemens Eurorunner diesel locomotives, Stadler Class 88 UKDual electro-diesel locos, Bombardier Traxx and ASEA RC3 electric locos, Stadler Flirt and ex-British Rail Class 313 EMUs and Alstom Lint DMUs, as well as CAF Mark 5a coaches under construction for the UK.

Continue Reading Below Geopolitical tensions added to the choppiness. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons were a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that "a response is likely" if they pose a danger. More from FOXBusiness.com Dick Bove: Stay away from bank stocks until October Tax reform will take strong presidential leadership: Sen. Jerry Moran White House to FBN: Trump has not 'scrapped' his tax plan With trading slow at the beginning of a holiday-shortened week, volume was the lightest of the year so far. The S&P energy index, up 0.8 percent, was the day's best-performing S&P 500 sector, following gains in oil prices. Investors prepared for the start of quarterly profit reports, with earnings of S&P 500 companies estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year. Energy companies, which dragged down results during the recent U.S. earnings recession, are expected to do most of the heavy lifting this profit period with a whopping 600 percent year-over-year increase. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT "I think the key will be oil stocks given how volatile oil has been since the election," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which has about $50 million in assets under management. The energy index is down 6 percent for the year to date. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.92 points, or 0.01 percent, to 20,658.02, the S&P 500 gained 1.62 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,357.16 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.11 points, or 0.05 percent, to 5,880.93. Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. Bank stocks have retreated of late as investors question lofty valuations and Trump's ability to swiftly introduce simpler regulations and other policies following the failure of a healthcare reform bill. The S&P 500 financial sector was off 0.3 percent. Traders attributed a stock dip around noon to unverified rumors stemming from weekend news related to North Korea. "You've had a lot of geopolitical news that could have driven this market a lot lower, and I think it's a huge relief that the market has held up so well," Dollarhide said. Whole Foods Market was the S&P 500's biggest percentage gainer on the day, rising 10 percent after activist investor Jana Partners LLC disclosed an 8.3 percent stake in the company as it looks to shake up the company's board. Straight Path Communications surged 151 percent to $91.64 after AT&T offered a huge premium to buy the owner of wireless spectrum licenses. Swift Transportation jumped 23.7 percent to $24.77 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation. Knight's shares were up 13.4 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 68 new highs and 38 new lows.  (Additional reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by James Dalgleish and Chizu Nomiyama) What do you think?

JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Thursday and could throw light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump.

"Unless there is a significant headline to derail what looks to be a quiet morning, I think the focus is going to be on earnings and what the companies say."

Shares of Straight Path Communications surged more than two-fold to $91.75 after AT&T offered a huge premium for the owner of wireless spectrum licenses.

JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Thursday and could throw light on the U.S. banking industry's performance after a strong finish in the fourth quarter. Investors are keenly watching the quarterly results to justify lofty market valuations following a post-election rally, sparked off by bets that President Donald Trump would introduce pro-growth policies. Earnings of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year, the most since the fourth-quarter of 2014. The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "It looks like the start of a quiet holiday week after an underwhelming Friday, where much could have happened but didn't," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. "Unless there is a significant headline to derail what looks to be a quiet morning, I think the focus is going to be on earnings and what the companies say." Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Dow e-minis were up 12 points, or 0.06 percent, at 8:27 a.m. ET (1227 GMT), with 19,034 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were up 2.5 points, or 0.11 percent, with 124,848 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 3.5 points, or 0.06 percent, on volume of 19,954 contracts. Oil prices rose more than 1 percent on Monday, with Brent crude moving above $55 per barrel following a shutdown at Libya's largest oilfield and tension over Syria after a U.S. missile strike. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak in Michigan after markets close. Investors will be looking to clues on the central bank's plans to trim its $4.5 trillion balance sheet after recent comments from Fed officials. Shares of Straight Path Communications surged more than two-fold to $92.99 premarket after AT&T said it would buy the company for $95.63 per share in an all-stock deal. Swift Transportation rose 14.4 percent to $22.90 after it announced a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation. Knight's shares were up 2.6 percent. Generic drugmaker Akorn was up 11 percent at $32.99 after confirming that it was in talks to be bought by German healthcare group Fresenius.

Chase’s support helps ensure that Carry The Load, started in 2011, can commit to providing active, meaningful ways to honor and celebrate the sacrifices made by our nation’s heroes. As part of its Awareness Program, Carry The Load hosts its annual National Relay throughout the month of May to honor the sacrifices made by our nation’s heroes. Funds are raised throughout May for Carry The Load’s Continuum of Care Program which provides direct services to military, law enforcement, fire and rescue personnel, and their families through our partnerships with other nonprofits across the country. „Six years ago, we set out to restore the true meaning of Memorial Day – a holiday deserving of our nation’s attention, affection and respect,” said Stephen Holley, president and CEO of Carry The Load. „We’ve since broadened our mission to include more than just our military heroes and more than just one holiday. We are proud that Chase continues to help us, and America, celebrate, honor and remember those who sacrifice for us daily.” The 31-day relay will span more than 6,000 total miles and is comprised of a 2,100-mile East Coast route from West Point, NY to Dallas and a 4,100-mile West Coast route from Seattle to Dallas. The two routes converge in Dallas on Memorial Day for a more than 20-hour and 17-minute Memorial March. Registration information and event details can be found at carrytheload.org. „It’s our honor and privilege to support Carry The Load again this year and the important message that we must remember our service members and first responders who gave the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of us all,” said JPMorgan Chase Head of Military and Veterans Affairs Ross A. Brown. From April 28 to May 28, the relay will progress 24 hours a day, with rallies taking place in various cities and towns along the route. Chase will host rallies in Seattle, New York City, Wilmington, Del., Phoenix, Columbus, Ohio, Tampa, Fla. and Jacksonville, Fla. where thousands of employees and volunteers in the communities will walk and gather to remember those who have lost their lives. Chase’s support of Carry The Load reflects the firm’s ongoing commitment to the veteran and military communities. Since 2011, the firm has hired more than 11,000 veterans and developed programs aimed at retaining and supporting veterans throughout their post-service careers. These efforts include leading the Veteran Jobs Mission – previously the 100,000 Jobs Mission – a coalition founded in 2011 by JPMorgan Chase and 10 other companies with the goal of hiring 100,000 veterans. Now more than 235 members strong, the coalition has collectively hired more than 380,000 veterans, and is ultimately committed to hiring 1 million.

Both chief executives are part of a group of business leaders that advise President Donald Trump. Fink was concerned over the pace of changes so far under the new administration after the Republicans, which control both houses of Congress, failed to replace the last administration’s health-care plan, “Obamacare” with a new health-care plan “Trumpcare.” He told CNBC that the US economy is slowing as both consumers and businesses wait to see if the new administration can deliver on tax reform and deregulation following the failure of the health-care bill in March. Share this story US President Donald Trump. AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File In January and February, US real personal spending had monthly declines, the first time there have been consecutive monthly declines since the recession year of 2009. Another decline is likely in March as light vehicle sales fell by 5.5 percent from February, while March non-farm payrolls only grew by 98000 compared with a consensus forecast of 180000 after a 219000 gain in February. “There’s a greater worry that these proposed changes are going to be harder and harder to execute,” said Fink, speaking on CNBC last week. "You’re seeing a slowing down of our economy.” Fink said the US is probably the slowest-growing economy in the first quarter among the major G-7 developed economies. Read also: Winners and losers in Trump's first budget plan Japan, Canada and Europe are expanding faster than anticipated six months ago while the US is lagging expectations. Without tax reform and deregulation, he said, the markets will suffer setbacks. The US equity markets have rallied to record highs on hopes that the Trump legislative agenda of lower corporate taxes, less red tape and a pro-business bias would lead to stronger growth and “Make America Great Again.” Fink, the head of the world’s largest asset manager, said the most crowded trade right now is that rates are going to move much higher due to higher inflation. Instead, he said, there’s a 51 percent chance that 10-year Treasuries drop below 2 percent. US inflation has risen to 2.7 percent year-on-year (y/y) in February from only 0.8 percent y/y in July. The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December and March, yet the US-10-year Treasury yield has traded in a band between 2.62 percent and 2.30 percent since mid-December after trading at only 1.81 percent on Election Day, November 8, 2016. On Friday, April 7, the yield closed at 2.38 percent.  BUSINESS REPORT Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 Mbeki warns ANC MPs 2 Hijackers killed in 'Fast and Furious' chase with cops 3 Msimanga to sell official mayoral mansion 4 WATCH: Outcry after passenger dragged off overbooked flight 5 Cops evict villagers to make way for Zimbabwe's First Lady Advertisement X BUSINESS REPORT About us Contact us Feedback Follow us on INSIDE BUSINESS REPORT Companies Economy Energy Markets Entrepreneurs Technology Careers International Opinion Financial tools EXPLORE IOL News Politics Business Report Personal Finance Sport Entertainment Lifestyle Motoring Travel BUSINESS REPORT WEEKLY Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 April 2017 by Military News World Week Ahead: US earnings season Monday, 10 April 2017, 11:27 am Article: BusinessDesk Monday 10 April 2017 08:18 AM World Week Ahead: US earnings season By Margreet Dietz April 10 (BusinessDesk) – In a week shortened to four days by Good Friday, investors will look to the pending US earnings season as a reality check on valuations. Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo are among US companies scheduled to report their latest quarterly results in the coming days. The financial sector is projected to post a 15.4 percent profit gain, second only to energy among S&P sectors, according to Reuters. Last Friday Wall Street’s three benchmarks closed marginally weaker, each down less than 0.1 percent, after the US launched a cruise-missile strike on Syria and a report showing American employers added fewer jobs than expected in March. The Labor Department report showed payrolls climbed by 98,000 in March, after a downwardly-revised 219,000 increase in February. Even so, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.5 percent, the lowest since May 2007, while hourly wages rose at a 2.7 percent year-over-year pace. Analysts remained optimistic about the US economy, attributing March’s headline miss to poor weather. “Aside from the payroll data, all the other underlying details are encouraging,” Tom Simons, an economist at Jefferies in New York, told Bloomberg. “People are re-entering the labour force and it looks like they’re getting jobs right away. The participation rate being steady is encouraging there.” This week the latest US economic data will arrive in the form of reports on the labour market conditions index, due today; the NFIB small business optimism index and JOLTS, or the Job Openings and Labour Turnover Survey, due Tuesday; import and export prices, Atlanta Fed business inflation expectations, due Wednesday; weekly jobless claims, producer price index, and consumer sentiment, due Thursday; as well as the consumer price index, retail sales, and business inventories, due Friday. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is set to speak in Ann Arbor, Michigan, today, while Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari will speak on Tuesday. Both will be closely watched for clues on the pace of rate increases as well as plans to reduce the central bank’s balance sheet. Wall Street’s top banks see the Fed laying out by year end its plan to scale back reinvestments in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, according to a Reuters poll. Five of 15 primary dealers, or banks that do business directly with the Fed, expected it to start paring reinvestments by year end, while the rest forecast the central bank would do so by the end of the second quarter of 2018, Reuters reported. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.3 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.6 percent. “While investors may be struggling to find reasons to get into the market, they also realise the reasons to sell are limited,” strategists at Voya Investment Management said in a note Friday, Bloomberg reported. Financial markets will be closed on Friday. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index closed 0.1 percent higher on Friday. One unknown as the week begins is a potential fresh geopolitical flashpoint. The US Navy is moving a strike group, including an aircraft carrier, toward the Korean peninsula as a show of force, according to a Reuters report.

Baer, The San Gabriel Valley Tribune Posted: 04/10/17, 2:42 PM PDT | Updated: 33 secs ago # Comments Former four-time world champion boxer Juan Manuel Marquez alleges in a complaint filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court that JP Morgan Chase & Co. was complicit in the theft of $2.3 million in fraudulently obtained tax refunds stolen from Mr. Marquez through “fake accounts” opened at Chase Bank’s Whittier, Calif. branch in the name of Mr. Marquez, without his knowledge or consent. Marquez is pictured during a press conference flanked by his manager Francisco Arce, left, April 10, 2017. (Photo by Leo Jarzomb, SGV Tribune/ SCNG) WHITTIER >> Professional Mexican boxer Juan Manuel Marquez said Monday he felt taken advantage of by a major U.S. bank and a father and son duo he believes stole $2.3 million in tax refunds from him through fraudulent bank accounts set up at the bank’s local branch. The world champion boxer spoke during a press conference at a restaurant located across the street from the Chase Bank, 13103 E. Philadelphia St. Last month, Marquez sued JP Morgan Chase & Co. and Adel Cotton and and his son Heber Cotton, both of Hacienda Heights, in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleging the bank conspired with his former tax preparers to launder tax returns withheld from Marquez’s winnings from fights in the U.S. The civil complaint filed March 24 claims the Cottons, who are currently serving sentences in federal prison in a separate tax fraud scheme, forged a power of attorney from Marquez to open the accounts in which they deposited Marquez’s tax refund checks totaling $2,308,439. The Cottons filed returns for Marquez in 2013, claiming refunds of $898,057 for 2008 and $1,410,382 for 2012, according to the complaint. “This is something he might expect in another country but here in the United States it’s very surprising to him and it’s something that gives him lots of personal preoccupation,” said Marquez’s attorney Alan J. Romero, translating what Marquez told reporters in Spanish. “He put his life on the line for this money.” Romero said the bank failed to comply with federal regulations to prevent the use of its operations for money laundering when it approved opening accounts without Marquez present. “It’s not just a case about theft of funds its a case about identity theft,” he said. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan has declined to comment on the lawsuit. Marquez said he was seeking to file returns for several tax years when he met the Cottons in 2012 or 2013. The father and son were recommended to him by three other boxers who had done business with them. Marquez’s new accountant Noriel Zuazo said Marquez received his returns for the 2009 and 2011 tax years but did not see the return checks for 2008 and 2012. He found out that the returns for those years were stolen in 2015 when Zuazo obtained his tax return records from the Internal Revenue Service, showing the checks had been deposited. “Where the money is now we hope to find out,” Romero said.

Peter Levashov, of St. Petersburg, Russia, hacked into email and bank accounts of thousands of Americans, federal prosecutors said Monday in a statement. They said he also operated under the name Peter Severa, who is among the top 10 of the world’s worst spammers, according to a list maintained by the antispam organization Spamhaus. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up The arrest is part of a crackdown on Russian hackers accused of targeting everything from financial institutions to the U.S. presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies believe that Russia orchestrated computer attacks to meddle with the election last fall, including a break-in to systems operated by the Democratic National Committee. That investigation is underway, and no charges have been filed. Beyond the election hacking, the U.S. government has accused Russia of directing some of the world’s most notorious cyber criminals to break into computer systems in a broad scheme that married illicit profits and intelligence gathering. ‘Embedded’ Agents Last month, four Russians, including two Russian intelligence agents, were indicted in the U.S. over a computer breach affecting a half-billion Yahoo Inc. email accounts. One of them, prosecutors said, was “embedded” at a Russian financial firm identified as Renaissance Capital, controlled by the billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, who also owns the Brooklyn Nets. In December, after months of negotiation, Joshua Aaron, an American living in Russia, returned to the U.S. to face charges related to the largest known cyber attack on Wall Street. The U.S. said that Aaron and two Israelis stole data on 100 million customers of companies including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Fidelity Investments. U.S. prosecutors said Levashov distributed malicious computer software, or malware, generating huge volumes of spam emails to advertise fake drugs, pump-and-dump penny stock schemes, work-at-home scams and other frauds. He linked as many as 100,000 computers around the world into a botnet using malware known as Kelihos, they said. "The ability of botnets like Kelihos to be weaponized quickly for vast and varied types of harms is a dangerous and deep threat to all Americans, driving at the core of how we communicate, network, earn a living and live our everyday lives,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Blanco said in the statement. Severed Link Federal officials said the malware has been in use in various forms since 2010, and that investigators were able to sever the link between the infected botnets and the criminals who were controlling them. A federal judge in Alaska issued a temporary restraining order against Levashov in the case, the officials said. Prosecutors said Levashov was first indicted in Michigan for email and wire fraud more than a decade ago. In 2009, he was again charged in federal court in Washington, D.C., with computer fraud related to his "Storm" botnet, a predecessor of Kelihos, according to the complaint. Alexander Ionov, a human-rights lawyer who is helping Levashov, said his client was arrested in Spain at the reqeust of the U.S., and that the Justice Department hadn’t followed international norms or consulted with Russia on the case.  "By arresting Russians abroad, the U.S. is circumventing all international procedures," Ionov said. "Levashov wasn’t included in Interpol or FBI wanted lists." Prosecutors said the case isn’t related to the alleged hacking of the U.S. election by Russia, contradicting published reports that quote Levashov’s wife. No Lack of Twists, Questions in Trump-Russia Saga: QuickTake Q&A Levashov used stolen passwords and co-opted internet addresses of thousands of victims’ computers to distribute spam to specified distribution lists, the U.S. said. He would also use login credentials harvested by Kelihos to gain unauthorized access to commercial email servers, which he used to send out spam messages that would appear to be sent from victims’ accounts, according to court papers. For example, Levashov would offer to send one million spam messages for "legal" products, such as adult material, mortgages, pills and counterfeit goods for $200, according to the complaint. The price would go up from there, the U.S. said, with spam costing $300 per million messages for recuiting job seekers into fraudulent positions, such as "mules" to launder money. Levashov’s most expensive offerings, at $500 per million, were email phishing attacks and messages that spread so-called ransomare -- spam that holds data hostage until victims pay to have it released, the U.S. said. Spam promoting pump-and-dump penny stocks had an additional cost -- a commission "based on the movement in the stock’s price that occurred as a result of the spam campaign," according to the complaint.

This is the first time Coalition has ranked banks on transaction banking, basing the scores on services provided to clients with annual turnover of over $1.5 billion (1.21 billion pounds). Cash management encompasses services such as direct debits, wire transfers and currency clearing, while trade finance can include items such as letters of credit and trade loans. Coalition regularly releases investment banking league tables and its 2016 rankings, released last month, showed U.S. banks grabbing the top five places. Eric Li, research and analytics director at Coalition, told Reuters that while the investment banking industry typically grabbed more attention, transaction banking had proved to be a more steady source of income for global banks. Also, trade finance, a key element in transaction banking, is picking up after a decline caused by the slowdown in global commerce in recent years, he noted. “This business is a lot more resilient compared to investment banking, you don’t see huge swings by 20-30 percent in terms of top line revenue. It’s a very steady business,” Li said. “As a result … we are increasingly seeing a gradual increase in coverage of this from the media as well as the bank management perspective.” Coalition’s transaction banking list is less U.S. heavy than its investment banking league table – after Citi, U.S. banks JPMorgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo were in second, fourth and ninth place respectively. HSBC was the top placed European bank, tying for second place with JPMorgan, while other top 10 European names were Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered, Societe Generale and Barclays, Coalition said. “In trade finance, most major players are European banks. This is a big divergence from the investment banking industry where you see big dominance by U.S. banks,” Lee added. The data showed Citi increasing its market share in trade finance as well as cash management, and dominant in the Americas. HSBC, on the other hand, was rapidly growing its transaction banking business in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Within transaction banking, the top trade finance banks were Citi, HSBC and BNP Paribas, while Citi, HSBC, JPMorgan and BAML scored highest in cash management. Coalition did not give details on how much banks had earned from the transaction business. The table was based upon the largest transaction banks within 15 leading banks, which included Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, J.P. Morgan, Société Générale, Standard Chartered and Wells Fargo.

Skincare drug manufacturer Amryt Pharma rose by 7.8pc to finish the day with the highest gains. Financial firm IFG rose by 3.1pc, while insurance group FBD advanced by 1.9pc. Irish carrier Ryanair was up 1.3pc. Permanent TSB fell by 0.8pc, hotel group Dalata dropped 0.7pc ,while shares in Bank of Ireland were down by 0.4pc. US stocks were set to gain the most in nearly two weeks late on Monday morning as higher oil prices lifted energy stocks, while investors braced for big banks to kick off the first-quarter earnings season later in the week. JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the US banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of US President Donald Trump. Oil prices rose more than 1pc, with US crude hitting a more than one-month high, supported by a Libyan oilfield shut-down, tension over a US missile strike on Syria and signs that an Opec-led output cut is helping to clear excess supplies. Investors are keenly watching the quarterly earnings to justify lofty market valuations, following the post-election rally sparked off by bets that Trump would introduce pro-growth policies. Earnings of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 10.1pc in the first three months of the year, the most since the fourth-quarter of 2014. "The financial sector has been a darling performer since the election and we've seen some of that performance retreat in the last couple of weeks," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. "So what the banks report and what their guidance is will be the primary driver for equity prices over the next week or two," he added.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 11 April 2017 Votorantim Metais considering IPO, sources say SAO PAULO: Votorantim Metais Holding SA, one of Latin America’s largest producers of base metals, is considering an initial public offering to fund investments and provide parent company Votorantim SA with cash to expand in other core areas, four people with direct knowledge of the transaction said. The Sao Paulo-based company, known as VMH, is seen completing a three-stage IPO preparation plan by September, according to one of the people. Toronto and New York appear to be the favored destinations for a VMH listing, the person said. Talks with investment banks are at an advanced stage, with Bank of America Corp, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co among those said to be vying for underwriting spots, two of the people said. The four people spoke under condition of anonymity because the transaction remains private. They did not detail a tentative structure and timetable for the transaction or give an estimated value for VMH. The IPO would give VMH access to a wide base of investors betting on a long-term recovery in zinc, copper, lead and silver prices, the first person said. Proceeds may come in handy for parent Votorantim, Brazil’s largest diversified industrial group, which is growing in energy, pulp and agribusiness while cutting a 14.7 billion-real (US$4.7bil) debt burden, the people added. Contacted on Sunday, media officials at parent Votorantim, which is controlled by Brazil’s billionaire Ermirio de Moraes family, declined to comment on “market speculation.” Bank of America did not have any immediate comment. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan declined to comment.— Reuters Tags / Keywords: voto Related Stories You May Be Interested Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie You May Be Interested Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie Others Also Read Bargains aplenty at Perfect Livin ’17 expo Malaysian Bar concerned over recent abductions Tottenham's strength in depth key to title charge - Kane Property Related advertisement Latest News CIDB sees construction sector growing 8% to RM170b in 2017 AZRB subsidiary to provide support services to Carigali Hess Battle of billionaires as Son set to clash with Bezos in India Stock on the Move: MUI Rising geopolitical worries weigh on KLCI, key Asian markets Most Viewed in Business Stock on the Move: MUI Oil majors eye Petronas’ stake Trading volume on Bursa at 1 billion shares in first hour Rising geopolitical worries weigh on KLCI, key Asian markets Stock on the Move : Willowglen turns volatile after Monday's limit up move Prasarana to go into debt market again AZRB subsidiary to provide support services to Carigali Hess CIMB Group picks Crespin as chief fintech officer Foreign funds slow down Uthaya Kumar appointed to Bumi Armada board advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Barclays said yesterday the investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority relates to an attempt last year by Mr Staley to identify the author of letters that were treated by Barclays as a whistleblowing incident. Barclays said it has formally reprimanded Mr Staley and will “very significantly” cut his bonus. But the bank said he continued to have the “unanimous confidence” of the board and it will support his reappointment at the annual shareholder meeting on May 10. Mr Staley, the former head of JP Morgan’s investment bank, became Barclays chief executive in December 2015. The investigation relates to anonymous letters sent in June 2016 to members of the board and a senior executive that raised concerns about a senior employee who had been recruited by Barclays earlier that year, the bank said. Barclays did not name the employee, but a source said the letters were about Tim Main, who Mr Staley worked with at JP Morgan. Mr Main was hired in June 2016 as chairman of Barclays’ financial institutions group, based in New York. Mr Main declined to comment through a Barclays spokeswoman. “Amongst other issues, the letters raised concerns of a personal nature about the senior employee, Mr Staley’s knowledge of and role in dealing with those issues at a previous employer, and the appropriateness of the recruitment process followed on this occasion by Barclays,” Barclays said in its statement. After being given a copy of the first letter and made aware of the second, Mr Staley asked the bank’s group information security (GIS) team attempt to identify the author or authors of the letters. “Mr Staley considered that the letters were an unfair personal attack on the senior employee,” the bank said. Mr Staley was told it was not appropriate to try to identify the author or authors. But in July 2016 he asked if the issue had been cleared. Following this, he had an “honestly held, but mistaken, belief was that he had clearance to identify the author of one of the letters”, the bank said. GIS asked for assistance from a US law enforcement agency in identifying the author, but it was unsuccessful and no further steps were taken to do so after that. Mr Staley apologised to staff in an email yesterday. READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS barclays, uk, finance © Irish Examiner Ltd.

Coalition regularly releases investment banking league tables and its 2016 rankings, released last month, showed U.S. banks grabbing the top five places.Eric Li, research and analytics director at Coalition, told Reuters that while the investment banking industry typically grabbed more attention, transaction banking had proved to be a more steady source of income for global banks. Also, trade finance, a key element in transaction banking, is picking up after a decline caused by the slowdown in global commerce in recent years, he noted. "This business is a lot more resilient compared to investment banking, you don't see huge swings by 20-30 percent in terms of top line revenue. It's a very steady business," Li said. "As a result ... we are increasingly seeing a gradual increase in coverage of this from the media as well as the bank management perspective." Coalition's transaction banking list is less U.S. heavy than its investment banking league table - after Citi, U.S. banks JPMorgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo were in second, fourth and ninth place respectively. HSBC was the top placed European bank, tying for second place with JPMorgan, while other top 10 European names were Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered, Societe Generale and Barclays, Coalition said."In trade finance, most major players are European banks. This is a big divergence from the investment banking industry where you see big dominance by U.S. banks," Lee added. The data showed Citi increasing its market share in trade finance as well as cash management, and dominant in the Americas. HSBC, on the other hand, was rapidly growing its transaction banking business in EMEA and Asia-Pacific.Within transaction banking, the top trade finance banks were Citi, HSBC and BNP Paribas, while Citi, HSBC, JPMorgan and BAML scored highest in cash management. Coalition did not give details on how much banks had earned from the transaction business.The table was based upon the largest transaction banks within 15 leading banks, which included Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, J.P. Morgan, Société Générale, Standard Chartered and Wells Fargo.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Tuesday April 11, 2017 News National Larger / SmallerNight Mode Property investors cool as crackdown takes effect Eryk Bagshaw 11 Apr 2017, 3:47 p.m. Investors are being shut out of the market with value of home loans written falling by 6 per cent. Investors are cooling on the Australian property market, with home loans falling sharply as Treasurer Scott Morrison encourages a crackdown on investor loans. But in a sign that more room is not being made for first home buyers, the proportion of total loans to those at the centre of the Turnbull government's housing affordability package also fell in February. The figures, released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Monday, show that while the total value of investment housing commitments rose by $92 million in February, the seasonally adjusted total value fell 5.9 per cent. The big four banks look to have pre-empted the latest warning from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to tighten their loans to investors. The February figures predate Mr Morrison's concerns about a "sharp increase in the level of investor credit", amid revelations that foreign buyers were spending $8 billion a year on new homes in NSW and Victoria, locking out owner-occupiers and first home buyers. Loans to first home buyers as a proportion of total lending fell 0.1 per cent in February. In January, investor loans passed 50 per cent of all loans for the first time since 2015 after strong action by APRA targeted at potential landlords and negative gearers waned. The 50 per cent peak pushed the authority to write to all banks in March stating it expected them to tighten lending practices on interest-only and investor loans. "Our objective with these new measures is to ensure lenders are recognising the heightened risk in the lending environment, and that their lending standards and practices appropriately respond to these conditions," said APRA chairman Wayne Byres. JPMorgan economist Tom Kennedy said he now expected a further pullback on investor loans would have a cooling effect on the market. "Given the extent to which housing transaction volumes have been tethered to investor lending flows, further contractions in the latter should take some of the oxygen out of housing activity," he said. On Monday, Mr Morrison continued to float housing affordability ideas before the May budget, ruling out changes to negative gearing but indicating policies to minimise empty houses were being discussed. He said encouraging elderly Australians to downsize their homes was a "reasonable issue to address", while allowing first home buyers to raid their superannuation to fund a deposit, and further tightening regulations on foreign investors were also being deliberated. "People owning their own home is a good thing for the economy, and we need to do as much as we can to achieve this," he said. The government has also not ruled out making changes to the capital gains tax concession. New research by the left-leaning Australia Institute to be released on Tuesday shows seats held by the Treasurer, Prime Minister and Assistant Treasurer gain the most benefit from the capital gains tax discount. Those that get the least benefit from the CGT discount are Nationals electorates. The average Nationals electorate gets $4000 a taxpayer while Liberal Party electorates on average get 2?? times that, averaging $10,000 a taxpayer. According to the Australia Institute, Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison's electorates get more than $30,000 a taxpayer. "This tax break is being enjoyed by the wealthiest, and at increasing rates," said the institute's senior economist, Matt Grudnoff. "Far less benefit flows to those living in rural and outer suburban areas. Further housing figures from CoreLogic-Moody's Analytics Australian Home Value Index Forecast released on Monday predicted detached-housing prices would rise a further 5.6 per cent this year. "[But] regulatory tightening will encourage a slowdown in market activity this year and next," the ratings agency found. CoreLogic-Moody's predicted prices would slide in 2018 and would not rise again until 2021.

Marquez is pictured during a press conference flanked by his manager Francisco Arce, left, April 10, 2017. (Photo by Leo Jarzomb, SGV Tribune/ SCNG) By Stephanie K. Baer, The San Gabriel Valley Tribune Posted: 04/10/17, 2:42 PM PDT | Updated: 12 mins ago # Comments WHITTIER >> Professional Mexican boxer Juan Manuel Marquez said Monday he felt taken advantage of by a major U.S. bank and a father and son duo he believes stole $2.3 million in tax refunds from him through fraudulent bank accounts set up at the bank’s local branch. The world champion boxer spoke during a press conference at a restaurant located across the street from the Chase Bank, 13103 E. Philadelphia St. Last month, Marquez sued JP Morgan Chase & Co. and Adel Cotton and and his son Heber Cotton, both of Hacienda Heights, in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleging the bank conspired with his former tax preparers to launder tax returns withheld from Marquez’s winnings from fights in the U.S. The civil complaint filed March 24 claims the Cottons, who are currently serving sentences in federal prison in a separate tax fraud scheme, forged a power of attorney from Marquez to open the accounts in which they deposited Marquez’s tax refund checks totaling $2,308,439. The Cottons filed returns for Marquez in 2013, claiming refunds of $898,057 for 2008 and $1,410,382 for 2012, according to the complaint. “This is something he might expect in another country but here in the United States it’s very surprising to him and it’s something that gives him lots of personal preoccupation,” said Marquez’s attorney Alan J. Romero, translating what Marquez told reporters in Spanish. “He put his life on the line for this money.” Romero said the bank failed to comply with federal regulations to prevent the use of its operations for money laundering when it approved opening accounts without Marquez present. “It’s not just a case about theft of funds its a case about identity theft,” he said. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan has declined to comment on the lawsuit. Marquez said he was seeking to file returns for several tax years when he met the Cottons in 2012 or 2013. The father and son were recommended to him by three other boxers who had done business with them. Marquez’s new accountant Noriel Zuazo said Marquez received his returns for the 2009 and 2011 tax years but did not see the return checks for 2008 and 2012. He found out that the returns for those years were stolen in 2015 when Zuazo obtained his tax return records from the Internal Revenue Service, showing the checks had been deposited. “Where the money is now we hope to find out,” Romero said.

The S&P energy index <.SPNY>, up 1.1 percent, was the best-performing S&P 500 sector in late-day trading, following gains in oil prices. Investors prepared for the start of quarterly profit reports, with earnings of S&P 500 companies estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year. The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters data. JPMorgan , Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. However, bank stocks have retreated of late as investors question lofty valuations and Trump's ability to swiftly introduce simpler regulations and other policies following the failure of a healthcare reform bill. The S&P 500 financial sector <.SPSY> was off 0.56 percent, dragged down by Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. "A lot of the rally that's occurred since the election has been predicated on the 10-year Treasury yield rising and a steepening yield curve. Over the past few months, we've flattened," said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. "The banks in general still have the post-election gain, but the catalyst behind that seems to be reversing, so that could be a risk here." At 2:53 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was up 48.86 points, or 0.24 percent, to 20,704.96, the S&P 500 <.SPX> had gained 6.7 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,362.24 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> had added 14.51 points, or 0.25 percent, to 5,892.32. Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Geopolitical tensions added to investor unease. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons were a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that "a response is likely" if they pose a danger. Traders attributed a stock dip around noon to unverified rumours stemming from weekend news related to North Korea. A U.S. official told Reuters over the weekend that a U.S. Navy strike group will be moving towards the western Pacific Ocean near the Korean peninsula as a show of force, as concerns grow about North Korea's advancing weapons programme. Straight Path Communications surged nearly two-fold to $89.71 after AT&T offered a huge premium to buy the owner of wireless spectrum licenses. Swift Transportation jumped 23.6 percent to $24.73 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation . Knight's shares were up 13.8 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.62-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 66 new highs and 34 new lows.

The city's developers such as Sun Hung Kai Properties and Cheung Kong Property are among those offering mortgages to home buyers.PHOTO: REUTERS Published10 hours ago More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Purchase Article Permalink: http://str.sg/4XWW Copy HONG KONG • The de facto central bank of Hong Kong has expressed concern about the riskiness of mortgages with high loan-to-value ratios issued by developers, as some analysts warn that property prices in the city are unsustainable. "The accumulation of these high loan-to-value mortgages may change the risk profiles of these property developers to which banks may have exposures," Mr Raymond Chan, executive director for banking supervision at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), said yesterday, in response to queries from Bloomberg. The HKMA said it may ask banks to take additional steps to manage their exposure to the sector. Hong Kong's property market, the world's least affordable, has been on a tear in recent months despite attempts by the city's leaders to cool prices last November by imposing additional taxes. That prompted warnings from analysts, including Mr Cusson Leung at JPMorgan Chase, who said that any external shocks could trigger tighter liquidity in the city's banking system and increase home buyers' borrowing costs. "If the bubble bursts, buyers will not only lose their own money, they will also lose all of their parents' money," Mr Leung said. Buyers have been using all of their assets as well as leveraging their parents' existing homes as collateral to help make residential property deposits, he said. Buyers have flocked to new homes as developers enticed them with tax rebates and loan offers, often made through finance subsidiaries. Hong Kong developers such as Sun Hung Kai Properties and Cheung Kong Property are among those offering mortgages to home buyers. While bank loans are subject to limits imposed by the monetary authority, builder-arranged mortgages are not covered by the same restrictions. Last year, Sun Hung Kai announced a mortgage offer worth as much as 120 per cent of a home's value at one of its projects. Regulations restrict traditional bank mortgages on properties costing less than HK$10 million (S$1.8 million) to 60 per cent of their value. "The HKMA will continue to monitor the situation closely and consider whether there is a need for banks to strengthen their risk management in respect of their lending to property developers," the authority said.

But that’s likely to change over the next few years, as banks, payment companies and even the likes of Google and Facebook push so-called peer-to-peer, or p2p, payment systems — a medium of exchange with revolutionary potential. The apps and online tools could someday overtake cash and checks as the primary way individuals pay each other, and they even could make inroads at the cash register and with businesses that send refunds and other payments to their customers. These systems will get a boost later this year when a coalition of the nation’s biggest banks roll out Zelle, a mobile and online money-transfer network that will let any customer of nearly every U.S. bank send money to customers of any other bank using only a phone number or email address. Analysts say the bank-led system — and the related marketing push — should bring online and mobile peer-to-peer payments to a larger audience. Even competitors, notably the popular money transfer app Venmo, say the Zelle rollout could boost their fortunes by making digital-money transfers more mainstream. “We don’t see it as a winner-take-all scenario,” said Josh Criscoe, a spokesman for Venmo owner PayPal. “We welcome any effort to move folks to more digital payments and move toward the smartphone as the central point of financial life. The common enemy is cash.” Online and mobile peer-to-peer payment systems have grown rapidly over the last few years, and analysts expect that to continue. In a report published in March, finance industry research firm Aite Group estimated that Americans made about $147 billion in digital p2p transfers last year, up from $100 billion the year before. Those are big numbers, to be sure, but last year’s sum still only accounted for about 12 percent of the more than $1.2 trillion that Americans paid each other that year, mostly in cash. That means there’s still plenty of growth ahead, said Talie Baker, an analyst at Aite Group. In her report, she estimated that the volume of digital p2p payments will more than double by 2020, topping $316 billion. “Not that many consumers are using mobile payments yet,” Baker said, noting that though these payments are more common among young consumers in big coastal cities, they’re not so ubiquitous elsewhere. “I’m a Gen-X person and I live in Denver — I hadn’t heard of Venmo until 2015.” There are plenty of players in the p2p game. Square Inc., the payments company behind the tiny white credit card reader that plugs into a smartphone, has a p2p service of its own, Square Cash, which launched in 2013. Following the geometric theme, there’s also Circle, a Boston firm that started the same year and specializes in cross-border p2p transfers in dollars, euros and British pounds. Facebook and Google, too, allow users to send money to friends. Google has Google Wallet, which started as a mobile wallet app but became a p2p payment tool in 2015, and Facebook users have been able to send money through Facebook Messenger since 2015. Square, Google and Facebook don’t report the volume of payments made through their p2p systems, but Facebook in regulatory filings has said that only “a relatively small percentage” of its users have used the payments feature. Venmo is arguably the biggest name in peer-to-peer transfers. It even has the coveted status, like Google, Uber and a few others, of becoming a verb — as in “Venmo me.” Founded in 2009, the company was acquired in 2012 by payment services provider Braintree, which was acquired the following year by online payments giant PayPal — which offers p2p payments under its own name too. But the biggest players in the market are still the banks. Last year, Venmo users transferred $17.6 billion. That’s more than double the volume from 2015, but it’s also much less than the $28 billion transferred in 2016 through QuickPay, JPMorgan Chase’s peer-to-peer payment system. And that’s just one bank. Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other major financial institutions have had their own p2p transfer programs for years, though it can sometimes be clunky for bank customers to send money to people with accounts at other financial institutions. Aite Group estimates that of all the digital p2p transfers Americans made last year, non-bank systems such as Venmo accounted for only about 17 percent of that. Banks accounted for the rest, though much of that likely was made through banks’ websites, not mobile apps, and much of it was money transferred between customers of the same bank. In part, that’s a statement about who uses different systems, and what they are used for. Venmo and other non-bank systems are accessed about twice as often as bank systems, but for much smaller transactions, according to Aite Group. The average money transfer on a non-bank system is $135; the average for bank systems is $1,359, according to the report. That might suggest that parents sending money to a student for college tuition, for instance, might be more likely to transfer money through a bank, while students are much more likely to split a restaurant bill or bar tab using Venmo. The payment app is also a social network in its own right, with users sending messages to friends when they transfer money — a feature Venmo pioneered. Those messages shed light on what’s behind each transaction and indicate that Venmo is most often used among friends over food and drink, said Criscoe, the Venmo spokesman. “Pizza is the No. 1 emoji on Venmo; beer is a close follow,” he said, adding that other messages suggest users are splitting bigger-ticket items too, such as rent. Though Venmo and other non-bank payment systems are still a small part of the p2p market, banks want to make sure they keep their place in the financial order and keep their customers. This summer, Early Warning, a company owned by some of the nation’s largest banks, will release Zelle, a payment system built to compete with Venmo and others — and, banks hope, to make digital p2p payments more mainstream. Along with the release, Early Warning will kick off a marketing campaign showing not only how Zelle works but how it might be used. Lou Anne Alexander, president of Early Warning’s payments group, said the focus will be on appealing to older consumers who might not have tried p2p payments. “We’re trying to take (p2p) from millennials to the mainstream—customers might use a product like this,” Alexander said. “That might be managing contributions to the high school marching band or it might be renting a home on the beach with friends or family.” Zelle traces it roots back to 2011, when Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase set out to build a system — initially called ClearXchange — that would allow their customers to send money to each other using only phone numbers and email addresses. Before, customers could only transfer money to friends and family by entering account and routing numbers — information customers often didn’t know and might be concerned about sharing. Zelle is essentially a souped-up, rebranded version of ClearXchange. It will be available to anyone with a U.S. bank account, and it aims to overcome some of the limitations and confusion around the ClearXchange system. Sarah Grotta of research and consulting firm Mercator Advisory Group said banks didn’t do a great job of explaining that ClearXchange would allow customers to send money to customers of other banks. Part of the problem, she said, was that every bank has its own name for its ClearXchange-powered p2p system, including Chase QuickPay, Wells Fargo SurePay and Capital One P2P Payments. “It wasn’t well-marketed that someone at Chase could pay someone at Bank of America because they had different marketing and different branding,” Grotta said. “You could pay someone at any financial institution, but people never realized that.” To address that problem, banks over the next few months will begin rebranding their p2p transfer systems to include Zelle in the name. Chase, for instance, will start calling its system “QuickPay with Zelle.” Customers of more than a dozen big banks — representing most U.S. account holders — will be able to transfer money through the banks’ mobile apps. For other banks and credit unions, customers will be able to do so through the Zelle mobile app, set to be released this summer. Once the system is running and the marketing campaign kicks off, Grotta expects Zelle to be a hit. “This is going to be a much better user experience than the banks had before,” she said. “I think it will start to catch on once people see that they can in fact send money to another person at another financial institution.” For banks, the stakes are high. Though Venmo and other money transfer apps are tiny by comparison, Baker said banks are rightfully worried about what might happen if their customers interact more often with outside payment companies. If a customer opens an outside p2p payment app once a day and their mobile banking app just once a week, the payment company has more opportunities to sell that customer on products and services the bank would otherwise provide, she said. “Once Venmo builds up a strong enough customer base, then it can say, ‘Hey, come get a credit card from us,’ or ‘Come get a home loan from us,’” Baker said. “That’s the approach some providers are hoping to take.” Banks see other advantages too. Mary Harman, an executive in Bank of America’s consumer payments division, said it’s expensive for banks to process checks and move cash around, so an increase in digital p2p payments could cut costs. She said banks also want to give customers the services and options they want. Some customers, she said, might prefer using Venmo; others might prefer the implied security of managing financial transactions exclusively through their bank. “We serve 65-million households in the U.S., and not everyone will act the same way,” Harman said. We have to recognize that and have different products available in different places.” 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2pn2ARO

In a statement on Monday, Britain's second biggest bank disclosed that British authorities were investigating American Staley's attempts to find out who wrote a letter that revealed "concerns of a personal nature" about an unnamed senior employee. New York's Department of Financial Services is also investigating, a person familiar with the matter said. A legal investigation ordered by the bank found that Staley's efforts involved a U.S. law enforcement agency and contradicted the company's own policy. Barclays grants whistleblowers anonymity to prevent any retribution for their actions - in keeping with normal UK practice. "I have apologised to the Barclays board, and accepted its conclusion that my personal actions in this matter were errors on my part," former JPMorgan banker Staley said in a statement. Barclays said its board would back Staley's reappointment at the company's annual shareholder meeting on May 10. Analysts said that Staley's position as CEO could come under pressure if regulators' reports on the case, expected to take a matter of months, were especially critical of his conduct. Staley, who took the role in Dec. 2015, stands to lose a chunk of the 1.3 million pound ($1.6 million) bonus he was awarded this year, but the final amount to be docked is yet to be decided, a separate source said. Staley said in a memo to Barclays staff on Monday that he had been attempting to protect a colleague from an unfair personal attack. "In my desire to protect our colleague, however, I got too personally involved in this matter," Staley wrote in the memo seen by Reuters. The investigations are the latest in a series of regulatory problems for the bank, which is still dealing with investigations into employees' manipulation of Libor benchmark interest rates. The whistleblower probe is particularly embarrassing for Barclays since it relates to recent wrongdoing rather than being a legacy of financial crisis-era misconduct, and because Staley himself has made much of the bank's efforts to clean up its act. "I am personally very disappointed and apologetic that this situation has occurred, particularly as we strive to operate to the highest possible ethical standards," Barclays Chairman John McFarlane said in the company's statement. Barclays shares fell as much as 0.7 percent on Monday but were trading 0.65 percent higher by 1340 GMT. 'HONEST MISTAKE' Barclays' board first heard of Staley's attempt to identify the author of the letter in early 2017, after the issue was raised by an employee, Barclays said. The board instructed law firm Simmons & Simmons to carry out an investigation led by Gerry Grimstone, the bank's deputy chairman, and also notified the regulators. "The investigation ... found, and the board has concluded, that Mr Staley honestly, but mistakenly, believed that it was permissible to identify the author of the letter," the bank said. The lawyers' report also said that Staley had requested the bank's internal security team contact U.S. enforcement officers to help identify the whistleblower, and that such assistance was received albeit without discovering the identity of the person. The board will issue a formal written reprimand to Staley and make a "very significant" adjustment to his variable compensation award. The board will also look into the position of other employees involved in the incident. Staley, 60, has embarked on a sweeping revamp of the lender's strategy since taking over Barclays, slashing its business in Asia and Africa in favour of a new 'transatlantic' focus on the U.S. and Britain. A career investment banker who spent 34 years at JPMorgan, Staley is popular among staff in Barclays' investment bank for bringing back some of its risk-taking swagger after the hairshirt regime of predecessor Antony Jenkins. The attempts to uncover the whistleblower took place despite the bank's appointment of a 'whistleblower champion' - Mike Ashley, the chairman of its Board Audit Committee. In 2016, Ashley emailed all Barclays employees with a video spelling out the bank's policy on protecting whistleblowers, according to the lender's annual report.

Legal marijuana is becoming more and more entrenched in the United States each year, and 2016 looks to be no exception. While possession, sale and consumption of marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, it is permitted for recreational use in four US states: Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington, plus the US capital Washington. / AFP / Andrew Caballero-Reynolds (Photo credit should read ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP/Getty Images) By RyanVlastelica Markets reporter Even though it hasn’t had its product on the market for a week, Horizons ETF Management is one of the most successful marijuana dealers in history. The company has seen remarkably strong interest for its Medical Marijuana Life Sciences ETF HMMJ, +9.23% Wall Street’s first marijuana-themed exchange-traded fund, which launched last week. The fund has traded for four sessions and has risen in each of them, including a surge of 9.9% on Monday, bringing its total rise to 17.8%. This medical device scans your brain on marijuana(2:52) The BrainBot, a brain-scanning technology developed by tech startup PotBotics, enables physicians to pick a marijuana strain that is most suited for their patients' needs. Just as impressively, the fund has seen heavy trading volume, with average daily volume of more than a million shares. To compare, there have been four other ETFs launched thus far in April, according to research firm XTF. Of those, the most popular — the Cambria Tail Risk ETF TAIL, +0.08% — has average daily volume below 5,000 shares a day. The others average daily volume under 500 shares. The Medical Marijuana fund has amassed more than C$37.6 million ($28.2 million) in assets, according to Horizons, making it the most popular fund launched this month by that metric. It’s closest competitor is the JPMorgan Global Bond Opportunities ETF JPGB, +0.12% which has $25.1 million in assets — as well as the backing and distribution capabilities of one of the world’s largest investment banks. Such success for a new fund is rare. According to Morningstar, while the ETF industry regularly hits new records in terms of its size — about $3.7 trillion in global assets currently — most of that money is going to a few select funds. ETFs with under $5 million in assets make up 15.4% of the category. See also: Here’s why the ETF graveyard is getting crowded Don’t miss: Should you invest in an ETF that’s closing? The Horizons fund represents something relatively rare for the modern-day ETF marketplace: a new fund that tracks an industry with heavy demand but which had no vehicle that investors can use to gain broad exposure. The legal questions surrounding marijuana have prevented regulators from approving such a fund in the past, and even Horizons’ has a somewhat limited focus — tracking companies involved with medical marijuana bioengineering and production and avoiding ones connected to recreational use. Another proposed fund, the Emerging AgroSphere ETF, has a similar limitation. It “will not invest in any companies that are focused on serving the nonmedical marijuana market in the United States, Canada or any other country unless and until such time as the production and sale of nonmedical marijuana becomes legal in the United States, Canada or such other country, respectively,” the firm wrote in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Still, the marijuana industry has seen surging growth of late. Sales grew 30% in 2016, according to Arcview Market Research, and they are seen tripling in four years.The growth comes as more and more people approve of legalizing marijuana, including for recreational purposes. In 2016, roughly 60% of Americans said they favored the legalization of recreational marijuana, as the industry gained support in invalidating the war on drugs and seven states voted to legalize pot for recreational or medical use. With the launch of the marijuana ETF, one of the few “white spaces” — an industry without a dedicated fund — left for the industry is bitcoin. Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission rejected a proposed rule change that would’ve allowed for the creation of the first such product, saying it was unnerved by the lack of regulation in the bitcoin market.

The company has seen remarkably strong interest for its Medical Marijuana Life Sciences ETF HMMJ, +9.23% Wall Street’s first marijuana-themed exchange-traded fund, which launched last week. The fund has traded for four sessions and has risen in each of them, including a surge of 9.9% on Monday, bringing its total rise to 17.8%.

Just as impressively, the fund has seen heavy trading volume, with average daily volume of more than a million shares. To compare, there have been four other ETFs launched thus far in April, according to research firm XTF. Of those, the most popular — the Cambria Tail Risk ETF TAIL, +0.08% — has average daily volume below 5,000 shares a day. The others average daily volume under 500 shares. The Medical Marijuana fund has amassed more than C$37.6 million ($28.2 million) in assets, according to Horizons, making it the most popular fund launched this month by that metric. It’s closest competitor is the JPMorgan Global Bond Opportunities ETF JPGB, +0.12% which has $25.1 million in assets — as well as the backing and distribution capabilities of one of the world’s largest investment banks. Such success for a new fund is rare. According to Morningstar, while the ETF industry regularly hits new records in terms of its size — about $3.7 trillion in global assets currently — most of that money is going to a few select funds. ETFs with under $5 million in assets make up 15.4% of the category. See also: Here’s why the ETF graveyard is getting crowded Don’t miss: Should you invest in an ETF that’s closing?

The offense: repeatedly trying to root out the identity of a whistle-blower who made allegations against a senior banker the chief executive officer had worked with before. The board formally reprimanded the CEO and may claw back his entire 1.3 million-pound ($1.6 million) bonus from last year. While Staley secured the unanimous backing of the board for now, he still faces a U.K. regulatory probe that could find him unfit to run a bank. Staley inserted himself into the compliance probe and kept trying to identify the whistle-blower after he was told it was inappropriate. The incident is a setback for a CEO who had been seeking to repair a culture at a bank where misconduct charges wiped out more than 20 billion pounds of profit over six years. “They did try and circulate this idea there was a cultural rejuvenation and this is definitely a backward step,” said Eric Moore, who helps to oversee about 2.9 billion pounds of assets at Miton Group Plc, including Barclays shares. “He’ll definitely be on the naughty step for a while.” The board had received an anonymous letter raising concerns about a senior hire, including Staley’s knowledge of and role in dealing with those issues at a previous employer. The CEO twice enlisted the help of the Group Information Security team to identify the author, but they failed to do so. The Barclays team contacted and received assistance from U.S. Postal Inspection Service in the effort, according to a person familiar with the request. A spokeswoman for the authority didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The internal investigation led by law firm Simmons & Simmons LLP concluded that Staley “honestly, but mistakenly” believed that it was permissible to seek the author’s identity. The CEO will have to face shareholders on May 10 at the bank’s annual general meeting in London, where he will seek re-appointment for his second full-year in charge. “An interesting question is, what would have happened to someone much farther down the food chain? They’d have lost their job,” Owen Watkins, a lawyer at Lewis Silkin in London and a former regulator at Britain’s Financial Services Authority, the precursor to the FCA, said in an interview. ‘Unfair’ Attack Staley said he was motivated to act by an anonymous “unfair personal attack” that he thought was designed to “maliciously smear” a colleague with allegations about personal issues from years ago, the CEO said in a memo to staff seen by Bloomberg News. The allegations in the letters relate to Tim Main, whom Staley hired in June as chairman of the bank’s global financial institutions group, according to a person familiar with the matter. Main joined from Evercore Partners Inc. and previously worked under Staley at JPMorgan. “In my desire to protect our colleague, however, I got too personally involved in this matter,” he said. “I realize that I should simply have let the compliance function handle this matter.” Staley was hired to replace Antony Jenkins, a former retail banker who said he wanted to restore the bank’s ethics to its Quaker roots but was replaced after he failed to restore profit growth fast enough. Staley pledged to continue the cultural push while recommitting to the firm’s investment bank. “We must complete the cultural transformation of the group; there can be no retreat from becoming a values-driven organization which conducts itself with integrity at all times,” Staley said in an October 2015 memo before he started as CEO. “My ambition is to restore Barclays to its rightful standing -- successful, admired and well regarded by all.” Mugs, Promotion Investors at the time expressed concern about appointing another U.S. investment banker. Jenkins’ predecessor Bob Diamond was ousted in 2012, having lost the confidence of British regulators and politicians after Barclays was fined for attempting to manipulate the Libor interbank rate. Following that episode, the bank commissioned an examination of its ethics and culture. One of the key recommendations, made by senior British lawyer Anthony Salz in April 2013, was greater protections for whistle-blowers after he found some senior managers “did not want to hear bad news.” The lender has successfully promoted its overhauled program that allowed employees to “raise concerns in confidence without fear of retaliation,” Mike Ashley, chairman of the audit committee and the board’s whistle-blower’s champion, said in the bank’s 2016 annual report released in February. The bank handed out free coffee mugs with a whistle and the hotline phone number on it to encourage more reporting, according to a person involved in the drive at the time. Pay Cut Staley himself feted the role of a junior trader who informed on a more senior colleague for suspicious telephone conversations in early 2016, according to one executive at the bank. The senior trader was investigated and fired, and Staley directly praised the young employee internally afterward, calling him a role model and promising he would make sure he was taken care of when pay decisions were taken, the person said.

Sign Up “You have to be very brave to do whistle-blowing and when you have a CEO trying to find out who it was, it reinforces the notion that whistle-blowers are going to suffer,” Sharon Bowles, a former head of the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, said in an interview. “We need to protect whistle-blowers. They may have their lives destroyed. It’s sad that you get a failure like this; it just seems to be a failure to grasp what it’s all about.” The FCA investigation will take several months and could result in anything from a verbal warning to Staley losing his status as an approved person and therefore his ability to run the bank. What’s certain is the probe will result in the board cutting the CEO’s bonus by a “very significant” amount, though the exact reduction will depend on the findings. Regulators will also look at the bank’s controls and the actions of other individuals, including who gave Staley the whistle-blower’s letter against company policy, said a person briefed on the probe. The events are also under scrutiny by the Department of Financial Services in New York, according to a separate person with knowledge of the matter. The investigation comes as Barclays faces another probe into its 2008 emergency fundraising backed by Qatar and prepares to go to court to fight allegations from U.S. Department of Justice over the sale of toxic mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis. “This is highly, highly embarrassing” because “giving a written warning to the CEO is unprecedented,” Christopher Wheeler, an analyst in London with Atlantic Equities LLP, said on Bloomberg Television. “It’s a very surprising situation, but my suspicion is that he’s fine for the time being. The bank wants to say ‘we have taken hard action and now Jes can get on running the bank,’ but it’s going to be a tough few weeks.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

No pricing details were listed in the filing, although the offering was valued up to $100 million in the original filing. The company intends to list its stock on the New York Stock under the symbol WTTR. The underwriters for the offering are Credit Suisse, FBR, Wells Fargo, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, RBC Capital Markets, Simmons and Tudor Pickering Holt. This company is a leading provider of total water solutions to the U.S. unconventional oil and gas industry. Within the major shale plays in the United States, management believes that the firm is a market leader in sourcing and transfer of water (both by permanent pipeline and temporary pipe) prior to its use in drilling and completion activities associated with hydraulic fracturing, which it collectively refers to as “pre-frac water services.” In most of its areas of operation, Select Energy provides complementary water-related services that support oil and gas well completion and production activities, including containment, monitoring, treatment, flowback, hauling and disposal. These services are necessary to establish and maintain production of oil and gas over the productive life of a horizontal well. Water and related services are increasingly important as oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) companies have increased the complexity and completion intensity of horizontal wells (including the use of longer horizontal wellbore laterals, tighter spacing of frac stages in the laterals and increased water and proppant use per foot of lateral) in order to improve production and recovery of hydrocarbons. Historically, the firm has generated a substantial majority of its revenues through providing total water solutions to customers. It provides services to major integrated and large E&P companies, who typically represent the largest producers in each of its areas of operations. The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for a few things: Up to $51 million will be used to repay borrowings incurred under our credit facility to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Permian Acquisition. $10.7 million will be used for the cash settlement of outstanding phantom units at SES Holdings. Approximately $5 million will be used for growth capital expenditures in the Bakken, including the expansion of the Bakken Pipeline systems. The balance will be used for general corporate purposes, including other organic and acquisition growth opportunities.

City watchdogs have also launched an investigation after it emerged Jes Staley twice attempted to find out who sent letters about a high flyer the bank had just hired. Both letters were sent in June last year. One went to the Barclays’ board and the other went to an unnamed top boss. They contained claims ‘of a personal nature’ about a ‘senior employee’. Reports say the employee concerned is Tim Main, hired in June last year as chairman of Barclays’ New York based financial institutions group. Mr Staley worked with Mr Main when they were both at investment bank JP Morgan. Barclays have made a 'very significant' cut to Staley's bonus (Photo: Getty) Read More Extra protection for NHS staff who raise the alarm over patient care The letters made claims about the ‘appropriateness of the recruitment process’. Barclays dismissed the allegations after conducting an investigation. Yet a month later, in July, Mr Staley asked the bank’s own security team to identify the whistleblower. Barclays said Mr Staley saw them as an ‘unfair personal attack on a senior employer’. He was told that unmasking the sender was not allowed. Yet he went ahead and asked security again. This time they contacted and got information from a US law enforcement agency. Despite that, Barclays concluded that Mr Staley’s actions amounted to an honest mistake. However, it decided to make a ‘very significant’ cut to the annual bonus Mr Staley got this year. Read More Parking firms target the elderly as wardens are told to lie in wait for unsuspecting drivers Labour MP John Mann has called for Mr Staley's resignation (Photo: PA) The exact amount will depend on outcome of the probe launched today by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority. His annual bonus was £1.3million last year, part of a pay and perks package worth £4.2million. Mr Staley said: “I have apologised to the Barclays board and accepted the conclusion that my personal actions in this matter were errors of the past.” However, Labour MP John Mann went further, suggesting Mr Staley should resign. The Institute of Directors called it ‘clearly disappointing’. Read More NHS call handler says he had to quit because of 'unbearable pressure' in service that's 'failing patients' Richard Nicolle, employment law expert at Stewarts Law, said: “The Jes Staley case couldn’t be more serious for confidence in whistleblowing in the financial services sector. “After the financial crisis, measures like the senior managers regime were meant to give all of us confidence that senior people in the industry are taking responsibility for ensuring wrongdoing is prevented, and decisions and actions that pose a risk to organisational stability are addressed. “For senior managers to be seen to be focused on unmasking anonymous whistleblowers will do great damage to the confidence of anyone who does want to anonymously raise legitimate concerns.” Andrew Tyrie MP, chairman of the Commons Treasury Select Committee, hunted that it may investigate the matter. He said: “The senior managers and certification Regime is supposed to ensure that whistleblowers are protected. This is the first proper test of those rules, and it is for the regulators to test whether Barclays had the right processes in place. “The Treasury Committee will take a close interest in the regulators’ conclusions.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Barclays Andrew Tyrie MP Banks Financial crisis News all Most Read Most Recent North KoreaTrump orders military advisers to prepare plans to hit North Korea It is believed that among the options are combined special forces raids and pre-emptive missile strikes Court caseFemale pensioner spared jail after having sex with dogs at 'bestiality party' claiming she didn't know it was illegal Carol Bowditch, 64, admitted a charge of having sex with an animal after believing it was 'not a crime' North KoreaChina 'moves 150,000 troops and medical supplies to North Korean border in case US attacks Kim Jong-un regime' President Trump's airstrike in Syria last week caused widespread alarm among the Chinese who believe North Korea is next e-cigarettesVaping laws are changing next month – this is what you need to know The new Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016 comes into force on Saturday, May 20, and introduces a number of rules about the sale of e-cigarettes and e-liquids United AirlinesUnited Airlines 'overbooked' flight incident: Disturbing new footage shows bleeding passenger telling staff 'just kill me' The man was left injured after being violently dragged from a flight because he refused to give up his seat HospitalsGirl, 13, left with horrific injuries after being slammed into concrete as her backpack got caught on passing tractor Natasha Pearce was unconscious for two days after she was pulled into the middle of the road in freak accident that fractured her eye socket and broke collar bone WeightWatchersMum-of-4 too fat for crutches when she broke ankle drops eight dress sizes after being forced to use Zimmer frame Final straw for mum Lucy Humphreys was when husband offered to push her around in wheelchair as tried to take the weight off leg when after falling off a friend’s front doorstep MurderMan stabbed to death as murder detectives seal off large area and launch hunt for suspects Officers found the victim as police, ambulance workers and an air ambulance were called following a report of a knife attack Breast cancerScotland gets breast cancer and HIV-prevention drugs deemed too expensive in England and Wales Scotland makes two significant steps in healthcare ahead of the rest of the UK ImmigrationDunkirk refugee camp fire: At least six injured after blaze sweeps through home of 1,500 migrants Dramatic images revealed how the fire destroyed the camp as French riot police intervened in scuffles Most Read Most Recent North KoreaTrump orders military advisers to prepare plans to hit North Korea It is believed that among the options are combined special forces raids and pre-emptive missile strikes Court caseFemale pensioner spared jail after having sex with dogs at 'bestiality party' claiming she didn't know it was illegal Carol Bowditch, 64, admitted a charge of having sex with an animal after believing it was 'not a crime' North KoreaChina 'moves 150,000 troops and medical supplies to North Korean border in case US attacks Kim Jong-un regime' President Trump's airstrike in Syria last week caused widespread alarm among the Chinese who believe North Korea is next Eden HazardReal Madrid's confidence growing over world-record smashing transfer of Eden Hazard from Chelsea Spaniards ready to include Alvaro Morata in £120m deal believe they are getting encouragement from star's camp Gordon RamsayGordon Ramsay says his children won't be getting his fortune and aren't allowed to sit in first class on holidays "I say to the chief stewardess: 'Make sure those little f***ers don’t come anywhere near us'" Shopping centresMan who collapsed in street was ignored by dozens of shoppers as he foamed at the mouth Two passers-by eventually came to the man's rescue but only after he was ignored for 30 minutes Jade ThirlwallJade Thirlwall throws back to Little Mix's How Ya Doin'? video as she poses up in a phone box The girls are currently in America Siobhan DonaghyOriginal Sugababes star Siobhan Donaghy is pregnant with her first child The popstar shared her happy baby news on Instagram King HaraldNorthern Norway, Northern Lights Deep in a land of real night-time silence, glassy frozen fjords and soaring eagles I was introduced to “snice”.

Chase’s support helps ensure that Carry The Load, started in 2011, can commit to providing active, meaningful ways to honor and celebrate the sacrifices made by our nation’s heroes. As part of its Awareness Program, Carry The Load hosts its annual National Relay throughout the month of May to honor the sacrifices made by our nation’s heroes. Funds are raised throughout May for Carry The Load’s Continuum of Care Program which provides direct services to military, law enforcement, fire and rescue personnel, and their families through our partnerships with other nonprofits across the country. „Six years ago, we set out to restore the true meaning of Memorial Day — a holiday deserving of our nation’s attention, affection and respect,” said Stephen Holley, president and CEO of Carry The Load. „We’ve since broadened our mission to include more than just our military heroes and more than just one holiday. We are proud that Chase continues to help us, and America, celebrate, honor and remember those who sacrifice for us daily.” The 31-day relay will span more than 6,000 total miles and is comprised of a 2,100-mile East Coast route from West Point, NY to Dallas and a 4,100-mile West Coast route from Seattle to Dallas. The two routes converge in Dallas on Memorial Day for a more than 20-hour and 17-minute Memorial March. Registration information and event details can be found at carrytheload.org. „It’s our honor and privilege to support Carry The Load again this year and the important message that we must remember our service members and first responders who gave the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of us all,” said JPMorgan Chase Head of Military and Veterans Affairs Ross A. Brown. From April 28 to May 28, the relay will progress 24 hours a day, with rallies taking place in various cities and towns along the route. Chase will host rallies in Seattle, New York City, Wilmington, Del., Phoenix, Columbus, Ohio, Tampa, Fla. and Jacksonville, Fla. where thousands of employees and volunteers in the communities will walk and gather to remember those who have lost their lives. Chase’s support of Carry The Load reflects the firm’s ongoing commitment to the veteran and military communities. Since 2011, the firm has hired more than 11,000 veterans and developed programs aimed at retaining and supporting veterans throughout their post-service careers. These efforts include leading the Veteran Jobs Mission — previously the 100,000 Jobs Mission — a coalition founded in 2011 by JPMorgan Chase and 10 other companies with the goal of hiring 100,000 veterans. Now more than 235 members strong, the coalition has collectively hired more than 380,000 veterans, and is ultimately committed to hiring 1 million.

Morgan Asset Management has launched its second actively managed fixed-income bond exchange traded fund that could freely and quickly adapt to any changes in the market environment. J.P. Morgan recently rolled out the JPMorgan Global Bond Opportunities ETF (BATS: JPGB), which comes with a 0.55% net expense ratio. The active bond ETF is managed by J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s Managing Directors Robert Michele, Iain Stealey, and Nicholas Gartside. “J.P. Morgan is uniquely positioned to offer an ETF that provides access to some of the most sophisticated fixed income investment capabilities available to investors,” Bob Deutsch, U.S. Head of ETFs for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a note. “Our network of global experts and research analysts can scour the globe for opportunities in any market cycle, and their extensive experience with this type of investing is unrivaled.” JPGB will try to provide total return by investing across sectors in developed and emerging markets around the world. “The fund is flexible and opportunistic,” according to the prospectus sheet. The management team has broad discretion to shift the fund’s exposure to strategies, sectors, countries or currencies based on changing market conditions and its view of the best mix of investment opportunities. Managers will select securities based on their analysis of individual investments and broader economic conditions in individual countries, regions and the world, shifting from conservative to higher risk opportunities based on prevailing market conditions. “The strategy takes a benchmark agnostic approach and seeks to take advantage of opportunities across market sectors, credit quality, countries and currencies, extending beyond traditional fixed income investments,” according to a note. “It captures J.P. Morgan’s highest conviction ideas in a flexible strategy that identifies opportunities in response to evolving market conditions.” The active ETF will include at least 40% of assets in countries other than the U.S and will hold at least 25% of assets in investment-grade debt. The fund will also try to maintain a duration of eight years or less. For more information on new fund products, visit our new ETFs category.

Short-term events such as earnings reports make ideal opportunities to use leveraged exchange-traded funds. Using leveraged ETFs necessitates knowing the risks associated with them. Leveraged ETFs are designed to amplify returns on a daily basis, but these products can deviate in a big way from their stated objectives over longer holding periods. Leveraged ETFs FAZ And FAS Traders looking to profit from moves in bank stocks this week and this earnings season have some familiar names to turn to, namely the Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: FAS) and the Direxion Daily Financial Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: FAZ) ETFs. FAS, the bullish member of that duo, is designed to deliver triple the daily returns of the Russell 1000 Financial Services Index (RGUSFLA). FAZ attempts to deliver triple the daily inverse returns of that benchmark. With U.S. markets being closed Friday in observance of the Good Friday holiday, Thursday will be the day to deploy FAS or FAZ. On Thursday, Dow component JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE: PNC) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC) will report earnings for the first quarter of 2017. Part of what makes Thursday so significant is that three of those banks, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, represent the first-, third- and fifth-largest holdings respectively in the Russell 1000 Financial Services Index. Those stocks combine for over 16 percent of the index's weight, underscoring the point that Thursday could be an active day for FAS and FAZ. The financials' laggard status — the sector has underperformed the overall market by about 3 percent in 2017 — is encouraging some traders to make bearish bets against the S&P 500's second-largest sector weight, which you can also do via the Direxion Daily Financial Bear 1X Shares (NYSE: FAZZ). All of these conditions are coming off a month that saw the Federal Reserve raise the target federal funds rate for the third time since the end of 2015, making the sector one of the more compelling stories of the year. Hawkish Fed Signifies Different Stories For FAZ, FAS That hawkish tone has, predictably, led to vastly different stories for FAZ and FAS. FAZ, the bearish Direxion financial services ETF, has averaged daily outflows of $624,000, according to Direxion data. Conversely, traders have been much more enthusiastic about FAS. The triple-leveraged bullish financials ETF averaged daily inflows of $3.26 million over that period. However an individual feels about the future of the sector, Thursday's earnings and the reports from the rest of the banks in the index over the coming weeks are sure to cause volatility. If that's something valued, these funds represent a significant trading opportunity.

In a statement on Monday, Britain’s second biggest bank disclosed that British authorities were investigating American Staley’s attempts to find out who wrote a letter that revealed “concerns of a personal nature” about an unnamed senior employee. New York’s Department of Financial Services is also investigating, a person familiar with the matter said. A legal investigation ordered by the bank found that Staley’s efforts involved a U.S. law enforcement agency and contradicted the company’s own policy. Barclays grants whistleblowers anonymity to prevent any retribution for their actions – in keeping with normal UK practice. “I have apologised to the Barclays board, and accepted its conclusion that my personal actions in this matter were errors on my part,” former JPMorgan banker Staley said in a statement. Barclays said its board would back Staley’s reappointment at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on May 10. Analysts said that Staley’s position as CEO could come under pressure if regulators’ reports on the case, expected to take a matter of months, were especially critical of his conduct. Staley, who took the role in Dec. 2015, stands to lose a chunk of the 1.3 million pound ($1.6 million) bonus he was awarded this year, but the final amount to be docked is yet to be decided, a separate source said. Staley said in a memo to Barclays staff on Monday that he had been attempting to protect a colleague from an unfair personal attack. “In my desire to protect our colleague, however, I got too personally involved in this matter,” Staley wrote in the memo seen by Reuters. The investigations are the latest in a series of regulatory problems for the bank, which is still dealing with investigations into employees’ manipulation of Libor benchmark interest rates. The whistleblower probe is particularly embarrassing for Barclays since it relates to recent wrongdoing rather than being a legacy of financial crisis-era misconduct, and because Staley himself has made much of the bank’s efforts to clean up its act. “I am personally very disappointed and apologetic that this situation has occurred, particularly as we strive to operate to the highest possible ethical standards,” Barclays Chairman John McFarlane said in the company’s statement. Barclays shares fell as much as 0.7 percent on Monday but were trading 0.65 percent higher by 1340 GMT. ‘Honest mistake’ Barclays’ board first heard of Staley’s attempt to identify the author of the letter in early 2017, after the issue was raised by an employee, Barclays said. The board instructed law firm Simmons & Simmons to carry out an investigation led by Gerry Grimstone, the bank’s deputy chairman, and also notified the regulators. “The investigation … found, and the board has concluded, that Mr Staley honestly, but mistakenly, believed that it was permissible to identify the author of the letter,” the bank said. The lawyers’ report also said that Staley had requested the bank’s internal security team contact U.S. enforcement officers to help identify the whistleblower, and that such assistance was received albeit without discovering the identity of the person. The board will issue a formal written reprimand to Staley and make a “very significant” adjustment to his variable compensation award. The board will also look into the position of other employees involved in the incident. Staley, 60, has embarked on a sweeping revamp of the lender’s strategy since taking over Barclays, slashing its business in Asia and Africa in favour of a new ‘transatlantic’ focus on the U.S. and Britain. A career investment banker who spent 34 years at JPMorgan, Staley is popular among staff in Barclays’ investment bank for bringing back some of its risk-taking swagger after the hairshirt regime of predecessor Antony Jenkins. The attempts to uncover the whistleblower took place despite the bank’s appointment of a ‘whistleblower champion’ – Mike Ashley, the chairman of its Board Audit Committee. In 2016, Ashley emailed all Barclays employees with a video spelling out the bank’s policy on protecting whistleblowers, according to the lender’s annual report.

JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. However, bank stocks have retreated of late as investors question lofty valuations and Trump's ability to swiftly introduce simpler regulations and other policies following the failure of a healthcare reform bill. The S&P 500 financial sector was off 0.56 percent, dragged down by Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. "The financial sector has been a darling performer since the election and we've seen some of that performance retreat in the last couple of weeks," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. "So, what the banks report and what their guidance is will be the primary driver for equity prices over the next week or two." Earnings of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year. The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Geopolitical tensions added to investor unease. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons were a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that "a response is likely" if they pose a danger. At 12:12 p.m. ET (1612 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 33.22 points, or 0.16 percent, at 20,622.88, the S&P 500 was down 2.98 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,352.56. The Nasdaq Composite was down 7.95 points, or 0.14 percent, at 5,869.86. Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Four of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with energy leading with a 0.94 percent gain, supported by higher oil prices. Technology was off 0.13 percent, led by declines in Intel and Nvidia. Shares of Amazon.com was the top stock on the S&P and the Nasdaq, rising 1.2 percent to $905.92. The world's largest online retailer was upgraded to "buy" at Needham, according to a trader. Straight Path Communications surged nearly two-fold to $89.71 after AT&T offered a huge premium to buy the owner of wireless spectrum licenses. Swift Transportation jumped 21.7 percent to $24.36 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation. Knight's shares were up 12 percent.

 Wall Street is about to find out whether the next big rally in stocks can be justified Akin Oyedele Apr. 10, 2017, 12:26 PM 2,208 facebook linkedin twitter email print Here's when to expect the most earnings releases. Bank of America Merrill Lynch First-quarter earnings season unofficially gets underway when three of the big banks announce their results on Thursday. Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo report before the market opens. Alcoa's release traditionally marked the start of earnings season until the aluminum giant split into two public companies last year, pushing its date further out.  The Q1 earnings are the first since the post-election surge in stocks that increased valuations to levels last seen around the 2000 peak of the tech bubble.  "A good Q1 earnings season would likely provide a platform to justify higher prices for stocks in the months ahead," John Stoltzfus, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, said in a note on Monday. "Earnings, should they surprise to the upside, will add support to current equity market price levels as 'vitamin e' (earnings) reduces P/E multiples if just a tad."  Wall Street has high expectations for earnings. Analysts forecast earnings per share of $29.44, which would be a 9% year-over-year improvement and mark the fourth straight quarter of improving growth, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.   Financials and energy lead  The financial and energy sectors are expected to account for the lion's share of earnings growth. Financials, considered to be major beneficiaries of deregulation and tax reform, were up 26% at the peak of their post-election rally, reflecting investors' expectations for policy under the new administration. However, the sector has since pared that gain to about 18% after the failure of the American Health Care Act, which demonstrated that promised reforms could be delayed or stifled.  Beyond the optimism in the stock market, a rebound in dealmaking compared to the same time last year should also benefit the banks, according to RBC Capital Markets.  "The year-on-year rebound in capital markets activity, net interest margins, and asset prices are benefiting the big-5 banks, insurers, and asset management companies," said Jonathan Golub, the chief equity strategist, in a note on Monday. "By contrast, regional bank earnings remain tepid on uninspiring loan volumes."RBC Capital Markets Over in the energy sector, crude oil has regained about 50% on average from its Q1 2016 levels. However, its 6% drop in March — the most in eight months — could mean energy companies report earnings that are lower than they had estimated, said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's head of US equity and quant strategy. Energy earnings estimates have fallen the most among sectors in the past month, she added, as the yellow bars on the chart below show.  Analysts slashed their estimates for energy earnings last month as oil prices fell. Bank of America Merrill Lynch The downgraded outlooks for industrials and materials were led by General Electric and Freeport-McMoRan respectively, according to FactSet. Dollar effect The US dollar index soared to a 14-year high after the November election. When the dollar strengthens, it tends to weaken demand for American goods and hurt the revenues of multinational companies.    The greenback has since fallen from that peak. "Such moderation could provide support for US multinationals and even encourage an opportunity to repatriate earnings held abroad should the politicos in Washington finally get around to making a deal favoring repatriation," Stoltzfus said.  Additionally, companies with foreign sales are expected to outperform their domestically oriented peers because the outlook for global growth is brightening, RBC's Golub said.   RBC Capital Markets Retail apocalypse More than 3,500 stores belonging to chains including Macy's and JCPenney are expected to close this year, as their industry undergoes a structural shift towards ecommerce.   As such, within the retail sector, apparel and department stores are forecast to report earnings declines, unlike industries like online retail and home improvement, according to RBC. In their holiday-season updates, companies including Kohl's and Target reported disappointing sales. And being an unseasonably warm winter with a record set in February, retailers could whip out the weather excuse for not clearing inventory as quickly as analysts expected.

In a statement on Monday, Britain’s second biggest bank disclosed that British authorities were investigating American Staley’s attempts to find out who wrote a letter that revealed “concerns of a personal nature” about an unnamed senior employee. New York’s Department of Financial Services is also investigating, a person familiar with the matter said. A legal investigation ordered by the bank found that Staley’s efforts involved a U.S. law enforcement agency and contradicted the company’s own policy. Barclays grants whistleblowers anonymity to prevent any retribution for their actions – in keeping with normal UK practice. “I have apologized to the Barclays board, and accepted its conclusion that my personal actions in this matter were errors on my part,” former JPMorgan banker Staley said in a statement. Barclays said its board would back Staley’s reappointment at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on May 10. Analysts said that Staley’s position as CEO could come under pressure if regulators’ reports on the case, expected to take a matter of months, were especially critical of his conduct. Staley, who took the role in Dec. 2015, stands to lose a chunk of the 1.3 million pound ($1.6 million) bonus he was awarded this year, but the final amount to be docked is yet to be decided, a separate source said. Staley said in a memo to Barclays staff on Monday that he had been attempting to protect a colleague from an unfair personal attack. “In my desire to protect our colleague, however, I got too personally involved in this matter,” Staley wrote in the memo seen by Reuters. The investigations are the latest in a series of regulatory problems for the bank, which is still dealing with investigations into employees’ manipulation of Libor benchmark interest rates. The whistleblower probe is particularly embarrassing for Barclays since it relates to recent wrongdoing rather than being a legacy of financial crisis-era misconduct, and because Staley himself has made much of the bank’s efforts to clean up its act. “I am personally very disappointed and apologetic that this situation has occurred, particularly as we strive to operate to the highest possible ethical standards,” Barclays Chairman John McFarlane said in the company’s statement. Barclays shares fell as much as 0.7 percent on Monday but were trading 0.65 percent higher by 1340 GMT. ‘HONEST MISTAKE’ Barclays’ board first heard of Staley’s attempt to identify the author of the letter in early 2017, after the issue was raised by an employee, Barclays said. The board instructed law firm Simmons & Simmons to carry out an investigation led by Gerry Grimstone, the bank’s deputy chairman, and also notified the regulators. “The investigation … found, and the board has concluded, that Mr Staley honestly, but mistakenly, believed that it was permissible to identify the author of the letter,” the bank said. The lawyers’ report also said that Staley had requested the bank’s internal security team contact U.S. enforcement officers to help identify the whistleblower, and that such assistance was received albeit without discovering the identity of the person. The board will issue a formal written reprimand to Staley and make a “very significant” adjustment to his variable compensation award. The board will also look into the position of other employees involved in the incident. Staley, 60, has embarked on a sweeping revamp of the lender’s strategy since taking over Barclays, slashing its business in Asia and Africa in favor of a new ‘transatlantic’ focus on the U.S. and Britain. A career investment banker who spent 34 years at JPMorgan, Staley is popular among staff in Barclays’ investment bank for bringing back some of its risk-taking swagger after the hairshirt regime of predecessor Antony Jenkins. The attempts to uncover the whistleblower took place despite the bank’s appointment of a ‘whistleblower champion’ – Mike Ashley, the chairman of its Board Audit Committee. In 2016, Ashley emailed all Barclays employees with a video spelling out the bank’s policy on protecting whistleblowers, according to the lender’s annual report.

In a statement, the bank disclosed that British authorities were also investigating American Staley’s attempts to identify the author of a letter that revealed “concerns of a personal nature” about an unnamed senior employee. The attempt by Staley, which a legal investigation ordered by the bank found involved a US law enforcement agency, was at odds with the company’s own policy. Barclays grants whistleblowers anonymity to prevent any retribution for their actions — in keeping with normal UK practice. “I have apologised to the Barclays board, and accepted its conclusion that my personal actions in this matter were errors on my part,” former JPMorgan banker Staley said in a statement. The board, which said it accepted Staley’s explanation that he was trying to protect a colleague from what he believed to be an unfair attack, will back his reappointment at the annual shareholder meeting on May 10. Nonetheless, the investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority casts a cloud over the bank. “I am personally very disappointed and apologetic that this situation has occurred, particularly as we strive to operate to the highest possible ethical standards,” Barclays Chairman John McFarlane said in the statement. The investigation could take months to conclude, said one person familiar with the matter. The probe into Staley’s conduct comes as the latest in a series of regulatory problems for the bank, which is still dealing with investigations into employees’ manipulation of the Libor benchmark interest rates. “Given Barclays’ history of regulatory misdemeanours ... this latest revelation represents a very significant embarrassment,” Gary Greenwood of Shore Capital wrote. Barclays’ board first heard of Staley’s attempt to identify the author of the letter in early 2017, after the issue was raised by an employee, Barclays said.

Of particular concern is a recent slowdown in loan growth, driven partly by an uptick in interest rates that dissuaded consumers and companies from refinancing loans. In February, outstanding loans across the US banking industry declined for the first time in more than three years, according to Federal Reserve data. Loans fell slightly for the first quarter overall. Analysts and investors said the lending slowdown came as a surprise, and appeared related not only to declines in mortgage refinancing and corporate borrowing but also to uncertainty about US policy and economic growth. “The loan metric doesn’t fit with the optimistic tone we’ve seen from the banks,” said Patrick Kaser, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global in Philadelphia who invests in bank stocks. The Fed lifted its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points in March, marking the second such hike in three months. But the recent climb in short-term rates has been accompanied by a drop in longer-term rates, bringing the two closer together. When yields flatten in that manner, it is not helpful to bank earnings either. The season kicks off on Thursday, when three of the country’s biggest lenders, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co, report first-quarter results. Rivals Bank of America Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley report the following week. On average, analysts expect the six biggest US banks to see a net income increase of 4.7 per cent compared to the prior year, according to Reuters data. While that may sound like a big gain, the year-ago quarter was an awful one for the banking sector, which saw capital markets activity and loan growth dry up amid mounting macroeconomic concerns. Several analysts lowered earnings estimates last week, citing loan weakness as well as sharp declines in revenue from stock trading, where commissions have come under pressure from a new regulation in Europe and broader troubles for active asset managers. Fewer deals in the first quarter also imply lower revenue from M&A banking. Altogether, the weak points are expected to outweigh small gains anticipated in businesses like fixed-income trading and wealth management. Evercore ISI bank analyst Glenn Schorr described the quarter as “OK” but “definitely not the gangbusters quarter everybody was hoping for.” Big banks have been struggling to earn decent returns on shareholder equity for some time. In recent years, they have been spending billions of dollars to settle legal claims and comply with new regulations and capital requirements. They have also launched massive cost-cutting programs and revenue-boosting initiatives. When November’s US election installed Donald Trump in the White House and business-friendly leadership in Congress, investors tended to think tough regulations would be eased and the economy would strengthen. Bank stocks were the biggest beneficiary of the so-called Trump rally, with the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index rising 32 per cent from November 7 to a peak on March 1. Banks were also the biggest contributors to gains in major blue chip indexes. But since then bank stocks have lost some of their shine, falling 6 per cent in the last month even as the broader market remained mostly flat. With the US Congress unable to pass laws on issues more pressing than financial deregulation, analysts said uncertainty around US polices including trade, taxes and spending may weigh on the economy in the near term. “Expectations were high coming into the year and while 1Q is by no means a bad quarter, revenues are probably less strong than market moves would have implied,” said Macquarie analyst David Konrad. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Activist targets GM share structure, board Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Ringgit down versus greenback Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Activist targets GM share structure, board Malaysian-based I Synergy puts expansion plan in place Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Related Articles Trump was right to strike Syria ― Nicholas Kristof Pentagon suspects chemical weapons still in Syria (VIDEO) US strike wiped out fifth of Assad’s air force World can peak planet-warming emissions by 2020, says ex-UN climate chief Manhunt underway for alleged gun thief who wrote manifesto to Trump Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The leader of the Front National told LCI television on Sunday that France wasn't responsible for arresting thousands of Jewish people and holding them at the Vel d'Hiv cycling track during the Second World War – an event that former presidents have apologized for. In response to Le Pen's comments, the centrist Emmanuel Macron said that her remarks were a "serious mistake" and some people had forgotten that the far-right leader is the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen - who previously led the party and called the Holocaust a "detail" of History. Both Le Pen and Macron are set to dispute the French presidency in the second round of the election, but French voters seem increasingly more divided and disappointed with politics as election day approaches. Opinion polls show that voters are more inclined to both political extremes, with the far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon gaining momentum. Projections published during the weekend showed Melenchon with 18 percent to 19 percent of votes, putting him in third place. "This is the most uncertain election in the history of the 5th Republic," Vincent Juvyns, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC over the phone on Monday, adding that the far-left candidate is gathering more support due to the failure of the Socialist party in pleasing voters. show chapters Mélenchon’s popularity in French election is increasing: Control Risks    Tuesday, 4 Apr 2017 | 1:22 AM ET | 01:17 However, Melenchon needs to do more if he wants to be one of the candidates in the second and final round of voting in May. "Melenchon's surge also happened in 2012," Deutsche Bank said in a note last Friday. Looking at his polling position in the month up to the election, "the similarity with the 2017 polls and momentum is striking." "If Mélenchon wants to have a chance to make it to the second round, he cannot rely on taking votes from Socialist (Benoit) Hamon anymore. He will have to adopt a different strategy and either aim to capture Le Pen's voters or Macron's voters or convince abstentionists to support him," the bank added. At the moment, surveys suggest that nearly 40 percent of the French electorate has yet to make up its mind. The indecision coupled with the expectation that this election will see higher abstention figures could aid extreme parties. "In France, participation at the Presidential elections varied between 70 percent and over 85 percent in the past 40 years. The lowest participation at the first round occurred in 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen (father of Marine Le Pen) surprisingly qualified for the second round. Historically, low participation has increased the National Front results," Deutsche Bank said. show chapters French election becoming difficult to predict: Open Citiz    Monday, 10 Apr 2017 | 1:23 AM ET | 03:17 Famke Krumbmüller, partner at Open Citiz, told CNBC on Monday that amid such high volatility "a lot can happen in the next two weeks" until the first round takes place. "The next two weeks of campaigning will obviously be extremely crucial," she said, as undecided voters might make up their minds as they head to the polls. According to Krumbmüller, French voters are looking for a candidate that shows "strength". Their vote is very much focused on personalities, but there are a lot of concrete issues on the table that will also be influencing voters, including the high level of unemployment and France's involvement in European politics.

JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. Oil prices rose more than 1 percent, with U.S. crude hitting a more than one-month high, supported by a Libyan oilfield shutdown, tension over a U.S. missile strike on Syria and signs that an OPEC-led output cut is helping to clear excess supplies. Investors are keenly watching the quarterly earnings to justify lofty market valuations, following the post-election rally sparked off by bets that Trump would introduce pro-growth policies. Earnings of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year, the most since the fourth-quarter of 2014. The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "The financial sector has been a darling performer since the election and we've seen some of that performance retreat in the last couple of weeks," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. "So what the banks report and what their guidance is will be the primary driver for equity prices over the next week or two." Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. At 10:55 a.m. ET (1455 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 84.2 points, or 0.41 percent, at 20,740.3, the S&P 500 was up 8.75 points, or 0.37 percent, at 2,364.29 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 22.63 points, or 0.38 percent, at 5,900.44. All the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 1.1 percent gain in energy. Chevron was up 1 percent while Exxon gained 0.6 percent. A raft of deals also lifted sentiment. Shares of Straight Path Communications surged nearly two-fold to $90 after AT&T offered a huge premium to buy the owner of wireless spectrum licenses. The deal also lifted shares of other communications companies. Swift Transportation jumped 23 percent to $24.64 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation. Knight's shares were up 13.5 percent at $34.75. Amazon.com was the top stock on the S&P and the Nasdaq, rising 1.3 percent to $906.73. The world's largest online retailer was upgraded to "buy" at Needham, according to a trader. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,122 to 641.

Ltd, XL Group Ltd, Berkshire Hathaway Cyber Insurance Cyber insurance market is set to grow as an outcome of an increase in data breach incidences in past 2-3 years. These attacks escalate in intensity and frequency, and pose a threat to individuals, organizations, and countries. Cyber-attacks have adverse impact on businesses such as declining customer base, disruption of business, regulatory fines, legal penalties & attorney fees, loss of intellectual property, and reputational damage. Do Enquiry For Sample Report @ goo.gl/Sxckr6 In the year 2014, there was increased number of cybercrimes with similar repercussions. Business houses such as Home Depot, Sony Entertainment, and Target had experienced data breaches that required them to pay billions of USD to cover the cost of damage. Similarly, financial institutions such as JP Morgan Chase, were also affected more severely, and had to pay huge amount to cover losses. To cater to the same, the stakeholders within the cyber insurance industry use approaches to educate consumers about the losses incurred due to cyber-attacks and stratagems to cope with them. For instance, Cyber liability insurance, which is available since last ten years, tends to protect business data from such cyber-attacks. Cyber insurance industry provides insurance products to mitigate risks and associated cost incurred due to cyber-attacks. BFSI, healthcare, and retail sector are the most targeted sectors, witnessing increase in incidences of information and identity theft, scams, and frauds. However, in the recent years, other industries such as manufacturing, construction, sports & gaming, entertainment, and education have also come under threat from cyber-attacks. Cyber insurance market growth is aided by a numerous factors. The prime factors include increase in awareness regarding cyber risks and mandatory legislations regarding cyber security in major countries, such as U.S., UK, South Korea, and Australia. In addition, rise in awareness regarding business interruption (BI) risks and related insurance products is also expected to drive the cyber insurance market. However, as this industry is complex and changes regularly, lack of standardized policies and evolving perils are projected to limit the market growth. Do Enquiry Before Purchasing Report @ goo.gl/jTQ9kD Cyber insurance market has a huge potential; however, it is largely an untapped market. Looking at spate of cyber-attacks, companies look forward to extend cyber liability to their supply chains as well, thus providing new opportunities for cyber liability insurance providers within the cyber insurance industry to innovate their insurance products. To analyze the global cyber insurance market, the cyber insurance is segmented based on company size, industry vertical, and geography. Companies are categorized as very small companies ($2.5 million to $99 million), small-sized companies ($100 million to $299 million), medium-sized companies ($300 million to $1 billion), and large ($1.1 billion and above). Among all, large companies pay larger premium for cyber liability policies, as these companies need to pay high cost to recover losses. Different industry vertical covered in this report include healthcare, retail, financial services (BFSI), information technology & services, and others (utilities, energy, manufacturing, construction, and transportation). The cyber insurance market is analyzed across four geographical regions namely, North America (U.S. and rest of North America), Europe (UK, Germany, France, and rest of Europe), Asia-Pacific (Australia, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and rest of Asia-Pacific), and LAMEA (Latin America, Middle East, and Africa). North America holds the highest cyber insurance market share, followed by Europe, owing to high frequency of cyber-attacks faced by the U.S. companies.

JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Thursday and could throw light on the US banking industry’s performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. Investors are keenly watching the quarterly earnings to justify lofty market valuations following the post-election rally, sparked off by bets that Trump would introduce pro-growth policies. Earnings of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 10.1 per cent in the first three months of the year, the most since the fourth-quarter of 2014. The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “It looks like the start of a quiet holiday week after an underwhelming Friday, where much could have happened but didn’t,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “Unless there is a significant headline to derail what looks to be a quiet morning, I think the focus is going to be on earnings and what the companies say.” Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. At 9.36am ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 32.18 points, or 0.16 per cent, at 20,688.28, the S&P 500 was up 4.49 points, or 0.19 per cent, at 2,360.03 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 13.32 points, or 0.23 per cent, at 5,891.13. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 0.43 per cent gain in energy following a more than 1 per cent rise in oil prices. A raft of deals also lifted sentiment. Shares of Straight Path Communications surged more than two-fold to US$91.75 (RM407) after AT&T offered a huge premium for the owner of wireless spectrum licenses. The deal also lifted shares of other communications companies. Swift Transportation jumped 23.4 per cent to US$24.7 after it announced a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation. Knight’s shares were up 15 per cent at US$35.20. Generic drugmaker Akorn was up 10.4 per cent at US$32.86 after confirming that it was in talks to be bought by German healthcare group Fresenius. Amazon.com was the top stock on the S&P and the Nasdaq following a “buy” upgrade by Needham, according to a trader. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,574 to 903. On the Nasdaq, 1,270 issues rose and 930 fell. The S&P 500 index showed three 52-week highs and two lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 18 highs and 10 lows. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Activist targets GM share structure, board Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Ringgit down versus greenback Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Activist targets GM share structure, board Malaysian-based I Synergy puts expansion plan in place Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Related Articles Oil set for longest gain this year as Libyan field suffers outage Wall Street sees Fed balance sheet normalisation plan by year end, poll shows Investors look to global growth for earnings power US stocks flat as March jobs growth disappoints US employment growth seen slowing as warm weather boost fades Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

It’s the only explanation. Otherwise, we’re left to assume that Hensarling was being the world’s biggest corporate shill and hypocrite when he accused the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of “abusing his authority.” In a contentious hearing last week that bordered on outright abuse, Hensarling told CFPB Director Richard Cordray that “the president is clearly justified in dismissing you and I call upon the president — yet again — to do just that, and to do it immediately. “American consumers need competitive markets and a cop on the beat to protect them from fraud and deception,” he snarled. “They don’t need Washington elites trampling on their freedom of choice and picking their financial products for them.” Advertisement Continue reading Make no mistake: Hensarling doesn’t give a damn about American consumers, and he sure as hell isn’t pushing for a “cop on the beat” to keep banks in line. What he wants is to liberate his deep-pocketed corporate patrons from regulatory oversight that’s resulted in billions of dollars being reimbursed to customers. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Hensarling has been raking in cash from the financial sector since he was first elected to Congress in 2002. The top single donor to his campaign efforts over the years is JPMorgan Chase, which has contributed $106,686. The second-biggest donor is Bank of America, which has given $86,250. Hensarling’s third-biggest donor is the rest of the banking industry in the form of the American Bankers Association, which has given him $85,300. On an industry basis, he’s received $1.3 million from commercial banks, $1.4 million from securities and investment firms, $1.4 million from insurers and $703,304 from finance and credit companies. And this is a guy with consumers’ best financial interests at heart? “Jeb Hensarling has a long, long list of contributions from banks and Wall Street firms,” Sally Greenberg, executive director of the National Consumers League, told me. “He and his committee have set their sights on the CFPB because the CFPB has been so successful at protecting consumers from being ripped off.” Since it opened for business in 2011, the bureau says it has recovered about $12 billion fleeced from consumers via illegal and questionable financial practices. It has overseen a revamping of mortgage rules, proposed new regulations for payday lenders and held dozens of firms accountable for fiscal misdeeds. Advertisement Continue reading I contacted the Financial Services Committee and said that a consumer advocate had suggested that Hensarling might be influenced by his industry ties. I asked if they’d like to respond. Sarah Rozier, a committee spokeswoman, first wanted me to name the consumer advocate, although why that should matter was a mystery. All she had to do was say, no, Hensarling isn’t influenced by the millions of dollars he’s received from financial firms. So I passed along Greenberg’s name and, an hour later, Rozier sent an email dismissing Greenberg’s organization as “a liberal group backed by labor unions.” Instead of explicitly denying that Hensarling is influenced by the money he gets from financial firms, Rozier said, “Chairman Hensarling led the fight against the Wall Street bailout in Congress.” She also said that legislation proposed by Hensarling would impose “the toughest penalties in history for those who commit fraud and insider trading.” Um, OK. Hensarling and his Republican colleagues, in their first face-to-face encounter with Cordray since the November election, spent nearly five hours Wednesday treating the CFPB chief like a pinata. The tone was set early when Hensarling said he was surprised that Cordray had shown up, even though the CFPB director is required to do so twice a year when the House Financial Services Committee requests his presence, which it did. In his next breath, Hensarling told Cordray, a former Ohio attorney general, that he’d half-expected him to be in his home state running for governor, which he isn’t. “Perhaps the rumors of your political aspirations are greatly exaggerated,” Hensarling said. Advertisement Continue reading Republicans feel that Cordray has too much power and acts with impunity. They’re emboldened by a recent court ruling that declared the CFPB’s leadership structure unconstitutional. However, that decision will be revisited by the U.S. Court of Appeals. “This tyranny must end,” Hensarling said at Wednesday’s hearing, reaching deep into his muddy bucket of hyperbole. He and other Republicans want to replace the bureau’s single director with a more easily influenced committee, and want to control the CFPB’s budget, which of course would make it vulnerable to industry lobbying. After the Republicans had taken turns getting in their licks, frequently denying Cordray a chance to respond, Rep. Michael Capuano, D-Mass., said, “Boy, they really hate you, don’t they?” Cordray replied that “it’s part of the game.” It’s not a game. If the CFPB were derelict in its mission of consumer protection, lawmakers would have every right to demand changes. But the bureau’s track record is one of unqualified success — much to the consternation of big-money banks and financial firms. “Chairman Hensarling is furious at the CFPB because it’s working, protecting consumers and holding banks and lenders accountable for their actions,” said Christine Hines, legislative director for the National Association of Consumer Advocates. “He’s made it clear that his leadership on the Financial Services Committee is strictly for the industry’s benefit.” Of all House members running for re-election last year, Hensarling was the second-largest recipient of contributions from commercial banks ($274,900), topped only by Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., ($344,399), the Center for Responsive Politics found. Advertisement Continue reading Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., seemed to put his finger on things when he told Cordray that last week’s hearing was little more than political theater. “It’s not really about any of this stuff,” he said. “It’s about the CFPB diverting money to the pockets of working Americans and not financial interests.” You can take that to the bank. —— ABOUT THE WRITER David Lazarus, a Los Angeles Times columnist, writes on consumer issues.

(File Photo | AP) NEW YORK: Tesla Motors overtook top US automaker General Motors in market capitalisation early on Monday as US stocks rose at the outset of a week that includes major bank earnings reports. Tesla's share price shot up 3.3 percent to reach a market capitalisation of $51.56 billion, $1.27 billion above GM, the latest landmark in the electric car maker's rise. Tesla surpassed Ford only last week to move into the second position behind GM. Key events this week include earnings releases on Thursday from three large banks: JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. Banks as a whole are projected to show earnings growth of 14.3 percent in the first quarter, according to CFRA Research.  Key US data this week include US retail sales for March, which is expected to show a decline of 0.1 percent, according to analysts. About 25 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 20,707.04, up 0.2 percent. The broad-based S&P 500 rose 0.3 percent to 2,362.77, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.4 percent to 5,899.93. Wells Fargo gained 0.6 percent after it clawed back $75 million in additional compensation from two executives responsible for its fake accounts scandal. AT&T lost 0.2 percent after acquiring spectrum holder Straight Path Communications for $1.6 billion.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 10 April 2017 | MYT 10:21 PM Barclays reprimands chief executive for trying to identify whistleblower LONDON: British bank Barclays has reprimanded Chief Executive Jes Staley and will cut his bonus heavily after he tried to uncover the identity of an internal company whistleblower in a case being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic. In a statement on Monday, Britain's second biggest bank disclosed that British authorities were investigating American Staley's attempts to find out who wrote a letter that revealed "concerns of a personal nature" about an unnamed senior employee. New York's Department of Financial Services is also investigating, a person familiar with the matter said. A legal investigation ordered by the bank found that Staley's efforts involved a U.S. law enforcement agency and contradicted the company's own policy. Barclays grants whistleblowers anonymity to prevent any retribution for their actions - in keeping with normal UK practice. "I have apologised to the Barclays board, and accepted its conclusion that my personal actions in this matter were errors on my part," former JPMorgan banker Staley said in a statement. Barclays said its board would back Staley's reappointment at the company's annual shareholder meeting on May 10. Analysts said that Staley's position as CEO could come under pressure if regulators' reports on the case, expected to take a matter of months, were especially critical of his conduct. Staley, who took the role in Dec. 2015, stands to lose a chunk of the 1.3 million pound ($1.6 million) bonus he was awarded this year, but the final amount to be docked is yet to be decided, a separate source said. Staley said in a memo to Barclays staff on Monday that he had been attempting to protect a colleague from an unfair personal attack. "In my desire to protect our colleague, however, I got too personally involved in this matter," Staley wrote in the memo seen by Reuters. The investigations are the latest in a series of regulatory problems for the bank, which is still dealing with investigations into employees' manipulation of Libor benchmark interest rates. The whistleblower probe is particularly embarrassing for Barclays since it relates to recent wrongdoing rather than being a legacy of financial crisis-era misconduct, and because Staley himself has made much of the bank's efforts to clean up its act. "I am personally very disappointed and apologetic that this situation has occurred, particularly as we strive to operate to the highest possible ethical standards," Barclays Chairman John McFarlane said in the company's statement. Barclays shares fell as much as 0.7 percent on Monday but were trading 0.65 percent higher by 1340 GMT. 'HONEST MISTAKE' Barclays' board first heard of Staley's attempt to identify the author of the letter in early 2017, after the issue was raised by an employee, Barclays said. The board instructed law firm Simmons & Simmons to carry out an investigation led by Gerry Grimstone, the bank's deputy chairman, and also notified the regulators. "The investigation ... found, and the board has concluded, that Mr Staley honestly, but mistakenly, believed that it was permissible to identify the author of the letter," the bank said. The lawyers' report also said that Staley had requested the bank's internal security team contact U.S. enforcement officers to help identify the whistleblower, and that such assistance was received albeit without discovering the identity of the person. The board will issue a formal written reprimand to Staley and make a "very significant" adjustment to his variable compensation award. The board will also look into the position of other employees involved in the incident. Staley, 60, has embarked on a sweeping revamp of the lender's strategy since taking over Barclays, slashing its business in Asia and Africa in favour of a new 'transatlantic' focus on the U.S. and Britain. A career investment banker who spent 34 years at JPMorgan, Staley is popular among staff in Barclays' investment bank for bringing back some of its risk-taking swagger after the hairshirt regime of predecessor Antony Jenkins. The attempts to uncover the whistleblower took place despite the bank's appointment of a 'whistleblower champion' - Mike Ashley, the chairman of its Board Audit Committee. In 2016, Ashley emailed all Barclays employees with a video spelling out the bank's policy on protecting whistleblowers, according to the lender's annual report.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 April 2017 by Military News Embrace Home Loans Launches New Digital Marketing Division MIDDLETOWN, R.I.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Embrace Home Loans, a prominent leader in the mortgage industry, has launched a new digital marketing division. Based in New York, N.Y., the new division is designed to build data-driven digital marketing capabilities to support the full mortgage sales cycle from awareness, lead generation, nurture, close and advocacy. As the marketplace changes and consumers’ expectations change, more prospective borrowers are researching lending opportunities digitally. In response to these changing expectations, Embrace Home Loans is adapting to this new generation of buyers. Working in collaboration with other departments, Embrace Home Loans’ digital division will build a digital marketing ecosystem that will integrate with the customer relationship platform. The omni-channel strategy is designed to integrate all customer touchpoints across the Embrace website, mobile, SMS, Email, Mail, Phone and in-person sales. As a part of this new initiative, Embrace named three experts in the fields of digital marketing, advertising and analytics to senior positions. Linda Benowitz is digital marketing director, Tony Branda is chief data and analytics officer, and Jorgen Persson is manager of digital demand generation Linda Benowitz, digital marketing director, was most recently at Citibank where she built a global digital insights team and accelerated data-driven digital techniques across the global consumer bank. She has been in the digital space for more than ten years and has experience in many aspects of banking including database marketing, credit and risk management, and marketing planning. Previously, she held positions at Cablevision and JP Morgan Chase in similar capacities. She holds an undergraduate degree from Cornell University and a Master’s of Business Administration from New York University’s Stern School of Business. “My vision is that Embrace Home Loans will be the premier omni-channel mortgage provider, providing the right balance of digital self-service and personal attention to service customers the way they want to be supported,” said Benowitz. “I joined the team at Embrace for two reasons. First, the opportunity to build a new team and new capabilities is motivating and exciting. Second, the team at Embrace houses some of the best in the business. From the very beginning, I was impressed with every person I met and the emphasis on people. They put a great deal of stock into building exceptional teams and developing people; that immediately drew me in.” Industry veteran, Tony Branda, stepped in as chief data and analytics officer late last year, bringing nearly 25 years of experience in the banking industry. Previously, Branda worked in executive positions with Citibank, Advance Publications Inc., RBS National Bank, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Branda also serves as an adjunct professor of digital marketing and consumer intelligence at Pace University’s Lubin Graduate School of Business. He holds a Master’s of Business Administration in Marketing and Finance from Pace University, a certification in Integrated Marketing from New York University, and is currently a doctoral candidate of Marketing and Customer Intelligence at Pace University. Under Branda’s leadership, Embrace will develop a new Enterprise data and analytics strategy and infrastructure to drive greater customer intelligence not only better data Decisioning, but also better support its overall mission of providing exceptional service. He will also create a digital nervous system to communicate digitally with customers and prospects, as well as provide marketing automation to drive more customer outreach and increase acquisitions all based on Big Data Analytics. “Under this new division, we aim to create digital awareness and intelligently target various market segments and audiences,” said Branda. “This will not only better meet the needs of today’s borrowers, but also drive performance. Borrowers will be able to complete online lead forms that we can integrate into our CRM, enabling us to further nurture those leads digitally. Overtime, we’ll increase efficiency and drive digital traffic. This is an exciting time for Embrace and the lending industry as a whole.” Embrace’s final addition to the senior digital marketing team is Jorgen Persson, who will manage SEO and paid media. Jorgen is well versed in the digital marketing field, previously holding positions such as senior marketing manager of Nordics and EU Strategic Partnerships at Vistaprint, co-founder of JAG Media Group, and director of marketing at Testive, Inc. He received a Bachelor’s of Science in Communications and Advertising from Salem State College. “We’re thrilled that Linda, Tony and Jorgen have joined the Embrace team in our continued commitment to creating a differentiating experience for our borrowers, that best matches the buying preferences of today’s customers,” said Kurt Noyce, president of Embrace Home Loans. “Today, lenders must have the ability to intelligently drive awareness through digital channels. This group will ensure Embrace remains a leader in combining technology with big data, in effectively matching our solutions to customers, allowing Embrace to continue growing in the Digital Era.” About Embrace Home Loans Founded in 1983, Embrace Home Loans is a direct lender for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, approved by FHA and VA, and an issuer for Ginnie Mae.

Investors are getting ready for the start of the earnings season. VIDEO: REUTERS JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report their quarterly earnings on April 13.PHOTO: AFP PublishedApr 10, 2017, 10:15 pm SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/4Xdy Copy NEW YORK (REUTERS) - US stocks were slightly higher on Monday as oil prices rose and as investors prepared for big banks to kick off the first-quarter earnings season later in the week. JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Thursday and could throw light on the US banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. Investors are keenly watching the quarterly earnings to justify lofty market valuations following the post-election rally, sparked off by bets that Trump would introduce pro-growth policies. Earnings of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 10.1 per cent in the first three months of the year, the most since the fourth-quarter of 2014. The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "It looks like the start of a quiet holiday week after an underwhelming Friday, where much could have happened but didn't," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. "Unless there is a significant headline to derail what looks to be a quiet morning, I think the focus is going to be on earnings and what the companies say." Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. At 9:36 a.m. ET (9:36 p.m Singapore time), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 32.18 points, or 0.16 per cent, at 20,688.28, the S&P 500 was up 4.49 points, or 0.19 per cent, at 2,360.03 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 13.32 points, or 0.23 per cent, at 5,891.13. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 0.43 percent gain in energy following a more than 1 percent rise in oil prices.

JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Thursday and could throw light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. Investors are keenly watching the quarterly earnings to justify lofty market valuations following the post-election rally, sparked off by bets that Trump would introduce pro-growth policies.

Eight of the 11 major S&amp;P sectors were higher, led by a 0.43 percent gain in energy following a more than 1 percent rise in oil prices. A raft of deals also lifted sentiment. Shares of Straight Path Communications surged more than two-fold to $91.75 after AT&amp;T offered a huge premium for the owner of wireless spectrum licenses. The deal also lifted shares of other communications companies. Swift Transportation jumped 23.4 percent to $24.7 after it announced a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation. Knight's shares were up 15 percent at $35.20. Generic drugmaker Akorn was up 10.4 percent at $32.86 after confirming that it was in talks to be bought by German healthcare group Fresenius. Amazon.com was the top stock on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq following a "buy" upgrade by Needham, according to a trader. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,574 to 903. On the Nasdaq, 1,270 issues rose and 930 fell. The S&amp;P 500 index showed three 52-week highs and two lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 18 highs and 10 lows.

Notably for the quarter, rate hike remains a concern because of its high exposure to long-term leased assets. Further, intense competition with national and local healthcare operators, earnings-dilutive effects of disposition, and considerable upfront costs associated with acquisitions and developments are concerns before the company. However, its diversified portfolio and strategic investments are expected to serve as growth drivers for Welltower in the long run.

We like this definition. (Marketwired) – Carry The Load announces Chase, the U.S. consumer and commercial banking business of JPMorgan Chase & Co., as the presenting sponsor of its 2017 National Relay for the third consecutive year. Chase’s support helps ensure that Carry The Load, started in 2011, can commit to providing active, meaningful ways to honor and celebrate the sacrifices made by our nation’s heroes. As part of its Awareness Program, Carry The Load hosts its annual National Relay throughout the month of May to honor the sacrifices made by our nation’s heroes. Funds are raised throughout May for Carry The Load’s Continuum of Care Program which provides direct services to military, law enforcement, fire and rescue personnel, and their families through our partnerships with other nonprofits across the country. “Six years ago, we set out to restore the true meaning of Memorial Day — a holiday deserving of our nation’s attention, affection and respect,” said Stephen Holley, president and CEO of Carry The Load. “We’ve since broadened our mission to include more than just our military heroes and more than just one holiday. We are proud that Chase continues to help us, and America, celebrate, honor and remember those who sacrifice for us daily.” The 31-day relay will span more than 6,000 total miles and is comprised of a 2,100-mile East Coast route from West Point, NY to Dallas and a 4,100-mile West Coast route from Seattle to Dallas. The two routes converge in Dallas on Memorial Day for a more than 20-hour and 17-minute Memorial March. Registration information and event details can be found at carrytheload.org. “It’s our honor and privilege to support Carry The Load again this year and the important message that we must remember our service members and first responders who gave the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of us all,” said JPMorgan Chase Head of Military and Veterans Affairs Ross A. Brown. From April 28 to May 28, the relay will progress 24 hours a day, with rallies taking place in various cities and towns along the route. Chase will host rallies in Seattle, New York City, Wilmington, Del., Phoenix, Columbus, Ohio, Tampa, Fla. and Jacksonville, Fla. where thousands of employees and volunteers in the communities will walk and gather to remember those who have lost their lives. Chase’s support of Carry The Load reflects the firm’s ongoing commitment to the veteran and military communities. Since 2011, the firm has hired more than 11,000 veterans and developed programs aimed at retaining and supporting veterans throughout their post-service careers. These efforts include leading the Veteran Jobs Mission — previously the 100,000 Jobs Mission — a coalition founded in 2011 by JPMorgan Chase and 10 other companies with the goal of hiring 100,000 veterans. Now more than 235 members strong, the coalition has collectively hired more than 380,000 veterans, and is ultimately committed to hiring 1 million. About Carry The Load® Carry The Load is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded in 2011 by two former Navy SEALs. Carry The Load’s mission is to provide an active way to honor and celebrate our nation’s heroes by connecting Americans to the sacrifices made by Military, Law Enforcement, Firefighters and First Responders. Funds raised during Memorial May programs allow Carry The Load to grow its vision and execute its mission, as well as provide existing nonprofit partners with valuable visibility, resources and meaningful connections.

JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Thursday and could throw light on the U.S. banking industry's performance after a strong finish in the fourth quarter. Investors are keenly watching the quarterly results to justify lofty market valuations following a post-election rally, sparked off by bets that President Donald Trump would introduce pro-growth policies. Earnings of S&amp;P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year, the most since the fourth-quarter of 2014. The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "It looks like the start of a quiet holiday week after an underwhelming Friday, where much could have happened but didn't," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. "Unless there is a significant headline to derail what looks to be a quiet morning, I think the focus is going to be on earnings and what the companies say." Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Dow e-minis were up 12 points, or 0.06 percent, at 8:27 a.m. ET (1227 GMT), with 19,034 contracts changing hands. S&amp;P 500 e-minis were up 2.5 points, or 0.11 percent, with 124,848 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 3.5 points, or 0.06 percent, on volume of 19,954 contracts. Oil prices rose more than 1 percent on Monday, with Brent crude moving above $55 per barrel following a shutdown at Libya's largest oilfield and tension over Syria after a U.S. missile strike. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak in Michigan after markets close. Investors will be looking to clues on the central bank's plans to trim its $4.5 trillion balance sheet after recent comments from Fed officials. Shares of Straight Path Communications surged more than two-fold to $92.99 premarket after AT&amp;T said it would buy the company for $95.63 per share in an all-stock deal. Swift Transportation rose 14.4 percent to $22.90 after it announced a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation. Knight's shares were up 2.6 percent. Generic drugmaker Akorn was up 11 percent at $32.99 after confirming that it was in talks to be bought by German healthcare group Fresenius.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 April 2017 by Military News Chase Named Presenting Sponsor of Carry The Load® Contribution from Chase for the third consecutive year enables nonprofit to continue honoring our nation’s heroes DALLAS, Apr. 10 /CSRwire/ – (Marketwired) – Carry The Load announces Chase, the U.S. consumer and commercial banking business of JPMorgan Chase & Co., as the presenting sponsor of its 2017 National Relay for the third consecutive year. Chase’s support helps ensure that Carry The Load, started in 2011, can commit to providing active, meaningful ways to honor and celebrate the sacrifices made by our nation’s heroes. As part of its Awareness Program, Carry The Load hosts its annual National Relay throughout the month of May to honor the sacrifices made by our nation’s heroes. Funds are raised throughout May for Carry The Load’s Continuum of Care Program which provides direct services to military, law enforcement, fire and rescue personnel, and their families through our partnerships with other nonprofits across the country. „Six years ago, we set out to restore the true meaning of Memorial Day — a holiday deserving of our nation’s attention, affection and respect,” said Stephen Holley, president and CEO of Carry The Load. „We’ve since broadened our mission to include more than just our military heroes and more than just one holiday. We are proud that Chase continues to help us, and America, celebrate, honor and remember those who sacrifice for us daily.” The 31-day relay will span more than 6,000 total miles and is comprised of a 2,100-mile East Coast route from West Point, NY to Dallas and a 4,100-mile West Coast route from Seattle to Dallas. The two routes converge in Dallas on Memorial Day for a more than 20-hour and 17-minute Memorial March. Registration information and event details can be found at carrytheload.org. „It’s our honor and privilege to support Carry The Load again this year and the important message that we must remember our service members and first responders who gave the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of us all,” said JPMorgan Chase Head of Military and Veterans Affairs Ross A. Brown. From April 28 to May 28, the relay will progress 24 hours a day, with rallies taking place in various cities and towns along the route. Chase will host rallies in Seattle, New York City, Wilmington, Del., Phoenix, Columbus, Ohio, Tampa, Fla. and Jacksonville, Fla. where thousands of employees and volunteers in the communities will walk and gather to remember those who have lost their lives. Chase’s support of Carry The Load reflects the firm’s ongoing commitment to the veteran and military communities. Since 2011, the firm has hired more than 11,000 veterans and developed programs aimed at retaining and supporting veterans throughout their post-service careers. These efforts include leading the Veteran Jobs Mission — previously the 100,000 Jobs Mission — a coalition founded in 2011 by JPMorgan Chase and 10 other companies with the goal of hiring 100,000 veterans. Now more than 235 members strong, the coalition has collectively hired more than 380,000 veterans, and is ultimately committed to hiring 1 million.

Carry The Load’s mission is to provide an active way to honor and celebrate our nation’s heroes by connecting Americans to the sacrifices made by Military, Law Enforcement, Firefighters and First Responders.

JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Thursday and could throw light on the U.S. banking industry's performance after a strong finish in the fourth quarter. Investors are keenly watching the quarterly results to justify lofty market valuations following a post-election rally, sparked off by bets that President Donald Trump would introduce pro-growth policies. Earnings of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year, the most since the fourth-quarter of 2014. The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "It looks like the start of a quiet holiday week after an underwhelming Friday, where much could have happened but didn't," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. "Unless there is a significant headline to derail what looks to be a quiet morning, I think the focus is going to be on earnings and what the companies say." Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Dow e-minis were up 12 points, or 0.06 percent, at 8:27 a.m. ET (1227 GMT), with 19,034 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were up 2.5 points, or 0.11 percent, with 124,848 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 3.5 points, or 0.06 percent, on volume of 19,954 contracts. Oil prices rose more than 1 percent on Monday, with Brent crude moving above $55 per barrel following a shutdown at Libya's largest oilfield and tension over Syria after a U.S. missile strike. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak in Michigan after markets close. Investors will be looking to clues on the central bank's plans to trim its $4.5 trillion balance sheet after recent comments from Fed officials.

Chase's support helps ensure that Carry The Load, started in 2011, can commit to providing active, meaningful ways to honor and celebrate the sacrifices made by our nation's heroes. As part of its Awareness Program, Carry The Load hosts its annual National Relay throughout the month of May to honor the sacrifices made by our nation's heroes. Funds are raised throughout May for Carry The Load's Continuum of Care Program which provides direct services to military, law enforcement, fire and rescue personnel, and their families through our partnerships with other nonprofits across the country. "Six years ago, we set out to restore the true meaning of Memorial Day – a holiday deserving of our nation's attention, affection and respect," said Stephen Holley, president and CEO of Carry The Load. "We've since broadened our mission to include more than just our military heroes and more than just one holiday. We are proud that Chase continues to help us, and America, celebrate, honor and remember those who sacrifice for us daily." The 31-day relay will span more than 6,000 total miles and is comprised of a 2,100-mile East Coast route from West Point, NY to Dallas and a 4,100-mile West Coast route from Seattle to Dallas. The two routes converge in Dallas on Memorial Day for a more than 20-hour and 17-minute Memorial March. Registration information and event details can be found at carrytheload.org. "It's our honor and privilege to support Carry The Load again this year and the important message that we must remember our service members and first responders who gave the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of us all," said JPMorgan Chase Head of Military and Veterans Affairs Ross A. Brown. From April 28 to May 28, the relay will progress 24 hours a day, with rallies taking place in various cities and towns along the route. Chase will host rallies in Seattle, New York City, Wilmington, Del., Phoenix, Columbus, Ohio, Tampa, Fla. and Jacksonville, Fla. where thousands of employees and volunteers in the communities will walk and gather to remember those who have lost their lives. Chase's support of Carry The Load reflects the firm's ongoing commitment to the veteran and military communities. Since 2011, the firm has hired more than 11,000 veterans and developed programs aimed at retaining and supporting veterans throughout their post-service careers. These efforts include leading the Veteran Jobs Mission – previously the 100,000 Jobs Mission – a coalition founded in 2011 by JPMorgan Chase and 10 other companies with the goal of hiring 100,000 veterans. Now more than 235 members strong, the coalition has collectively hired more than 380,000 veterans, and is ultimately committed to hiring 1 million. About Carry The Load® Carry The Load is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded in 2011 by two former Navy SEALs. Carry The Load's mission is to provide an active way to honor and celebrate our nation's heroes by connecting Americans to the sacrifices made by Military, Law Enforcement, Firefighters and First Responders.

She is a qualified chartered accountant. Follow @GillianTan Facebook Twitter Email Print Share April 10, 2017 7:30 AM EDT (Corrected April 10, 2017 12:18 PM EDT ) WELLS FARGO & CO -0.30 At Closing, April 10th 54.54 USD Wells Fargo shareholders should prepare to make history.  I've written before that the bank's board of directors could use a shake-up after a retail-banking scandal that has cost the lender more than just a $110 million settlement with customers and a separate $185 million settlement with federal regulators and the Los Angeles city attorney’s office. Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. took that idea a step further. On Friday, it recommended that at the annual meeting on April 25, investors should vote for only three of the company's 15 directors: Two who joined in February and the new CEO, Tim Sloan.   Tenured The average Wells Fargo director has served for a little less than eight years Source: ISS That recommendation took on added urgency on Monday after the bank released the results of a six-month investigation by a panel of independent directors, who deflected blame, saying that top executives including former CEO John Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of community banking, misled them about the extent of the issues with the bank's sales practices. On Monday, Wells Fargo's directors said that they were clawing back an additional $75 million in compensation from Stumpf and Tolstedt. (Tolstedt's attorneys told Bloomberg News that they "strongly disagreed with the report and its attempt to lay blame" with their client.)  As expected, Wells Fargo & Co. has defended its board, describing ISS's recommendation as "extreme and unprecedented." It added that the firm isn't giving the bank credit for enhanced accountability, including forgone executive compensation and an improved corporate governance structure. One highlight of the latter was the bank's decision to split the CEO and chairman roles, which to be fair is something that investors in other major U.S. banks like Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are still confronting. While these moves should be applauded, starting with what's basically a clean slate would allow the company to tap new directors with original ideas on how to drive loan growth or refine overall strategy, possibly by fueling investments into various parts of its business. And if the majority of investors are prepared to shake things up, it'll be one for the record books. Apart from instances of shareholder activism, it's rare for the majority of a board to exit. But it's happened on occasion, including once in 2008. ISS recommended that shareholders withhold votes for all nine Cooper Cos. directors because the company amended its poison pill provisions without giving shareholders a say. In the end, five didn't receive enough shareholder support.  Still, obtaining consensus is tricky, especially if some shareholders are nonplussed. After Target Corp.'s massive data breach in 2013, ISS recommended against supporting the re-election of seven out of 10 directors, citing inadequate risk oversight. But when it came down to it, investors deemed them fit to stay on in their roles, and the board remained intact.  Count 'Em on Two Hands Over the past decade, just 57 directors have failed to receive majority support at annual meetings. Of those, only 30 left their posts. Source: ISS Analytics In fact, since 2007, out of a pool of more than 37,000 elections, just 57 directors have failed to receive majority support from shareholders, according to ISS Analytics, the data and analytics arm of ISS. What's more eyebrow-raising is of those, 27 have been able to hang onto their board seats, generally because their companies don't have majority vote standards, which allows directors to be re-elected even without overwhelming support from investors.   Lackluster Wells Fargo's retail-account scandal has weighed on its shares Source: Bloomberg To its credit, Wells Fargo does have majority vote standards, so if the bulk of shareholders decide not to support the re-election of one or more directors, that decision will stick. And the bank's relative underperformance to its peers over the past 12 months -- a gain of 17 percent compared with JPMorgan's 50 percent, Bank of America's 80 percent and Citigroup Inc.'s 48 percent -- may provide ample motivation for a change in direction.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. (Adds fourth paragraph on investigation by independent directors.) Glass Lewis & Co., another proxy adviser, recommended shareholders oppose the re-election of six directors. For the 30 directors that were relieved of their duties, the voting was relatively close, with an average 42.6 percent of their respective shareholders casting favorable votes.

Chase's support helps ensure that Carry The Load, started in 2011, can commit to providing active, meaningful ways to honor and celebrate the sacrifices made by our nation's heroes. As part of its Awareness Program, Carry The Load hosts its annual National Relay throughout the month of May to honor the sacrifices made by our nation's heroes. Funds are raised throughout May for Carry The Load's Continuum of Care Program which provides direct services to military, law enforcement, fire and rescue personnel, and their families through our partnerships with other nonprofits across the country. "Six years ago, we set out to restore the true meaning of Memorial Day – a holiday deserving of our nation's attention, affection and respect," said Stephen Holley, president and CEO of Carry The Load. "We've since broadened our mission to include more than just our military heroes and more than just one holiday. We are proud that Chase continues to help us, and America, celebrate, honor and remember those who sacrifice for us daily." The 31-day relay will span more than 6,000 total miles and is comprised of a 2,100-mile East Coast route from West Point, NY to Dallas and a 4,100-mile West Coast route from Seattle to Dallas. The two routes converge in Dallas on Memorial Day for a more than 20-hour and 17-minute Memorial March. Registration information and event details can be found at carrytheload.org. "It's our honor and privilege to support Carry The Load again this year and the important message that we must remember our service members and first responders who gave the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of us all," said JPMorgan Chase Head of Military and Veterans Affairs Ross A. Brown. From April 28 to May 28, the relay will progress 24 hours a day, with rallies taking place in various cities and towns along the route. Chase will host rallies in Seattle, New York City, Wilmington, Del., Phoenix, Columbus, Ohio, Tampa, Fla. and Jacksonville, Fla. where thousands of employees and volunteers in the communities will walk and gather to remember those who have lost their lives.

In June 2016, members of Barclays’ board of directors and a senior executive at the bank each received letters outlining what the senders described as concerns “of a personal nature” about a high-ranking employee, the bank said in an April 10 statement. The authors of the letters also flagged that Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley knew about the issues and had played a role in dealing with it when he and the person in question were both employed elsewhere, Barclays said. The person is Tim Main, who was hired in June as chairman of the bank’s global financial institutions group, according to a person familiar with the matter. Staley and Main previously worked together at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Those letters, which also raised concerns about the “appropriateness” of Barclays’ recruitment process, were registered as whistle-blower complaints by the bank’s compliance department, the bank said. Given a Copy When Staley was given a copy of the letter sent to the board and learned of the other, he asked the bank’s security team to try and find out who wrote them. Staley considered the letters to be an “unfair personal attack” on the employee, according to Barclays. Staley was told it was inappropriate for him to try to identify the authors, the bank said. In July, Staley asked if the whistle-blowing allegations had been dismissed and came to believe he had a right to find the identity of the authors, the bank said. He again asked bank security to identify the author of the first letter. In the course of doing so, security staff reached out to a U.S. law enforcement agency, Barclays said, declining to name which one. The U.S. agency did provide some assistance to Barclays, and Staley was apprised of the situation, the bank said without going into specifics. Even with the help, Barclays said it wasn’t able to identify the author of the first letter and said no further efforts were made to unmask the person. New Rules In the wake of the Libor rate rigging case and a payment protection insurance scandal, the U.K.’s Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards recommended in 2013 that new regulations be adopted to encourage bank employees to report wrongdoing to the authorities. Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up The Financial Conduct Authority held a consultation in 2015 and implemented new rules in September 2016 requiring financial institutions to establish robust procedures for protecting employees who report potential wrongdoing. These measures include appointing a senior manager to act as a "whistle-blower champion," installing protocols for handling an array of disclosures, and producing an annual report for the board on the effectiveness of the program. Barclays overhauled its whistle-blower system around 2015 and made a push to publicize it internally, a person familiar with the program said. It’s up to the banks themselves to decide how they protect the confidentiality of whistle-blowers, said Arpita Dutt, a partner who specializes in such cases at BDBF LLP, a London law firm. Barclays assures employees that it will "make every reasonable effort to hold your name in confidence," according to its policies published on its website. "It’s quite alarming that the person at the top of the bank doesn’t know what his own policy says and how important it is to preserve the confidentiality for whistle-blowers," Dutt said. "That could reverberate across the bank and dissuade potential whistle-blowers from coming forward." Adequacy Concerns The bank’s board first learned of Staley’s attempts to identify the authors early this year, when an employee raised concerns about the adequacy of the bank’s whistle-blowing procedures. Barclays hired the law firm of Simmons & Simmons to probe the issue and informed the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority. The FCA is investigating both Staley’s individual conduct and the bank’s responsibilities and controls in connection with whistle-blowing, the Barclays said in a statement. The case is also under scrutiny by the Department of Financial Services in New York, a person familiar with the matter said. The FCA, which has wide reaching investigative powers, will probably examine whether Staley breached its conduct rules, said Josephine Van Lierop, a senior associate at Slater and Gordon LLP. A spokesman for the FCA declined to comment. Barclays said in the April 10 statement that Staley’s belief he had a right to know the name was “mistaken,” reprimanded him and cut his compensation by an undisclosed but “very significant” amount. Nevertheless, the board said it retained its “unanimous confidence” in the American to be reappointed as CEO at the upcoming annual meeting on May 10.

In a statement, the bank disclosed that British authorities were also investigating American Staley's attempts to identify the author of a letter that revealed "concerns of a personal nature" about an unnamed senior employee. The attempt by Staley, which a legal investigation ordered by the bank found involved a US law enforcement agency, was at odds with the company's own policy. Barclays grants whistleblowers anonymity to prevent any retribution for their actions — in keeping with normal UK practice. "I have apologised to the Barclays board, and accepted its conclusion that my personal actions in this matter were errors on my part," former JPMorgan banker Staley said in a statement. The board, which said it accepted Staley's explanation that he was trying to protect a colleague from what he believed to be an unfair attack, will back his reappointment at the annual shareholder meeting on May 10. Nonetheless, the investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority casts a cloud over the bank. "I am personally very disappointed and apologetic that this situation has occurred, particularly as we strive to operate to the highest possible ethical standards," Barclays Chairman John McFarlane said in the statement. The investigation could take months to conclude, said one person familiar with the matter. The probe into Staley's conduct comes as the latest in a series of regulatory problems for the bank, which is still dealing with investigations into employees' manipulation of the Libor benchmark interest rates. "Given Barclays' history of regulatory misdemeanours ... this latest revelation represents a very significant embarrassment," Gary Greenwood of Shore Capital wrote. Barclays shares fell as much as 0.7 percent on Monday but were trading little changed by 09:45 GMT. 'HONEST MISTAKE' Barclays' board first heard of Staley's attempt to identify the author of the letter in early 2017, after the issue was raised by an employee, Barclays said. The board instructed law firm Simmons & Simmons to carry out an investigation led by Gerry Grimstone, the bank's deputy chairman, and also notified the regulators. "The investigation ... found, and the board has concluded, that Mr Staley honestly, but mistakenly, believed that it was permissible to identify the author of the letter," the bank said. The lawyers' report also said that Staley had requested the bank's internal security team contact U.S. enforcement officers to help identify the whistleblower, and that such assistance was received albeit without discovering the identity of the person. The board will issue a formal written reprimand to Staley and make a "very significant" adjustment to his variable compensation award. The board will also look into the position of other employees involved in the incident. Staley, 60, has embarked on a sweeping revamp of the lender's strategy since taking over Barclays in December 2015, slashing its business in Asia and Africa in favour of a new 'transatlantic' focus on the US and Britain. A career investment banker who spent 34 years at JPMorgan, Staley is popular among staff in Barclays' investment bank for bringing back some of its risk-taking swagger after the hairshirt regime of predecessor Antony Jenkins. The attempts to uncover the whistleblower took place despite the bank's appointment of a 'whistleblower champion' - Mike Ashley, the chairman of its Board Audit Committee. In 2016, Ashley emailed all Barclays employees with a video spelling out the bank's policy on protecting whistleblowers, according to the lender's annual report. The regulators are now looking at Barclays' systems and controls and culture relating to whistleblowing, the bank said.

Take your FirstStep Barclays reprimands CEO Jes Staley for attempting to uncover whistleblower Barclays grants whistleblowers anonymity to prevent any retribution for their actions Barclays grants whistleblowers anonymity to prevent any retribution for their actions Barclays has reprimanded Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jes Staley and will cut his bonus for attempting to uncover a whistleblower's identity, the British bank said on Monday, dealing a blow to a man who has been in the role little over 15 months. In a statement, the bank disclosed that British authorities were also investigating American Staley's attempts to identify the author of a letter that revealed "concerns of a personal nature" about an unnamed senior employee. The attempt by Staley, which a legal investigation ordered by the bank found involved a US law enforcement agency, was at odds with the company's own policy. Barclays grants whistleblowers anonymity to prevent any retribution for their actions — in keeping with normal UK practice. "I have apologised to the Barclays board, and accepted its conclusion that my personal actions in this matter were errors on my part," former JPMorgan banker Staley said in a statement. The board, which said it accepted Staley's explanation that he was trying to protect a colleague from what he believed to be an unfair attack, will back his reappointment at the annual shareholder meeting on May 10. Nonetheless, the investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority casts a cloud over the bank. "I am personally very disappointed and apologetic that this situation has occurred, particularly as we strive to operate to the highest possible ethical standards," Barclays Chairman John McFarlane said in the statement. The investigation could take months to conclude, said one person familiar with the matter. The probe into Staley's conduct comes as the latest in a series of regulatory problems for the bank, which is still dealing with investigations into employees' manipulation of the Libor benchmark interest rates. "Given Barclays' history of regulatory misdemeanours ... this latest revelation represents a very significant embarrassment," Gary Greenwood of Shore Capital wrote. Barclays shares fell as much as 0.7 percent on Monday but were trading little changed by 09:45 GMT. 'HONEST MISTAKE' Barclays' board first heard of Staley's attempt to identify the author of the letter in early 2017, after the issue was raised by an employee, Barclays said. The board instructed law firm Simmons & Simmons to carry out an investigation led by Gerry Grimstone, the bank's deputy chairman, and also notified the regulators. "The investigation ... found, and the board has concluded, that Mr Staley honestly, but mistakenly, believed that it was permissible to identify the author of the letter," the bank said. The lawyers' report also said that Staley had requested the bank's internal security team contact U.S. enforcement officers to help identify the whistleblower, and that such assistance was received albeit without discovering the identity of the person. The board will issue a formal written reprimand to Staley and make a "very significant" adjustment to his variable compensation award. The board will also look into the position of other employees involved in the incident.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 7:40 PM, April 10, 2017 Updated: 7:30 AM, April 11, 2017 NEW YORK - U.S. stocks ended a choppy session slightly higher on Monday as gains in energy shares offset losses in financials ahead of quarterly corporate earnings later this week. Geopolitical tensions added to the choppiness. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons were a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that "a response is likely" if they pose a danger. With trading slow at the beginning of a holiday-shortened week, volume was the lightest of the year so far. The S&P energy index <.SPNY>, up 0.8 percent, was the day's best-performing S&P 500 sector, following gains in oil prices. Investors prepared for the start of quarterly profit reports, with earnings of S&P 500 companies estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Energy companies, hit by a selloff in oil prices last year, are expected to show the greatest strength with a 600 percent year-over-year earnings increase. "The key will be oil stocks given how volatile oil has been since the election," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which has about $50 million in assets under management. The energy index is down 6 percent for the year to date. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was up 1.92 points, or 0.01 percent, to 20,658.02, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 1.62 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,357.16 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 3.11 points, or 0.05 percent, to 5,880.93. Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Just 5.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday. The daily average for the past 20 trading days is 6.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. JPMorgan <JPM.N>, Citigroup <C.N> and Wells Fargo <WFC.N> are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. Bank stocks have retreated recently as investors question lofty valuations and Trump's ability to swiftly introduce simpler regulations and other policies following the failure of a healthcare reform bill. The S&P 500 financial sector <.SPSY> was off 0.3 percent. Traders attributed a stock dip around noon to unverified rumors stemming from weekend news related to North Korea. "You've had a lot of geopolitical news that could have driven this market a lot lower, and I think it's a huge relief that the market has held up so well," Dollarhide said. Whole Foods Market <WFM.O> was the S&P 500's biggest percentage gainer on the day, rising 10 percent after activist investor Jana Partners LLC disclosed an 8.3 percent stake in the company as it looks to shake up the company's board. Swift Transportation <SWFT.N> jumped 23.7 percent to $24.77 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation <KNX.N>. Knight's shares were up 13.4 percent.

The UK Financial Conduct Authority is investigating both Staley’s individual conduct relating to the complaint and the bank’s responsibilities and controls in connection with whistle-blowing, the bank said in a statement. Staley, who will be reprimanded by the firm, has admitted his error and formally apologized to the board, Barclays said. He could be fined and faces a ban if he is deemed by the FCA not to be a “fit and proper” person to lead a bank. Share this story Chief executive officer of Barclays, Jes Staley, takes part in the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit in New York Staley tried to identify a tipster who alerted the bank to a personal matter involving a senior executive, the bank said, confirming what a person with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg earlier Monday. An investigation by law firm Simmons & Simmons commissioned by Barclays concluded that Staley “honestly, but mistakenly” believed that it was permissible to identify the author of the letter. The case is also under scrutiny by the Department of Financial Services in New York, the person said. “At present Staley will probably survive as CEO, but if other allegations of unethical behaviour emerge, this could change,” said Andre Spicer, a professor specializing in organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School at City University in London. "No one within the bank is likely to trust the whistle-blowing system anymore." Staley, 60, has made overhauling Barclays’s culture and restoring its reputation the centerpiece of his tenure, after the bank was fined billions of pounds over scandals including rigging Libor, gaming currency markets and wrongfully selling customers insurance products they didn’t need. The FCA and Serious Fraud Office are also investigating the bank’s 2008 emergency fundraising backed by Qatar, where questions have been raised about the proper disclosure of fees and services agreements between the two parties. Barclays shares dropped as much as 1.2 percent in London trading, and were little changed at 215.35 pence as of 11:07 a.m. The stock has fallen about 3.6 percent this year, giving the company a market value of about 36.7 billion pounds ($45.4 billion). “I have apologised to the Barclays board and accepted its conclusion that my personal actions in this matter were errors on my part,” Staley said in the statement. “I will also accept whatever sanction it deems appropriate. I will cooperate fully with the FCA and the Prudential Regulatory Authority, which are now both examining this matter.” Rebuffing Staley has recruited several former colleagues from JPMorgan Chase & Co, where he spent more than three decades. The CEO rebuffed calls to spin off or radically shrink the securities unit, instead opting to speed up sales of unwanted assets and sell down the firm’s African banking stake to reduce the bank’s capital requirements. Staley received a 1.3 million-pound annual bonus and he may be docked the entire amount as a result of the scandal, according to a person familiar with the board’s investigation. The bank will not make a decision about how much to deduct until after the UK regulators complete their investigation. The CEO was awarded 7.53 million pounds in total compensation including benefits for last year. Given the bank’s history of regulatory mishaps, the latest investigation is a “very significant embarrassment” for the board as it tries to rebuild Barclays’s reputation, and a “serious knock” for Staley, Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood wrote in a note to investors, adding he doesn’t think the CEO should be fired. “It remains to be seen whether the PRA and FCA come to the same conclusion as the Board in allowing him to remain in his post. It is possible that the group may also be fined by the regulators.” Read also: Barclays to pay R13bn to split from African business The attempt to identify the whistle-blower came to the attention of the Barclays board early this year after an employee raised concerns. The board notified the FCA and the PRA and other authorities. “The Board has concluded that Jes Staley, group chief executive officer, honestly, but mistakenly, believed that it was permissible to identify the author of the letter and has accepted his explanation that he was trying to protect a colleague who had experienced personal difficulties in the past from what he believed to be an unfair attack, and has accepted his apology,” Chairman John McFarlane said in the statement. US law enforcement In June, the board received a letter and a senior executive another anonymous letter raising concerns about an employee recruited by Barclays earlier that year. Amongst other issues, the letters raised concerns of a personal nature about the senior employee, Staley’s knowledge of and role in dealing with those issues at a previous employer. Staley requested that the bank’s Group Information Security team identify the author, yet was informed it was “not appropriate” to do so. The following month, the CEO again asked the GIS team to unmask the whistle-blower and this time received assistance from US law enforcement agencies, according to Barclays’s statement. The allegations in the letters relate to Tim Main, who was hired in June as chairman of the bank’s global financial institutions group, according to a person familiar with the case. Main joined from Evercore Partners and previously worked under Staley at JPMorgan. Other Barclays employees, in addition to Staley, are also under probe for violating conduct, the person said. Main didn’t immediately respond to an email and a spokesman for Barclays declined to elaborate on the case. Patrick Burton, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London, declined to comment.

Posted 10 Apr 2017 19:35 Updated 11 Apr 2017 07:50 FILE PHOTO: A street sign for Wall Street is seen outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in Manhattan, New York City, U.S. December 28, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks ended a choppy session slightly higher on Monday as gains in energy shares offset losses in financials ahead of quarterly corporate earnings later this week. Geopolitical tensions added to the choppiness. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons were a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that "a response is likely" if they pose a danger. With trading slow at the beginning of a holiday-shortened week, volume was the lightest of the year so far. The S&P energy index , up 0.8 percent, was the day's best-performing S&P 500 sector, following gains in oil prices. Investors prepared for the start of quarterly profit reports, with earnings of S&P 500 companies estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Energy companies, hit by a selloff in oil prices last year, are expected to show the greatest strength with a 600 percent year-over-year earnings increase. "The key will be oil stocks given how volatile oil has been since the election," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which has about US$50 million in assets under management. The energy index is down 6 percent for the year to date. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.92 points, or 0.01 percent, to 20,658.02, the S&P 500 gained 1.62 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,357.16 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.11 points, or 0.05 percent, to 5,880.93. Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Just 5.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday. The daily average for the past 20 trading days is 6.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. JPMorgan , Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. Bank stocks have retreated recently as investors question lofty valuations and Trump's ability to swiftly introduce simpler regulations and other policies following the failure of a healthcare reform bill. The S&P 500 financial sector was off 0.3 percent. Traders attributed a stock dip around noon to unverified rumors stemming from weekend news related to North Korea. "You've had a lot of geopolitical news that could have driven this market a lot lower, and I think it's a huge relief that the market has held up so well," Dollarhide said. Whole Foods Market was the S&P 500's biggest percentage gainer on the day, rising 10 percent after activist investor Jana Partners LLC disclosed an 8.3 percent stake in the company as it looks to shake up the company's board. Swift Transportation jumped 23.7 percent to US$24.77 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation . Knight's shares were up 13.4 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 68 new highs and 38 new lows.

Home Love & Sex Fashion Health Fitness Your Rights Parenting Advice JAMAICA OBSERVER Menu Home Love & Sex Fashion Health Fitness Your Rights Parenting Advice Lionel Rookwood Nadeen Matthews: A global leader All Woman Monday, April 10, 2017 , By KIMBERLEY HIBBERT Tweet NADEEN Matthews is a creative, solutions-oriented woman who believes in dreaming big and being open for change. Matthews, 37, said such beliefs were nurtured after she left Jamaica for New York at age 11. While in junior high school she got accepted to attend the top specialised maths and science high school in New York. “I had auditioned for LaGuardia High School, which is the school that Fame, the TV show, is based on, and I was accepted for voice. But I was also the first person from my junior high school in the Bronx to ever be accepted to Stuyvesant High School — the top specialised math and science school in New York. And my parents said: ‘You’re going to Stuyvesant.’ “I remember that my guidance counsellor at the time tried to discourage my parents from sending me by saying it would be a lot of pressure, but I went and that gave me the confidence to do well. It became my turning point, and I used it to remind myself not to let people define what realistic is for me,” she told All Woman. From there Matthews moved on to the Binghamton University (State University of New York) on a full scholarship, where she pursued a BSc in financial economics, with a minor in Spanish and an adjunct in business management. Shortly afterwards she joined JPMorgan Chase, where she rose to the position of assistant vice-president at age 23, then moved on to The Wharton School of The University of Pennsylvania, where she pursued a Master of Business Administration in marketing and entrepreneurship. She has also served as senior associate at the international management consultancy firm McKinsey & Company. She explained that while at McKinsey she yearned for a job with more meaning, and that led her to the National Commercial Bank (NCB) in 2010. She joined NCB as assistant general manager – strategy, and was promoted to senior assistant general manager – strategy, marketing and communications in just under three years, making her the youngest female head of a division at the largest financial services institution in Jamaica. She also leads the group’s marketing and communications and enterprise information management functions, and serves as the Chief Executive Officer of the NCB Foundation. In November 2015, Matthews was named chief digital and marketing officer for the Group. Under her tenure, NCB has rolled out innovative solutions, including online account opening, NCB Quisk (a mobile money solution), and the latest Loan at ABM solution — a first for the English-speaking Caribbean. Matthews was recently selected as the sole representative of the English and Spanish-speaking Caribbean in the World Economic Forum’s 2017 cohort of Young Global Leaders (YGL), a high-profile, growing network of bold and action-oriented young leaders from across the world. Additionally, she adds to the 54 per cent female make-up of the 2017 YGL class. “It is an honour and privilege to be selected as a part of the 2017 class of Young Global Leaders. I look forward to collaborating with my peers in the forum from all over the world and harnessing the valuable educational opportunities this experience provides to serve as a force for good for Jamaica and the broader Caribbean. I also look forward to positively representing Jamaica in this forum with some of the foremost political and business leaders shaping the world today.” Throughout her life, she has had the opportunity to visit a number of places spanning five continents, which include Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, Italy, London, Spain, Greece, Peru, Israel, Canada, and the United States of America. But she tells All Woman that she enjoys the Caribbean, notably Doctor’s Cave in St James, Jamaica. On her bucket list is a visit to the Blue Mountains. Away from her desk, Matthews is a lover of dance. She is also passionate about education, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and having larger breastfeeding spaces for women in the workplace. “Education has made a huge difference in my life and professional trajectory. Through the NCB Foundation, this passion is realised as we have the Adopt-A-School programme, launched in 2013, where we take primary schools and support them in terms of not only finances, but mentoring. For SMEs, I am passionate to make people realise how they can be viable and contribute positively to the economy. At NCB, having the opportunity to co-create and produce Capital Quest and being a part of building out that ecosystem help me put my mark in that space.” Her philosophies are numerous, but she shares the following: “We don’t serve the world by playing small and shrinking so that others around us don’t feel insecure.” She adds that, in the words of Aristotle, “One way to avoid criticism is to do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing.” Matthews, a mother of two, has one word of advice for young people: “Start by dreaming big. Set the goal and be open to change; it’s the one constant. Be persistent. Failure is an opportunity to learn. If you fall down seven times, get up eight.” Comments POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES   1.

The City watchdog has also opened a probe and could inflict fines on the bank and Staley in the latest blows to the bank’s reputation. When the board received a letter making allegations that a top banker had “medical issues”, the matter was investigated. The bank concluded that the banker, whom Staley knew well, had sought help for issues in the past and decided the matter was closed. The banker has not been named and is below board level, but was recruited by Staley, who spent 34 years at JPMorgan. The first letter to the board was in June 2016. A second letter alleging the bank had inadequate whistleblowing procedures in early 2017 led to an investigation by lawyers at Simmons & Simmons. Once the whistleblowing matter was closed, Staley sought to find who wrote the letter, asking internal investigators for help. According to Barclays, he “honestly, but mistakenly, believed that it was permissible to identify the author”. The board has “accepted his explanation that he was trying to protect a colleague who had experienced personal difficulties in the past from what he believed to be an unfair attack”. Staley will get a formal written reprimand and suffer a “very significant compensation adjustment”. The size of the hit may depend on what the Financial Conduct Authority concludes. Richard Burger, partner at law firm Reynolds, Porter, Chamberlain, said: “The Regulator will actively support whistleblowers, including taking steps to enforce the rules around protecting whistleblowers.” Barclays’ shares slipped 1% to 213p on the news. One bank analyst said: “If the end of the story is, say, a nominal regulatory fine and no managerial change then the impact on the investment case should be muted.” John McFarlane, the chairman, said he was “very disappointed” that “this situation has occurred”. He insisted Staley has the “unanimous” support of the board. Staley (pictured) can earn up to £8 million a year depending on performance, making him one of the best-paid bank bosses in Europe. Last year, he got £4.2 million, including a £1.3 million bonus. Until this morning, he was regarded as having made a clean start to the job, shaking up the investment banking arm, selling off fringe businesses and offering a clear strategy to the City. Barclays has been heavily implicated in most recent financial scandals, including Libor fixing. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said: “This latest revelation represents a very significant embarrassment for the board. As for Mr Staley, it remains to be seen whether the PRA and FCA come to the same conclusion as the board in allowing him to remain in his post.” More about: Barclays Jes Staley Business Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: All Topics All Authors Archive Terms of use Contact Us Privacy policy Cookie policy Code of Conduct & Complaints Advertisers Promotion rules Contributors Syndication Business Connections Homes & Property Jobs London Live The Independent This is London Magazine indy100 Install our apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Of particular concern is a recent slowdown in loan growth, driven partly by an uptick in interest rates that dissuaded consumers and companies from refinancing loans. In February, outstanding loans across the U.S. banking industry declined for the first time in more than three years, according to Federal Reserve data. Loans fell slightly for the first quarter overall. Analysts and investors said the lending slowdown came as a surprise, and appeared related not only to declines in mortgage refinancing and corporate borrowing but also to uncertainty about U.S. policy and economic growth. "The loan metric doesn't fit with the optimistic tone we've seen from the banks," said Patrick Kaser, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global in Philadelphia who invests in bank stocks. The Fed lifted its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points in March, marking the second such hike in three months. But the recent climb in short-term rates has been accompanied by a drop in longer-term rates, bringing the two closer together. When yields flatten in that manner, it is not helpful to bank earnings either. The season kicks off on Thursday, when three of the country's biggest lenders, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo &amp; Co, report first-quarter results. Rivals Bank of America Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley report the following week. On average, analysts expect the six biggest U.S. banks to see a net income increase of 4.7 percent compared to the prior year, according to Reuters data. While that may sound like a big gain, the year-ago quarter was an awful one for the banking sector, which saw capital markets activity and loan growth dry up amid mounting macroeconomic concerns. Several analysts lowered earnings estimates last week, citing loan weakness as well as sharp declines in revenue from stock trading, where commissions have come under pressure from a new regulation in Europe and broader troubles for active asset managers. Fewer deals in the first quarter also imply lower revenue from M&amp;A banking. Altogether, the weak points are expected to outweigh small gains anticipated in businesses like fixed-income trading and wealth management. Evercore ISI bank analyst Glenn Schorr described the quarter as "OK" but "definitely not the gangbusters quarter everybody was hoping for." Big banks have been struggling to earn decent returns on shareholder equity for some time. In recent years, they have been spending billions of dollars to settle legal claims and comply with new regulations and capital requirements. They have also launched massive cost-cutting programs and revenue-boosting initiatives. When November's U.S. election installed Donald Trump in the White House and business-friendly leadership in Congress, investors tended to think tough regulations would be eased and the economy would strengthen. Bank stocks were the biggest beneficiary of the so-called Trump rally, with the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index rising 32 percent from Nov. 7 to a peak on March 1. Banks were also the biggest contributors to gains in major blue chip indexes. But since then bank stocks have lost some of their shine, falling 6 percent in the last month even as the broader market remained mostly flat. With the U.S. Congress unable to pass laws on issues more pressing than financial deregulation, analysts said uncertainty around U.S. polices including trade, taxes and spending may weigh on the economy in the near term. "Expectations were high coming into the year and while 1Q is by no means a bad quarter, revenues are probably less strong than market moves would have implied," said Macquarie analyst David Konrad.

When the Federal Reserve raised benchmark interest rates last month, it took North Carolina lender BB&T Corp. less than an hour to announce it was passing that cost along to borrowers. Depositors, however, have yet to see the benefit. For many investors, such discipline means U.S. banks are about to feast on rising interest rates -- profiting from a fatter margin between what they charge for loans, and the rewards offered depositors who provide the funds. Now, a small but growing chorus of senior executives and analysts is signaling that resolve may fray and that shareholder optimism is too high. Banks are under unprecedented pressure to break ranks and compete for deposits. Compared with past cycles, more savers are web savvy -- able to comparison shop and transfer money online to firms offering better deals. Money-market funds that suffered for years with near-zero rates are eager to lure back customers. And new liquidity rules encourage banks to draw more funding from consumer deposits, pushing lenders to fight for those clients. “We’ve never really seen this movie before,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake warned investors in February. Lenders are “coming off of zero-bound rates in a world where liquidity requirements and technology advancements will increase the competition to get deposits and where customers are more rate aware.” In a raft of recent research notes, analysts said they will listen carefully for U.S. bank leaders to project deposit rates when their companies start reporting first-quarter results April 13. Net income at the nation’s six biggest banks -- JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley -- will probably climb 15 percent to $21.3 billion in the period, helped by improvement in net interest margins, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. But many analysts are underestimating the speed at which banks may need to increase their so-called deposit beta, the share of Fed rate hikes that banks say will get passed along to depositors, according to U.S. Bancorp Chief Operating Officer Andy Cecere, who will become chief executive officer of the nation’s largest regional lender next Tuesday. Cecere, 56, laid out this argument in an interview: For years, with interest rates near zero, money market funds whittled costs and waived fees to keep clients. After the Fed raised rates in March by a quarter point for the third time since the financial crisis, fees are back. That means funds can share future Fed hikes more liberally with customers. And that changes the game for banks. “Competition against waivers meant banks were holding deposit betas,” Cecere said. “Now, the competition for those consumer deposits will increase rates.” Wall Street trading will also drive bank earnings in the first quarter -- with analysts estimating dealings in fixed-income, currencies and commodities probably increased at Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, offset by declines in revenue from equities. But interest rates have been a major theme for shareholders in recent months. Financial stocks soared after Donald Trump’s November election on speculation he will ease rules and pursue policies that spur inflation and lift long-term rates, helping banks earn more from lending. A key question for that equation is whether deposits are still as “sticky” as they have been for decades, or whether customers -- freed from going to branches to deal with tellers -- will demand higher returns to stick around. Small deviations in beta can help or hurt banks’ bottom lines. JPMorgan’s Lake told investors in February that the bank modeled a scenario in which the Fed raises rates by a quarter point twice a year through 2018, and once in 2019. If the lender passes along more than half of that increase to depositors -- a beta of more than 50 percent -- it would reap $11 billion more revenue from interest, she said. While that bodes well for profits, one assumption is notable. In 2004, the beta was roughly 45 percent, she said. In the first quarter, analysts project the six biggest U.S. banks increased net interest income 8.5 percent to $49.1 billion, the most since 2010. Marty Mosby, an analyst at Vining-Sparks IBG, said banks have been slow to increase deposit rates because they’re still working to cover the expense of maintaining accounts. He expects to see more movement after the Fed raises rates by another 25 basis points. “We will be watching for indications of an uptick in deposit betas in the wake of Fed rate hikes in December and March,” Jeff Harte, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners, said Monday in a note to clients. At BB&T, customers with an eSavings account earned a 0.03 percent interest rate as of Friday -- even less than in early December 2015, just before the Fed began its hikes. ‘More Hype’ The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Banks, meanwhile, realize that consumers’ patience won’t last too long, said Ray Montague, director of deposit product research at Informa Research Services. His clients include bank executives who set rates to remain competitive. Some who used to request his research monthly now ask for it once a week, he said. Those who got it weekly are now asking for it twice a week or even daily. The fear is that consumer behavior might change fast. “As there’s more pressure, more hype, more news about increased rates I think there’s going to be more sense that ‘I need to actually start shopping around looking for the best rate,’” he said. “That’s what’s going to rattle the banks.” (Updates with analyst’s comment in 16th paragraph. An earlier version of this story corrected the timing of BB&T’s announcement.) Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A LONDON: British bank Barclays has reprimanded Chief Executive Jes Staley and will cut his bonus heavily after he tried to uncover the identity of an internal company whistleblower in a case being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic. In a statement on Monday, Britain's second biggest bank disclosed that British authorities were investigating American Staley's attempts to find out who wrote a letter that revealed "concerns of a personal nature" about an unnamed senior employee. New York's Department of Financial Services is also investigating, a person familiar with the matter said. A legal investigation ordered by the bank found that Staley's efforts involved a U.S. law enforcement agency and contradicted the company's own policy. Barclays grants whistleblowers anonymity to prevent any retribution for their actions - in keeping with normal UK practice. "I have apologized to the Barclays board, and accepted its conclusion that my personal actions in this matter were errors on my part," former JPMorgan banker Staley said in a statement. Barclays said its board would back Staley's reappointment at the company's annual shareholder meeting on May 10. Analysts said that Staley's position as CEO could come under pressure if regulators' reports on the case, expected to take a matter of months, were especially critical of his conduct. Staley, who took the role in Dec. 2015, stands to lose a chunk of the 1.3 million pound (US$1.6 million) bonus he was awarded this year, but the final amount to be docked is yet to be decided, a separate source said. Staley said in a memo to Barclays staff on Monday that he had been attempting to protect a colleague from an unfair personal attack. "In my desire to protect our colleague, however, I got too personally involved in this matter," Staley wrote in the memo seen by Reuters. The investigations are the latest in a series of regulatory problems for the bank, which is still dealing with investigations into employees' manipulation of Libor benchmark interest rates. The whistleblower probe is particularly embarrassing for Barclays since it relates to recent wrongdoing rather than being a legacy of financial crisis-era misconduct, and because Staley himself has made much of the bank's efforts to clean up its act. "I am personally very disappointed and apologetic that this situation has occurred, particularly as we strive to operate to the highest possible ethical standards," Barclays Chairman John McFarlane said in the company's statement. Barclays shares fell as much as 0.7 percent on Monday but were trading 0.65 percent higher by 1340 GMT. 'HONEST MISTAKE' Barclays' board first heard of Staley's attempt to identify the author of the letter in early 2017, after the issue was raised by an employee, Barclays said. The board instructed law firm Simmons & Simmons to carry out an investigation led by Gerry Grimstone, the bank's deputy chairman, and also notified the regulators. "The investigation ... found, and the board has concluded, that Mr Staley honestly, but mistakenly, believed that it was permissible to identify the author of the letter," the bank said. The lawyers' report also said that Staley had requested the bank's internal security team contact U.S. enforcement officers to help identify the whistleblower, and that such assistance was received albeit without discovering the identity of the person. The board will issue a formal written reprimand to Staley and make a "very significant" adjustment to his variable compensation award. The board will also look into the position of other employees involved in the incident. Staley, 60, has embarked on a sweeping revamp of the lender's strategy since taking over Barclays, slashing its business in Asia and Africa in favor of a new 'transatlantic' focus on the U.S. and Britain. A career investment banker who spent 34 years at JPMorgan, Staley is popular among staff in Barclays' investment bank for bringing back some of its risk-taking swagger after the hairshirt regime of predecessor Antony Jenkins. The attempts to uncover the whistleblower took place despite the bank's appointment of a 'whistleblower champion' - Mike Ashley, the chairman of its Board Audit Committee.     In 2016, Ashley emailed all Barclays employees with a video spelling out the bank's policy on protecting whistleblowers, according to the lender's annual report.

By SueChang Markets reporter After being stuck in a state of suspended animation for the past few weeks, the stock market will finally have its moment of truth as corporate earnings begin rolling out over the next few days. There will be a lot riding on this earnings cycle. It will be the first quarter since President Donald Trump took office, providing a look at whether the euphoria that propelled major stock indexes to historic levels was justified. It could also be the spark that rejuvenates the market as investors have become increasingly cautious amid signs that many of the pro-growth policies promised by the new president may be delayed. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.01%  fell 6.85 points to end at 20,656.10, closing flat for the week. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.07%  shed 1.95 points to finish at 2,355.54, falling 0.3% for the week and the Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 1.14 points to 5,877.81, logging a weekly decline of 0.6%. Here's what Trump could mean for the nonprofit sector(2:07) Feeding America CEO Diana Aviv explains how President Trump's proposed budget and fiscal policies could affect the nonprofit sector. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.35% Citigroup Inc. C, -0.25% and Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, -0.55% will be among the first to report quarterly results. The financial sector has been in the spotlight since the Federal Reserve’s shift to a tighter monetary policy regime, and first-quarter results will be a critical test for whether bank shares have more upside potential. Across the board, earnings are expected to rise as much as 12%, which will mark the highest growth in profitability since third quarter 2011, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet. However, there is always a chance that earnings may fall short. “What I do see as a possibility is early first-quarter earnings perhaps not living up to the expectations and that increases the selling pressure and the market uses that as a reason to sell off but I’m thinking if this does occur then we only see the selling mounting to down 5%-7%,” said Bob Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. There is also the risk that if earnings fail to revive the market’s momentum, investors may be forced to play an extended waiting game for the next catalyst. See also: Predictions for stocks, bonds, gold and oil after U.S. strike on Syria As Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James, noted, the S&P 500 has been corralled between 2,335 to 2,400 for the past couple of months, which he blames on the market being “confused” with no clear indication whether it is headed up or down. “The best strategy has been to basically do nothing,” said Saut. Jason Goepfert, president of Sundial Capital Research, pointed out that there is “a large conflict between bullish and bearish inputs.” Perhaps the confusion shouldn’t come as a surprise, given that for each incentive to buy stocks, there are just many reasons to sell. It may also be symptomatic of the uncertain times as President Trump’s policies get bogged down by politics. “If you are still of the belief we can get tax reform done in a meaningful bi-partisan way, then there is room to go on the upside because I think the market is pricing in only a 65/35 chance it does at this point. By meaningful I mean less than 25% corporate tax rate with a one time repatriation holiday at 10% and a cut in individual taxes ideally without a border-adjusted tax,” said Ian Winer, head of equities at Wedbush Securities. On the other hand, there is a strong case to sell stocks since tax reforms could fail given the difficulties over repealing and replacing Obamacare and tax cuts are not possible without a BAT, he said. Similar arguments apply to the economy. See also: Trump economy starting to look like the same-old, same-old “You buy if you think we can get to 3% to 3.5% GDP exiting 2018. You sell if you think the economy is not going to improve,” he said. “If we can’t grow above 2% to 2.5% then our upside is limited from here.” To make matters more murky for investors, even the charts are sending garbled messages. According to Goepfert, the NYSE Advance/Decline Line is climbing even while the S&P 500 is moving lower. The rise in the Advance/Decline Line, which tracks the number of advancing stocks minus the declining shares each day and adds that to the figure from the previous session, indicates a positive trend. Sundial Capital Research “The only times the S&P showed a loss over the prior month while the A/D Line rose at least 1% and hit a multiyear high during the month were in April 2014 and April 2016. Both led to nice rallies over the next few months,” he said in a report. However, Chris Kimble, founder and chief executive of Kimble Charting Solutions, had a different take on the market. Kimble believes the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, +0.81% a bellwether for the U.S. economy, may be forming a bearish pattern similar to the ones observed in 1998-99 and 2007-08. “The bulls will need the transports to blow through the red resistance line to breathe a sigh of relief. If not, it could spell trouble for the transports,” he wrote in a blog post. Kimble Charting Solutions In his chart, he pinpointed 9,109 as a key support level. “A break below this line would be the first warning to investors,” he said. The index closed at 9,104.81 on Friday.
