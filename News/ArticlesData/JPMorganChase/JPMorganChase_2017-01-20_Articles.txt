"Following" : "Follow"}} January 20, 2017 11:41am   Comments Share: Related Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For December 30, 2016 Stocks Hitting 52-Week Lows Syndax Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: SNDX) is a clinical stage bio-pharmaceutical company that focuses on development of therapies in multiple cancer indications. Benzinga had the opportunity to chat with Briggs Morrison, M.D., Syndax's CEO and director. The interview took place at a time when the company's executives were in San Francisco in conjunction with the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. 3 Immediate Objectives Although Syndax did not present at the JPMorgan conference, Morrison set out three goals. To speak with business development partners to set up collaborations with its pipeline or to enhance its pipeline. Morrison said there are several partners he will be meeting with that are medium- to large-size companies. Morrison said he is open to partnerships with companies located outside of the United States since the company can navigate through the regulatory process on its own domestically. "So, I'd say about a third of our meetings have been with people looking for opportunities to out license molecules or work on collaborations with our existing molecules," Morrison emphasized. Morrison planned on meeting with investors who want to get caught up on the work the company is doing and to discuss the progress of its programs. The executive was tasked with meeting bankers to discuss ways of further raising capital for the company. Current Positioning Morrison pointed out that Syndax has sufficient funding through roughly the middle of 2018 during which the company can complete readouts of ongoing clinical experiments. Nevertheless, the executive reached out with bankers to "understand the various options that are available to us." Morrison added that he would prefer to be able to read out of the experiments that are ongoing, which could prove to be catalysts to boost the company's stock higher. Under that scenario, it would be easier to raise capital at a lower cost. Morrison did emphasize that as it stands now, it is not active in raising capital as there is no need to do so. "Right now, we're actually in good shape," he said. Drug Pricing The topic quickly shifted toward drug pricing policies. Morrison argued that there is increasing price pressures although he did acknowledge there has always been pricing pressure. He suggested that the industry dynamics aren't as obvious to people outside of the industry as they are to people inside the industry. "I think as the U.S. system continues to evolve, my personal view is that the large companies have quite a bit of experience in multiple different models and will know how to navigate that evolving structure," Morrison explained. "The impact on biotech, I think many people like to say well biotech is really early innovation. It tends not to be sort of large commercial organizations, and that's all very true. Yet, I think the ripple effect on biotech is, if it were true that a large company like a Pfizer or Novartis or somebody couldn't generate the same amount of profits that they were generating from their existing businesses then perhaps they don't have the demand for buying drops down a little bit and maybe prices go down a little bit on buying biotech companies." Morrison did acknowledge he feels "pretty optimistic" and that "innovation is a good thing and it'll always be valued." Pipeline Morrison went on to explain Syndax's pipeline. Entinostat is undergoing a phase 3 trial for the treatment of hormone receptor positive breast cancer. He explained that initial data suggests the company's therapy is pretty active and could provide important clinical benefits for patients. "I think if we can show that we improved the survival, the chances of being alive from your breast cancer, that's innovation that will be valued whether it is in the U.K. or in the U.S. or France or Germany," Morrison said. "We're excited about that program." Morrison also stated that another objective of Entinostat is to focus on populations of people who don't have current therapy. One of those populations is patients with melanoma who have failed in immunotherapy." The executive estimates there are 15,000 to 20,000 patients a year in the United States alone who fail those therapies so the company is active in testing Entinostat in that population of patients and expects to have early data probably by the end of the first quarter of this year. Entinostat's Adverse Events Morrison acknowledged that there are toxicities that come from Entinostat, but they are not very severe. He explained that the main concern is a decrease in white blood cell count, but it doesn't have any clinical impact on the patient. Another concern is patient fatigue. Specifically, patients tend to get fatigued on the day where they take the therapy, but the physicians who took part in the clinical studies felt it was quite tolerable for the patients.

REUTERS/Dylan Martinez/File Photo 1/2 left right A view of Jakarta, Indonesia December 20, 2016. Picture taken December 20, 2016. REUTERS/Darren Whiteside 2/2 By Eveline Danubrata and Gayatri Suroyo | JAKARTA JAKARTA Indonesia's reform-minded finance minister seemed to invoke memories of the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis this week when explaining why she came down so hard on JPMorgan Chase & Co for downgrading the country's equity market. JPMorgan published a research report on Nov. 13 that gave Indonesia an underweight assessment, just as Southeast Asia's biggest economy was seeing an outflow of funds along with other emerging markets after Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. election. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, a former International Monetary Fund director and World Bank managing director, thought the downgrade could fuel a stampede out of the country's assets. There may be a "herd mentality" during a situation of panic in financial markets, "so if someone shouts fire, everyone runs and then there's a stampede," she told a parliamentary committee this week. That is exactly what happened during the 1997-98 "Asian Contagion" financial crisis, when economies from Thailand to South Korea and Indonesia collapsed as foreign investors pulled capital from the region. Indonesia was the worst hit: a death spiral in the rupiah triggered a banking crisis, bankruptcies and rising unemployment - and in a matter of months had toppled the country's longtime autocratic president, Suharto. The U.S.-educated Indrawati shocked the financial community by cutting all business ties with JPMorgan after the November research note, including its role as a primary dealer and underwriter for Indonesia's sovereign bonds. She also signed new rules on Dec. 30, requiring all primary bond dealers to adhere to "a principle that is aligned with the government" and avoid "conflicts of interest". She said those conflicts arise when partners "receive business from the government, but on the other side they do something that is different from the government's own interest". Indrawati defended her crackdown on JPMorgan, saying that alongside fundamental economic factors, investors are influenced by psychology and perception, which is "sometimes very subjective". Achmad Sukarsono, an analyst at consultancy Eurasia Group, called Indrawati's moves "a wake-up call for investors that even the most reformist official in Indonesia is taking a political approach to policy and has no qualms about punishing negative opinion." Indonesia is particularly vulnerable to a foreign stampede out of its markets: foreigners owned 37.55 percent of its government bonds at the end of 2016. In November, foreigners sold nearly 32 trillion rupiah ($2.4 billion) of Indonesian stocks and government bonds, according to data from the finance ministry and the stock exchange, though the selling has since abated. "TACTICAL MOVE" Before Indonesia's punishment, JPMorgan was a primary dealer. That meant it was allowed to buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers including Citibank, Deutsche Bank A.G. and HSBC as of Nov. 25. In its Nov. 13 report, JPMorgan downgraded Indonesian stocks to "underweight" from "overweight", citing higher risk premiums in emerging markets after Trump's win. Malaysia received an "overweight" assessment and Brazil a "neutral". The finance ministry's head of fiscal policy, Suahasil Nazara, said Indonesia did not deserve a recommendation that was lower than Brazil, after the South American country impeached its president and suffered an economic contraction last year. JPMorgan executives were caught off-guard by Indonesia's reaction to what they saw as a routine report that was not particularly critical of government policies, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Over a series of meetings, JPMorgan analysts sought to assure Indonesian officials the change in the bank's assessment on Indonesia was a "tactical" portfolio rebalancing tied to global factors, people familiar with the matter said. On Monday, JPMorgan upgraded its recommendation on Indonesian stocks to "neutral", saying that "bond volatility should now decay" after funds sold a large amount of bonds and equities in emerging markets. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said Indonesia's move against the bank had not influenced the upgrade. "JPMorgan's research is independent and anything published is a result of extensive and objective analysis." HISTORY Other emerging market countries have tried to retaliate against unfavourable research, including against Morgan Stanley in China and Banco Santander in Brazil, although the pressure has usually been less explicit than what JPMorgan in Indonesia faced. Indonesia's finance ministry came down hard due to its perception of JPMorgan as a repeat offender, officials said. In 2015, while Indonesia was grappling with its weakest growth in six years and a market sell-off, Barron's news site picked up a JPMorgan report and ran it with the headline "JPMorgan: Sell Indonesia Bonds, Rupiah NOW". Indonesia's then finance minister, Bambang Brodjonegoro, dropped JPMorgan as an underwriter for its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The government relented after JPMorgan said its report had been misrepresented, said the person, who declined to be identified. Barron's subsequently corrected its report to say JPMorgan had cut its recommendation on Indonesia's bonds to "underweight". Barron's did not respond to requests for comment.

"The whole idea of an ever-closer Europe has gone, it's buried," said Dutch premier Mark Rutte, dismissing calls for full political union as a dangerous romantic fantasy. "The fastest way to dismantle the EU is to continue talking about a step-by-step move towards some sort of superstate," he said at the World Economic Forum. His comments went to the heart of a fierce battle under way for control over the EU project, and provoked an impassioned counter-attack from Martin Schulz, the European Parliament's president. Mr Schulz called it profoundly misguided to give up the dream of political union and retreat to the nation state. "If it's Angela Merkel, or Mark Rutte, or whoever else, they must have the courage to say that we need ever-closer union more than ever in the 21st century, and without it the EU has no future," he said. Mr Schulz accused Europe's ministers of subverting the EU in a "double game", agreeing to measures behind closed doors in the EU's council of ministers and then denying any responsibility once they return home. "This is destroying the European spirit." He accused prime ministers of arriving for meetings at the Justus Lipsius Building in Brussels and proclaiming before they even enter the door that they are there only to protect their own narrow interest. "We have some members sitting inside the European Parliament trying to destroy the EU from within. They are drawing EU salaries, and one of them is running for the presidency of France," he said. Frans Timmermans, the European Commission's vice-president, said there was a "fundamental ideological confrontation going on in our EU". He called on Europe's leaders to stop hiding behind subterfuge and pick their side, rather than blaming Brussels for everything. "You need to show your cards, show where you stand," he said. David Fuller's view The masks of EU solidarity have clearly fallen away at Davos.  This will have shocked delegations from a number of other countries, particularly American readers of The New York Times and The Washington Post, and also anyone influenced by President Obama’s view of the EU and Angela Merkel. This item continues in the Subscriber’s Area, where a PDF of AEP’s report is also posted.   Bankers in Davos See Trump Making Wall Street Great Again Here is the opening of this topical article from Bloomberg: Wall Street’s high-flyers in Davos, basking in their firms’ strong fourth-quarter earnings, said they’re confident Donald Trump’s incoming administration will loosen regulatory constraints on financiers -- even if it leaves Barack Obama’s signature Dodd-Frank Act largely intact. Bank executives, speaking on condition of anonymity at events around the Swiss ski resort, said they’re not counting on Trump to overturn Dodd-Frank. Instead, they expect the federal agencies that enforce the rules to ease up on them and support bankers’ efforts to limit how much capital and liquidity their companies need to pay bills or absorb losses in a crisis. The bankers said they recognize that changing or overturning the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act would require support in the U.S. Senate that Republicans may lack. Instead they’re counting on Trump’s team to dial back how supervisory agencies enforce and interpret rules. Led by Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo, U.S. regulators have adopted an extra-strict version of the global standards on capital and liquidity set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. “Legislation, obviously that’s harder to do than just changing regulations,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a Bloomberg Television interview with John Micklethwait on Wednesday. “Regulators can change a lot of things easily about compliance, about costs, certain rules about lending, how you use your liquidity, how you use your capital. I would like to see some of those looked at and maybe modified a bit, and I think it would be good for the economy.” At a panel discussion on the global banking outlook in Davos Thursday morning, JPMorgan asset-management CEO Mary Callahan Erdoes echoed that view. “It’s going to be a great several years,” Erdoes said. “It’s going to be very positive for businesses in the U.S., which should cascade to businesses around the world.” David Fuller's view There has always been a cycle to bank regulation.  When excessive speculation by banks ends in a crash, as we last saw in 2008, and many of them have to be rescued, there is always a call for new, much tougher regulations.  These are designed to significantly boost cash reserves, limit leverage and also punish the offending banking industry. As a consequence, it is more difficult for the economy to recover because banks are unable to provide the liquidity required by their customers, as we have seen since the 2008 credit crisis recession. Eventually, anger towards banks subsides and governments commence easing tight regulations, as we are about to see with the incoming Trump administration. This will help the banking industry and also the US economy. Some people worry that this will soon lead to another banking crisis.  Those concerns are premature because banks are not about to repeat the same mistakes at the first opportunity.  On average, it usually takes at least a generation before banks lose their discipline and contribute to another financial crisis.       The Evolution of Theresa May Sets Brexit Britain On Course for a Bright Global Future Here is the opening and also the last paragraph of this topical article by Fraser Nelson for The Telegraph: By her standards, Theresa May was relatively restrained at the Davos summit.  She loves enemies, and not in the Christian way. In front of her stood a congregation of the very people she holds up to ridicule: the plutocratic masters of the global economy, or, as she calls them, “citizens of nowhere”. On another day, she might have delivered one of the machine-gunnings that she reserves for the Police Federation or Boris Johnson. But this time she had another mission: to position Britain as the new global leader in free trade and reintroduce her country to the world. The result was nothing short of a manifesto for a new British foreign policy and one of the best speeches given by a Prime Minister in recent years. It was a landmark not only in the evolution of her approach to Brexit, but in the development of her own political identity. It shows how far she has travelled in just a few months. The traditional Davos speech involves clichés about the world’s ills and abstract nonsense like the “fourth industrial revolution”. The Prime Minister preferred to talk plainly. Rather than join them in lamenting populism, she sought to explain it: if people’s legitimate grievances aren’t addressed by established political parties, voters turn to insurgents. She could have added that Britain, virtually alone in Europe, has no problem with populism: the BNP dead, Ukip in crisis. And why? Because we had Brexit. It was not a Trump-style disruption; Brexit was how Britain avoids Trump-style disruption. This is the point that European leaders find hard to understand. From Sweden to Sardinia, they are facing Eurosceptic insurgents whom they portray as barbaric and xenophobic. So they tell themselves (and their voters) that Britain has succumbed to a similar malady and is now sinking into a pit of hate crime, nativism and isolationism. This is not an anti-British agenda, necessarily, just the panic of politicians who can’t think of other ways to fend off new challengers. Mrs May came to offer some gentle advice: if you respond to people’s concerns, populism tends to go away. As Britain’s recent mini-revolution has just demonstrated. Still, the Prime Minister has arrived rather late to all this. One of the great risks of Brexit was that the vote would be portrayed as a once-great country in meltdown, retreating from the world. Such concerns needed to be answered clearly, calmly and repeatedly. Had Boris Johnson become Tory leader he would have done this from day one. But Mrs May arrived in office implementing what seemed to be a far meaner version of Brexit than the one compellingly articulated by the Vote Leave campaign. We heard about EU nationals as bargaining chips, companies drawing up lists of foreigners, and new rules making it harder for foreigners to buy British companies. And: In her speech, she quoted Edmund Burke, to the effect that if a state cannot change, it cannot survive. That good governments do not become wedded to mistakes, but scour the horizon for opportunities and adapt with the times. As she has worked out, the same is true of prime ministers.   David Fuller's view I am relieved.  OK, the Prime Minister and her Cabinet were thrown in at the deep end but they were not providing the kind of Brexit that I voted for.  Fortunately this has changed dramatically in little over a week. How did that happen?  Was it a tactical decision to appear to have turned inwards, to lull the Brexit opposition and EU into a false sense of security before striding boldly and positively forward?  I hope not and I don’t think so. Was it a simultaneous eureka moment By Theresa May and Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, or did they receive some very helpful advice?  I suspect it is the latter although we may never know.  However, I do recall mentioning shortly after Theresa May became Prime Minister that she could always get some sound advice from The Telegraph’s editorial team.  While very much on her side, they had become a little more critical in the last several weeks, but no more as we see with the article above. Whatever, Theresa May and Philip Hammond have reassured their supporters.  They have also seized the initiative on Brexit and are determined to set their own agenda with a divided EU which is in disarray.  Good luck to them.   Bond Guru Who Called Last Bear Market 40 Years Ago Says Go Long This article by Andrea Wong for Bloomberg may be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section: Money velocity isn’t a bullet-proof economic indicator. Financial innovation, and the rise of shadow banking, have made it hard to measure exactly how much money is floating around in the financial system. And some would say that "money" itself is going through an identity crisis these days. Hunt isn’t the only one seeing the record-low pace as an ominous sign. The fact that money velocity declined rapidly during years of near-zero interest rates may signal aggressive monetary easing actually led to deflation instead of inflation, economists at the St. Louis Fed wrote back in 2014. "In this regard, the unconventional monetary policy has reinforced the recession by stimulating the private sector’s money demand through pursuing an excessively low interest rate policy," economists Yi Wen and Maria A. Arias wrote. "I know I’m the minority here,” Hunt said. “I’m just trying to see the world as I think it should be seen.”   Eoin Treacy's view I have long argued that the disintermediation associated with the internet and technological innovation is a major contributor in the decline in the velocity of money. The downtrend in the data from 1997 offers a graphic representation of the deflationary influence of technology. It also helps to explain why the surge in the quantity of money associated with quantitative easing has not resulted in high inflation.   Email of the day on Canadian cannabis stocks Pot luck... If the Canadian government continue to support AND passes legislation favorable to the development of the cannabis industry, some companies may have exponential growth, My pick has been Canopy on the TSX and I will continue to hold it.   Eoin Treacy's view Thank you for highlighting Canopy Growth Corp which as you point out is one of Canada’s most popular vehicles for expressing a view on cannabis. Canada is home to a significant number of recreational cannabis and cannabis related pharmaceutical start-ups, which as you say. would benefit from favourable legislation.

JPMorgan published a research report on Nov. 13 that gave Indonesia an underweight assessment, just as Southeast Asia’s biggest economy was seeing an outflow of funds along with other emerging markets after Donald Trump’s victory in the US election. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, a former International Monetary Fund director and World Bank managing director, thought the downgrade could fuel a stampede out of the country’s assets. There may be a “herd mentality” during a situation of panic in financial markets, “so if someone shouts fire, everyone runs and then there’s a stampede,” she told a parliamentary committee this week. That is exactly what happened during the 1997-98 “Asian Contagion” financial crisis, when economies from Thailand to South Korea and Indonesia collapsed as foreign investors pulled capital from the region. Indonesia was the worst hit: a death spiral in the rupiah triggered a banking crisis, bankruptcies and rising unemployment — and in a matter of months had toppled the country’s longtime autocratic president, Suharto. The US-educated Indrawati shocked the financial community by cutting all business ties with JPMorgan after the November research note, including its role as a primary dealer and underwriter for Indonesia’s sovereign bonds. She also signed new rules on Dec. 30, requiring all primary bond dealers to adhere to “a principle that is aligned with the government” and avoid “conflicts of interest”. She said those conflicts arise when partners “receive business from the government, but on the other side they do something that is different from the government’s own interest”. Indrawati defended her crackdown on JPMorgan, saying that alongside fundamental economic factors, investors are influenced by psychology and perception, which is “sometimes very subjective”. Achmad Sukarsono, an analyst at consultancy Eurasia Group, called Indrawati’s moves “a wake-up call for investors that even the most reformist official in Indonesia is taking a political approach to policy and has no qualms about punishing negative opinion.” Indonesia is particularly vulnerable to a foreign stampede out of its markets: foreigners owned 37.55 per cent of its government bonds at the end of 2016. In November, foreigners sold nearly 32 trillion rupiah (US$2.4 billion) of Indonesian stocks and government bonds, according to data from the finance ministry and the stock exchange, though the selling has since abated. ‘Tactical move’ Before Indonesia’s punishment, JPMorgan was a primary dealer. That meant it was allowed to buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers including Citibank, Deutsche Bank A.G. and HSBC as of Nov. 25. In its Nov. 13 report, JPMorgan downgraded Indonesian stocks to “underweight” from “overweight”, citing higher risk premiums in emerging markets after Trump’s win. Malaysia received an “overweight” assessment and Brazil a “neutral”. The finance ministry’s head of fiscal policy, Suahasil Nazara, said Indonesia did not deserve a recommendation that was lower than Brazil, after the South American country impeached its president and suffered an economic contraction last year. JPMorgan executives were caught off-guard by Indonesia’s reaction to what they saw as a routine report that was not particularly critical of government policies, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Over a series of meetings, JPMorgan analysts sought to assure Indonesian officials the change in the bank’s assessment on Indonesia was a “tactical” portfolio rebalancing tied to global factors, people familiar with the matter said. On Monday, JPMorgan upgraded its recommendation on Indonesian stocks to “neutral”, saying that “bond volatility should now decay” after funds sold a large amount of bonds and equities in emerging markets. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said Indonesia’s move against the bank had not influenced the upgrade. “JPMorgan’s research is independent and anything published is a result of extensive and objective analysis.” History Other emerging market countries have tried to retaliate against unfavourable research, including against Morgan Stanley in China and Banco Santander in Brazil, although the pressure has usually been less explicit than what JPMorgan in Indonesia faced. Indonesia’s finance ministry came down hard due to its perception of JPMorgan as a repeat offender, officials said. In 2015, while Indonesia was grappling with its weakest growth in six years and a market sell-off, Barron’s news site picked up a JPMorgan report and ran it with the headline “JPMorgan: Sell Indonesia Bonds, Rupiah NOW”. Indonesia’s then finance minister, Bambang Brodjonegoro, dropped JPMorgan as an underwriter for its US dollar-denominated bonds, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The government relented after JPMorgan said its report had been misrepresented, said the person, who declined to be identified. Barron’s subsequently corrected its report to say JPMorgan had cut its recommendation on Indonesia’s bonds to “underweight”.

Dimon, who was already the best paid Wall Street CEO in the prior year, received $28 million in total compensation for 2016. The bank disclosed in a filing Thursday that his base pay stayed unchanged at $1.5 million, but his bonus increased. JPMorgan shareholders likely won't have a problem with the raise, given the bank posted a record profit for the year of $24.7 billion, and the stock soared. Last year, 92% of JPMorgan Chase shareholders voted in favor of the bank's executive compensation package at its annual meeting. A year earlier, he faced something of a shareholder revolt, when 38% of them voted against Dimon's pay package. Also, 36% voted in favor of splitting Dimon's two positions as chairman and CEO of the company -- in effect asking for an independent chairman to lead the board of directors. Related Fast facts about Jamie Dimon JPMorgan (JPM) stock was up 29% last year, easily outpacing the broader market. The Trump market rally since the election has also been led by bank stocks, as investors are betting that Wall Street could be unshackled from the chokehold of regulations that were passed during the Obama administration.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    JPMorgan Asset Management is boosting its holdings of high-yield debt on the expectation that President Donald Trump’s policies will fuel domestic growth and improve corporate earnings, strengthening the balance sheets of junk-rated companies. Following the election, the firm nearly tripled its exposure to junk bonds in its unconstrained debt fund, which permits shifts of that magnitude, and raised its exposure “meaningfully” across the board, according to Bob Michele, who oversees $470 billion as the chief investment officer and head of global fixed income, currency and commodities at the firm’s $1.8 trillion asset management arm. “This is historically the largest move we’ve ever made,” he said in an interview. The reallocation comes as many on Wall Street are sounding alarms that the junk bond rally has gone too far. The Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Index returned more than 17 percent in 2016 as yields fell steadily throughout the year -- and bullish sentiment since Nov. 8 has pushed them even lower. Strategists like Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Contopoulos have warned investors not to pile in to the crowded trade, especially as yields approach their all-time lows. Michele derived his take on Trump from what he considered common themes in his campaign speeches, interviews, post-election statements and cabinet picks. “When you listen to the rhetoric, its pro-business and pro-growth,” he said, pointing to Trump’s pledges of fiscal stimulus and deregulation as talking points that fit that mold. In JPMorgan’s $2.8 billion unconstrained debt fund net high-yield exposure now stands at 35 percent. To reach that level, Michele not only added new junk-rated assets but also closed out all of his credit hedges, leaving in place only hedges on interest rate risk. In addition to boosting its junk allocation after the election, JPMorgan revised its macro predictions more dramatically than ever before, Michele said. The firm raised its forecast for the probability of “above trend” growth to 65 percent from 10 percent and slashed its expectation for a recession to 5 percent from 25 percent. The firm’s managers expect high-yield overall will likely return between 8 percent and 10 percent in 2017, Michele said. The average expectation on Wall Street is less ebullient, between 4 percent and 6 percent.   © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, in a statement shortly after Trump took the oath of office, said the 45th president's enthusiasm for economic development is encouraging. "The swearing-in of a new president represents a moment of opportunity for America and all Americans," Dimon said in a statement he released as the chairman of the Business Roundtable. "The United States is well positioned to build on the momentum the U.S. economy is already showing. President Trump and the new Congress have both identified economic growth and job creation as top priorities, and America's business leaders fully agree." The roundtable is a consortium of CEOs working together to promote responsible public policy and economic growth. Though he's expressed some reservations about Trump's campaign trail rhetoric, Dimon in recent weeks has shown a willingness to work with the new administration. In a CNBC interview this week from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Dimon said gains for Americans will extend beyond the stock market rally that has taken place since the election. Dimon predicted gross domestic product growth could hit 3 percent to 4 percent under Trump in 2017, after averaging just 1.6 percent during former President Barack Obama's eight years. Trump has emphasized the importance of breaking the mediocre growth trend since the financial crisis ended. To do so, he has prescribed a mix of tax cuts, regulation rollbacks and increases in infrastructure spending to unleash American business investment. "There is no better time than now for enacting reasoned policies that achieve those goals. Americans can only benefit if we modernize our tax system, take a smarter approach toward regulation and invest in infrastructure," Dimon said. "CEOs want this nation to succeed," he added. "We are ready to work collaboratively with President Trump, Congress, state and local leaders, unions and all the many institutions of civil society to create more opportunity for all Americans." show chapters Donald Trump sworn in as 45th president of the U.S.    Friday, 20 Jan 2017 | 11:20 AM ET | 01:45 Jeff CoxFinance Editor To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Dimon, who was already the best paid Wall Street CEO in the prior year, received $28 million in total compensation for 2016. The bank disclosed in a filing Thursday that his base pay stayed unchanged at $1.5 million, but his bonus increased. JPMorgan shareholders likely won't have a problem with the raise, given the bank posted a record profit for the year of $24.7 billion, and the stock soared. Last year, 92% of JPMorgan Chase shareholders voted in favor of the bank's executive compensation package at its annual meeting. A year earlier, he faced something of a shareholder revolt, when 38% of them voted against Dimon's pay package. Also, 36% voted in favor of splitting Dimon's two positions as chairman and CEO of the company -- in effect asking for an independent chairman to lead the board of directors.

Dimon's package includes a base salary of $1.5 million, as well as cash and stock-related instruments that are tied to Dimon's performance, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Dimon's base salary was the same in 2015, as was his $5 million cash performance bonus. The increase came from an additional $1 million in performance share units. The board "took into account the firm's strong performance" in setting Dimon's pay, the company said. show chapters Economic growth is crucial, regardless of political party: Jamie Dimon    Wednesday, 18 Jan 2017 | 9:31 AM ET | 02:48 Last year, JPMorgan's profit rose 1 percent, to nearly $25 billion. Return on tangible common equity, a key measure of profitability and a factor in the compensation, was 13 percent for the third consecutive year. Shares of JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, rose 2016 by 31 percent in 2016, compared with a 26 percent gain in the KBW bank stock index. Dimon's pay has been a sensitive topic for JPMorgan. The company changed its practices last year to tie more of his compensation to objective measures of performance and leave less leeway for judgment by directors. The decision came after investors and proxy voting advisers complained that Dimon's pay was too arbitrary. Shareholders voted to endorse the new structure at their annual meeting in May. Directors are expected to describe their rationale for Dimon's 2016 package in more detail in a proxy statement ahead of this year's annual meeting. Other top JPMorgan executives are paid with a somewhat different mix of salary, cash, and stock-related incentives. The performance pieces are like last year's and almost all consist of 40 percent cash, 30 percent performance share units, and 30 percent restricted stock units, a company spokesman said on Thursday. Applying the formula to other disclosures made on Thursday, they would receive total compensation of the following amounts: Ashley Bacon, chief risk officer, $11 million. Mary Erdoes, asset management chief executive, $19 million. Marianne Lake, chief financial officer, $12.5 million. Douglas Petno, commercial bank chief executive, $11 million. Daniel Pinto, chief executive for corporate and investment banking, $19 million. Gordon Smith, consumer banking chief executive, $19 million. Matthew Zames, chief operating officer, $19 million.

In a decidedly cautious move, which left the bank with no 'buy’ ratings in the UK food retail space, Exane BNP Paribas downgraded Tesco and Sainsbury’s to “underperform” and “neutral”, respectively. Tesco Last year, expectations were low for the sector. However, 2107 is “a different story”, analysts said. “Expectations are high, there’s cost inflation, and the possibility ASDA improves. The long-term labour market and population impact of Brexit could be bad too.” Risks are building that inflation isn’t fully passed through to the shopper. Although some grocers have nudged up prices, Exane BNP Paribas warns: “Pass through could be far from smooth”. J Sainsbury share price Tesco has made good progress so far, but as a big box operator that is still about twice the size of its nearest competitor, analysts cautioned: “Consistently growing volume will be a challenge and if volumes go negative as seems quite possible, the de-rating could be sharp.” The bearish note knocked shares, with Tesco closing down 4.3p, or 2.1pc, at 198.3p and Sainsbury’s surrendering 5.3p to finish at 262.7p. Peer Morrisons also lost ground, down 1.1p to 240p. On the broader market, the FTSE 100 recorded its worst week since before Donald Trump’s US presidential election win. It finished the week down 139.37 points, or 1.9pc, at 7,198.44 - its biggest weekly fall since the week ended November 4. FTSE 100 Pharma giant AstraZeneca also found itself among the laggards after its rival Bristol-Myers Squibb decided not to seek accelerated US approval for a combination of its two immunotherapy drugs as an initial treatment for lung cancer. Shares dropped 150p to £43.19. AstraZeneca 1-year share price Elsewhere, Royal Mail extended its losses a day after it released a disappointing nine month trading update, suffering its worst two-day losing streak since mid-2016. Morgan, Stanley, Investec, Credit Suisse and Jefferies all slashed its price target. Neil Glynn, of Credit Suisse, said: “Any further deterioration in market conditions may require management to dig deeper in cost cutting, with timing potentially unfortunate as the chief financial officer’s exit looms.” Shares fell 8.5p to 414p. Royal Mail shares Meanwhile, Costa Coffee and Premier Inn owner Whitbread eked out gains of 49p to £41.20 after Barclays lifted its rating to “equal-weight” from “underweight”. The bank expects a good set of third quarter results next week. whitbread shares On the mid-cap index, motoring group AA went into reverse, down 16.9p to 254p, following a price target downgrade. Liberum cut its price target to 340p from 375p citing low earnings and higher debt. It also trimmed its 2018 earnings estimate by 3pc. Chemicals maker Synthomer set a new record high, surging 46.8p to 424.3p, after the company said it sees full-year profits beating estimates, buoyed by stronger-than-expected trading in Asia and Europe.

Thanks for following our markets coverage this week.  5:17PM Wall St trims gains as President Trump speaks US stocks trimmed gains, shortly after Donald Trump started his inaugural speech during his swearing-in as the 45th US president. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 50.88 points, or 0.26pc, at 19,783.28 The S&P 500  was up 5.41 points, or 0.24pc, at 2,269.1 The Nasdaq Composite was up 10.56 points, or 0.19pc, at 5,550.65. 5:13PM Dollar index falls as Trump makes his inauguration speech Here's a quick snapshot of how markets are reacting to Trump's inauguration speech:  Mexico's peso pares gains further as Trump delivers inauguration speech Dollar index falls  US stocks hit session low Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq up just about 0.2pc Dollar and US stocks wobble during Trump's inauguration speech Credit: AP 4:49PM FTSE 100 suffers worst week since before Trump's election win The FTSE 100 has recorded its worst week since before Donald Trump's US presidential election win.  It ended the week off by 0.9pc at 7,198.44, its biggest weekly fall since the week ended November 4 when it tumbled 1.33pc.  Meanwhile, other European bourses made little movement as investors remained on the sideline as the awaited Trump's inauguration. The DAX rose 0.18pc, the CAC added 0.17pc and the IBEX dipped 0.03pc.  FTSE100 1 yr  Chris Beauchamp, of IG, said: "For now the buyers have the upper hand in most stock markets but enthusiasm is distinctly lacking, with yesterday’s losses barely recovered. It seems highly unlikely that the new president will provide any surprises in his inauguration speech, but it has provided the perfect excuse for most traders to end the week early. "Investors will come back on Monday ready to see what executive orders Trump has in store for them, and perhaps we  will get a clearer sense then of whether the usually weaker period post-inauguration for stocks will apply this time around."  4:31PM Dollar flat as investors look to inauguration speech  Market uncertainty ahead of the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump kept the dollar muted in choppy trading on Friday after a volatile week that underlined the growing uncertainty over how Trump will govern. The US currency was little changed from its late Thursday levels against a basket of major currencies, but remains 3.5pc higher since Trump's election victory in November. However, it has shed more than 1 percent in value so far in January as concerns grow over Trump's protectionist rhetoric and recent comments about his dissatisfaction with the strong dollar. Dollar traders largely took bets off the table, analysts said, a reflection of Friday's dearth of US data and investors' anxiety over what the new president will say in his inaugural address. "Everybody’s waiting for Trump," said Charles St-Arnaud, senior strategist and economist at Nomura Securities International in London. "Even though traditionally the inauguration speech is not a speech where you lay down details on your policies, Trump is unconventional so he could change the convention on that one." The dollar index .DXY was flat at 101.130 and was little changed for the week. Report from Reuters 3:46PM Pound rebounds in afternoon trade Another rollercoaster trading session for the pound. After sliding to an intraday low of $1.2261 against the dollar in morning trade following the release of UK retail sales data, the pound has now regained momentum.  It is currently trading up 0.16pc on the day at $1.2322.  Credit: Bloomberg Michael Hewson, of CMC Markets, explains: "The pound took a bit of knock, before bouncing back, after December retail sales showed a sharp decline of 2pc, confounding the optimism that came out of a raft of updates from various retailers about their Christmas trading activity. Over the quarter as a whole, sales were still positive, but there was some evidence that higher prices were starting to weigh on consumption.   "On an annualised basis sales still rose 4.9pc; however this was well down on Novembers 6.4pc, while this is disappointing this shouldn’t be a surprise given that over the last 15 years the sort of sales growth above 6pc has been very much the exception. If history is any guide annualised sales growth is likely to slow further in the coming months." 3:39PM What will Trumpism look like in practice? As the celebrations get underway ahead of Trump's inauguration in Washington, Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at JP Morgan Asset Management, investigates what Trumpism will look like in practice:  “Here’s one way to look at the current situation in the US: employment, housing and consumer activity are doing OK, but businesses remain cautious, even with all-time lows in real interest rates. The big question for investors now is how will Trump’s policies affect this backdrop in the US? Financial markets appear to be pricing in a benign “American Enterprise Institute Presidency,” meaning that they anticipate plenty of deregulation, corporate tax cuts and little disruption from some very transformational tax proposals, limited (if any) action on trade, tariffs and deportations of undocumented workers, a large military expansion combined with an isolationist foreign policy, infrastructure financed through taxes on offshore profits and public-private partnerships, a gradual, non-disruptive dismantling of the Affordable Care Act. Given all of the above, markets also seem to be expecting a modestly higher and steeper yield curve that’s great for banks, but not high enough to derail the housing expansion or worsen corporate debtor solvency. Whether this benign view is accurate or not is an open question. The right mix could be stimulative, adding 0.2pc to 0.4pc to US GDP growth without much damage. But too much emphasis on tax cuts, government spending or tariffs could result in large budget deficits, higher interest rates, a spike in the dollar, rising Federal debt ratios (and a possible ratings downgrade) and higher inflation. There are a lot of tea leaves to read, since the outcome depends on the President-elect’s intentions, the disposition of House/Senate majority leaders and the degree to which Democrats filibuster Trump policies. Estimates of the deficit and debt consequences of Trump tax and spending plans vary significantly depending on the extent to which they are enacted. Ultimately it’s likely the US will end up somewhere in between, with a mix of infrastructure spending (in sizes way below figures Trump has cited), corporate tax cuts, small personal tax cuts (if any), some trade restrictions on Mexico, deregulation of healthcare/financials/energy, a modestly higher budget deficit and 3pc+ on the 10-year Treasury by the end of 2017. While the markets look to us to have already priced in corporate tax reform, the details are not clear yet, and some proposals are quite transformational. In the long run, these policies could eliminate distortions in the tax code, encourage capital spending, reduce excessive leverage and reduce incentives to shelter income or move HQ offshore through tax inversions. However, the adjustment period could be disruptive. There are likely to be winners and losers from such changes, particularly if the dollar does not rally as expected by some economists. 3:04PM A surging dollar under Trump poses biggest threat to global economy, BlackRock boss warns A surging dollar under Trump poses biggest threat to global economy, Larry Fink, of BlackRock, has warned. From Davos, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard reports:  The surging dollar poses the biggest single threat to the global economy and will be extremely difficult to manage under the incoming Trump presidency, the world's largest investment fund has warned.  Larry Fink, head of the $4 trillion giant BlackRock, said sweeping plans for tax cuts and fiscal stimulus in the US were already causing markets to price in a monetary squeeze by the Federal Reserve, potentially driving an upward spiral in the dollar. "It's going to be very hard to navigate," he told the World Economic Forum in Davos.  onald Trump has sweeping plans for tax cuts and fiscal stimulus in the US Credit: AFP One worry is that the stronger dollar undermines the competitiveness of core US manufacturers, the very sector that Donald Trump has vowed to promote. This will make it even more likely that he will turn to trade warfare, or seek to pressure the Fed into weakening the dollar by delaying rate rises. "There is going to be great tension with the Fed over these issues," he said. The other is that ballooning fiscal deficits could draw in a flood of foreign capital and yet more US dependence on powerful creditors in Asia, leading to a combustible situation if diplomatic relations deteriorate.   Continue reading here 2:43PM Wall Street opens higher ahead of Trump inauguration US stocks rose at the opening bell ahead of Trump's inauguration as the 45th president of the US.  Here's a quick snap shot of how markets opened:  Dow Jones: +0.4pc Nasdaq: +0.32pc S&P 500: +0.34pc 2:19PM US stocks fell during two-thirds of the US presidential swearing-in ceremonies since 1900 Nice chart from Bloomberg, showing opening day ups and (mostly) downs during US presidential inaugurations.  Futures are up this morning buuutttt if history is any guide, that's not going to lasthttps://t.co/HePCt62wx0 pic.twitter.com/rFttd0KnQ9— Dani Burger (@daniburgr) January 20, 2017 2:17PM Wall St set to rise ahead of Trump inauguration US stocks looked set to advance on Friday, with investors counting down to Donald Trump's inauguration as the 45th president of the United States.

However, the Trump trade has been unraveling in recent weeks as investors wait to see how he will carry out his ambitious plans.  Report from Reuters 2:01PM 'Chicken King' Boparan receives £350m bid for Fox's biscuits Food tycoon Ranjit Boparan, known as the "Chicken King" due to his 2Sisters poultry business, has received an approach for Party-Ring maker Fox's Biscuits from a mystery bidder. Mr Boparan owns Fox's Biscuits following the 2011 £300m takeover of Northern Foods, which also handed him control of Goodfella's frozen pizzas. Fox's biscuits were fronted by a campaign including Vinnie, the Panda His company, Boparan Holdings, disclosed that it had received a "preliminary approach for Fox's Biscuits, the trading name of Northern Foods" without revealing the bidder's identity. Sources believe that it is the Ontario Teacher's Pension Fund, the owner of Burton's Biscuits, as the two firms were in discussions last year about a deal.  "The group’s expectation is that any formal offer for Fox’s Biscuits would be at a valuation in the region of £350m," the company said in a statement to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, where debt is listed. Report by Ashley Armstrong (Read more here) 1:51PM Outcome of Trump inauguration could be 'brutal' for markets As  we await Trump's inauguration speech later today, Naeem Aslam, of Think Markets, highlights the two things that are at the peak for investors:  Anxiety; and Expectations.  "During his press conference, stocks reacted negatively due to the absence of vital information such as trade tariff and fiscal spending but we are hoping that today he will address them at his first opportunity because if he fails to conscience the market, the outcome could be brutal." Profile | Donald Trump Aslam says thinks brings the risk of "bigger disappointment" which could derail the massive rally which equity markets have enjoyed since Trump's victory.  It's also worth noting that precious metals are rising today as traders look to "hedge their bets".  He adds: "The dollar index which had assurance from the Fed president and economic data is trading cautiously as Donald Trump has indicated that he is not happy with a stronger dollar."  1:25PM Chemicals group Synthomer soars after 'reverse profit warning' Shares in Synthomer set a record high, up by more than 11pc, after the mid-cap group said it sees its full-year profits coming in ahead of expectations. Alan Tovey reports:  Chemicals maker Synthomer jumped to the top of the FTSE 250 leaderboard after it reported better-than-expected performances in Europe and Asia and a boost from the pound’s weakness. Reporting on fourth quarter and full-year trading, the company - which makes polymers used in construction, textiles, paper and surgical gloves - forecast annual profits of £120m. This beat City expectations of profits between £92m and £104m and sent the shares up 11pc to 419p, their highest level ever. Synthomer shares The slump in sterling since the EU referendum in June compounded Synthomer’s profit gains, with the company saying it expected foreign exchange movements to deliver a £12m boost to profits. Operational and product improvements also contributed to the strong performance, the company said. Looking ahead, Synthomer cautioned that while it expected material prices and macroeconomics to be “volatile” in the coming year, it still believed trading would be resilient in Europe in 2017.

Danske Bank does not expect his inauguration speech to include any surprises but from now on Trump will take his business from Twitter to the Oval office (while arguably keeping his strong presence on Twitter). Sverre Holbek, of Danske Bank, says: "The first 100 days of the Presidency are usually the most productive, so it will be interesting to see how quick Trump will be off the bat."

The value womenswear retailer posted a 3.3pc lift in sales for the 13 weeks to December 24, with like-for-like sales at stores open more than a year rising by 0.8pc. However Bonmarché failed to enjoy any festive boost as like-for-like sales in the five weeks to Christmas Eve fell 3.4pc, while online sales plunged by 14.3pc. BON The dismal Christmas performance weighed on its performance in the first three-quarters of its financial year, dragging sales across the 39 weeks down 5.3pc.  Shares in Bonmarché took a battering in September after the retail chain issued its second profit warning of the year, blaming an Indian summer for putting people off buying its autumnwear. Helen Connolly, who replaced Beth Butterwick as boss over the summer, has ruled out a radical strategy overhaul but said that the company's poor online performance "continues to be a key area of focus".  Continue reading here 11:47AM 'Uncertainty and volatility ahead' as markets await Trump inauguration Markets remain subdued in mid-morning trade  amid concern Trump may struggle to deliver on his stimulus promises. Ahead of his inauguration, Michael Hewson, of CMC Markets, said: "European markets tread carefully ahead of controversial US president-elect’s inauguration. With his distinct lack of political prowess but seemingly clear vision for his time in office, we look set for a roller-coaster ride of political events. "This coupled with mixed data from China which looks to bring a day of uncertainty and volatility ahead.

Donald Trump has somehow managed to gain the Presidency without the support of the lobbyists or his own party. "At a time when people are seeking out change, Trump offers that, and the big question from here on in is whether he will deliver on his promises. Trump’s promise of a major fiscal stimulus plan has come as a welcome respite from the monetary policy led days gone by.

Unfortunately, this may not last much longer. The solid growth in retail sales of 1.4pc qoq in Q4 (1.9pc qoq in Q3) suggests the UK economy ended 2016 on a stable footing. The ten year average quarterly growth rate is 0.5pc. Retail sales provide the timeliest official indicator of household demand and spending which makes up two-thirds of GDP.  The modest slowdown in the quarterly growth rate supports our call that GDP growth slowed to around its trend rate of 0.5pc qoq in the final quarter of last year from 0.6pc qoq in the third quarter.  Broad based correction on a monthly basis but annual growth remained strong: On a monthly basis, retail sales ex. fuels declined by 2.0pc following gains in the previous two months. Keep in mind, monthly data is volatile. We should not look too much into the larger-than-expected monthly correction.  On a monthly basis the correction was broad based across all major categories with the largest declines occurring in household goods (7.3pc mom) and textiles, clothing and footwear (-3.7pc mom). According to the Office of National Statistics, the strong Black Friday sales in November may have exacerbated the drop in December. Brexit headwinds set to blow a little harder in 2017: In the long-run, the major drivers of real spending are employment, real wages and households’ appetite for debt. During the past two years, solid gains in real incomes and rising employment have led to above-trend growth in real consumption. Looking ahead, headwinds from the Brexit vote may begin to blow a little harder. We expect real consumption growth to slow from an average rate of 2.6pc yoy in 2015 and 2016 to 1.7pc in 2017 and 2018 as real wage gains are eroded by rising inflation (2.5pc in 2017 and 2.4pc in 2018). Slowing job gains now that the labour market has reached full employment could further reduce demand momentum. Risks tilted to the upside: The recent surge in consumer credit growth to a decade high – in part induced by the aggressive BoE easing in August – shows that households’ appetite for debt is rising again. While the return to old habits of excess borrowing may herald a return of the cyclical dynamics of boom-bust, it creates upside risk to our calls for growth over the medium-term.  Pound falls after retail sales drop by the most in nearly 5 years https://t.co/Otilm8N5ze pic.twitter.com/LpOF64oVnY— Bloomberg Brexit (@Brexit) January 20, 2017 10:12AM Retail sales disappoint in December as prices begin to climb Here's our full report on retail sales by Jon Yeomans:  Retail sales fell short of expectations in December, despite a surge in shopping ahead of Christmas, as prices on the high street began to creep up. The quantity of goods bought fell 1.9pc between November and December, far in excess of the 0.4pc pencilled in by forecasters.

Admittedly, unusually mild weather probably was the main driver of the 3.7pc month-to-month drop in clothing sales. UK consumer "doing just fine" with spending running at around +2.5%, says JP Morgan. But rising inflation suggests that is about to change.— Jamie McGeever (@ReutersJamie) January 20, 2017 "But sales fell across the board, with food, department store, household goods and non-store sales dropping by 0.6pc, 1.2pc, 7.3pc and 5.3pc month-to-month respectively. The strength in retail sales in prior months therefore appears to have reflected consumers bringing forward purchases in order to avoid impending price rises." Credit: Pantheon Macroeconomics Meanwhile, Neil Wilson, of ETX Capital, notes that sterling is taking a "pasting after a pretty shoddy set of retail sales figures" for December. He adds: "Hopefully this is a blip and not a sign of a slowdown in consumer spending. We must note that the ONS said the estimates for December 2016 do not include “Black Friday”. It rarely does to read too much into a single month-on-month set of figures, and we prefer instead to consider quarterly figures for a more even view of the market. "But the worry is that consumer sentiment is fickle and based largely on ballooning unsecured debt.

It’s been 73 days since Donald Trump won the US election and the phoney war is about to come to an end as the world gets ready for the inauguration of the 45th President of the United States. "Financial markets, having rallied strongly since November 8th are now showing the first signs of some nervousness as investors now adjust to the reality and immediacy of a Trump Presidency, with the Dow declining for five days in succession. "Having overdosed on the expectations of significant tax cuts and infrastructure investment the question now moves to whether the new President will be able to deliver on his campaign promises now that the time has come for action to replace all of the words."  9:15AM Davos 2017: Philip Hammond on centre stage as World Economic Forum draws to a close Jes Staley, the boss of Barclays, suggests cities on the Continent can't steal London's crown as a global financial centre because it doesn't have the "ecosystem" to do so. From Davos, Szu Ping Chan reports: He says it would be "incredibly simple and wrong" to say London's status as the "capital of capital markets" is because there are a couple of banks based in London. If some move jobs overseas, this is unlikely to be a game changer, he adds. Jes Staley, the boss of Barclays Credit: Bloomberg Britain's legal system has helped to underpin the efficient operation of capital markets in a way that is not matched by the rest of Europe. The rest of the EU knows this, he says. Follow all the action from Davos on our live blog: Davos 2017: Philip Hammond on centre stage as World Economic Forum draws to a close 9:02AM Dollar skids on Yellen comments and as markets await Trump inauguration The dollar dipped this morning after Fed chair Janet Yellen spoke of gradual rate hikes, in a speech that was less hawkish than expected, while investors remained cautious ahead of Trump's inauguration later today.  The dollar index slipped 0.2pc against a basket of major currencies to 100.97. Dollar drops in Asia Friday morning after Yellen comments seen as less "hawkish" https://t.co/03Rg2GzKCi pic.twitter.com/bUq8J1zyOt— David Ingles (@DavidInglesTV) January 20, 2017 Yesterday, the dollar index had hit a high of 101.73 on upbeat US job and housing data. 8:54AM Analysts eye UK retail sales data UK retail sales data will be released at 9.30am this morning. Forecasts suggest there will be a dip in the headline figure.  Previewing the data release, Michael Hewson, of CMC Markets, said:  "Some of the recent trading updates from various retailers would appear to suggest that December saw a decent expansion in retail sales, though you wouldn’t know it to see what expectations are for the monthly numbers. A decline of -0.3pc excluding fuel is expected, though the annualised number is expected to 7.6pc from 6.6pc."  8:50AM European bourses in retreat ahead of Trump inauguration A cautious mood swept European trading floors this morning as investors remained on the sidelines ahead of Trump's inauguration later today.  Interestingly, European bourses are on track for their worst weekly performance since before Trump's US presidential election win in early November.  Here's a look at the current state of play:  FTSE 100: -0.07pc DAX: -0.07pc CAC: Flat IBEX: +0.25pc FTSE100 1 yr  Mike van Dulken, of Accendo Markets, said: "Calls for a flat open come after small losses on Wall St last night and a mixed picture in Asia overnight. Investors are looking ahead to this afternoon’s inauguration of the 45th US President, even solid overnight Chinese GDP failing to provide any meaningful positive impetus overnight. If anything, it is a weaker USD having most impact, after a slightly less hawkish tone from Yellen, the stronger resulting GBP and EUR hindering FTSE and DAX sentiment."  8:47AM Hong Kong stocks snap 3-week winning streak before Trump's inauguration Hong Kong stocks ended a thinly-traded week down and snapped three weeks of gains on Friday, as investors were wary ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration as the 45th U.S. president later in the day. The benchmark Hang Seng index fell 0.7pc, to 22,885.91 points at the close, while the China Enterprises Index lost 0.8pc, to 9,715.72 points. The benchmark index lost a modest 0.2pc this week. "The key risk is Trump's trade policy. The external risk of China is obviously heightened, at the same time how Fed will move policy rates in the U.S," said Raymond Yeung, chief economist of Greater China for ANZ in Hong Kong.

Report from Reuters  8:44AM China GDP beats expectations Overnight, data from China showed the economy enjoyed faster-than-expected growth of 6.8pc in the fourth quarter, buoyed by higher government spending and record bank lending.  The economy expanded 6.7pc in 2016, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday, near the middle of the government's 6.5-7pc growth target but still the slowest pace in 26 years. Forecasts pointed to growth of 6.7pc for both Q4 and the full year.  #China delivered its dubious GDP figures in week Pres Xi visited #wef17.

Speaking in Davos, a panel of bank chief executives said that Trump could herald the start of a new era of economic growth driven by a booming banking industry for the first time in nearly a decade. Mary Callahan Erdoes, chief executive of JP Morgan Asset Management, almost struggled to contain her excitement at the prospect of a Trump administration: “The US economy will take off in a way that it hasn’t for many years. There has been a pendulum switch that will be very positive for US companies and should cascade to other businesses outside the US. It will be great for the next couple of years.” The bosses of some of the world’s biggest financial institutions have spoken in glowing terms about Donald Trump’s presidency ahead of his inauguration in Washington DC.

Fed chief Janet Yellen "cautiously optimistic" about forces restraining growth https://t.co/ljsLw0AKFx pic.twitter.com/s66BQqjsZn— Bloomberg (@business) January 20, 2017 But in response to a question from Stanford professor John Taylor, Yellen reiterated her opposition to a proposed law that would require the Fed to stick to Taylor's well-known policy rule and to submit to an audit should it deviate. Such a law, she said, opens the Fed to short-term political pressures. Report from Reuters 8:35AM Agenda: Caution prevails in financial markets ahead of Trump inauguration Good morning and welcome to our live markets coverage.   Caution prevailed in financial markets on Friday ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, even as China's economic growth beat expectations and Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen toned down her earlier hawkish policy stance. China's fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth came in at 6.8 pc, versus forecasts of 6.7pc, supported by higher government spending and record bank lending.

Jamie Dimon is the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase (Source: Getty) Francesca Washtell JP Morgan Chase directors paid the bank's chief executive Jamie Dimon $28m (£22.7m) in total compensation for last year, the group said yesterday. This was a four per cent bump on the previous year and includes a base salary of $1.5m as well as cash and stock-related instruments tied to his performance, a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission revealed. Dimon's base salary was the same as in 2015, as was his $5m cash performance bonus, but the increase came from a $1m addition in performance share units.

The bank smashed expectations in the fourth quarter, reporting adjusted earnings per share of $1.71 on forecasts of $1.43. Revenues rose to $24.3bn in the fourth quarter, five per cent lower than the $25.5bn it brought in during the previous quarter - but two per cent up on the $23.7bn it made in the fourth quarter of last year.

Dimon, who’s also chairman, got a US$28 million compensation package for 2016, or 3.7 per cent more than a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing yesterday. It includes US$21.5 million in performance shares tied to future goals, a US$5 million cash bonus and US$1.5 million in salary. Under Dimon, 60, JPMorgan became the most valuable US lender by market capitalisation last year, taking the crown from Wells Fargo & Co, which stumbled because of a scandal tied to bogus customer accounts. JPMorgan, also the biggest US bank by assets, boosted revenue and cut expenses in 2016, helping it produce a record annual profit of US$24.7 billion. The firm has posted record profits in six of the past seven years. The stock rose 6.1 per cent last year before Donald Trump’s victory in November’s US presidential election, then surged as investors speculated that banks will benefit from higher interest rates, lighter regulation and lower taxes. The New York-based lender previously revamped its executive compensation programme for 2015 to link it more closely with performance. Dimon, who in prior years had received restricted shares that vest over time regardless of JPMorgan’s financial results, instead got performance units tied to the bank’s return on tangible common equity over three years. For Dimon to collect his US$20.5 million 2015 stock award for performance, he needs to keep the firm out of the bottom five in a ranking of 12 major banks. If he does better, he can earn up to 150 per cent of the award, increasing its target value by more than US$10 million, according to a February filing. The CEO got a 35 per cent pay boost to US$27 million in 2015, after receiving US$20 million a year for 2013 and 2014. For 2012, his pay was cut in half to US$11.5 million after the board said he bore some responsibility for the London Whale trading debacle. The company awarded US$19 million compensation packages to four of Dimon’s deputies, according to spokesman Joe Evangelisti. They are chief operating officer Matt Zames, corporate and investment bank chief Daniel Pinto, asset management head Mary Callahan Erdoes and retail bank chief Gordon Smith. That equated to raises of 2.7 to 5.6 per cent. Chief financial officer Marianne Lake got a 14 per cent raise to US$12.5 million, Evangelisti said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Wall Street slips after soft GDP data, earnings Stocks slip on earnings, data; dollar advances Microsoft’s market value tops US$500b again after 17 years US economy posts slowest growth since 2011 Ringgit ends lower against US dollar Trump pulls US out of Pacific trade deal, loosening Asia ties (VIDEO) US dollar slides near seven-week lows on fading Trump trade Saudi Aramco shelves plans for RAPID venture with Petronas, source says Ringgit to trade softer against US dollar next week At some Singapore suburban malls, retailers confront the sound of silence Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Alexa versus Siri Reutes Video: Miss Universe’s preliminary show starts in Manila Reuters Video: Ryan Gosling brings ‘La La Land’ to Tokyo Reuters Video: Mexicans build makeshift wall around US embassy in Trump protest Reuters Video: President Trump, Melania share 'first dance' Reuters Video: Marketing experts on how best to spend money, time, energy in 2017 Related Articles JPMorgan upgrades Indonesian stocks to ‘neutral’ after row Major US banks post strong 2016 earnings JPMorgan CEO Dimon may be headed to US Treasury Americans may spend less after clocks turn back US business moguls urge ‘commonsense’ governance approach Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s pay hiked to $28 million in 2016 By Emily Glazer Published: Jan 19, 2017 8:21 p.m. ET Share Exec gets package worth $1 million more than last year Bloomberg News Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. By EmilyGlazer J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive James Dimon will receive $28 million in total compensation for 2016, up 3.7% — or $1 million — from 2015, according to a Thursday securities filing. The chairman and chief executive’s pay package includes $21.5 million in performance-related restricted stock and $5 million in cash. His base salary is unchanged at $1.5 million, according to the filing. The total compensation is up from his 2015 pay package of $27 million. This is the second year Dimon is being paid in so-called performance share units, a type of restricted stock that has requirements on how long it must be held and has the possibility of being worth nothing based on the performance of Dimon and the bank. J.P. Morgan’s board awarded Dimon total pay of $28 million in 2016 based on strong performance across businesses, risk management, customers and leadership, according to the filing. The bank’s stock gained nearly 31% in 2016, though much of the increase came from a postelection bump across the banking sector. Before the November election, J.P.

Most of Dimon’s compensation is in JPMorgan shares that vest over several years. He received $1.5 million in salary and a $5 million cash bonus. While the package, approved by the board, still needs to be ratified by shareholders, it is expected to pass. Last week, JPMorgan reported a 24 percent increase in fourth-quarter profits, boosted by a blowout in trading following the election. The bank’s profits rose 1 percent for the year, to $24.7 billion — an all-time record for the bank. JPM shares are up 46 percent over the last 12 months Early last year, Dimon made what turned out to be an enormously successful bet when he plunked down $26.6 million to buy 500,000 shares while the bank was at a 52-week low. Those shares are now worth $41.7 million. All in all, Dimon, 60, owns about 6.7 million shares, totaling $558.11 million. Last year, Dimon received a 35 percent raise, to $27 million. Shares of the company fell 64 cents on Thursday, to $83.30, amid a broader market sell-off.

(Photo: Jerry S. Mendoza, AP file photo) The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has sided with Flint residents in a 24-year legal battle over whether the placement of a wood-fired plant in a neighborhood with many African-American residents was discriminatory. The agency is urging the State of Michigan to have a Non-Discrimination Coordinator to enforce discrimination law in environmental pollution and to address community concerns about "odor, fugitive dust, lead, or other impacts" from the Genesee Power Station in Flint. Related: DETROIT FREE PRESS MDEQ denies EPA claim that it discriminates against minorities DETROIT FREE PRESS JPMorgan pays $55M to settle mortgage discrimination lawsuit The letter, dated Thursday, was sent by the director of the external civil rights compliance office of the EPA,  under the Obama administration, to Rev. Philip Schmitter, of Christ the King Catholic Church, who filed the original complaint in 1992 against the state and local officials on behalf of the St. Francis Prayer Center. The 35-page letter blasts the state for, it says, ignoring compliance with federal laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, national origin, and other categories. It said the state discriminated against African Americans in Flint during the permit process from 1992-94. The letter said that the EPA had tried to work with the Michigan Department of Environmental Equality (MDEQ), but was unable to get them to make changes. The EPA civil rights compliance director, Lilian Dorka, gave a list of recommendations for the state environmental agency to comply with nondiscrimination requirements under law and to address community concerns about the plant. A spokesperson for the MDEQ could not immediately comment late Friday, but was working on a response.(Update: MDEQ responds to EPA letter, denying its claims of discrimination.)  A man who answered the phone at the power station said no one was available to comment late Friday. The EPA's recommendations included: Continue any current investigations and investigate any community concerns  Ensure a complaint and response system that enables residents to file complaints. The letter said in the past, the state didn't often make it clear how people could file discrimination or pollution complaints  "Ensure that all appropriate DEQ staff have been trained on its internal non-discrimination policies and procedures ..."  "Ensure its public involvement process is available to all persons regardless of race, color, national origin ... " After the initial complaint was filed in 1992, a lawsuit was filed in 1995 in Genesee County Circuit Court by the Flint chapter of the NAACP and others against state and local officials. In 1992, the plant got permission from the state to operate. It sat next to Carpenter Elementary School near Carpenter and Dort roads in Flint. Lead and other chemicals are emitted during the burning process, harming people in the neighborhood, say residents. "The facility will be emitting toxic metals, and those children are not there by choice," said Janice O'Neal, at the time an associate professor at C.S. Mott Community College, in a 1995 Free Press article about the lawsuit. "This area is predominantly black, low-income, with a disproportionate number of female-headed households. These people are at greater risk for all kinds of environmental exposures already. This ought to be taken into consideration in the siting process. If it's not, the process is racist." Thursday's letter doesn't appear to call for the plant to be shut down, but is aimed at persuading the state to make sure it allows minorities to be able to be involved in the public complaint processes. The EPA's letter comes as the Flint water crisis has also brought charges of environmental racism from some advocates who argue that because Flint is a black-majority and low-income city, it suffered from negligence from government officials. The Thursday letter came the day before Barack Obama left office, as the incoming Trump administration vows to roll back what they see as overregulation in departments like the EPA.

While China’s private refiners have received their first batch of quotas to buy foreign crude in 2017 and may get approval to purchase more later, the amount probably won’t exceed 2016 volumes, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. That’s because the government is cutting allocations for those who bought less last year. What the processors have been allowed to directly import in the latest tranche is 62 percent of 2016’s total levels, the bank said in a report. The refiners, known as teapots, have been wooed by everyone from producers such as Saudi Arabia to oil traders including Trafigura Group as a global supply glut stoked competition among sellers. While benchmark crude prices are gaining from their worst crash in a generation amid supply curbs by OPEC and other nations, demand from China — the world’s biggest energy consumer — will be key to a sustainable recovery. “All these uncertainties around the teapot quota will weaken the nation’s oil demand in the first half of the year,” Guo Chaohui, an analyst at Beijing-based China International Capital Corp., said by phone. “China’s oil imports hinge on one single big factor, and that is the teapots. And right now, they are facing policy risks.” The private refiners made their mark on the global oil market last year with purchases from Saudi Arabia to Africa and Latin America, after they first received import approvals in 2015 as part of a government effort to revamp China’s energy industry. Purchases of overseas crude were until then dominated by state-owned giants such as Sinopec and PetroChina Co. Their growing clout has brought with it several hurdles. Infrastructure at ports where they receive their oil has struggled to accommodate the surge in shipments. A lack of pipeline and storage facilities have proved to be a headwind, along with concern about teapots’ creditworthiness and lack of experience in international trade. The implementation of higher fuel-quality standards has led to speculation that some may be forced to shut. Perhaps most critically, authorities are clamping down on anyone who skirts tax rules. Their most recent struggle was earlier this month, when a lack of import quotas at the time meant a clutch of tankers filled with crude for the refiners were stranded off the eastern Chinese province of Shandong, where the teapots are clustered. The government has now approved the teapots to buy a total of 68.81 million metric tons of crude from overseas under a first batch of allocations for 2017, according to officials from companies that received the notification. Of that, 45.64 million tons can be bought directly by the private refiners, according to the JPMorgan report. The rest will be processed via state-owned traders and other agents. The independent processors were allowed to directly buy 73.77 million tons in 2016, the bank said. Baota Petrochemical Group, one of the refiners, was given 7 percent of its 2016 volume this year, according to the JPMorgan note. Baota was awarded 6.16 million tons for 2016. Nobody answered calls to Baota’s headquarters in Yinchuan city. Pro-Rated Quotas The latest batch of quotas for the refiners is calculated based on the companies’ January-October 2016 import volumes and pro-rated for a 6-month period this year, teapot officials said last week. The processors imported 30 million tons of crude in the first ten months last year, or about 720,000 barrels a day, according to Shanghai-based commodities researcher ICIS China. That compares with a combined allowance of 67.05 million tons a year for 17 companies as of October. China’s Ministry of Commerce, which issues the import quotas, didn’t respond to a fax inquiry seeking comment. Total inbound crude shipments to China rose to a record average of 7.63 million barrels a day in 2016, boosted by the teapots, government data show. The purchases were one of the factors that helped crude prices recover after they fell to below $30 a barrel amid the global oversupply. Brent crude, the benchmark for more than half the world’s oil, was up 0.4 percent at $54.40 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange by 12:51 p.m. Singapore time. “The total full year of 2017 crude oil import quota for teapots should be similar to 2016 levels and unlikely to see further significant expansions,” JPMorgan analyst Wang Ying said in the note. With import volumes and operating rates at the refiners expected to stay flat this year, the country’s crude oil import growth will slow, he wrote.

And as his paid up Private Briefing readers know, he's simply the best there is at "betting the other way" and winning - more than 217 double- and triple-digit peak gainers since 2011. So, right now - when the market pundits are overflowing with optimism and major indexes have only just stopped breaking all-time highs every other day - Bill thinks it's the perfect time to prepare for the worst and build a strategy that will keep your money safe and growing vigorously during downturns. He's going to show you how to do precisely that now...

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website nine  ×  one  =  Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter William Patalon III We've just been through a very healthy post-election rally that pushed the S&P 500 up a bit more than 6%, as of this week. The history buffs out there, like me, will note the S&P 500's "Trump Bump" was a little less than twice as powerful as the 3.7% shot in the arm Franklin D. Roosevelt's election dealt the index, but a bit less than half as potent as the ripping 13.29% rocket ride Herbert Hoover's victory "catalyzed" on the S&P 500 between his election in 1928 and his swearing-in. But… we all know how that rally ultimately played out for investors of Hoover's day. At his inauguration on March 4, 1929, "the Great Engineer," as Hoover was called, could rightly boast of huge market gains. And of course barely eight months later, by Oct. 29, the U.S. stock market was a smoking ruin, closing the door forever on the Roaring 20s and lifting the curtain on the Great Depression. Now, I'm not saying we're in for a repeat performance. Not at all. But I am conscious of the history, and as a dyed-in-the-wool contrarian, I'm inclined to prepare for the worst, especially if the good times are rolling. Besides, I agree 100% with our Chief Investment Strategist, Keith Fitz-Gerald, when he says that, "Chance favors the prepared mind." So even if it's the farthest thing from your mind, there's no time like right now to take in a few of what we here at Money Map Press like to call "Downturn Lessons." They'll not only save you a lot of heartache when the weather changes, but you'll be in a much better position to make money at a time when nearly everyone else is losing it. So let me share them with you. Downturn Lesson No. 1: Don't Run for Cover Investors are lousy at predicting short-term market trends. Indeed, as I hinted just a moment ago, if you sell out in a bad market and miss the rebound (or even miss a handful of the "best" market days), your long-term returns plummet. If you invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 at the start of 1995 – and stayed fully invested to the end of 2014 – your average annual return would have been 9.85%… and your stake would have grown to $65,453, JPMorgan Asset Management said in its 2015 "Guide to Retirement." But if you missed just the market's 10 best days, your average annual return would plunge to 6.1% – and your portfolio would only be worth $32,665. In other words, missing those few days where stocks were stock cut your gains in half. It gets worse. Miss the 60 best days (you cash out, run to the sideline, and only reinvest after the market outlook becomes "clear"… meaning you dozed through most of the bull-market rebound), and your portfolio actually records an average annual loss of 3.84%. That $10,000 you invested? It's now worth $4,570 – after two decades in the market. Build yourself a nice "foundation" of investments with a long-term horizon. And augment that by looking for special-situation opportunities. That's a one-two punch that will really put you on Easy Street in the long run. Downturn Lesson No. 2: Keep Your Plan Updated Everyone should have a financial plan – a written document that outlines your financial goals… and details how you expect to achieve them. Be sure to assess whether you're behind, ahead, or right on schedule. Do a new assessment each quarter. Downturn Lesson No. 3: Reassess Your Tolerance for Risk During the "dot-com" boom, lots of historically conservative investors were making so much money that they ceased to be concerned that this was being done by using increasingly risky stocks. (I have a story to share on this… in a few minutes.) When that dot-com boom turned into the "dot-bomb" bust, lots of folks were positively horrified by the shellacking they took. A physical therapist friend of mine was so badly stung that he can't retire – and he continues to work today – in his late 60s, even though his health problems have left him virtually crippled and visually impaired. Don't get stung like that. Take the time to assess your risk tolerance. And be honest. How much volatility can you really stand? How will you feel if the big gainers you're sitting on fall back, eradicating a chunk of those gains? Do you have the emotional makeup to ride through a whipsaw market? What about a full-blown crash? Finally, has your risk tolerance changed – due to the change in your age, financial situation, new goals, or experience in the markets? Once you've answered those questions, make any changes you feel you need to make in order to feel more secure in such a potentially uncertain environment. Downturn Lesson No. 4: Ditch Your Dogs No, not your pets. In fact, during times of intense stress, studies show that pets can help you relax, and actually promote wellness. (And I love animals…) I'm talking about ditching your "doggy" investments – the stocks, funds, or other holdings that have cratered in value or have done nothing during this powerful bull market. By dumping those laggards, you help yourself in a bunch of ways. First, you reduce the odds for still-steeper losses. You raise capital for new profit opportunities and even create a "margin of safety" in your holdings. And if you put that cash to work in a better-performing investment, you also rev up your returns. Downturn Lesson No. 5: Harvest Some Tax Write-offs If you have losses in some of your mutual funds, stocks, or ETFs, you can save some money on your taxes but still stay invested pretty much as you were by executing what's known as a "tax swap." You lock in the capital losses by dumping the losing positions and purchasing positions in companies in similar industries or funds with similar investment mandates. If you do this, make sure to beware of the "wash-sale rule," which can disallow the tax break if you invest the sale proceeds in a "substantially identical" investment within 30 days of the sale (before or after). Let's say you have a stock that's a loser, but that you still like. And you worry it could pop during the 30-day stretch that you're "out" of it. Here's a neat trick a mentor of mine taught me years ago. Buy an equal position in the same stock… then wait 31 days or more and sell the first position. If the stock moves in the interim, you'll go along for the ride. Otherwise, you've booked a loss that can offset other gains, but are still in line to profit if the stock rallies. And you're in at a lower cost basis than the original position. Talk to your accountant before you make any of these moves. Downturn Lesson No. 6: Switch to an "Accumulate" Strategy Thanks to Wall Street's sell-side analyst community (and some popular investment shows on certain cable channels), we're trained to think in terms of "Buy, Sell, or Hold" when it comes to stocks.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 21 January 2017 Europe’s future scares Davos elite as political risk mounts Dimon: ‘I say this out of respect for the European people, but they’re going to have to change.’ – AFP LONDON: The disintegration of Europe is becoming the next source of angst for a global elite that’s only just coming to terms with the concept of President Donald Trump. While the Davos elite spent much of the week trying to figure out what a Trump presidency will look like, the future of the world’s largest trading bloc became a hotter and hotter theme as the week wore on. “I worry much more about Europe,” Merck KGaA CEO Stefan Oschmann said in an interview at the World Economic Forum. “If the French elections go utterly wrong, the EU is in real trouble: we have the Italian banking situation, we still have Greece and we have the situation with migrants in Germany, everything is changing, we are somewhat concerned about that.” Those sentiments were echoed by investors, bankers and business chieftains gathered in Switzerland for the summit. JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon warned that the euro region may break up if political leaders don’t get to grips with the discontent that’s spurring support for populist leaders such as France’s Marine Le Pen. For billionaire George Soros, while Trump may be a “con man,” Europe’s disintegration is going to have “dire” consequences. Such anxieties are mounting because of the political environment in Europe: Anti-euro, anti-immigration presidential candidate Le Pen is currently the front-runner in a tight, three-way race in the French presidential contest that culminates May 7. Elsewhere, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said this week she will pursue a hard Brexit, indicating that the country won’t remain part of the EU’s single market. And Chancellor Angela Merkel will face off against growing populist movements in Germany in general elections this year. “The bigger impact is what happens to Europe,” Novartis AG chief executive officer Joe Jimenez said in an interview at Davos on Thursday. “Europe is in a state of flux right now and there’s a high level of volatility and uncertainty.” Dimon said he isn’t as worried about the future of the US under Trump, whose own rise drew on a populist movement. The real estate mogul and reality TV star is enlisting “very serious people” for his administration, such as Goldman Sachs alumni Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, who’ve been tapped to lead the Treasury Department and help oversee White House economic policy. Europe meanwhile must become more competitive, Dimon said. “I say this out of respect for the European people, but they’re going to have to change,” he said. “They may be forced by politics.” From Soros’s perspective, the EU is disintegrating following last year’s Brexit vote and Italian referendum -- a course that must be reversed. The trading bloc has become dysfunctional because it is governed by laws that are “not appropriate to the current circumstances” and not easily changed, he said. “If Europe breaks down, the consequences will be very dire,” the investor said. “But I do see a way it could be saved, and this is also recognized by many of the people in Brussels. “They can’t say so publicly, but they know that Europe is not functioning.” His comments came among signs that Le Pen, who has pledged to take France out of the euro if she wins, is gaining support in France. She has taken the lead in a major survey of voters’ intentions for the first round of the presidential election, according to an Ipsos Sopra Steria poll for Cevipof and Le Monde this week. Novartis’s Jimenez expects the uncertainty in Europe to have reduced in the next 12 months. And over the long term, the euro zone is likely to have fewer, “more like-minded” member countries, he said. “We’ll be watching very carefully what happens in the French elections and understanding what that will mean in terms of the future of the EU,” the head of the Swiss health-care giant said. – Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: davos Related Stories AirAsia expects binding bids by March China’s president warns against trade war Study: Businesses can unlock US$12 trillion Lagarde: China transition challenge is manageable Angst mounts in Davos as oil falls and China slows You May Be Interested Short Position Microsoft’s market value tops US$500bil again after 17 years Giving banks a run for their money Bring cheer to the underprivileged this festive season Go purple this CNY if you want to get lucky in love Six simple steps to feng shui your home Others Also Read Dishes that symbolise good luck and prosperity MPO concert raises RM123,000 for charity Trump tussle gives unpopular Mexican leader much-needed shot in arm Property Related advertisement Latest News Tycoon Slim says Trump not 'Terminator,' sees opportunities for Mexico In double whammy for Turkey, Fitch cuts to junk after S&P slashes outlook Fed to stop mortgage reinvestments in 2018 Wall St slips after soft GDP data, earnings Giving banks a run for their money Most Viewed in Business Making money from money Azman’s journey with AMMB Tycoon Slim says Trump not 'Terminator,' sees opportunities for Mexico Joey Yap: Good time to invest as assets are cheap What Dow hitting 20,000 points means to Malaysia In double whammy for Turkey, Fitch cuts to junk after S&P slashes outlook Unlocking value in MMC Giving banks a run for their money Fed to stop mortgage reinvestments in 2018 Wall St slips after soft GDP data, earnings advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

    * Bond prices mostly higher across the maturity curve

    By Solarina Ho
    TORONTO, Jan 20 The Canadian dollar pared
earlier losses following weaker-than-expected inflation and
retail sales data, to finish little changed against its U.S.
counterpart on Friday.
    Canada's annual inflation rate rose to 1.5 percent in
December from November's 1.2 percent, short of analysts'
forecasts for an increase to 1.7 percent, while retail sales
edged up 0.2 percent in November, just shy of expectations for
an increase of 0.5 percent.  
    Markets were focused on the inauguration and speech by
incoming U.S. president Donald Trump to see if he would give any
indication on the new administration's policies.
    "The market in general ... were anxiously awaiting any type
of surprise comment during the inauguration speech. And when
that didn't happen, for all intents the market feels as though
it was ready to call it a week," said Brad Schruder, director,
foreign exchange sales at BMO Capital Markets.  
    The Canadian dollar ended at C$1.3327 to the
greenback, or 75.04 U.S. cents, little changed from the Bank of
Canada's official close of C$1.3314, or 75.11 U.S. cents.
    The currency's strongest level of the session was C$1.3285,
while its weakest level was C$1.3388. It has weakened roughly 2
Canadian cents, or 1.5 percent on the week.
    Earlier in the week, the loonie, which had been trading near
the C$1.30 level against the U.S. dollar, took a tumble after
Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz indicated that an interest
rate cut was still possible.
    Schruder noted that the Canadian dollar's swing this week
from around C$1.30 to just below C$1.34 mirrored moves in mid
October following comments from the Bank of Canada.
    "That suggests to me that as USD/CAD approaches C$1.30, the
Bank of Canada would much prefer to see the Canadian dollar
weaken from that point, rather than pick up any steam below that
level," said Schruder.
    Canadian government bond prices were mostly higher across
the maturity curve, with the two-year price up 3.5
Canadian cents to yield 0.772 percent and the benchmark 10-year
 rising 9 Canadian cents to yield 1.75 percent.
    The Canada-U.S. two-year bond spread was -42.1 basis points,
while the 10-year spread was -71.9 basis points.

Since coming within a fraction of a point of 20,000 on January 6, the Dow has lost nearly 200 points, as of early this morning, inauguration day for President-elect Donald Trump. Including an adjustment for dividends, 13 DJIA stocks have posted losses so far this year, and two of the index’s 10 most heavily weighted shares are among the biggest losers, with those two alone accounting for more than 12% of the index average. All told, the five worst performing stocks account for about 20% of the Dow and 16.7% of its components. The five worst performing stocks to date in 2017 are Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM), Travelers Companies Inc. (NYSE: TRV), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE). Also check out the 24/7 Wall St. review of the best Dow stocks so far this year. Following the November elections, the sectors posting the best gains to date were financials (up about 16%); industrials (up about 9%); and materials (up about 7.7%). But since the beginning of the year, financials are down about 2%, energy is down about 1%, and health care has slipped from a high of about 2.5% to a gain of just 0.5%. Adjusted for dividends, Exxon Mobil stock traded down 6.13% for the year to date, as of mid-morning Friday. The stock traded at $85.32 in a 52-week range of $73.55 to $95.55, and the dividend yield is 3.48%. The 12-month consensus price target on the stock is $88.87. Last week, analysts at Wells Fargo cut its rating from Outperform to Market Perform and cut the valuation range from $92 to $100 to a new range of $87 to $93. We also have a look and the bull/bear case for Exxon and Chevron, the two energy stocks among the Dow 30. Financial sector giant Travelers has dropped 3.62% on a dividend-adjusted basis in the new year. In our bull/bear analysis of the Dow financial stocks, we noted that Travelers posted a share price gain of 11% in 2016, and the shares might have been overbought earlier this year.

Goldman Sachs is the most heavily weighted stock in the Dow, accounting for 8.03% of the index’s value. Goldman stock added 60% to its share price in the past six months of 2016, primarily on the basis of an expected easing of regulations on financial institutions under Trump administration.

Despite the prime minister’s promise to seek a transitional phase, financial professionals expressed disappointment after Brexit Secretary David Davis estimated that the period would amount to one to two years. Lenders are saying the government needs to ensure that they have time to adapt amid signs that the process will move quickly. Although the premier used terms like a “phased process of implementation” to avoid a “cliff edge,” Brexit Secretary David Davis estimated that the period would amount to one to two years. On top of the two years the government will use to negotiate its break from the EU, the industry will need at least three more years of access to the EU in its current form to adapt to what comes next, one bank executive said. An industry lobbyist suggested it might need as long as five years. Worst Case The U.K. leader indicated this week that she’ll pull Britain out of the European Union’s single market, prompting banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and HSBC Holdings Plc to begin detailing their strategies to shift thousands of jobs out of the country to ensure continued access to the bloc. “Talking about transitions and phase-ins will be important,” Barclays Plc Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley told Bloomberg Television on Thursday from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. A lack of clarity on the government’s part could force banks to assume the worst and begin enacting their contingency plans early and perhaps switch over more activities than they might do with more insight. Bankers are also concerned that discussions between the U.K. and EU on a transitional phase will come late in the divorce process. The finance industry needs time to make adjustments including finding offices abroad, shifting capital, moving or hiring staff, seeking regulator approvals in new locations and ensuring existing financial contracts remain legal. By talking of an “implementation” period, the government may just be aiming for enough time for firms to make technical legal changes rather than overhaul their businesses, Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Robert Wood told clients in a report this week. Politics is also in play. A lengthy adjustment period could be seen as foot-dragging by those who campaigned for Brexit and could hurt May if she ends up fighting for re-election in 2020 with deep ties to the EU still intact. Davis told the BBC on Wednesday that any interim arrangement “won’t be a long time” and will be determined by the terms of the final deal. Before 2020 “Markets seem to interpret ‘transition’ as effectively maintaining the U.K. in the EU perhaps until the mid-2020s,” Wood said. “That is, in our view, unlikely.” The most important business stories of the day.

Frankfurt, Madrid, Dublin and Paris are among the cities in their sights. Lloyd’s of London, the insurance market, is pushing ahead with plans to open European headquarters outside of Britain and will decide where to go in the first quarter, Chief Executive Officer Inga Beale said in an interview on Friday. Morgan Stanley may move as many as 1,000 jobs in sales and trading, risk management, legal and compliance, as well as back-office positions, Reuters reported Friday, citing an unidentified source. Citigroup Inc. could move about 100 positions, according to the report. “We continue to evaluate what changes we may need to make to our business, and no decisions have yet been made in this regard,” Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. Citigroup’s Danielle Romero-Apsilos declined to comment. Piecemeal Access May said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Thursday in Davos that she wanted “to ensure that we can keep financial services in the City of London. I believe that we will do just that.” While bankers hope May can match her words with action, previous EU trade accords with countries outside of the block have tended to allow only piecemeal access to the continent’s markets for finance. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond argues Britain should be a special case, saying companies and consumers throughout the EU benefit from the U.K. financial industry’s might and therefore have an interest in safeguarding it. “Any diminution of London’s financial system would be bad” for the EU and U.K., he said in Davos. EU leaders may not be persuaded, as cities on the continent look for ways to lure jobs from London. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble warned in Davos that any negotiations for banks to be able to penetrate the EU from the U.K. will be “very difficult” and would take “a lot of time.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Minyanville Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is Headed for a Much Rougher Road BAC stock has had a stellar run, but murky waters will dog the company in 2017 By Scutify Jan 20, 2017 9:38 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. I think it's fair to say we were all a bit shocked about the 2016 election results. If rumors are to be believed, even Donald Trump himself was taken aback. While the media focused on the nature of the upset, it wasn't all bad news. Beleaguered Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) finally got something positive cooking, ending 2016 up nearly 37%. Source: Shutterstock That's a stunning turnaround for BAC, which started last year with a 14% loss for the month of January. The President-elect's campaign message of a less burdensome regulatory environment paved the way for bullishness towards BAC stock. Of course, BofA wasn't the only beneficiary. The other members of the "Big Four" - JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) and even the controversial Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) - all piggybacked off the "Trump rally." The bullish thesis towards BAC stock and the rest of the financial services complex is easy to understand. Fewer regulations means that Bank of America can dial up the risk and get more aggressive. Furthermore, the U.S. Federal Reserve has trended towards a hawkish monetary policy for quite some time. This incentivizes banks to loan out money, for which BofA and others will receive a greater margin. This all sounds wonderful ... but why hasn't this resulted in sustained optimism? If you look at things a little more closely, BAC has only jumped 0.35% since Dec. 8. It's as if the Trump rally was exactly good for only one month. Should investors start to worry? BAC Under "The Donald" I'll say this: If you've taken a speculative bet on Bank of America shares, now would be a good time to consider taking some profits off the table. Although the fundamentals of a less burdensome regulatory environment is a tailwind, I have concerns about execution. Let's take a look at an unrelated, but extremely relevant news item. Last week, the Senate took the first step towards repealing the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as "Obamacare." As expected, thousands of people across the nation took to the streets to protest. And it's not just the fact that the fate of 20 million Americans insured under Obamacare hangs tenuously. No one has any idea of what will replace it. Check that - that's not entirely accurate. When asked about the reception of a new healthcare plan, Donald Trump replied, "I think we will get approval. I won't tell you how, but we will get approval." So there you have it: BAC and the rest of the financial complex are going to be great again because Donald Trump said so. What more provenance do you need? Bank of America is going to be the best bank ever. They'll have the least amount of problems. In fact, they won't have any problems. The American people are going to be so proud of BofA ... just you wait! For those that prefer a little more explanation, you might be out of luck. Given this uncertainty, I don't think it hurts at all to reconsider your exposure to BAC stock. Next Page Questionable Fundamentals for BofA Those that still ardently believe in the big banks may want to know how the rest of the industry is holding up. Of significant concern are the institutions that fall outside the Big Four. As an example, Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc (NYSE:NSM) took a good-sized beating last Friday and on Monday, slipping more than 10% over the last three trades. This volatility contradicts notions that our economy is steadily improving. Click to Enlarge It's easy to see why the financial services sector is not perfectly in tune if you look at the situation topically. Yes, banks will benefit from rising key interest rates, but only if they're willing borrowers. Here's the thing: New one family houses sold in the U.S. average 652,000 units since 1963. At last count, the figure was 592,000 and throughout virtually all of 2016, it averaged 563,000. In other words, we still have a long ways to go. Thus, rising rates are a double-edged sword for BAC stock. Sure, some divisions like business loans may see upticks, while home mortgages aren't likely to improve unless sentiment changes dramatically. If the housing market wasn't all that great to begin with at record-low interest rates, higher rates would logically exacerbate the problem. And if the repeal of Obamacare is any indication, we're not going to get much transparency from the new administration. Judging by the markets, BofA shareholders are feeling pretty antsy about the political transition. The populace and pro-business message sounded amazing on the campaign trail. However, in reality, the execution is much messier than anticipated. That might come back to haunt BAC, which has benefited from strong words, but not yet deeds.

The company moved from the Keystone building to Fishers in 2004 and no longer has a presence in its old headquarters, according to Mark Forsythe, president and chief operating officer of Mainscape Inc. "Mainscape Inc., the landscape maintenance organization, is a separate entity from Mainscape Leasing LLC," Forsyth said in an emailed statement to IBJ. "Mainscape Inc. is not a party to the litigation involving Mainscape Leasing, LLC and its lenders. The litigation has no impact on Mainscape Inc.’s business or services." The complaint comes after Mainscape founder Dave Mazanowski agreed in October to plead guilty to participating in a $16 million overbilling scheme. Federal prosecutors allege the sham was carried out in cahoots with top executives of the state’s largest nursing home company, American Senior Communities. Forsythe told IBJ that the foreclosure suit was in no way related to the charges against Mazanowski. Mainscape wrote in a letter to customers last October that Mazanowski voluntarily stepped down as CEO after being charged. The letter, from Forsythe, said the transactions at issue “were overseen personally by Mr. Mazanowski” and “no allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct” were leveled at anyone else in the company. Mazanowski started Mainscape as a Ball State University student in 1980 as a way to employ Christian students who otherwise would go home for the summer. It grew steadily over the years and now ranks No. 18 on Landscape Management magazine’s list of largest companies in the industry, with more than $71 million in annual revenue. Mainscape bought the 100,000-square-foot building on Keystone Avenue in 1995. Current tenants at its Keystone building include the Indiana Department of Child Services and the not-for-profit Child Advocacy Center. Before Mainscape’s purchase of the building, it last housed an Ames discount store and was nothing more than a shell. The company spent millions of dollars on improvements to the property, according to a 2002 story in IBJ. Mazanowski, meanwhile, is set to be sentenced Nov. 17 in federal court for his role in the overbilling scheme.

My JLAP experience counsels caution. I was remanded by the bar examiners, in keeping with the discretion given them by the Ind S.Ct. into JLAP from Jan 25, 2008 to Jan 22, 2009. As a direct result of that tour of duty in care of their hand-picked, handsomely paid, ideologically-attuned psych-fessionals, I am now banned for life from the Indiana bar. My refusal to adopt the demanded political correctness was my ostensible mental illness, a yellow star stapled to my sleeve. I will post at the end of this note the primary documents proving this up. (Funny thing, never have any bureaucrats filed against my Kansas license for posts like this or my legal work against them.) Here is what is most important to realize if you are sent into their parlor: JLAP is a tool of the court that must raise funds to survive. It raises funds by keeping persons under its ongoing tutelage by order of the court. Those so ordered, either via the BLE (conditional licenses) or a disciplinary matter, or even (at the beginning) voluntarily pay monies to keep the system afloat, pay to support JLAP's handful of chosen psych-fessionals. Those in the system also become the statistics JLAP uses to justify to the court and legislature their continued rule over those remanded to them. This psych-plantation system was busted hard by the DOJ in Louisiana in 2014, and the BLE supposedly agreed to not partake in such a system. See here: http://www.theindianalawyer.com/ada-violations-in-bar-admission-catch-attention-of-indiana-ble/PARAMS/article/33637. Alas, the BLE is not quite as keen on not using this plantation of the allegedly mentally ill as they claim, and esp when it can be used to sideline "extremists" .... as my briefing at appendix pages 110-115 here clearly reveal: https://www.scribd.com/document/299040062/Brown-ind-Bar-memo-Pet-cert. Read the facts in my three denied pet for cert to the SCOTUS to see just how JLAP uses its hand picked psych-fessionals to destroy those who refuse to assume the position: http://www.ogdenonpolitics.com/2013/10/catholic-lawyer-denied-admission-to-bar.html and https://www.scribd.com/doc/312841269/Thomas-More-Society-Amicus-Brown-v-Ind-Bd-of-Law-Examiners I escaped their clutches when they remanded this pro-life activist out of their system on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade years ago. I will never escape the stigma they carved into my forehead. My attorney was Samuel Vazanellis. I paid him for services he never finished for my driver's license. How can I get my money back on services he never completed? OK, let me see if I have this right ... "Rucker said diversity builds confidence in the judiciary, particularly for young people who see people of color on the bench as well as a female chief justice." RACE and GENDER DIVERSITY (Ie Not white, not male) GOOD. "It sort of keeps the extremes from making it through that process. … I think that process eliminates the outliers, and so you get what I like to call a group of raging centrists." IDEOLOGICAL DIVERSITY VERY BAD. Well sir, as one labeled an extremist by the Left, and culled out from your special club as a nonperson, please allow me to wish you off with this fine quote from the corridors of history you likely disdain: " I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice! And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue!" And to keep quoting Goldwater, please ruminate on this: "Equality, rightly understood, as our founding fathers understood it, leads to liberty and to the emancipation of creative differences. Wrongly understood, as it has been so tragically in our time, it leads first to conformity and then to despotism." You yourself have celebrated it, your honor. I agree that fully funding support programs is essential to successful criminal justice reform. If people don't get needed support, they may end up right back where they started, and observers will view the whole endeavor as a failure. It is wise to ensure that resources are available to promote the best possible outcome when undertaking these kinds of efforts. I also believe that people often need different types of support and accurately identifying someone's needs is critical. Some people may need a very low level of additional support to succeed, whereas others may need a high level of support to be successful. A person who is having trouble primarily because they are addicted to drugs has one set of needs. Someone who has low-impulse control has another set of needs. Someone who has had limited opportunities to receive education, has limited prospects for employment with a criminal record, and may need support to get education and clear their record through a legal process has another set of needs. Someone who needs to be in a batterer's intervention and have a clear set of incentives and "or else" provided to keep them on track has another set of needs. A "one-size-fits-all" model is not likely to be helpful to many people. I really liked Sheriff Clark's observation about how people may not have experiences and confidence to make life work without some initial empowerment. This doesn't mean that people are not fully capable of learning to do things, but they may not have had the role models to learn these things. If all of people's role models have ended up in prison or jail, with a few exceptions, and very few people in their family have ever held down a job or stayed in school for any meaningful period of time, they may need the kinds of empowering support and positive role models that everyone needs. There is an opportunity to support people and see what it is that they are missing that would help them succeed and have a positive life. It can be overwhelming and scary for people to ask for and accept help. They may be used to being very "tough." It is hard to admit that they may not know how to set up a bank account, apply for a job, or how they should conduct themselves at a job. I remember listening to a talk by a woman (Cathrine Sneed) who had helped run a program for people in jail in California and she talked about how a person who could succeed as a "tough" person on the street felt quite nervous about going into a bank and what people would think of him. We need to try to be open to each other's stories and do our best to respond in a helpful way. This is what is sounds like people in Indiana are doing and that is so wonderful and heartwarming to see.

Mainscape Leasing LLC is accused of failing to make required payments on a $7.8 million loan on its building at 4150 N. Keystone Ave. that came due in March 2016. Mainscape Leasing borrowed the money in February 2006 from JPMorgan Chase Bank, according to the suit. Chase, through trustee U.S. Bank, is seeking to have a receiver appointed by the court to manage the property during the foreclosure proceedings. A hearing is set for Tuesday.

Executives gathered in the Swiss resort for the World Economic Forum this week keep repeating, like a soothing mantra, that Donald Trump is at heart a pragmatist who will avoid trade wars and regulations that make it harder to do business. “What somebody’s saying is not necessarily what they’re going to do,” said David Cote, chief executive officer of Honeywell International Inc. He should hope so: Honeywell is a global manufacturing giant with far more employees outside the U.S. than in, and it has made major bets on projects like supplying parts for China’s first commercial jet. With stock markets nearing record highs and business-friendly figures like billionaire investor Wilbur Ross named to the cabinet, a conviction has set in that a man who came to power as an anti-establishment populist might in fact usher in a golden age for business. “In the end if he knows the facts, he’ll respond according to the facts,” said Hideaki Omiya, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The stakes are high for companies that have prospered during the era of globalization, locating factories where labor’s cheap and finding suppliers that can offer components at the most competitive prices. Trump has criticized the arrangements that make those integrated operations possible, calling the North American Free Trade Agreement -- which has allowed automakers like Ford Motor Co. to build supply chains spanning the length of the continent -- a “disaster.” During his campaign, Trump blasted the multilateral economic and political order, saying China, the most important U.S. trading partner, had been allowed “to rape our country.” ‘One Liners’ Companies shouldn’t sweat the president’s “one-liners” and instead should focus on Trump’s cabinet nominees, said Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. “I think that these very rational people will be very thoughtful when they go about the actual policy.”  Foreign companies say they’re similarly relaxed; Nissan Motor Co.’s co-CEO, Hiroto Saikawa, said he doesn’t believe Trump has any intention of severing trade ties that benefit the U.S. Some political veterans say the Davos set is being naïve. Larry Summers, a Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton, is puzzled by the shifting views on Trump and cautions against “enabling” the new administration. “I’ve been very troubled by the attitude of business people from the U.S.,” Summers said. “People who were terribly afraid of what this would mean for America’s place in the world are now hailing those who surround Donald Trump as great geniuses.” Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and adviser to former President George W. Bush, said executives shouldn’t entirely discount what Trump says. Past presidents, he notes, have been careful to avoid proclamations they don’t intend to stand behind.  “Usually when somebody who’s been elected president makes threats, people take it seriously,” Levy said. The healthcare industry has a more delicate task than most in making its case to Trump. Earlier this month he accused drugmakers of “getting away with murder” through high prices, and broke with traditional Republican policy by suggesting the government could use its purchasing power to rein in costs. Drugmakers, though, argue they need to charge what they do to reward the risks they face and to cover the cost of research. True North One of them, Merck KGaA CEO Stefan Oschmann, said he’s “convinced that the U.S. is a market that values innovation.” Besides, he said, pharmaceutical companies employ thousands of highly paid researchers in cities like Boston and San Diego, “a huge share of the value chain of drug-making.” The most important business stories of the day.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Executives looking for ways to avoid confrontation with Trump will try to highlight those arguments, on the assumption that his main concern is U.S. economic growth and employment, rather than ideology. Winning his support may not take much: he took to Twitter to praise Wal-Mart Stores Inc. for a “big jobs push back into the U.S.” after the retailer announced 10,000 new positions that in fact represented a slowdown in growth plans compared with previous years. “This is all about jobs in the U.S.,” said Novartis AG CEO Joe Jimenez. “That will be the True North, and everything else will follow that.” The ultimate test of whether Trump implements his stated policies may be their impact on U.S. consumers, who’ve grown accustomed to cheap products made abroad. The U.S. in 2015 imported $2.2 trillion of goods and exported $1.5 trillion. The country ran trade deficits of $367 billion with China and $61 billion with Mexico, its largest and third-biggest trading partners, respectively. There are already signs, however, that Trump is preparing for a wholesale overhaul of trade that goes well beyond rhetoric. He’s created a National Trade Council to advise him, picking Peter Navarro, a professor at the University of California at Irvine and a sharp China critic, to run it. Some Davos attendees were prepared to concede that optimism about Trump is built, at least in part, on wishful thinking. “I don’t think anyone likes the unpredictability he brings to the table,” said Martin Eurnekian, a director at Buenos Aires-based conglomerate Corporacion America. “Everybody wants to believe,” he said, “that it’s mostly for show.” For more on Davos, see our special report on the World Economic Forum 2017.

 There's one business on Wall Street that has suddenly 'become a lot more interesting' Matt Turner Jan. 20, 2017, 11:57 AM 9,655 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/Susana Vera You could hear it in every earnings call and see it in every analyst note. There's a lot going on in the world, and one group of traders stands to benefit. From JPMorgan to Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs to Citigroup, executives highlighted their macro trading businesses, the units that help clients bet on moves in interest rates and in the foreign-exchange market — the financial instruments most sensitive to shifting political winds and economic uncertainty. There are suddenly lots of triggers for moves in those markets. Here's a selection of notable comments: "If you look at what's going on in the markets, a lot of activity. There's movement in currencies, in rates, in oil, and in equities. It's a rare time when there's a lot in motion. I think it's a market that honestly screams for you to have a view, and with that comes activity," James Gorman, Morgan Stanley CEO, said in an interview with CNBC in Davos, Switzerland. "Our macro businesses benefited from increased volumes in rates and repositioning in FX as the markets re-priced the path for US monetary and fiscal policy following the election," Jonathan Pruzan, Morgan Stanley CFO, said on an earnings call. "As the world gets a little growth here, and as rates get raised and as people anticipate further raising of interest rates, those markets, of course, become a lot more interesting," Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs CEO, said in an interview with CNBC in Davos. "What we saw from clients in the second half of the year was basically a build of confidence and expectation that we might see stronger fiscal policy, divergence of interest rates, that we weren't heading into a deflationary cycle, more confidence about economic growth, and so I would say there was increased optimism around the world," Harvey Schwartz, Goldman Sachs CFO, said on an earnings call. "It was a strong performance in the quarter, and we would expect that to continue at it's much more interesting to for our clients to trade around a moving yield curve and rates above zero, so as we see rates normalize we would fully expect that to be ultimately a beneficiary to the franchise in terms of clients trading and positioning and hedging around that over time," Marianne Lake, JPMorgan CFO, said on an earnings call. "Rates and currencies grew roughly 30% year-over-year, reflecting strong client activity and a more favorable environment continuing on the positive momentum that began to build in the second quarter," John Gerspach, Citigroup CFO, said on an earnings call. In November, the Treasury market moved rapidly after the surprise election of Donald Trump, as investors adjusted to a new set of expectations for fiscal stimulus and inflation. In December, the Federal Reserve hiked rates. The dollar surged through late 2016, too, while other currencies like the Mexican peso took a hit. On January 18, Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen said she expects the Fed to hike "a few" times in 2017. In Europe, the British pound is bouncing around, moving daily depending on what UK Prime Minister Theresa May says. The European Central Bank's base interest rate remains at 0%, while its deposit rate is -0.4%. And upcoming elections in Holland, France, and Germany have some worried about the future of the EU. "We believe higher macro volatility is here to stay," Kinner Lakhani, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a note. That has traders hoping for bigger bonuses and bank analysts predicting that the macro business will grow. Kian Abouhossein, an analyst at JPMorgan, is forecasting a 2% increase in fixed income, currencies, and commodities revenues in 2017, with macro products like rates and FX expected to drive the increase. "We believe that ongoing global political uncertainty (Brexit, French/Dutch/German elections, US trade policies, etc.) are likely to result in good client volatility in FX and rates leading to healthy trading volumes," he said in a note.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    U.S. bankers, buoyed by a resurgence in profits, are advising their counterparts in Europe to think positively about the new administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. But many Europeans still need convincing. At the annual gathering of the world's political and business elites in the Swiss resort of Davos, U.S. financiers told investors and overseas' rivals to focus less on Trump's anti-globalisation rhetoric and more on his cabinet picks, comprising of Wall Street veterans and corporate bosses. Many European bankers fear Trump, who campaigned on an "America first" platform and who has threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports, could trigger a trade war with the world's second-largest economy. Jose Vinals, chairman of Standard Chartered Bank and a former deputy governor of the Spanish central bank, said there was a lot of unease over whether the Republican's campaign rhetoric would translate into his policies as president. "In Europe, there is concern and trepidation about Trump's administration and how his politics will affect global trade and finance," he told Reuters. "Any form of protectionism will likely ultimately make the U.S. economy less competitive and be bad news for the world," said Vinals, who has previously built up an expertise on Asian markets, including China, while working as a senior official at the International Monetary Fund. But Mary Callahan Erodes, who runs the asset management arm of U.S. bank JPMorgan, sought to assuage concerns about the incoming White House administration. She told the World Economic Forum that Trump's officials, including former Goldman Sachs bankers Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, would push a pro-business agenda that would drive economic growth. "We are going to have to get used to thinking very pro-actively and getting excited about growth," she said. "It is a pendulum swing and it is going to be positive for business. It just is." Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund manager who has been appointed by Trump to liaise with the business community, was the only member of the new U.S. administration to attend the Davos forum. He spoke publicly about how Trump would be good for the global economy and, according to banking sources, followed this up with private discussions with European bankers. But the sources said industry players in Europe wanted more clarity on key U.S. economic policies from Trump himself. Banks on both sides of the Atlantic might be happy at having a leader in the White House who has pledged to cut tax rates and ease restrictions imposed on banks' risk-taking in the wake of the financial crisis.   TRADING STRENGTH At private lunches and evening cocktail receptions in the swish ski resort, some U.S. financiers expressed concern about the impact from Trump's blunt re-evaluation of key foreign policy principles and his penchant for castigating American companies on Twitter. Most bankers expect volatile market swings in 2017 after investors, having driven up stock prices in anticipation of tax cuts and spending hikes, grow impatient for action. Increased volatility plays to Wall Street banks' greater strength in trading bonds, stocks and currencies. U.S. investment banks have already reported bumper fourth-quarter results following a surge in trading volumes across commodities, interest rate products and foreign exchange as investors reworked their portfolios in response to Donald Trump's surprise victory and the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike. Goldman Sachs, the bank most dependent on trading, has seen its stock rise nearly 30 percent since the Nov. 8 election. European banks have not yet reported fourth-quarter earnings but their shares have also have been boosted by the U.S. developments. The region's banking index is up 15 percent as investors bet banks such as Barclays and Deutsche, which have U.S. investment banking operations, will get a boost from increased trading and deal action. To be sure, some European bankers reflected that sunnier outlook in Davos, saying Trump was good news for banks. "He wants banks to have more say in economic growth and I fundamentally think that is an inextricable link combination, you don't have strong economies in the long run without strong banks, and vice versa," said Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Britain's Lloyds. "Banks are for the economies like blood is for the body and, therefore, I see that as very positive." © 2017 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:00 PM, January 20, 2017 JAKARTA - Goldman Sachs has rejected allegations by an Indonesian businessman who is seeking $1.1 billion in damages from the U.S. bank for making what he called "unlawful" trades in the shares of a property firm. The U.S. bank said the legal dispute may affect foreign investor sentiment toward Southeast Asia's biggest economy. Indonesia's government has recently raised investor concerns by cutting business ties with JPMorgan over a negative research report and partially reversing a mining policy. Benny Tjokrosaputro, president director of Indonesian property developer PT Hanson International Tbk <MYRX.JK>, filed a lawsuit in a Jakarta court on Sept. 8 against Goldman's unit, Goldman Sachs International. Tjokrosaputro was the owner of the 425 million Hanson shares that Goldman traded, according to a statement on his lawyer's website. "(The) transaction was conducted unlawfully and/or without the consent of our client." (http://bit.ly/2k8op50) In an emailed statement on Friday, Goldman said Goldman Sachs International bought the shares from New York hedge fund Platinum Partners in a series of "valid" transactions on the Indonesia Stock Exchange between February 2015 and March 2016. Top executives of Platinum Partners were arrested in December and charged with running a $1 billion fraud. Tjokrosaputro is seeking 15 trillion rupiah ($1.1 billion) in compensation from Goldman Sachs International and wants its assets frozen in Indonesia and overseas. Citibank, a custodian bank for Goldman Sachs International, was named as a co-defendant in his lawsuit. Goldman said in response that Goldman Sachs International was the legal owner of the Hanson shares. "Any business dealings or deal made between Mr. Tjokrosaputro and Platinum Partners before this have no bearing or obligation on Goldman Sachs," it said. The bank would take "all necessary action to protect itself and recover damages from Mr. Tjokrosaputro," it said, without elaborating. It also said that Tjokrosaputro's "unfounded actions" risked undermining Indonesia's effort to attract international investment and threatened the integrity of Indonesia's stock market. "All investors in Indonesia should be free to trade with confidence, without fear that legitimately executed trades will later be subject to spurious legal action by unconnected third parties," Goldman said. Tjokrosaputro and his lawyer did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. Citibank was not immediately available for comment.

The U.S. bank said the legal dispute may affect foreign investor sentiment towards Southeast Asia's biggest economy. Indonesia's government has recently raised investor concerns by cutting business ties with JPMorgan over a negative research report and partially reversing a mining policy. Benny Tjokrosaputro, president director of Indonesian property developer PT Hanson International Tbk, filed a lawsuit in a Jakarta court on Sept. 8 against Goldman's unit, Goldman Sachs International. Tjokrosaputro was the owner of the 425 million Hanson shares that Goldman traded, according to a statement on his lawyer's website. "(The) transaction was conducted unlawfully and/or without the consent of our client." (http://bit.ly/2k8op50) In an emailed statement on Friday, Goldman said Goldman Sachs International bought the shares from New York hedge fund Platinum Partners in a series of "valid" transactions on the Indonesia Stock Exchange between February 2015 and March 2016. Top executives of Platinum Partners were arrested in December and charged with running a $1 billion fraud. Tjokrosaputro is seeking 15 trillion rupiah ($1.1 billion) in compensation from Goldman Sachs International and wants its assets frozen in Indonesia and overseas. Citibank, a custodian bank for Goldman Sachs International, was named as a co-defendant in his lawsuit. Goldman said in response that Goldman Sachs International was the legal owner of the Hanson shares. "Any business dealings or deal made between Mr. Tjokrosaputro and Platinum Partners before this have no bearing or obligation on Goldman Sachs," it said. The bank would take "all necessary action to protect itself and recover damages from Mr. Tjokrosaputro," it said, without elaborating. It also said that Tjokrosaputro's "unfounded actions" risked undermining Indonesia's effort to attract international investment and threatened the integrity of Indonesia's stock market. "All investors in Indonesia should be free to trade with confidence, without fear that legitimately executed trades will later be subject to spurious legal action by unconnected third parties," Goldman said. Tjokrosaputro and his lawyer did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. Citibank was not immediately available for comment.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Money News | Fri Jan 20, 2017 | 8:09pm IST Goldman Sachs rejects Indonesian businessman's $1.1 bln claim over share trade By Eveline Danubrata | JAKARTA JAKARTA Goldman Sachs has rejected allegations by an Indonesian businessman who is seeking $1.1 billion in damages from the U.S. bank for making what he called "unlawful" trades in the shares of a property firm. The U.S. bank said the legal dispute may affect foreign investor sentiment towards Southeast Asia's biggest economy. Indonesia's government has recently raised investor concerns by cutting business ties with JPMorgan over a negative research report and partially reversing a mining policy. Benny Tjokrosaputro, president director of Indonesian property developer PT Hanson International Tbk, filed a lawsuit in a Jakarta court on Sept. 8 against Goldman's unit, Goldman Sachs International. Tjokrosaputro was the owner of the 425 million Hanson shares that Goldman traded, according to a statement on his lawyer's website. "(The) transaction was conducted unlawfully and/or without the consent of our client." (bit.ly/2k8op50) In an emailed statement on Friday, Goldman said Goldman Sachs International bought the shares from New York hedge fund Platinum Partners in a series of "valid" transactions on the Indonesia Stock Exchange between February 2015 and March 2016. Top executives of Platinum Partners were arrested in December and charged with running a $1 billion fraud. Tjokrosaputro is seeking 15 trillion rupiah ($1.1 billion) in compensation from Goldman Sachs International and wants its assets frozen in Indonesia and overseas. Citibank, a custodian bank for Goldman Sachs International, was named as a co-defendant in his lawsuit. Goldman said in response that Goldman Sachs International was the legal owner of the Hanson shares. "Any business dealings or deal made between Mr. Tjokrosaputro and Platinum Partners before this have no bearing or obligation on Goldman Sachs," it said. The bank would take "all necessary action to protect itself and recover damages from Mr. Tjokrosaputro," it said, without elaborating. It also said that Tjokrosaputro's "unfounded actions" risked undermining Indonesia's effort to attract international investment and threatened the integrity of Indonesia's stock market. "All investors in Indonesia should be free to trade with confidence, without fear that legitimately executed trades will later be subject to spurious legal action by unconnected third parties," Goldman said. Tjokrosaputro and his lawyer did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. Citibank was not immediately available for comment.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 10:00 PM, January 20, 2017 DAVOS, Switzerland - U.S. bankers, buoyed by a resurgence in profits, are advising their counterparts in Europe to think positively about the new administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. But many Europeans still need convincing. At the annual gathering of the world's political and business elites in the Swiss resort of Davos, U.S. financiers told investors and overseas' rivals to focus less on Trump's anti-globalization rhetoric and more on his cabinet picks, comprising of Wall Street veterans and corporate bosses. Many European bankers fear Trump, who campaigned on an "America first" platform and who has threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports, could trigger a trade war with the world's second-largest economy. Jose Vinals, chairman of Standard Chartered Bank <STAN.L> and a former deputy governor of the Spanish central bank, said there was a lot of unease over whether the Republican's campaign rhetoric would translate into his policies as president. "In Europe, there is concern and trepidation about Trump's administration and how his politics will affect global trade and finance," he told Reuters. "Any form of protectionism will likely ultimately make the U.S. economy less competitive and be bad news for the world," said Vinals, who has previously built up an expertise on Asian markets, including China, while working as a senior official at the International Monetary Fund. But Mary Callahan Erodes, who runs the asset management arm of U.S. bank JPMorgan <JPM.N>, sought to assuage concerns about the incoming White House administration. She told the World Economic Forum that Trump's officials, including former Goldman Sachs bankers Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, would push a pro-business agenda that would drive economic growth. "We are going to have to get used to thinking very pro-actively and getting excited about growth," she said. "It is a pendulum swing and it is going to be positive for business. It just is." Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund manager who has been appointed by Trump to liaise with the business community, was the only member of the new U.S. administration to attend the Davos forum. He spoke publicly about how Trump would be good for the global economy and, according to banking sources, followed this up with private discussions with European bankers. But the sources said industry players in Europe wanted more clarity on key U.S. economic policies from Trump himself. Banks on both sides of the Atlantic might be happy at having a leader in the White House who has pledged to cut tax rates and ease restrictions imposed on banks' risk-taking in the wake of the financial crisis. TRADING STRENGTH At private lunches and evening cocktail receptions in the swish ski resort, some U.S. financiers expressed concern about the impact from Trump's blunt re-evaluation of key foreign policy principles and his penchant for castigating American companies on Twitter. Most bankers expect volatile market swings in 2017 after investors, having driven up stock prices in anticipation of tax cuts and spending hikes, grow impatient for action. Increased volatility plays to Wall Street banks' greater strength in trading bonds, stocks and currencies. U.S. investment banks have already reported bumper fourth-quarter results following a surge in trading volumes across commodities, interest rate products and foreign exchange as investors reworked their portfolios in response to Donald Trump's surprise victory and the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike. Goldman Sachs, the bank most dependent on trading, has seen its stock rise nearly 30 percent since the Nov. 8 election. European banks have not yet reported fourth-quarter earnings but their shares have also have been boosted by the U.S. developments. The region's banking index <.SX7P> is up 15 percent as investors bet banks such as Barclays and Deutsche, which have U.S. investment banking operations, will get a boost from increased trading and deal action. To be sure, some European bankers reflected that sunnier outlook in Davos, saying Trump was good news for banks. "He wants banks to have more say in economic growth and I fundamentally think that is an inextricable link combination, you don't have strong economies in the long run without strong banks, and vice versa," said Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Britain's Lloyds <LLOY.L>. "Banks are for the economies like blood is for the body and, therefore, I see that as very positive."

Anthem announced earlier in a filing that it was extending the termination date for the pending merger, through and including April 30, 2017 and would appeal a negative ruling. Cigna said in a statement that it had received notice of Anthem’s extension and that it would evaluate its options after the court ruling.

On Wednesday, “Shark Tank” host and O’Shares Investments chairman Kevin O’Leary announced a bid for the leadership of Canada’s Conservative party. Members of Canada’s Conservative party will vote on a leader May 27, who will challenge Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of the Liberal party in the 2019 federal election. In his first exclusive interview with an American publication, O’Leary told Benzinga why he decided to run. Blogosphere Sell Netflix, Buy Blockbuster: "There’s nothing wrong with ideas, new or old, but the problem is that once we come public with them, it becomes incredibly difficult to change our mind. To admit that what we once believed is no longer valid can be viewed from the outside (and often times from the inside) as a sign of weakness, rather than a sign of growth. I want to look at a few real world examples of this." Trending SGYP IBM GE SWKS ENDP PG SPY FSLR STI AXP GLBL SLB RF CSX SYF In the days leading up to President Barack Obama’s inauguration on January 20, 2009, traders panicked. Activity for the S&P 500 spiked with a trade volume of 7.8 billion just two days before the ceremony. Between the week preceding the election and the day following, the index fell 3.4 percent. On the day of inauguration, alone, it fell 5.2 percent. Trump’s fate may not at all resemble that of his predecessor, who championed very different economic policies. But history shows that even his economic doppelganger, Ronald Reagan, saw negative market activity on his first day.

If rumors are to be believed, even Donald Trump himself was taken aback. While the media focused on the nature of the upset, it wasn’t all bad news. Beleaguered Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) finally got something positive cooking, ending 2016 up nearly 37%. Source: Shutterstock That’s a stunning turnaround for BAC, which started last year with a 14% loss for the month of January. The President-elect’s campaign message of a less burdensome regulatory environment paved the way for bullishness towards BAC stock. Of course, BofA wasn’t the only beneficiary. The other members of the “Big Four” — JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) and even the controversial Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) — all piggybacked off the “Trump rally.” The bullish thesis towards BAC stock and the rest of the financial services complex is easy to understand. Fewer regulations means that Bank of America can dial up the risk and get more aggressive. Furthermore, the U.S. Federal Reserve has trended towards a hawkish monetary policy for quite some time. This incentivizes banks to loan out money, for which BofA and others will receive a greater margin. This all sounds wonderful … but why hasn’t this resulted in sustained optimism? If you look at things a little more closely, BAC has only jumped 0.35% since Dec. 8. It’s as if the Trump rally was exactly good for only one month. Should investors start to worry? BAC Under “The Donald” I’ll say this: If you’ve taken a speculative bet on Bank of America shares, now would be a good time to consider taking some profits off the table. Although the fundamentals of a less burdensome regulatory environment is a tailwind, I have concerns about execution. Let’s take a look at an unrelated, but extremely relevant news item. Last week, the Senate took the first step towards repealing the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as “Obamacare.” As expected, thousands of people across the nation took to the streets to protest. And it’s not just the fact that the fate of 20 million Americans insured under Obamacare hangs tenuously. No one has any idea of what will replace it. Check that — that’s not entirely accurate. When asked about the reception of a new healthcare plan, Donald Trump replied, “I think we will get approval. I won’t tell you how, but we will get approval.” So there you have it: BAC and the rest of the financial complex are going to be great again because Donald Trump said so. What more provenance do you need? Bank of America is going to be the best bank ever. They’ll have the least amount of problems. In fact, they won’t have any problems. The American people are going to be so proud of BofA … just you wait! For those that prefer a little more explanation, you might be out of luck.

REUTERS/Mike Segar By Carmel Crimmins and Pamela Barbaglia | DAVOS, Switzerland DAVOS, Switzerland U.S. bankers, buoyed by a resurgence in profits, are advising their counterparts in Europe to think positively about the new administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. But many Europeans still need convincing. At the annual gathering of the world's political and business elites in the Swiss resort of Davos, U.S. financiers told investors and overseas' rivals to focus less on Trump's anti-globalization rhetoric and more on his cabinet picks, comprising of Wall Street veterans and corporate bosses. Many European bankers fear Trump, who campaigned on an "America first" platform and who has threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports, could trigger a trade war with the world's second-largest economy. Jose Vinals, chairman of Standard Chartered Bank (STAN.L) and a former deputy governor of the Spanish central bank, said there was a lot of unease over whether the Republican's campaign rhetoric would translate into his policies as president. "In Europe, there is concern and trepidation about Trump's administration and how his politics will affect global trade and finance," he told Reuters. "Any form of protectionism will likely ultimately make the U.S. economy less competitive and be bad news for the world," said Vinals, who has previously built up an expertise on Asian markets, including China, while working as a senior official at the International Monetary Fund. But Mary Callahan Erodes, who runs the asset management arm of U.S. bank JPMorgan (JPM.N), sought to assuage concerns about the incoming White House administration. She told the World Economic Forum that Trump's officials, including former Goldman Sachs bankers Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, would push a pro-business agenda that would drive economic growth. "We are going to have to get used to thinking very pro-actively and getting excited about growth," she said. "It is a pendulum swing and it is going to be positive for business. It just is." Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund manager who has been appointed by Trump to liaise with the business community, was the only member of the new U.S. administration to attend the Davos forum. He spoke publicly about how Trump would be good for the global economy and, according to banking sources, followed this up with private discussions with European bankers. But the sources said industry players in Europe wanted more clarity on key U.S. economic policies from Trump himself. Banks on both sides of the Atlantic might be happy at having a leader in the White House who has pledged to cut tax rates and ease restrictions imposed on banks' risk-taking in the wake of the financial crisis. TRADING STRENGTH At private lunches and evening cocktail receptions in the swish ski resort, some U.S. financiers expressed concern about the impact from Trump's blunt re-evaluation of key foreign policy principles and his penchant for castigating American companies on Twitter. Most bankers expect volatile market swings in 2017 after investors, having driven up stock prices in anticipation of tax cuts and spending hikes, grow impatient for action. Increased volatility plays to Wall Street banks' greater strength in trading bonds, stocks and currencies. U.S. investment banks have already reported bumper fourth-quarter results following a surge in trading volumes across commodities, interest rate products and foreign exchange as investors reworked their portfolios in response to Donald Trump's surprise victory and the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike. Goldman Sachs, the bank most dependent on trading, has seen its stock rise nearly 30 percent since the Nov. 8 election. European banks have not yet reported fourth-quarter earnings but their shares have also have been boosted by the U.S. developments. The region's banking index .SX7P is up 15 percent as investors bet banks such as Barclays and Deutsche, which have U.S. investment banking operations, will get a boost from increased trading and deal action. To be sure, some European bankers reflected that sunnier outlook in Davos, saying Trump was good news for banks. "He wants banks to have more say in economic growth and I fundamentally think that is an inextricable link combination, you don't have strong economies in the long run without strong banks, and vice versa," said Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Britain's Lloyds (LLOY.L). "Banks are for the economies like blood is for the body and, therefore, I see that as very positive."

Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund manager who has been appointed by Trump to liaise with the business community, was the only member of the new U.S. administration to attend the Davos forum. He spoke publicly about how Trump would be good for the global economy and, according to banking sources, followed this up with private discussions with European bankers. But the sources said industry players in Europe wanted more clarity on key U.S. economic policies from Trump himself. Banks on both sides of the Atlantic might be happy at having a leader in the White House who has pledged to cut tax rates and ease restrictions imposed on banks' risk-taking in the wake of the financial crisis. TRADING STRENGTH At private lunches and evening cocktail receptions in the swish ski resort, some U.S. financiers expressed concern about the impact from Trump's blunt re-evaluation of key foreign policy principles and his penchant for castigating American companies on Twitter. Most bankers expect volatile market swings in 2017 after investors, having driven up stock prices in anticipation of tax cuts and spending hikes, grow impatient for action. Increased volatility plays to Wall Street banks' greater strength in trading bonds, stocks and currencies. U.S. investment banks have already reported bumper fourth-quarter results following a surge in trading volumes across commodities, interest rate products and foreign exchange as investors reworked their portfolios in response to Donald Trump's surprise victory and the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike. Goldman Sachs, the bank most dependent on trading, has seen its stock rise nearly 30 percent since the Nov. 8 election. European banks have not yet reported fourth-quarter earnings but their shares have also have been boosted by the U.S. developments. The region's banking index is up 15 percent as investors bet banks such as Barclays and Deutsche, which have U.S. investment banking operations, will get a boost from increased trading and deal action. To be sure, some European bankers reflected that sunnier outlook in Davos, saying Trump was good news for banks. "He wants banks to have more say in economic growth and I fundamentally think that is an inextricable link combination, you don't have strong economies in the long run without strong banks, and vice versa," said Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Britain's Lloyds. "Banks are for the economies like blood is for the body and, therefore, I see that as very positive."

The 50-story Trammell Crow Center on Ross Avenue is among the city's most beloved 1980s towers. The owners of the 32-year-old post modern high-rise are about to begin substantial changes to the building -- including construction of a retail, hotel and parking structure across the street. "We are going to be making some dramatic changes to not only the interior but the exterior of the building to go with the expansion across the street,"  said Ramsey March, managing director at Stream Realty Partners. "Everything below the third floor will get a refresh if not a complete replacement. "The idea is to pour light and life into the heart of the building and encourage foot traffic between the Arts District and Ross Avenue," said March, the development manager. Trammell Crow Center is a 50-story postmodern skyscraper at 2001 Ross Avenue in the Arts District of downtown Dallas, opened in 1985. DAVID WOO/Staff Photographer/Staff Photographer The redevelopment will bring more than 30,000 square feet of new retail and restaurant space to the two blocks, which are just south of Klyde Warren Park. Trammell Crow Center owner JPMorgan Asset Management and building manager and leasing agent Stream Realty have been working for more than a year with international architect HOK on the tower redesign. The skyscraper will get a totally new entrance on Ross, and the two lower floors will be largely rebuilt. The most notable change will be a 50-by-80-foot glass and metal entry atrium, which will extend out to Ross Avenue. Now, there is "really a tiny keyhole of an entry to the building," March said. "The focus of the entire Trammell Crow Center renovation is the creation of a grand hall that traverses the building from Ross Avenue to Flora Street. "We are pulling the building out toward the street. It will introduce a lot of light and glass." Dark wood and stone that now lines the lobby will be replaced with lighter-colored wood, stone, metal and glass. "What you are going to see in the interior is a lot of white stone," March said. "There will be a total overhaul with modern materials everywhere." The Ross Avenue side of the building will be enlarged with two new retail wings that will extend toward the street on three sides. "It effectively pops out the ground floor of the building," Marsh said. "We will have about 8,000 square feet for two restaurant outlets. A new glass entry and retail will replace small doors and granite walls on the Ross Avenue side of the tower. (HOK/Neoscape) The current front of the Trammell Crow Center has a narrow entry and granite walls. Steve Brown "The corner of Harwood and Ross we have really reserved as our full-service upscale dining option." A rotunda and two elevated walkways over the current lobby will be removed and new space will be built on the second level to house a conference center and fitness facilities. March said the grounds of the Trammell Crow Center will be reshaped with outdoor eating and gathering areas. The biggest expansion is across the street of a vacant block between Harwood and Olive Street that JP Morgan Asset Management bought in 2014. The original plan was to build additional parking for the Trammell Crow Center. But the project has expanded to a major mixed-use development. "We are going to be adding 2,050 parking spaces across the street," Marsh said. But the same building in the first phase will house 26,000 square feet of retail space plus a 200-room boutique hotel. A second phase of the development will add a 400-unit residential tower. "The skin on that building has a lot of glass and metal and sculptural quality we think will make sense with the Arts District," March said. "It won't look like another parking structure." Dallas architect HKS designed the new building and Austin Commercial is the general contractor. Turner Construction is the contractor for the existing building remodel. "They are making an enormous investment," said John Crawford with Downtown Dallas Inc. "And it's not just lipstick and rouge — this is a significant addition to the entire neighborhood. "It adds greatly to the overall environment in that part of downtown. It is a major statement on behalf of the ownership of that property and a major commitment to the future." Trammell Crow Center owner JPMorgan Asset Management also owns the landmark Crescent development in Uptown, where it is finishing a $35 million-plus renovation. The investor isn't disclosing how much the Trammell Crow Center revamp and the additional building will cost. But March said the price tag is higher than at the Crescent. The current lobby in the Trammell Crow Center will be replaced with a "grand hall." Steve Brown A new second floor at Trammell Crow Center will add a conference center and fitness center. Steve Brown Trammell Crow Center is the latest in a string of downtown skyscrapers getting a redo. The 1.2 million-square-foot office tower is more than 80 percent leased. But several major tenants, including law firms Baker McKenzie and Vinson & Elkins, have announced plans to leave Trammell Crow Center for new towers under construction. While other downtown office building reboots have amped up tenant amenities, the Trammell Crow Center project goes further with the addition of so much retail and restaurant space. "We want to invite people into the building and into our retail establishments," March said. "They are not just for the building tenants but for the neighborhood." March said Ross Avenue has a traffic count of more than 14,000 cars a day. "There has never been built on Ross Avenue the kind of retail in this format and patio space from scratch that the best restaurants and retailers demand," he said. "We saw a blatant gap in the market." About 4,000 people work in the Trammell Crow Center, and there are 16,000 workers within two blocks of the site. "A lot of them are getting in their car and driving to Uptown for lunch," March said. He said most of the planned restaurants will be casual eateries that will appeal to a broad demographic. "We are going to land two or three full-service lunch or dinner options that law firms and investment banks are going to want," March said. Retail Street Advisors, which worked on the new CityLine campus in Richardson and Preston Hollow Village in North Dallas, is leasing the retail center. "I think there is a great opportunity to program additional retail and restaurant along Ross and in the Arts District," said Retail Street Advisors' Aaron Stephenson. "The design is very retail focused with an emphasis on storefront and sidewalk interaction versus a more top-down approach where retail is an afterthought. "There's just not a lot of viable retail space in this area but our studies indicate that there is demand." Construction will start this quarter on the new building on the south side of Ross, and work on the Trammell Crow Center renovations will be underway by midyear. The project is set to wrap up by fall 2018. A new building across the street from Trammell Crow Center on will bring parking, a hotel and retail space along Ross Avenue. HKS The new retail, parking and hotel building will occupy what is now a parking lot across the street from Trammell Crow Center.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Business  • Markets •  Money Real Estate Legal Corporate News One News Page > Markets > S&P Futures, Dollar Rise As World Awaits Trump Inauguration Speech S&P Futures, Dollar Rise As World Awaits Trump Inauguration Speech George SorosDonald Trump Friday, 20 January 2017 (1 week ago) Global shares were mixed, equity futures, the dollar and crude rose as investors focused their attention on today's inauguration of Donald Trump as U.S. president. While the early tone is well bid, some traders anticipate a volatile session, with speculation that a bout of "sell the inauguration" could cap the aging Trump rally, which started with his inauguration. Despite last night's Yellen speech which was more dovish than her remarks just 24 hours earlier, and which suggested that the US economy is "not overheating", the dollar managed to rebound from overnight losses and was trading 0.2% higher this morning. The early gains came after China reported its first economic expansion in 2 years (conveniently with president Xi in Davos) with GDP rising to 6.8% after quarters of decline. However for the year, China's GDP growth declined to the slowest pace in 26 years, despite a record debt load and record weak Yuan. * * But it will be all about Trump today: tens of thousands of law enforcement officers and miles of barriers were in place in Washington D.C., as officials braced for hundreds of thousands of people planning to celebrate or protest the inauguration of Trump.  The inauguration is “definitely a big moment for the markets,” said Neil Mellor, a London-based currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon Corp. “We could get more clues about what Trump is planning today. *If he ramps up the rhetoric the market will be concerned about building long dollar positions*.” "All eyes will be on the content and style of Trump's inauguration speech," Morgan Stanley's Hans Redeker wrote in a note.  "The more 'Presidential' this speech comes across, the better the outcome for markets." "[Trump is] likely to talk about job creation and unifying the U.S. and we may have to wait a bit longer for details on economic measures," said Natixis fixed income strategist Cyril Regnat. “It’s clear that investors have reached a level where they are prepared to wait and see what the Trump administration has to offer,” said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets Asia Pacific Ltd. in Sydney. Trump’s inauguration ceremony “*will be followed by a speech that will be carefully decoded by those looking for signs of things to come in the new U.S. administration, an exercise that amounts to political astrology in an era characterized by a shakeup of the old rules of the game*,” Citigroup’s chief global political analyst Tina Fordham wrote in note. As Bloomberg notes, rallies in the dollar and equities are easing this week before Trump is sworn in as the 45th American president, with investors growing anxious for indications the administration will follow through on pro-growth campaign promises. Billionaire investor George Soros said the euphoria among stock investors since Trump’s victory will end as uncertainty takes over. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has churned in its tightest range ever over the past month. European stocks opened weaker before recouping some losses to trade flat. Trading was choppy with mining shares, the biggest beneficiaries of the reflation rally spurred by Trump's election win, the biggest drag on the indexes. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was poised for its worst week since early December while the pound slid after a report showed U.K. retail sales fell at the fastest pace in almost five years last month. Gold headed for a fourth weekly advance. Fund flows in the run-up to Friday's inauguration indicate investors moving into less risky assets and locking in some profits in banking stocks and high-yield debt. Precious metals funds saw their first inflows in 10 weeks, according to data from fund tracker EPFR and Bank of America-Merrill Lynch while money was pulled from funds focused on financials stocks and high-yield bonds. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index little changed as declines in miners offset gains in energy shares. Futures on the S&P 500 Index rose 0.2%. The S&P500 is heading for its biggest weekly drop of 2017. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average were little changed on Friday, and may be pressued by the disappointing earnings from both American Express and IBM. 10Y yields were flat at 2.5%, erasing previous declines. Government bonds retreated across the European Union. * * * *Bulletin summary from RanSquawk* · Somewhat of a quiet affair this morning with European bourses failing to find any firm direction · USD saw softness during Asian hours amid dovish interpretations of Yellen's latest comments as well as ahead of Trump's inauguration · As well as Presidential Elect Trump's Inauguration, today also see Canadian CPI and comments form Fed's Harker and Williams *Market Snapshot* · S&P 500 futures up 0.2% to 2267 · Stoxx 600 down 0.1% to 362 · FTSE 100 down less than 0.1% to 7205 · DAX down less than 0.1% to 11595 · German 10Yr yield up 2bps to 0.4% · Italian 10Yr yield up 3bps to 2.02% · Spanish 10Yr yield up 2bps to 1.5% · S&P GSCI Index up 0.5% to 396.9 · MSCI Asia Pacific down 0.1% to 140 · Nikkei 225 up 0.3% to 19138 · Hang Seng down 0.7% to 22886 · Shanghai Composite up 0.7% to 3123 · S&P/ASX 200 down 0.7% to 5655 · US 10-yr yield up 3bps to 2.5% · Dollar Index up 0.16% to 101.31 · WTI Crude futures up 1.2% to $51.98 · Brent Futures up 1.2% to $54.79 · Gold spot down 0.3% to $1,201 · Silver spot down 0.9% to $16.87 *Top Global News* · Trump Arrives for Inauguration With Promise to Unify the Nation: Addresses supporters on eve of swearing-in · Yellen Says Fed Not Behind the Curve, Backs Gradual Rate Rises: Yellen sees risk in allowing the economy to run too hot · Data showed U.K. retail sales fell at the fastest pace in almost five years in December · China’s central bank said it provided a "temporary liquidity facility’’ to some major commercial banks for 28 days to help ease a cash crunch before the Lunar New Year holiday · Soros Says Markets to Slump With Trump, EU Faces Disintegration: Says incoming U.S. president will fail · JPMorgan Boosts CEO Dimon’s Annual Pay 3.7% to $28 Million: Bank awards $19 million compensation packages to four deputies · IBM Margins Narrow While It Struggles to End Sales Slide: Revenue slips for 19th quarter, margins shrink for fifth · American Express Profit Falls 8.2% as Expenses Top Estimates: Lender increases forecast for full-year earnings- per-share · Deutsche Bank Burden in Mortgage Settlement Eased by Fine Print: German bank is the first to negotiate such a provision · Heineken in Discussions With Kirin to Double Down in Brazil: Price would be less than a quarter of what it paid in 2011 · TPG’s Cushman & Wakefield Said to Have Held Early IPO Talks: Company said to hold informal meetings on listing soon as 3Q * * * *Looking at regional markets, Asian stocks traded mixed *following an uninspiring lead from Wall Street with participants cautious ahead of the US Presidential Inauguration and as the region digests Chinese GDP data.

The gauge is heading toward its first weekly advance since the period ending Dec. 23.  The pound dropped 0.3 percent to $1.2301 and the euro retreated 0.3 percent to $1.0637. Nerves among USD longs were telling in late Asia and first thing in London were telling as the presidential inauguration ahead carries the ever-present risk of way lies ahead in terms of trade and currency policy in particular. This has since been reversed to some degree as UST yields push higher towards the highs seen at the very start of the year, but USD gains look a little more hesitant given events later in the day. USD/JPY is eyeing a return to the mid 115.00 highs seen yesterday, but notable was the EUFt/USD return to the upper 1.0600's again despite was an unchanged status quo at the ECB Thursday, with tapering considerations dismissed out of hand to see the accommodative stance maintained despite rising headline inflation. For GBP, *a softer than expect retail sales read in the UK for Dec has put a modest dent in the Pound based on the EUR/GBP upturn, *which as yet struggles for momentum above the .8650 mark. Cable has slipped below 1.2300, but partly due to the broader USD impact. 1.2250 support has yet to be tested. *In commodities, *the Trump inauguration ahead is prompting much caution across all asset classes, but given the prospective impact on infra structure spending and trade policy which has ramifications for China in particular, base metals in particular have been trading flat to marginally lower over the last 24-36 hours or so. Gold was finding a modest bid as the USD retreated a little this morning, but with US Treasuries pulling back again, we have seen the yellow metal slip back below USD1200.00, although it is likely that general risk sentiment will provide some support given today's key events In Washington. Oil prices have stabilised after some notable losses in recent sessions, but the USD50.00 handle looks safe for now. *Looking at today’s calendar, *there's nothing of note in the US this afternoon although we will hear from both the Fed’s Harker (2pm GMT) and Williams (6pm GMT). Of course the main event today will be Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 45th US President. The swearing-in ceremony is due at 2.30pm GMT. Before we wrap up, in addition to all things Trump related this weekend it’s also worth highlighting a couple of other potentially interesting events. French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen and Holland’s Freedom Party head Geert Wilders are amongst political leaders speaking at a rally of European nationalist parties in Germany tomorrow. Meanwhile on Sunday, France’s leftist parties are due to hold the first round of their primary. So worth keeping an eye on both those events. *US Event Calendar* · 9am: Fed’s Harker Speaks in New Jersey on Economic Outlook · 9:45am: Markit US Manufacturing PMI, Jan P, est. 54.3 (prior 54.3) · 10am: Existing Home Sales, Dec., est. 5.55m (prior 5.61m) · 10am: Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, Jan. (prior 8) · 1pm: Baker Hughes rig count · 1pm: Fed’s Williams Speaks at Event at San Francisco Fed *Government:* · 12pm: President-Elect Donald Trump takes oath of office · Senate to hold confirmation votes on some Cabinet nominees · 3pm: Congressional Hispanic Caucus holds news conference with House Democratic leaders on immigration policy * * * *DB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap* In my 2017 outlook presentation in Paris I asked 4 questions where the audience were able to vote on the answer. The first was when will the next US recession occur? The audience voted 45% for 2019 and 45% for 2020 or beyond. The rest were 2017 and 2018. So they were pretty optimistic that the cycle will extend. When I asked this question to two big audiences on my travels last year around 70% answered 2017 or 2018 so expectations have seemingly changed. I also asked whether Italy will still be in the single currency in 5 years time. 91% said yes. Last year around 80% said yes in similar polls so again a more optimistic crowd. When asked whether the ECB will be fully out of QE by YE 2018 around 80% said no so it seems investors, although optimistic, still feel the ECB need to keep stimulus high over the next two years. Finally I asked what was the most likely event to occur out of the following four by the end of 2018? a) 10 year USTs above 5%, b) the S&P 500 trading below 1500, c) England winning the football World  Cup or d) France electing Le Pen. Interestingly answer a) won with nearly 50% and the biggest shock was that England winning the World Cup scored 40% on this measure with the other two making up the last 10%. So only a few French investors thought a Le Pen victory was more likely than 5% yields, the S&P 500 below 1500 or England winning the World Cup. So overall an optimistic crowd contrasting with surveys I did last year at various conferences. So there's no doubt sentiment has changed in 2017 even if markets are in a bit of a lull. This should change soon one way or another as Donald Trump's inauguration today marks the start of what promises to be a fascinating ride with a wide range of outcomes. Trump is set to speak at 2.30pm GMT and all we know right now is that Trump was said to have prepared the speech himself, with some advice and counsel from advisers as well as from some historians specifically regarding the length of the speech. Trump was also said to have told reporters that the speech will aim to unite America but we know little more than that at this stage. So it remains to be seen just how market moving this will be. One topic which is certainly hogging the spotlight right now is the administration’s views on the US Dollar. Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin was the latest to address the currency debate yesterday and added to the confusion by saying that Trump’s observation on Monday that the Dollar is too strong was not meant as a “long-term comment”. Instead, Mnuchin said that “long-term strength over long periods of time is important” and that “I believe that’s a reflection of (the US having) the most attractive investment environment in the world”. Mnuchin also made comments about bank regulation, saying he supports the Volcker rule. On top of this he also said that he would look to raise the debt ceiling sooner rather than later, while also saying that he would label China a FX manipulator if warranted. Over in markets, Dollar strength was again a theme yesterday after the USD index closed up +0.22% although it did pare earlier gains of as much as +0.80%. The other theme yesterday was the second successive day of Treasury yields climbing higher. In fact 10y Treasury yields closed up 4.4bps higher yesterday at 2.475% - which is a YTD high - and have all of a sudden risen 17bps from the intraday lows on Tuesday. The data helped at the margin but it appeared to be Yellen’s speech the day before and then those comments from Mnuchin which helped drive yields higher. The Fed Chair spoke again this morning but it seems to largely be a repeat of what she said previously, with little new information to highlight. Meanwhile US equity markets never really got going yesterday with the S&P 500 finishing -0.36% with rate sensitive sectors in particular underperforming. Before we go any further we’re straight to China now where the latest monthly data dump is in. It has revealed that China’s economy grew 6.8% yoy in Q4 last year which was slightly more than the 6.7% expected by the market. For full year 2016, China reported growth of 6.7% which, while being the slowest pace since 1990, did end up right in the middle of the government’s official target. Meanwhile other activity indicators were mixed. Retail sales rose +10.9% yoy in December (vs. +10.7% expected) which is a tenth higher than that in November, although industrial production did slip two-tenths to +6.0% yoy (vs. +6.1% expected). Finally fixed asset investment was reported as rising +8.1% yoy for the full year (vs. +8.3% expected). In terms of the market reaction Chinese equity markets are higher in response with the Shanghai Comp and CSI 300 +0.54% and +0.69% although a Bloomberg report suggesting that the China Financial Futures Exchange is to relax curbs on trading might also be helping the positive tone. Elsewhere it’s more mixed. The Nikkei is +0.14% although the Hang Seng (-0.58%), Kospi (-0.19%) and ASX (-0.58%) are down. Moving on. The other focus for markets yesterday was the ECB meeting outcome. As we’d expected, a patient message was preached. Our European economists noted that the Bank is looking through the rise in headline inflation as the ECB’s patience and willingness to wait to extract the underlying trend from inflation was emphasized. Draghi said the Council will “continue to look through” HICP inflation “if judged to be transient and to have no implications for medium-term price stability”. The ECB President also outlined a framework for judging the “sustained adjustment” of inflation. In the view of our colleagues, “looking through” inflation implies less risk of an early tightening move in March. June is still the earliest timing for a tapering decision. Away from that it was interesting to hear comments (Bloomberg) from hedge-fund manager George Soros yesterday in Davos. Speaking about Brexit he said that “it is unlikely that Prime Minister May is actually going to remain in power” and that Britons are in denial about what the economic impact of Brexit could be. When commenting about Europe Soros added that the laws that govern the EU are “not appropriate to the current circumstances” and that while he acknowledges it can still be saved, those making decisions in Brussels “know that Europe is not functioning”. Before we look at the day ahead, it was an overall decent day for economic data in the US yesterday. Housing starts were reported as rising a bumper +11.3% mom (vs. +9.0% expected) in December while the November data was also revised up. Building permits (-0.2% mom vs. +1.1% expected) did miss but again we saw upward revisions to prior months. Meanwhile initial jobless claims declined to 234k from 249k which is the lowest since November. Finally the Philly Fed manufacturing survey ticked up 3.9pts to 23.6 (vs. 15.3 expected). That’s actually the highest level since November 2014 and more importantly, the detail revealed broad-based improvement which is indicative of a decent improvement in business spending this year according to our US economists. Looking at today’s calendar, this morning in Europe the early data comes from Germany where the December PPI print will be released. Thereafter we’ll get retail sales numbers in the UK for the month of December which is expected to show a -0.4% mom decline excluding fuel. There’s nothing of note in the US this afternoon although we will hear from both the Fed’s Harker (2pm GMT) and Williams (6pm GMT). Of course the main event today will be Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 45th US President. The swearing-in ceremony is due at 2.30pm GMT. Before we wrap up, in addition to all things Trump related this weekend it’s also worth highlighting a couple of other potentially interesting events. French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen and Holland’s Freedom Party head Geert Wilders are amongst political leaders speaking at a rally of European nationalist parties in Germany tomorrow. Meanwhile on Sunday, France’s leftist parties are due to hold the first round of their primary.

If rumors are to be believed, even Donald Trump himself was taken aback. While the media focused on the nature of the upset, it wasn’t all bad news. Beleaguered Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) finally got something positive cooking, ending 2016 up nearly 37%. Source: Shutterstock That’s a stunning turnaround for BAC, which started last year with a 14% loss for the month of January. The President-elect’s campaign message of a less burdensome regulatory environment paved the way for bullishness towards BAC stock. Of course, BofA wasn’t the only beneficiary. The other members of the “Big Four” — JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) and even the controversial Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) — all piggybacked off the “Trump rally.” The bullish thesis towards BAC stock and the rest of the financial services complex is easy to understand. Fewer regulations means that Bank of America can dial up the risk and get more aggressive. Furthermore, the U.S. Federal Reserve has trended towards a hawkish monetary policy for quite some time. This incentivizes banks to loan out money, for which BofA and others will receive a greater margin. This all sounds wonderful … but why hasn’t this resulted in sustained optimism? If you look at things a little more closely, BAC has only jumped 0.35% since Dec. 8. It’s as if the Trump rally was exactly good for only one month. Should investors start to worry? BAC Under “The Donald” I’ll say this: If you’ve taken a speculative bet on Bank of America shares, now would be a good time to consider taking some profits off the table. Although the fundamentals of a less burdensome regulatory environment is a tailwind, I have concerns about execution. Let’s take a look at an unrelated, but extremely relevant news item. Last week, the Senate took the first step towards repealing the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as “Obamacare.” As expected, thousands of people across the nation took to the streets to protest. And it’s not just the fact that the fate of 20 million Americans insured under Obamacare hangs tenuously. No one has any idea of what will replace it. Check that — that’s not entirely accurate. When asked about the reception of a new healthcare plan, Donald Trump replied, “I think we will get approval. I won’t tell you how, but we will get approval.” So there you have it: BAC and the rest of the financial complex are going to be great again because Donald Trump said so. What more provenance do you need? Bank of America is going to be the best bank ever. They’ll have the least amount of problems. In fact, they won’t have any problems. The American people are going to be so proud of BofA … just you wait! For those that prefer a little more explanation, you might be out of luck. Given this uncertainty, I don’t think it hurts at all to reconsider your exposure to BAC stock.

Close share panel Image copyright Reuters Image caption Donald Trump may have a hard time getting his agenda through Congress Donald Trump's hand-picked policy advisers have indicated that some of his most controversial campaign promises may never be fully implemented. The BBC spoke to members of the Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of 19 business leaders who will meet with the incoming president, who will be sworn in on Friday, on a regular basis to help shape his economic agenda. They expressed scepticism over whether Mr Trump would be able to follow through on his pledges to rip up trade deals, repeal the Affordable Care Act or roll back energy regulations. The Forum includes JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon, Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman and General Motors' Mary Barra - the latter of which has been at the receiving end of the president-elect's Twitter attacks - and none of whom have been shy in making the case for globalisation and free trade. One member of the Forum, BCG's Rich Lesser, added to that chorus at the World Economic Forum in Davos. George Soros: Trump is an imposter Hedge fund boss Dalio: Trump will boost growth Davos coverage in full Speaking to the BBC, Mr Lesser said, "I believe the fundamentals of a strong globalisation framework are good for the economy," and played down some of Mr Trump's rhetoric on destroying decades-old trade relationships with Mexico and China. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nafta has been a win for all its members, says Rich Lesser "I think in many cases," Mr Lesser said, "he's not looking to blow things up, he's looking to address what he and others perceive as real imbalances in trade." He also defended Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement which Mr Trump has referred to as "the worst trade deal in history", as having been "a win" for all its constituent countries, including the United States. And although he welcomed the chance to improve elements of Nafta and other trade relationships, Mr Lesser dismissed comments made to the BBC by the Trump administration's Anthony Scaramucci, who had suggested that the US would win a trade confrontation with China. "I don't think anyone would win in a trade war," Mr Lesser said. Health check Another member of the Strategic and Policy Forum, which has yet to meet with the president, said his oft-repeated campaign promise to repeal Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, would probably not be realised. "It is a very complicated law, it is affecting the biggest industry in the United States, and it is well positioned," said Dr Toby Cosgrove, who runs the Cleveland Clinic, a network of not-for-profit American hospitals. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Dr Toby Cosgrove has cast doubt on the planned repeal of Obamacare "If you just repeal it, there's going to be 20 million people who are without healthcare insurance and I think it would be politically very unpopular." Dr Cosgrove, who was decorated for his services as a surgeon in the Vietnam war, and who was initially tapped by Donald Trump to be the head of the Department of Veteran Affairs, also underlined the strength of US institutions and their restraining effect on policymaking. "What you are going to see is the political reality of trying to get a bill through Congress," he said of the president-elect's efforts to repeal Obamacare. "The US has a tripartite government. President-elect Trump is the executive, then we have the legislature and the judiciary. Each one is a modifying force on the other. "I suspect what you are going to see is a continuing refinement of the law." Asked whether he thought Donald Trump understood the complex landscape of healthcare policy in the US, Dr Cosgrove said: "No, I don't think he does. "He has not been a policy person, he's been a business person, but he has surrounded himself with lots of people who are familiar with the intricacies." Energy warning Another member of the Forum also highlighted the limitations of the Oval Office and pointed to how Mr Trump's plans could be frustrated by political forces in individual states. Dr Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning energy expert and vice-chairman of IHS Markit, said that while some regulations would be rolled back, the removal of clean energy subsidies and the ramping up of fossil fuel production would probably not "be as dramatic a change as possible". "Oil and gas production in the US is largely regulated by the states," he said, "not by the federal government.

He added: "The US is not going to move away from clean energy, there is a lot of new wind and solar that is going to come in over the next few years." Dr Yergin also called into question the viability of axing Nafta, particularly in light of the amount of oil and natural gas traded between Mexico, Canada and the United States. "If the energy trade is disrupted or impacted, it's not a question of who wins or who loses," he said. "It's lose-lose for both sides." 'Case for optimism' All of the Forum members whom the BBC spoke to were keen to stress that they were not working for the administration, but had been invited to air their views and give impartial advice to the president-elect. And some also underlined that they thought Mr Trump's flagship policies of lower taxes, lighter regulation and increased government spending would be good for business.

"On a fundamental level, the US has largely been, at the federal level, in gridlock for a decade," he said. "I think people see an opportunity with a businessman as president, who is very committed to business and to growth, and potentially much less gridlock with the Republicans in control of Congress." But one prominent Forum member, who didn't want to be interviewed on the record, said he spoke for all Forum members when he said: "We have no idea what the hell is going to happen."

But Steven Mnuchin, President-elect Trump's pick for treasury secretary, signaled on Thursday that the Volcker Rule isn't on the chopping block, at least not completely. "I do support the Volcker Rule," Mnuchin said during his confirmation hearing in the U.S. Senate. The post-crisis rule bans big banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) from making risky bets with their own money -- actions that some say exacerbated the financial crisis. Mnuchin said he didn't believe risky trading belongs in banks that require FDIC insurance. However, Mnuchin sounded concerned about unintended consequences of the rule, which is named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, flagged a recent Fed paper that found the 2015 implementation of the Volcker Rule had a harmful effect on the ability to easily buy and sell bonds during times of stress. Without that liquidity, markets can get jammed up. "That is something I absolutely would look at," Mnuchin said. Trump's pick for treasury blamed an overly-complex interpretation of the Volcker Rule that has left Wall Street confused and handcuffed about their abilities to provide liquidity. Making bets or trading with their own money is known in Wall Street as proprietary trading. "We need to be able to explain to banks what's proprietary trading -- and what's not proprietary trading," Mnuchin said. Related: Wall Street hates the Volcker Rule. Will Trump kill it? Powerful Republican leaders had been pushing to kill the Volcker Rule. The Financial Choice Act, a bill championed by House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, calls for repealing the rule entirely. Mnuchin's testimony to Congress suggests the Trump administration will relax -- but not completely eliminate -- some regulation. For instance, Mnuchin said he thinks the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the watchdog championed by Elizabeth Warren, is worth keeping. By comparison, Hensarling's bill would get rid of the CFPB, much to the disappointment of supporters who credit the regulator with cracking down on shady payday lenders and big banks like Wells Fargo. (WFC) However, Mnuchin said he believes the CFPB should be funded by Congress, not the Federal Reserve as it currently is. CFPB supporters would push back against such a shift. Their argument is that it would hurt the agency's independence and could allow Republicans to starve it of funding. Related: Mnuchin: Raise the debt ceiling sooner rather than later Yet Mnuchin didn't give big banks much love, especially not compared with Main Street banks. "My biggest concern is this regulation is killing community banks," Mnuchin said, adding that tiny lenders provide much-needed loans to small businesses. Mnuchin also said he wants to make sure "we don't end up in a world where we only have four big banks." Trump's treasury pick was asked about bringing back the Glass-Steagall Act. Last summer the official Republican platform called for a return of this Great Depression-era law that restricted banks from serving both Wall Street and Main Street. The law was repealed in 1999 under President Clinton. "I don't support going back to Glass-Steagall as is," Mnuchin said. He explained that Glass-Steagall is a "very old law" and implementing it now "would have very big implications to liquidity and capital markets." Still, Mnuchin said there's a need for a "21st Century Glass-Steagall." He didn't elaborate exactly what that would look like.

Some in financial sector blast buzz over Brexodus By Victor Reklaitis Published: Jan 24, 2017 4:06 a.m. ET Share HSBC, UBS, Goldman, J.P. Morgan talk about shifting jobs out of Britain Getty Images Should we get some pictures before we’re transferred? By VictorReklaitis Markets writer Here’s another sign that Brexit is getting real: Big banks are revealing plans to shift workers from London to other European cities. U.K.-based HSBC HSBA, +0.54% HSBC, -0.07%  expects to move about 1,000 staff out of London to Paris, and Switzerland’s UBS UBSG, -4.52% UBS, -3.61%  sees about 1,000 jobs affected, according to comments from execs. Among U.S. banks, Goldman Sachs GS, -1.10% is considering cutting its London workforce to roughly 3,000 from 6,000 and transferring key operations to New York and continental Europe, particularly Frankfurt, according to a report from German business newspaper Handelsblatt. And J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +0.21%  CEO Jamie Dimon said this month that there “will be more job movement than we hoped for,” after warning last year that 4,000 U.K. employees could be hit. If Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit speech in mid-January was aimed at soothing the City of London and preventing banks from sending jobs elsewhere, early indications are that it flopped, a Financial Times report said. There have been long-running worries that Britain’s June vote to leave the European Union could hurt London’s status as a financial hub, due in large part to companies losing their key “passporting” rights that allow them to conduct business across the EU. But some in the U.K.’s financial sector have pushed back at the recent Brexodus buzz. Below are a few reactions: • “I don’t believe that the financial center of Europe will leave the City of London. There are all sorts of reasons why I think the U.K. will continue to be the financial lungs for Europe.” — Jes Staley, chief executive at Barclays, in an interview with the BBC • “Inevitably Brexit will mean some jobs move from London to the continent, but jobs in Europe are also likely to come onshore. We believe the banks will realign staffing across Britain and the EU, but that there will be no clear flow of jobs in either direction.” — Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, in a note Check out: How Brexit is holding back London’s IPO market And see: Theresa May urges businesses to “play by the same rules” • “I just think it’s crying wolf. We won’t see anything like this amount of saber-rattling at other banks.” — Ian Gordon, head of banks research at Investec, in an interview with City A.M. • “I was irritated that HSBC, which does 20% of its business with Europe, announced at Davos that staff will be shifted to the hinterland of Europe. I understand contingency plans, but this announcement seems too precipitous to me. There’s two years to go, and probably six months before we know what the financial-services agenda will look like. ... The real action, they will find, will remain in London!” — David Buik, market commentator at Panmure Gordon, in a note See: Marmitegate — uproar over beloved spread may be Brexit turning point And read: Brexwhat?

But Steven Mnuchin, President-elect Trump's pick for treasury secretary, signaled on Thursday that the Volcker Rule isn't on the chopping block, at least not completely. "I do support the Volcker Rule," Mnuchin said during his confirmation hearing in the U.S. Senate. The post-crisis rule bans big banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) from making risky bets with their own money -- actions that some say exacerbated the financial crisis. Mnuchin said he didn't believe risky trading belongs in banks that require FDIC insurance. However, Mnuchin sounded concerned about unintended consequences of the rule, which is named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, flagged a recent Fed paper that found the 2015 implementation of the Volcker Rule had a harmful effect on the ability to easily buy and sell bonds during times of stress. Without that liquidity, markets can get jammed up. "That is something I absolutely would look at," Mnuchin said. Trump's pick for treasury blamed an overly-complex interpretation of the Volcker Rule that has left Wall Street confused and handcuffed about their abilities to provide liquidity. Making bets or trading with their own money is known in Wall Street as proprietary trading. "We need to be able to explain to banks what's proprietary trading -- and what's not proprietary trading," Mnuchin said. Related: Wall Street hates the Volcker Rule. Will Trump kill it? Powerful Republican leaders had been pushing to kill the Volcker Rule. The Financial Choice Act, a bill championed by House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, calls for repealing the rule entirely. Mnuchin's testimony to Congress suggests the Trump administration will relax -- but not completely eliminate -- some regulation. For instance, Mnuchin said he thinks the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the watchdog championed by Elizabeth Warren, is worth keeping. By comparison, Hensarling's bill would get rid of the CFPB, much to the disappointment of supporters who credit the regulator with cracking down on shady payday lenders and big banks like Wells Fargo. (WFC) However, Mnuchin said he believes the CFPB should be funded by Congress, not the Federal Reserve as it currently is. CFPB supporters would push back against such a shift. Their argument is that it would hurt the agency's independence and could allow Republicans to starve it of funding. Related: Mnuchin: Raise the debt ceiling sooner rather than later Yet Mnuchin didn't give big banks much love, especially not compared with Main Street banks. "My biggest concern is this regulation is killing community banks," Mnuchin said, adding that tiny lenders provide much-needed loans to small businesses. Mnuchin also said he wants to make sure "we don't end up in a world where we only have four big banks." Trump's treasury pick was asked about bringing back the Glass-Steagall Act. Last summer the official Republican platform called for a return of this Great Depression-era law that restricted banks from serving both Wall Street and Main Street. The law was repealed in 1999 under President Clinton. "I don't support going back to Glass-Steagall as is," Mnuchin said. He explained that Glass-Steagall is a "very old law" and implementing it now "would have very big implications to liquidity and capital markets." Still, Mnuchin said there's a need for a "21st Century Glass-Steagall." He didn't elaborate exactly what that would look like.

Fearless Muckraking Since 1993 Home Articles Recent Articles Magazine Current Issue Back Issues Subscribe Subscriber Access Subscribe Donate Archives Search Authors About JOIN LIST Books T-shirts podcasts FAQs January 20, 2017 Divide and Rule: Class, Hate, and the 2016 Election by Paul Street by Tweet Email Listen and you can hear the sneering “elite” liberal left narrative about how the big dumb white working class is about to get screwed over by the incoming multi-millionaire- and billionaire-laden Trump administration it voted into office.  Once those poor saps in the white working class wake up to their moronic mistake, the narrative suggests, they’ll come running back to their supposed friends the Democrats. Trump Didn’t Really Win Over Working Class America: Clinton Lost it It’s true, of course, that Trump is going to betray white working class people who voted for him in the hope that he would be a populist champion of their interests – a hope he mendaciously cultivated. But there are three basic and related problems with the scornful liberal-left storyline. The first difficulty is that the notion of a big white proletarian “rustbelt rebellion” for Trump has been badly oversold. “The real story of the 2016 election,” the left political scientist Anthony DiMaggio notes, “is not that Trump won over working class America, so much as Clinton and the Democrats lost it…The decline of Democratic voters among the working class in 2016 (compared to 2012) was far larger than the increase in Republican voters during those two elections”  If the Democrats had run Bernie Sanders or someone else with “a meaningful history of seeking to help the working class,” DiMaggio observes, they might well have won. Populism-Manipulation is a Bipartisan Affair Second, betraying working class voters (of all colors, by the way) in service to concentrated wealth and power (the “One Percent” in post-Occupy Wall Street parlance) is what presidents and other top elected officials from both of the reigning capitalist U.S. political parties do.  What did the white and the broader (multiracial) working class experience when the neoliberal corporate Democrats Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama held the White House? Abject disloyalty towards egalitarian-sounding campaign rhetoric and a resumption of (big) business (rule) as usual. An ever-increasing upward distribution of income, wealth, and power into fewer hands. It’s an old story. In his 1999 book on Bill and Hillary Clinton, No One Left to Lie To, the still left Christopher Hitchens usefully described “the essence of American politics, when distilled,” as “the manipulation of populism by elitism. That elite is most successful,” Hitchens added, “which can claim the heartiest allegiance of the fickle crowd; can present itself as most ‘in touch’ with popular concerns; can anticipate the tides and pulses of public opinion; can, in short, be the least apparently ‘elitist.’ It is no great distance from Huey Long’s robust cry of ‘Every man a king’ to the insipid ‘inclusiveness’ of [Bill Clinton’s slogan] ‘Putting People First,’ but the smarter elite managers have learned in the interlude that solid, measurable pledges have to be distinguished by a reserve’ tag that earmarks them for the bankrollers and backers.” True, the Republicans don’t manipulate populism in the same way as the Democrats. The dismal, dollar-drenched Dems  don the outwardly liberal and diverse, many-colored cloak of slick, Hollywood- , Silicon Valley-, Ivy League-and Upper West Side-approved bicoastal multiculturalism.  The radically regressive and reactionary Republicans connect their  manipulation more to white “heartland” nationalism, sexism, hyper-masculinism, nativism, evangelism, family values, and (to be honest) racism. But in both versions, that of the Democrats and that of the Republicans, Goldman Sachs (and Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America et al.) always prevails. The “bankrollers and bankers” atop the Deep State continue to reign. The nation’s unelected deep state dictatorship of money (UDSDoM, UDoM for short) continues to call the shots. That was certainly true under the arch-neoliberal Barack Obama, whose relentless service to the nation’s economic ruling class has been amply documented by numerous journalists, authors (the present writer included) and academics. Obama ascended to the White House with record-setting Wall Street contributions.  He governed accordingly, from the staffing of his administration (chock full of revolving door operatives from elite financial institutions) to the policies he advanced – and the ones he didn’t, like (to name a handful) a financial transaction tax, the re-legalization of union organizing, single-payer health insurance, a health insurance public option, tough conditions on bankers receiving bailout money, and the prosecution of a single Wall Street executive for the excesses that created the financial meltdown. Anyone who thinks that any of that might have changed to any significant degree under a Hillary Clinton presidency is living in a fantasy world.  She gave every indication that a president Clinton 45 would be every bit as friendly to the finance-led corporate establishment (the UDoM) as the arch-neoliberal Cliinton42 and Obama44 presidencies.  She was Wall Street’s golden/Goldman/Citigroup girl. We are Not the 99 Percent Third, elite liberals and left liberals often miss a key point on who white (and nonwhite) working class people most directly interact when it comes to the infliction of what the sociologist Richard Sennett called “the hidden injuries of class.” It is through regular contact with the professional and managerial class, not the mostly invisible corporate and financial elite, that the working class mostly commonly experiences class inequality and oppression in America. Working people might see hyper-opulent “rich bastards” like Trump, Bill Gates, and even Warren Buffett on television. In their real lives, they carry out “ridiculous orders” and receive “idiotic” reprimands from middle- and upper middle-class coordinators—from, to quote a white university maintenance worker I spoke with last summer, “know-it-all pencil-pushers who don’t give a flying fuck about regular working guys like me.” This worker voted for Trump “just to piss-off all the big shot (professional class) liberals” he perceived as constantly disrespecting and pushing him around. It is not lost on the white working class that much of this managerial and professional class “elite” tends to align with the Democratic Party and its purported liberal and multicultural, cosmopolitan, and environmentalist values. It doesn’t help that the professional and managerial “elites” are often with the politically correct multiculturalism and the environmentalism that many white workers (actually) have (unpleasant as this might be to acknowledge) some rational economic and other reasons to see as a threat to their living standards, status, and well-being. The  Green Party leader and Teamster union activist Howie Hawkins put it very well last summer. “The Democratic Party ideology is the ideology of the professional class,” Hawkins said.  “Meritocratic competition. Do well in school, get well-rewarded.” (Unfortunately, perhaps, his comment reminds me of the bumper sticker slogan I’ve seen on the back of more than a few beat-up cars in factory parking lots and trailer parks over the years: “My Kid Beat Up Your Honor Student.”) “The biggest threat to the Democrats isn’t losing votes to the Greens,” Hawkins noted. It is losing votes to Trump, who “sounds like he’s mad at the system. So they throw a protest vote to him.” The white maintenance worker is certainly going to get screwed by Trump’s corporate presidency. You can take that to the bank.  He would also have gotten shafted by Hillary’s corporate presidency if she had won. You can take that down to your favorite financial institution too.  And the worker’s anger at all the “big shots” with their Hillary and Obama bumper stickers on the back of their Volvos and Audis and Priuses is not based merely on some foolish and “uneducated” failure to perceive his common interests with the rest of the “99 percent” against the top hundredth. We are the 99 Percent, except, well, we’re not. Among other things, a two-class model of America deletes the massive disparities that exist between the working-class majority of Americans and the nation’s professional and managerial class. In the U.S. as across the world capitalist system, ordinary working people suffer not just from the elite private and profit-seeking capitalist ownership of workplace and society. They also confront the stark oppression inherent in what left economists Robin Hahnel and Mike Albert call the “corporate division of labor”—an alienating, de-humanizing, and hierarchical subdivision of tasks “in which a few workers have excellent conditions and empowering circumstances, many fall well below that, and most workers have essentially no power at all.” Over time, this pecking order hardens “into a broad and pervasive class division” whereby one class — roughly the top fifth of the workforce —“controls its own circumstances and the circumstances of others below,” while another (the working class) “obeys orders and gets what its members can eke out.” The “coordinator class,” Albert notes, “looks down on workers as instruments with which to get jobs done. It engages workers paternally, seeing them as needing guidance and oversight and as lacking the finer human qualities that justify both autonomous input and the higher incomes needed to support more expensive tastes.” That sparks no small working class resentment. It comes with ballot box implications. Many white workers will “vote against their pocketbook interests” by embracing a viciously noxious and super-oligarchic Republican over a supposedly liberal (neoliberal) Democrat backed by middle- and upper middle- class elites who contemptuously lord it over those workers daily. The negative attention that dreadful Republican (Trump) gets from “elite” upper-middle class talking heads in corporate media often just reinforces that ugly attachment. 2016: Hate Trumped Hate It doesn’t help the Democrats when their top candidates channel elitist contempt of the working in their campaign rhetoric.  Here’s how the silver-tongued Harvard Law graduate Obama referred to white working-class voters in old blue-collar towns decimated by industrial job losses in the early spring of 2008:  “They get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.”  Amusingly enough, these reflections were seized on by his neoliberal compatriot and rival for the Democratic nomination, the Yale Law graduate Hillary Clinton. She hoped to use Obama’s condescending remarks to resuscitate her flagging campaign against a candidate she now accused of class snotty-ness. “I was taken aback by the demeaning remarks Senator Obama made about people in small-town America,” she said. “His remarks are elitist and out of touch.” Clinton staffers in North Carolina even gave out stickers saying “I’m not bitter.” How darkly ironic is to compare that (failed) campaign gambit from nearly nine years ago with the campaign Hillary ran in 2016! Hillary’s latest and hopefully last campaign was quite consciously and recklessly about contempt for the white working class. As John Pilger recently reflected: “Today, false symbolism is all. ‘Identity’ is all. In 2016, Hillary Clinton stigmatised millions of [white working class and rural – P.S.] voters as ‘a basket of deplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic — you name it’. Her abuse was handed out at an LGBT rally as part of her cynical campaign to win over minorities by abusing a white mostly working-class majority. Divide and rule, this is called; or identity politics in which race and gender conceal class, and allow the waging of class war. Trump understood this.” The “deplorables” comment was a great gift to Trump, whose staffers gave people buttons saying “I’m an Adorable Deplorable.” Disappointed Hillary voters have chanted “Love Trumps Hate” while marching against the incoming quasi-fascist president. But, really, the 2016 U.S. presidential election was about one kind of hate – the “heartland” white nationalist Republican version – trumping another kind of hate, the more bi-coastal and outwardly multicultural and diverse Democratic version. Let us not forget former Obama campaign manager David Ploufe’s comment to the New York Times last March on how the Hillary campaign would conduct itself against a Trump candidacy: “hope and change, not so much; more like hate and castrate.” Meanwhile, the nation’s UDoM rules on, whichever party holds nominal power atop the visible state.  Pardon my French, but the working class (of all colors) is fucked either way. Goldman Sachs Wins Either Way We might also think of the essence of American politics as the manipulation of identity politics – and identity-based hatred – by elitism. Reduced to a corporate-managed electorate (Sheldon Wolin), the citizenry is identity-played by a moneyed elite that pulls the strings behind the duopoly’s candidate-centered spectacles of faux democracy. As the Left author Chris Hedges noted three years ago, “Both sides of the political spectrum are manipulated by the same forces. If you’re some right-wing Christian zealot in Georgia, then it’s homosexuals and abortion and all these, you know, wedge issues that are used to whip you up emotionally. If you are a liberal in Manhattan, it’s – you know, they’ll be teaching creationism in your schools or whatever…Yet in fact it’s just a game, because whether it’s Bush or whether it’s Obama, Goldman Sachs always wins. There is no way to vote against the interests of Goldman Sachs.” (We can update that formulation to say “whether it’s Trump or where it’s Hillary.”) For all their claims of concern for ordinary people and beneath all their claims of bitter, personal, and partisan contempt for their major party electoral opponents, the Republican and Democratic “elites” are united with the capitalist “elite” in top-down hatred for the nation’s multi-racial working-class majority. The resistance movement we need to develop cannot be merely about choosing one of the two different major party brands of Machiavellian, ruling class hate.  The reigning political organizations are what Upton Sinclair called (in the original Appeal to Reason newspaper version of The Jungle) “two wings of the same bird of prey.”  We must come out from under both of those two noxious wings and their obsessive and endless focus on the quadrennial candidate-centered electoral extravaganzas, which have replaced the recently closed Ringling Brothers show as the greatest circus in the world. We cannot fall prey anymore to the reigning message that meaningful democratic participation consists of going into a voting booth to mark a ballot once every four years and then going home to (in Noam Chomsky’s words)  “let other [and very rich ] people run the world [into the ground].” Join the debate on Facebook Paul Street’s latest book is They Rule: The 1% v.

(SJM) to Sell January 20th, 2017 - 0 comments - Filed Under - by Trevor Kearing Filed Under: Analyst Articles - US - Finance Tweet J.M. Smucker Co. (NYSE:SJM) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a note issued to investors on Wednesday. According to Zacks, “Estimates have been declining since Smucker posted second quarter fiscal 2017 results. While the bottom line surpassed estimates, sales marked its second consecutive miss. In fact, the stock has underperformed the Zacks categorized industry over the past six months. Sales have been declining due to currency headwinds, lower coffee volumes, lower pricing, sluggish pet food sales and the divestiture of the U.S. canned milk business. The recent increase in coffee prices will also negatively impact the coffee volumes. Though the company remains optimistic on the company’s acquisitions and innovation program and remains focused on improving the performance of the mainstream dog and cat brands, heightened competition in the pet food business in the near term remains a concern. Further, we remain concerned that the company's weak sales in the first half put its full-year forecast under threat.” A number of other equities analysts have also recently commented on the stock. Bank of America Corp. began coverage on shares of J.M. Smucker in a research note on Tuesday, December 6th. They issued a “neutral” rating and a $130.00 price target for the company. Jefferies Group cut their price target on shares of J.M. Smucker from $135.00 to $125.00 and set a “hold” rating for the company in a research note on Wednesday, November 30th. Credit Suisse Group AG set a $134.00 price target on shares of J.M. Smucker and gave the stock a “hold” rating in a research note on Friday, November 18th. Deutsche Bank AG reissued a “buy” rating and issued a $162.00 price target (up previously from $150.00) on shares of J.M. Smucker in a research note on Monday, November 14th.

May and Hammond try to charm the bankers, but Soros has a dire warning. by Simon Kennedy @simonjkennedy More stories by Simon Kennedy January 20, 2017, 2:16 AM EST Davos 2017: Day Three at the World Economic Forum Sign up to receive the Brexit Bulletin in your inbox, and follow @Brexit on Twitter. Theresa May had some rare warm words for bankers in the cold of Davos. Speaking to Bloomberg, the U.K. prime minister offered her strongest support yet for London’s financial sector, insisting banks are of “huge value” to the economy even as executives accelerate plans to move staff to the European Union with Brexit looming. Theresa May, U.K. prime minister, interviewed by Bloomberg Television at Davos. Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg “I value financial services in the City of London, and I want to ensure that we can keep financial services in the City of London,” May said at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting on Thursday. “I believe that we will do just that.”  She made her case in person to bank chiefs in Davos, and her words suggest a shift in emphasis towards an industry that pays more than £60 billion in taxes each year and employs more than 1 million people. May’s government has until now focused on criticizing corporate elites and signaled banks will not be a priority in the Brexit talks.  Banks may not stay around long enough to see if she can match her words with action. During their time in the Swiss ski resort, bosses from JPMorgan, HSBC, Lloyds and UBS all gave new details of their plans to relocate jobs from London. May’s Brexit plan risks depriving them of easy access to the region’s single market. May’s message was underscored by Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, who told a lunch for British business leaders that “any diminution of London’s financial system would be bad” for the U.K. and EU.  For a catch up on what sometimes seemed like Brexit Day at Davos, watch our two-minute highlights. Here's the best of @BloombergTV's coverage of day 3 at Davos https://t.co/4L3FLvMGq0 #wef17 pic.twitter.com/yh4avoUmEl— Bloomberg (@business) January 19, 2017 Banks Skeptical, EU Leaders Critical Bankers nevertheless maintained pressure on May in interviews in Davos.  Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said New York is “already a bit of a gainer” from Brexit as the firm slows its policy of moving operations to London. While Barclays CEO Jes Staley said it’s going to be “very difficult” to recreate a financial center like London, he said banks need clarity over how long they will have to adapt to any new regime.  They also received a warning at the conference from German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who said in an interview that any negotiations for banks to gain access to the EU from the U.K. will be “very difficult” and would take “a lot of time.” Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny said he’s optimistic his nation will draw investment from companies looking for a base within the EU. Billionaire investor George Soros, the man who “broke the Bank of England” by betting against sterling in the 1990s, went as far as to say May “will not last” long in office because her Cabinet is divided and voters underestimate the pending hit to the economy.  What Europe Thinks May this week noted, perhaps ruefully, that Europe’s leaders are “keeping their discipline” when communicating on Brexit. They held the line in Davos too. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the U.K. will pay a “huge price” for leaving the EU, in the form of weaker economic growth. His finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said the U.K. underestimated the complexity of trade deals. Bloomberg’s Nikos Chrysoloras and Jonathan Stearns reckon the EU’s public positions boil down to the following basic points: The bloc will negotiate with one voice and not until the U.K. files for divorce The EU insists that the U.K.’s terms outside won’t be preferable to its terms inside. That means no “cherry-picking” elements of the customs union and single market An aggressive lowering of corporate-tax rates will be seen as a provocation. Failure to reach a mutually acceptable compromise, perhaps including an exit fee, will damage any prospects of a free-trade agreement Talks are bound to be arduous for both sides. So even though some – not all – EU officials felt compelled to be diplomatic after May’s gesture on clarity, fundamentally nothing has changed. Clearing Stays? Top bankers in Davos reckon London will prove victorious in one battle: keeping its derivatives clearing business even after Brexit. Despite French and German threats, Britain will probably continue to house trillions of euros of swaps trades because of the potential for any changes to backfire, executives from several global firms told Bloomberg, speaking on condition of anonymity. Imposing controls on how and where the common currency is used could damage its reserve status, they said. On the Markets Brexit and the resulting fall in sterling aren’t enough to hamper the U.K.’s high-yield bond market. Sterling-denominated sales by companies rated below investment grade are off to a flyer in 2017, already making this month the busiest January for issuance on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg’s Marianna De Aragao. Non-financial issuance so far this year totals £1.35 billion ($1.66 billion).  For his part, Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska said En+ Group Ltd., the commodities business he controls, plans to go public in London because the U.K. capital remains attractive after Brexit. “We plan to list in London and will try to do it soon,” Deripaska said in Davos. “Brexit only will reinforce the British platform. It will be more competitive.” And Finally… Brexit Secretary David Davis was a winner in more ways than one from last year’s referendum. Not only was he on the victorious side and rewarded with a seat in the Cabinet, but now we discover he won £1,000 betting on the result at a time when polls were saying voters would choose to stay.  “I put some money on,” he told LBC radio on Thursday. “It’s still paying my office drinks.” Brexit Secretary David Davis reveals he made BIG money betting on the EU Referendum result https://t.co/bLVUICgdTW— LBC (@LBC) January 18, 2017 For more on Brexit follow Bloomberg on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and see our full coverage at Bloomberg.com Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

That’s because the government is cutting allocations for those who bought less last year. What the processors have been allowed to directly import in the latest tranche is 62 percent of 2016’s total levels, the bank said in a report. The refiners, known as teapots, have been wooed by everyone from producers such as Saudi Arabia to oil traders including Trafigura Group as a global supply glut stoked competition among sellers. While benchmark crude prices are gaining from their worst crash in a generation amid supply curbs by OPEC and other nations, demand from China -- the world’s biggest energy consumer -- will be key to a sustainable recovery. “All these uncertainties around the teapot quota will weaken the nation’s oil demand in the first half of the year,” Guo Chaohui, an analyst at Beijing-based China International Capital Corp., said by phone. “China’s oil imports hinge on one single big factor, and that is the teapots. And right now, they are facing policy risks.” The private refiners made their mark on the global oil market last year with purchases from Saudi Arabia to Africa and Latin America, after they first received import approvals in 2015 as part of a government effort to revamp China’s energy industry. Purchases of overseas crude were until then dominated by state-owned giants such as Sinopec and PetroChina Co. Their growing clout has brought with it several hurdles. Infrastructure at ports where they receive their oil has struggled to accommodate the surge in shipments. A lack of pipeline and storage facilities have proved to be a headwind, along with concern about teapots’ creditworthiness and lack of experience in international trade. The implementation of higher fuel-quality standards has led to speculation that some may be forced to shut. Perhaps most critically, authorities are clamping down on anyone who skirts tax rules. For a story about China’s scrutiny on taxes from refiners, click here Their most recent struggle was earlier this month, when a lack of import quotas at the time meant a clutch of tankers filled with crude for the refiners were stranded off the eastern Chinese province of Shandong, where the teapots are clustered. The government has now approved the teapots to buy a total of 68.81 million metric tons of crude from overseas under a first batch of allocations for 2017, according to officials from companies that received the notification. Of that, 45.64 million tons can be bought directly by the private refiners, according to the JPMorgan report. The rest will be processed via state-owned traders and other agents. The independent processors were allowed to directly buy 73.77 million tons in 2016, the bank said. Baota Petrochemical Group, one of the refiners, was given 7 percent of its 2016 volume this year, according to the JPMorgan note. Baota was awarded 6.16 million tons for 2016. Nobody answered calls to Baota’s headquarters in Yinchuan city. Pro-Rated Quotas The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter The latest batch of quotas for the refiners is calculated based on the companies’ January-October 2016 import volumes and pro-rated for a 6-month period this year, teapot officials said last week. The processors imported 30 million tons of crude in the first ten months last year, or about 720,000 barrels a day, according to Shanghai-based commodities researcher ICIS China. That compares with a combined allowance of 67.05 million tons a year for 17 companies as of October. China’s Ministry of Commerce, which issues the import quotas, didn’t respond to a fax inquiry seeking comment. Total inbound crude shipments to China rose to a record average of 7.63 million barrels a day in 2016, boosted by the teapots, government data show. The purchases were one of the factors that helped crude prices recover after they fell to below $30 a barrel amid the global oversupply. Brent crude, the benchmark for more than half the world’s oil, was up 0.4 percent at $54.40 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange by 12:51 p.m. Singapore time. “The total full year of 2017 crude oil import quota for teapots should be similar to 2016 levels and unlikely to see further significant expansions,” JPMorgan analyst Wang Ying said in the note. With import volumes and operating rates at the refiners expected to stay flat this year, the country’s crude oil import growth will slow, he wrote. — With assistance by Sarah Chen, Serene Cheong, and Alfred Cang Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Stephanie KeithMore By Dan Freed (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N>, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, said on Thursday it would merge its international business with its wholesale banking unit that serves corporate clients. The bank also named Richard Yorke, who previously headed the international group, as chief operating officer for the wholesale banking business. Spokesman Alan Elias said the international business previously stood on its own since it was so small that it needed more individual attention. The bank began to build its international operations in earnest after its acquisition of Wachovia at the start of 2009. Wells Fargo derives just 4 percent of its revenues from outside the United States. That is a much smaller portion than rivals like JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N>, Bank of America Corp <BAC.N> and Citigroup Inc <C.N>. Still, the international presence grew considerably following acquisitions from General Electric Co <GE.N> last year. Wells Fargo now has operations in 42 countries and territories with close to 3,000 employees in Asia Pacific, Europe and the United Kingdom. Before he takes on his new role, Yorke will assume an interim post as a senior member of a team of executives helping Wells Fargo plan for its possible bankruptcy. Joining that team on a permanent basis will be Scott Zaret, an executive from the bank's risk division. Wells Fargo failed its resolution planning process in December and will have to submit a new plan to regulators in March. [L1N1E81RC] Elias said the decision to move the international business inside the wholesale unit was not a response to December's failure.

British prime minister Theresa May addresses the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, yesterday “I value financial services in the City of London, and I want to ensure we can keep financial services in the City of London,” the British prime minister said in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland.  “I believe we will do just that.” The comments are the warmest Ms May has made about the financial sector in her six months in the top job. In the past, she has focused on warning the global elite that its excesses can not continue. But, following her speech on Tuesday setting out her Brexit strategy, which includes a full departure from the EU’s single market, bankers have begun setting out their own exit plans — from London. JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said “it looks like there will be more job movement than we hoped for”, while HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver said staff generating about 20% of London revenue may move to Paris. Lloyds, Britain’s largest mortgage lender, is set to choose Frankfurt as its base for guaranteeing ties to the EU, according to a source. Ms May’s message in Davos has been conciliatory, saying she wants to work with business. “Financial services are of huge value to the British economy,” she said. “And of course the services that fit around the banks, asset management companies and insurance companies, are important to us as too.” The industry pays up to £67bn (€77.3bn) in taxes each year, meaning the UK treasury will suffer a hit if London bankers leave. Meanwhile, British finance minister Philip Hammond warned the EU yesterday Britain would find other ways to remain competitive after Brexit if it did not strike a comprehensive trading deal with the bloc. At Davos, he stuck closely to the government’s message it wants to explore ways with the EU to ensure decades of close ties are not broken — saying that, with goodwill, anything was possible.  However, Mr Hammond said while the UK government did not want to leave the economic mainstream and trigger a race to the bottom on tax, the decision was “not entirely in our gift”. “We have to remain competitive,” he said. “The best way is to have a comprehensive trading relationship with the EU, our closest neighbours. But if we can’t achieve that then we will have to find other ways to maintain our competitiveness, because our first obligation of government is to make sure that our people are able to maintain their standard of living.” Mr Hammond later said this was not a threat, but German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Britain should not try to gain competitive advantage by cutting corporate tax rates after the G20 leading economies agreed not to do so in 2015.

Jim Cramer rang the lightning round bell, which means he gave his take on caller favorite stocks at rapid speed: CVS Health Corp: "CVS is a very good company, but you know what, it's bricks-and-mortar retail. My charitable trust owns Walgreens. We own it because of the combination of Rite Aid and Walgreens would be good. But otherwise we would not own it because brick-and-mortar retail is bearish." Cheniere Energy: "The trade in Cheniere is over because the great Charif Souki, who got us in very low and then got us out very high is gone. I'm not a backer without Charif Souki." PNC Financial Services Group: "PNC had a good quarter. I read through the conference call and I really liked it. But remember, Bank of America was I think better. JPMorgan was better. Citigroup, which my charitable trust owns, was better and Wells Fargo bizarrely, was a star." Sanchez Energy Corp: "Sanchez is very speculative. I like a little less speculative. Schlumberger reports tomorrow. Maybe on a dip you can buy that one. I also like Apache in the Permian, APA, the charitable trust has been buying that one. Got to be price sensitive, the next level is $61." Cott Corporation: "Everyone always says it's getting a takeover, it's beverages, it's going to work. Me, no thank you. That Coca-Cola downgrade was very, very, very threatening and shaky. So, I'm going away from the beverages, except for the charitable trust believes in PepsiCo and Indra Nooyi. Boy, if that stock came down $99 you know how much I would push for you to buy that." Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world? Hit him up!

But above all, they’re rich. And they’re starting to see plenty of opportunities to stay that way under Donald Trump. At coffee bars and cocktail parties in the Swiss town, which hosts the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting this week, conversation has often turned to how money can be made from the rise of a populist firebrand. Amid all the panel-talk of reducing inequality and re-invigorating the middle class, the Davos set is hard at work looking for ways to safeguard and expand its wealth even as anti-establishment movements roil global politics. That means enjoying the benefits of a Trump-driven boom in the U.S., where the business world is celebrating his pledges to slash taxes and loosen regulations. Stock markets have surged to near record highs, and banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. have reported strong earnings. “If you look at what’s happened to U.S. bank stocks in the last six weeks, they’re up 30 percent,” said Huw Jenkins, the vice-chairman of Sao Paulo-based lender Grupo BTG Pactual. “The U.S. looks like it’s a great place to invest right now. Willing Capital Optimism about money-making opportunities under the Trump administration goes well beyond the markets. The real estate mogul is stocking his cabinet with finance-friendly figures like billionaire investor Wilbur Ross and former Exxon Mobil Corp. chief Rex Tillerson. And Trump’s promise to reinvigorate infrastructure spending, with the co-operation of a Republican-dominated Congress that will be eager to involve private firms, opens potentially huge business opportunities. China Investment Corp., the country’s $814 billion sovereign wealth fund, is “actively” seeking opportunities in U.S. infrastructure and manufacturing, its vice-president said in Davos on Wednesday. Spanish utility Iberdrola SA would be “delighted” to invest in new energy infrastructure in the U.S. if Trump makes it a priority, CEO Ignacio Galan told Bloomberg Television on Thursday. “The capacity for infrastructure funded by government is basically limited by the size of the deficit,” said Bank of Montreal CEO Bill Downe, whose company is a major underwriter of port and road projects. “There’s a lot of private capital willing to do that.” The sudden embrace of Trump in Davos is jarring in its contrast with what many of its attendees said about him before. The overwhelming majority supported either his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, or more mainstream Republican candidates, many on the grounds that they viewed the real estate mogul as dangerously volatile. ‘Responsive Leadership’ Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said he’s "very troubled" by the turnaround, and the possibility it will "enable whatever the instinct of this new administration is." Business leaders who "two, three months ago were saying he was a man they’d never do business with are now hailing him as a great economic statesman," he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. Summers: Business May Regret ’Enabling’ Trump Source: Bloomberg The capitalists at Davos are trying hard to sound sober this year. The official theme is “Responsive and Responsible Leadership,” and attendees keep pledging to heed the lessons of Trump’s victory as well as the U.K.’s surprise Brexit vote. Still, there’s little sense that the Magic Mountain has been humbled. On Wednesday an A-list crowd packed the famed Belvedere Hotel late into the night. Ousted U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron appeared at a dinner hosted by Pricewaterhouse Coopers, and the dance floor was jammed at an annual party thrown by McKinsey & Co., with guests sporting hot pink glasses handed out for the occasion. JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon held court at the bar. Finance Barons Few seem more confident in their ability to profit from Trump’s rise than the barons of finance. Fixed-income trading, the traditional engine of Wall Street booms, is up sharply. JPMorgan’s shares have gained 19 percent since the election; Goldman’s fourth-quarter earnings tripled from a year earlier. Some traders have more esoteric ideas about how to squeeze the last dollar out of the Trump rally. One possibility: riding the swings caused by his pronouncements on pending mergers like AT&T Inc.’s $85 billion purchase of Time Warner Inc. “He’s pontificated a lot on what deals he thinks should go through and should not go through,” Canyon Capital Advisers co-CEO Mitch Julis told Bloomberg Television. “So arb spreads are one area where you can actually lay bets,” he said, referring to trades that exploit the gap between offer prices and the current value of shares. “And we have.” For more on Davos, see our special report on the World Economic Forum 2017. However rosy the immediate future looks for the Davos crowd, an undercurrent of unease about Trump is never hard to detect here -- even among those who say they’re optimistic.

He railed against “elites” during his campaign. He’s suggested that hedge-fund managers are “getting away with murder” thanks to the so-called carried interest tax break for their earnings. And he’s threatened to tear up longstanding trade and security arrangements that are almost sacrosanct in Davos -- raising the worst-case scenario of a confrontation with China that would rupture the world’s most important economic relationship. “There’s this wall of geopolitical risk in the world,” said Michael Sabia, the CEO of Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, a $191 billion pension fund. “These tails of risk, whether they’re protectionism risk or pure geopolitical risks, these are fat tails.
