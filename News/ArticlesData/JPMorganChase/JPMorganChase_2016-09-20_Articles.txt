One of Berkshire Hathaway’s investment managers just got cozy with one of Wells Fargo’s biggest competitors. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Sep 21, 2016 at 6:08PM Image source: The Motley Fool. There's reason to believe that Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) biggest shareholder, Warren Buffett, isn't pleased with the bank after learning that thousands of its employees opened as many as 2 million fraudulent accounts for consumers without the approval to do so between 2011 and 2015. No, the 86-year-old chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) hasn't said anything publicly to this effect. There's also no evidence to suggest that he's selling Berkshire's stake in the nation's third biggest bank by assets -- though, of course, he certainly could be. But what we do know is that one of Buffett's lieutenants, Todd Combs, agreed on Tuesday, the same day Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf was grilled by members of the Senate, to join the board of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Slap in the face? This probably goes without saying, but JPMorgan Chase is one of Wells Fargo's biggest competitors. On top of that, as Rafferty Capital Markets' Dick Bove pointed out to me, Combs' addition to the board of JPMorgan Chase eliminates any possibility that Berkshire will seek formal representation on Wells Fargo's board. By law, banks are prohibited from having interlocking directorships. This dates back a century ago to the days of the so-called money trust, when John Pierpont Morgan, the Rockefeller family, and a collection of their associates controlled many of the major banks in the country. It's worth pointing out, too, that while Buffett has claimed in the past to personally own JPMorgan Chase stock, he has never added it to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Or is it something else? There are, of course, alternative rationales for the Berkshire's decision to allow Combs to join JPMorgan's board. It's long been known, for instance, that Buffett respects the bank's Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. They teamed up earlier this year to discuss, of all things, corporate governance. And Buffett has said in the past that he reads Dimon's annual shareholder letter as soon as it's published. It's also possible that Buffett wanted a lieutenant to sit on the board of a major, well-respected bank that Berkshire doesn't have a stake in. Perhaps this reduces liability. Maybe it's about optics. Or maybe it's a signal that Berkshire recently took a position in JPMorgan Chase, but just not reported it yet. Though, to be clear, this doesn't seem likely given Buffett's preference for quietly accumulating positions. Either way, to Bove's point, it's hard to imagine that the timing of the announcement, coinciding with Wells Fargo's public lambasting on Capital Hill, was a coincidence. That seems far-fetched.

RAN research shows that these sponsors, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of the West (BNP Paribas) are helping drive the climate crisis by pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into extreme fossil fuels. Extreme fossil fuels are the most carbon intensive, financially risky, and environmentally destructive subsectors of the fossil fuel industry and include coal power, coal mining, liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals, and extreme oil (tar sands, Arctic oil, and ultra-deepwater drilling). Rainforest Action Network's 2016 report, Shorting the Climate, reveals that between 2013 and 2015, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and BNP Paribas (parent company of Bank of the West) banks put $9.89 billion into coal mining companies, $30.7 billion into the largest coal power producers, $74.91 billion into companies building LNG export terminals in North America, and $77.3 billion into companies exposed to extreme oil. Amanda Starbuck, RAN Climate and Energy Program Director, said:  "To meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and BNP Paribas must stop funding extreme fossil fuels, which are simply incompatible with a climate-stable world. Given their current investments in climate-wrecking activities, their sponsorship of ‘Climate Week NYC' amounts to little more than greenwashing. If these banks aspire to be climate leaders,  they must accelerate their exit from coal, and commit to getting out of extreme oil and fracked-gas terminals as well." The Shorting the Climate report, released this past June, also showed that leading financial institutions' business-as-usual investment in fossil fuels stands in direct contradiction to the global consensus to limit global warming.  Between 2013 and 2015, 25 major global banks  sank $42 billion in companies active in coal mining; $154 billion for the 20 largest coal-fired power producers; $306 billion for companies that drill extreme oil; and $282 billion for companies building LNG export infrastructure.   Among the 25 major global banks analyzed in Shorting the Climate, JPMorgan Chase was the #1 investor in two extreme fossil fuel subsectors: LNG export terminals and extreme oil. The report does reflect bank movement on coal mining, where nine of the biggest U.S. and European banks committed to reduce funding for the coal mining sector since 2015.  Based on their ability to quickly switch their stance on coal over the last year alone, banks are capable of making the critical choice to cut out extreme fossil fuel investments. Not only can they do it, but it is a critical step to follow through on promises made in Paris to stabilize the climate.

Eric Volkman (TMFVolkman) Sep 20, 2016 at 2:22PM What happened? Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) has confirmed a hot media report that the Department of Justice is offering to settle a raft of civil claims over the company's conduct in the run-up to last decade's financial crisis. The previous day, The Wall Street Journal reported that the DoJ had offered $14 billion, an amount the company said was accurate. In a statement addressing the matter, Deutsche Bank said emphatically that it has "no intent to settle these potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited." Image source: Deutsche Bank via Flickr.  It added that it and the DoJ were engaged in negotiations, which it characterized as "only just beginning." The settlement would cover the company's alleged malfeasance in the issuance and underwriting of residential mortgage-backed securities -- plus associated securitization activities -- from 2005 to 2007. Such machinations by global banks provided much of the fuel that inflamed the crisis. Does it matter? Ultimately, the two sides are certain to hit a dollar amount that they can both live with, and get on with their lives. Billion-dollar bullet biting occurred with each of the "big four" American banks -- Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo -- when the regulatory hammer came down on their pre-crisis era shenanigans with mortgage-related securities. Some of these amounts were substantial, most notably JPMorgan Chase's $13 billion, and Bank of America's nearly $16.7 billion. We can expect the same with Deutsche Bank; the problem is, the company is smaller in terms of assets, and much smaller in terms of market capitalization, as its American peers. For comparison, the latter figure for the German company is $18 billion, which is dwarfed by JPMorgan Chase's $237 billion and Bank of America's $158 billion.  So it has a much smaller capital cushion to absorb a big DoJ settlement. Even if it were to talk that amount down to, say, $5 billion, that number would represent more than one-quarter of its current market value. Shareholders should find it admirable that the company is strongly determined to talk down the huge figure offered. But regardless, that bullet is going to be a very tough one to bite for the bank.  Eric Volkman has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Wells Fargo.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Todd Combs, one of Warren Buffett's stockpicking deputies at Berkshire Hathaway Inc , has joined the board of JPMorgan Chase & Co , expanding the conglomerate's already deep ties to the financial services industry. In a statement on Tuesday, JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said Combs' appointment took effect on Monday. His committee assignment will be determined later. Combs, 45, has taken a growing role at Berkshire since joining the Omaha, Nebraska-based company in 2010. Buffett has credited him with triggering Berkshire's largest acquisition, the US$32.1 billion takeover in January of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp. "For such a young man, it's a high honor," Andy Kilpatrick, author of "Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett," said about Combs' appointment. "It provides Combs board experience at a financial company and a platform to broaden his growth, which is important because he is a leader at Berkshire." The appointment gives Berkshire direct ties to the three biggest U.S. banks. It owns US$5 billion of preferred stock in Bank of America Corp , and has a more than US$22 billion, or roughly 10 percent, stake in Wells Fargo & Co . Berkshire also invests in American Express Co , Goldman Sachs Group Inc and US Bancorp . It reported no JPMorgan stake as of June 30. Before joining Berkshire, Combs was a hedge fund manager at Castle Point Capital Management LLC in Connecticut. He and Ted Weschler, Buffett's other stockpicking deputy, each manage roughly US$9 billion. They are expected to take over Berkshire's investments after Buffett, 86, leaves. "Hiring these two was one of my best moves," Buffett said in his annual shareholder letter in February. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, said in a statement about Combs: "Our company and our board will benefit from his wisdom and judgment." Other Berkshire executives have also taken outside board roles. Greg Abel, an energy executive whom investors consider a possible future Berkshire chief executive officer, and Tracy Britt Cool, who has chaired a few Berkshire units, are directors at Kraft Heinz Co , in which Berkshire has a 26.8 percent stake. Buffett once sat on the Coca-Cola Co and Washington Post Co boards, but left those roles to focus on Berkshire. "Buffett and Jamie Dimon have expressed admiration for each other as business leaders," Kilpatrick said. "Buffett is trying to leave an enormous legacy, and this involves putting someone he trusts on Jamie's board."

Here's A Way To Think About It (Seeking Alpha) A New York judge ruled bitcoin qualifies as money as part of a judgment related to a case over hacking attacks against JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) and other companies, according to a report on Fortune. The report said U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan rejected Anthony Murgio's bid to dismiss two charges regarding his alleged operation of Coin.mx. Prosecutors have called Coin.mx an "unlicensed bitcoin exchange." Related Link: What Is Blockchain, And Why Should You Care? But, Nathan ruled bitcoin satisfies the definition of a virtual currency. "Bitcoins are funds within the plain meaning of that term. Bitcoins can be accepted as a payment for goods and services or bought directly from an exchange with a bank account. They therefore function as pecuniary resources and are used as a medium of exchange and a means of payment," Fortune reported, quoting Nathan. Brian Klein, a lawyer for Murgio, said he disagreed with the decision. Last year, prosecutors charged Murgio over the operation of Coin.mx and in April charged his father, Michael, with participating in bribery to support the exchange.

(Photo: Mike Mozart/flickr/cc) Big bank sponsorship of Climate Week 2016, which kicked off Monday in New York City, "amounts to little more than greenwashing," according one environmental organization, given financial institutions' business-as-usual investment in fossil fuels. Indeed, Rainforest Action Network (RAN) charges three major sponsors—Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, and Bank of the West (BNP Paribas)—with "helping [to] drive the climate crisis" through their ongoing funding of extreme fossil fuels such as coal and tar sands oil.  Citing its own 2016 report, Shorting the Climate, which was released in June, RAN notes that between 2013 and 2015, those three entities put $9.89 billion into coal mining companies, $30.7 billion into the largest coal power producers, $74.91 billion into companies building LNG export terminals in North America, and $77.3 billion into companies exposed to extreme oil. Furthermore, among the 25 major global banks analyzed in Shorting the Climate, JPMorgan Chase was the number one investor in two extreme fossil fuel subsectors: liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminals and extreme oil. Bank of America is a "Platinum Sponsor" of Climate Week, while JP Morgan Chase and Bank of the West are listed as "Affiliate" and "Supporting" sponsors, respectively. "Given their current investments in climate-wrecking activities, their sponsorship of 'Climate Week NYC' amounts to little more than greenwashing," said RAN climate and energy program director Amanda Starbuck on Monday. "If these banks aspire to be climate leaders, they must accelerate their exit from coal, and commit to getting out of extreme oil and fracked-gas terminals as well." Climate group 350.org separately took Bank of America to task on Monday for "playing a key role in financing dangerous fossil fuel infrastructure like the Dakota Access Pipeline"—even as it announces "new environmental operations goals" such as moving to 100 percent renewable electricity by 2020. Earlier this month, Food & Water Watch revealed that Bank of America was among the financial institutions that has "committed substantial resources to the Energy Transfer Family of companies" behind the controversial pipeline project. "While executives tout these steps toward the renewable energy-powered world we need, we know that it's not nearly enough," declared 350.org's U.S. campaigns director Jenny Marienau. "If they don't prioritize defunding the climate crisis," she said, "they are continuing a pattern of prioritizing profit over people, planet, and ethical business practices. As the second largest bank in the U.S., with nearly $2.2 trillion in assets, the Bank of America has the ability, not to mention a greater responsibility, to actually move money away from the fossil fuel economy to prioritize people and planet."

 Here's why it seems like the CEO of Wells Fargo can't remember anything Linette Lopez Sep. 20, 2016, 11:41 AM 19,835 facebook linkedin twitter email print John Stumpf looks like he was caught off guard here... REUTERS/Chris Keane John Stumpf — the CEO of what was once Wall Street's most squeaky-clean bank, Wells Fargo — was in front of Congress on Tuesday answering for the fraudulent actions of thousands of employees. It's yet another exhausting example of how people working at a bank got up in the morning, cheated and lied to their customers, went home to their families, ate dinner, were fairly normal, went to bed, and then got up in the morning to lie and cheat at work again. Here's what happened at Wells Fargo: Under intense pressure to meet performance targets from above, thousands of employees opened fake accounts for clients. The bank has agreed to pay a fine of $125 million (peanuts, really, at a company with a market capitalization of $235 billion), and thousands — excluding the executives who ran this division, of course — were fired. In front of Congress, Stumpf was apologetic but weak and ineffectual. He said Wells Fargo was dealing with the issue for a number of years before he was made aware of the issue. "If I could turn the clock back, I — we all — wish we had done something earlier," Stumpf said. And then he said something that you could've seen coming. He couldn't remember details. Specifically, Stumpf said he couldn't remember when exactly in 2013 he learned about the issue. He was repeatedly asked if he had known before the Los Angeles Times published a story on the practices, but he didn't answer. This, you see, is a Wall Street coping mechanism. It also happens to beget more disastrous behavior. Memories Let's go back to a few times when Wall Street executives went to Congress to answer for their sins. If you've ever watched one, you've probably been struck by one thing — these guys don't seem to remember anything. Two examples for you. In 2010, Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, had to take the hot seat to answer for packaging toxic mortgage bonds and shipping them off to customers around the world. This caused what we now know as our most recent global financial crisis. Big deal. Blankfein, however, couldn't really remember much of what was done surrounding those assets. Here's an exchange from the hearing: 6:59: Collins: "There's an email from you to Tom Montag. 'Should we have cleaned up these books before and are we doing enough now to sell off cats and dogs?'" Blankfein: "I got to the page!" Collins: "That would seem to be you indicating that in early 2007, before you marketed more of these synthetic CDOs, you were saying let's clean up these residuals and push them to traders." Blankfein: "I don't remember typing this but I can tell you how I use that statement. By 'cats and dogs,' I mean 'miscellaneous stuff.'" This is quite an email — one that Blankfein likely typed under great duress. Goldman was incredibly diligent about clearing its books of bad assets so it wouldn't collapse like some of its peers. But, you know, sometimes you can just forget about that time you were trying to save your multibillion-dollar international financial corporation from impending doom. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein can't... quite... remember... REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay Then there was former JPMorgan Vice Chairman Douglas Braunstein's Congressional testimony in 2013. He was getting grilled on whether JPMorgan's executives — including CEO Jamie Dimon — were hiding losses related to the infamous London Whale from regulators and investors. The whale was a trader who blew a $6 billion hole in JPMorgan's trading book in London because he thought he could salvage a losing position (and likely because he was scared of admitting he was in deep trouble). The bank also seemed scared. During that period, it stopped sending daily profit-and-loss reports to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. When it started again, apparently Dimon flipped out on Braunstein. Braunstein was asked about that in the hearing. From Bloomberg: "'I don't recall the specifics of his reaction,' answered Braunstein, in one of at least three exchanges in which he said he couldn't remember details. A Senate report released this week said Dimon 'reportedly raised his voice in anger' when told the profit and loss reports had resumed. "Lawmakers expressed exasperation throughout the hearing as current and former JPMorgan executives deflected assertions that the bank, Dimon and other executives misled investors and dodged regulators while losses mounted on the so-called London Whale bets." Personally, I'd remember getting chewed out by my boss like that over a crisis like that. But hey, that's just me. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's memory could use some jogging, too... AP Photo The science The reality of these situations is that human beings naturally muddy their memories when they have done something bad. That's according to research from professors Maryam Kouchaki at Northwestern and Francesca Gino at Harvard. They call it "unethical amnesia." Here's how they described it in a recent research paper: "We identify a consistent reduction in the clarity and vividness of people's memory of their past unethical actions, which explains why they behave dishonestly repeatedly over time. Across nine studies using diverse sample populations and more than 2,100 participants, we find that, as compared with people who engaged in ethical behavior and those who engaged in positive or negative actions, people who acted unethically are the least likely to remember the details of their actions. "That is, people experience unethical amnesia: unethical actions tend to be forgotten and, when remembered, memories of unethical behavior become less clear and vivid over time than memories of other types of behaviors. Our findings advance the science of dishonesty, memory, and decision making." In Kouchaki's and Gino's experiments, thousands of participants played games. Those who cheated would come back with sketchy memories. Those who didn't cheat remembered what happened clearly. This memory loss even happened when the cheaters were told they were allowed to cheat. When the cheaters and noncheaters were brought back in to do a new task (no cheating allowed), the cheaters were much more likely to cheat again, the study found. They had become unethical — repeat cheaters. They had suppressed the memory of what was wrong to the point that they didn't recognize wrong anymore. This applies to all aspects of people's lives, not just their jobs. People don't want to be bad, so they conveniently forget when they've been bad. That just makes them worse people. And here's the thing: When it comes to banking, this happens time and time again, in part because we as a society don't always do the best job making the industry and its people remember when they've done something wrong. We allow banks to get away without admitting wrongdoing. We allow top executives to go unpunished, even when behavior is systematic. We let history get rewritten. So don't be shocked that Stumpf can't remember details about a fraud perpetuated by thousands of employees at his bank. We've seen this kind of behavior from bankers from the top of the business to the bottom. Yet we're surprised when this kind of cheating happens over and over again. That, in and of itself, has to be another form of amnesia.

In a statement on Tuesday, JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said Combs' appointment took effect on Monday. His committee assignment will be determined later. Combs, 45, has taken a growing role at Berkshire since joining the Omaha, Nebraska-based company in 2010. Buffett has credited him with triggering Berkshire's largest acquisition, the $32.1 billion takeover in January of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp. "For such a young man, it's a high honor," Andy Kilpatrick, author of "Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett," said about Combs' appointment. "It provides Combs board experience at a financial company and a platform to broaden his growth, which is important because he is a leader at Berkshire." The appointment gives Berkshire direct ties to the three biggest U.S. banks. It owns $5 billion of preferred stock in Bank of America Corp, and has a more than $22 billion, or roughly 10 percent, stake in Wells Fargo & Co. Berkshire also invests in American Express Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and US Bancorp. It reported no JPMorgan stake as of June 30. Before joining Berkshire, Combs was a hedge fund manager at Castle Point Capital Management LLC in Connecticut. He and Ted Weschler, Buffett's other stockpicking deputy, each manage roughly $9 billion. They are expected to take over Berkshire's investments after Buffett, 86, leaves. "Hiring these two was one of my best moves," Buffett said in his annual shareholder letter in February. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, said in a statement about Combs: "Our company and our board will benefit from his wisdom and judgment." Other Berkshire executives have also taken outside board roles. Greg Abel, an energy executive whom investors consider a possible future Berkshire chief executive officer, and Tracy Britt Cool, who has chaired a few Berkshire units, are directors at Kraft Heinz Co, in which Berkshire has a 26.8 percent stake. Buffett once sat on the Coca-Cola Co and Washington Post Co boards, but left those roles to focus on Berkshire. "Buffett and Jamie Dimon have expressed admiration for each other as business leaders," Kilpatrick said. "Buffett is trying to leave an enormous legacy, and this involves putting someone he trusts on Jamie's board."

Combs’s appointment was effective Monday, New York-based JPMorgan said in a statement Tuesday. Buffett’s Berkshire is one of the top investors in JPMorgan competitors such as American Express Co. and Bank of America Corp., and U.S. regulators are weighing whether his 10 percent stake in Wells Fargo & Co. violates rules meant to limit the power of insiders. “It is unusual for any of Buffett’s employees to serve on outside boards, so that’s interesting,” Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a telephone interview. “While Berkshire doesn’t own JPMorgan shares, Warren Buffett has made comments previously that it’s one of his larger personal holdings.” Next Generation Combs, 45, has been taking on a larger role since joining Berkshire in 2010 to manage a portion of the investment portfolio. Buffett credited Combs for sparking Berkshire’s interest in Precision Castparts Corp., one of the billionaire’s largest acquisitions, and named the investment manager this year to the board of the aircraft-parts manufacturer. Buffett has said Combs and Ted Weschler, both former hedge-fund managers, will oversee all of his company’s investments one day, and has also given them oversight roles at other operating subsidiaries. “This arrangement will save me a minor amount of work and, more important, make the two of them even better investors than they already are,” Buffett, 86, wrote in his annual letter published last year. Energy executive Greg Abel and Tracy Britt Cool are also among the next generation of leaders at Berkshire who have been given additional duties. Both are on the board of Kraft Heinz Co., the food company that counts Berkshire as its top investor. Dimon’s View JPMorgan Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was impressed by Combs on his visits to Berkshire, according to a person familiar with the board decision. The investment manager will be the youngest director on a panel where most members are older than 60. Dimon credited Combs in the statement for wisdom and judgment, and the bank said his committee assignment will be reported later. “You have someone who thinks like Warren Buffett on your board, maybe someone who one day replaces Warren Buffett,” Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd., said in an interview with Bloomberg Radio. “That doesn’t seem like a bad guy to have on your board of directors -- a long-term thinker, someone who’s really thinking about value, managing for economics, not politics." Prior to joining Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, Combs worked as an analyst at Florida’s banking regulator and for auto insurer Progressive Corp. He got an MBA at Columbia Business School and eventually started a hedge fund called Castle Point Capital Management LLC in Connecticut. At the fund, he oversaw investments in companies including U.S. Bancorp, Mastercard Inc., Western Union Co. and Chubb Corp. Berkshire is a major holder in U.S. Bancorp and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Its American Express stake is valued at about $10 billion, and the Wells Fargo investment at more than $20 billion. Buffett said in 2012 that he had a personal stake in JPMorgan. ‘Class Act’ Jeff Matthews, an investor and author of books about Buffett, said JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, is a natural fit for Combs, partly because of its prestige. If Combs were to join the board of a lender where Berkshire owns a substantial stake, such as U.S. Bancorp or Bank of America, the relationship could raise further questions about Buffett’s influence, Matthews said. “It’s the class act of big banks, and Buffett thinks very highly of Jamie Dimon,” Matthews said. Both executives have been vocal advocates for increasing corporate transparency and were among a group of finance leaders who released a report in July urging companies to refrain from short-term earnings forecasts. Buffett didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment Tuesday. ‘Impeccable’ Timing In 2012 and 2013, after JPMorgan posted a trading loss on credit derivatives and worked to settle regulatory probes amid pressure to split Dimon’s dual roles, Buffett expressed his support, crediting the bank for propping up smaller rival Bear Stearns Cos. during the financial crisis. Buffett, who is highly regarded for his folksy manner and record of creating wealth, has lent support to other banking executives under fire, including Goldman Sachs’s Lloyd Blankfein and Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan. Politicians have been directing their ire for years at the country’s largest lenders for abusive behavior. Wells Fargo agreed this month to pay a record $185 million to authorities after a review found employees may have opened more than 2 million accounts and credit cards without consumers’ permission. “Perhaps JPM believes that an association with Berkshire Hathaway would be favorable in the current environment,” Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co., wrote in an email, using the ticker symbol for Dimon’s bank. “This would only strengthen the perception of JPM and its board of directors, not only in the eyes of investors but also in the eyes of regulators and the media. Due to some recently-disclosed bad behavior by one of JPM’s peers, the timing is impeccable.” JPMorgan climbed 52 cents to $66.71 at 9:38 a.m. in New York and has advanced about 1 percent this year. Berkshire rose 0.4 percent, and is up about 10 percent since Dec. 31. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

See next articles See previous articles Site Navigation Site Mobile Navigation Advertisement Supported by Wells Fargo’s John Stumpf Has His Wall St. Comeuppance By MICHAEL CORKERYSEPT. 19, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Wells Fargo’s headquarters in San Francisco’s financial district. Credit Max Whittaker for The New York Times Long before he ran Wells Fargo, one of the nation’s largest banks, John Stumpf grew up on a dairy and poultry farm, one of 11 children. He started his career as a community banker in Minnesota and married the local banker’s daughter. Over the years, Mr. Stumpf has cultivated his image as a community banker and that of his bank as the antithesis of a giant global lender. While its rivals were mired in mortgage and trading scandals, Wells boasted that it was helping small businesses and families prosper in what Mr. Stumpf called the “real economy.” But now Mr. Stumpf, 63, is having his own Wall Street moment. On Tuesday, the Wells Fargo chief executive will face questions from the Senate Banking Committee over the creation of as many as 1.5 million phony bank accounts — a widespread scandal that has cost 5,300 Wells employees their jobs and raised questions about a broad failure of oversight inside the bank. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the years immediately after the financial crisis, a congressional grilling was a sort of rite of passage for bank chief executives or top Wall Street traders. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But not since Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase was taken to task for a $6 billion trading loss — the London Whale episode — in 2012 has a banking executive faced such intense political heat. In his prepared testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, Mr. Stumpf apologizes profusely to the bank’s customers for selling them accounts they did not authorize. But he says the accounts were not part of an “orchestrated effort, or scheme as some have called it, by the company.” “That said, I accept full responsibility for all unethical sales practices in our retail banking business,” Mr. Stumpf plans to say in testimony. Video Wells Fargo C.E.O. Won’t Resign “I think the best thing I could do right now is lead this company, and lead this company forward,” John Stumpf said in an interview with Jim Cramer on “Mad Money.” By CNBC on Publish Date September 16, 2016. Photo by CNBC. Watch in Times Video » embed He adds, “I am deeply sorry that we failed to fulfill our responsibility to our customers, to our team members and to the American public.” As the scrutiny of Wells intensifies, there is a particular feeling of schadenfreude on Wall Street and in certain circles of Washington, where Mr. Stumpf was seen as portraying Wells as being different than the risky global investment banks behind the mortgage crisis. While his star was rising on Wall Street and he became the industry’s highest-paid banker, Mr. Stumpf criticized the “plethora of new regulations” on banks. “I think we have gone too far” in terms of regulation, he told an interviewer in 2013, the same year he was named Banker of the Year by The American Banker, a trade publication. It was also the same year that the creation of the sham bank accountants hit their peak, as did the firings of lower-level employees responsible for creating them. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “This is a particular reversal for him,” said Barney Frank, the former congressman from Massachusetts who co-wrote Dodd-Frank, the 2010 legislation that overhauled the financial industry. “He regarded himself as the best person situated to criticize what some people regarded as regulatory excess.” At the same time that Mr. Stumpf assailed some of the new regulations ushered in during that era in interviews and opinion pieces, officials at other banks said that Wells seemed reluctant to be associated with Wall Street’s lobbying efforts in Washington. Wells’s head of government relations is based not in Washington, where all the regulations were being hashed out, but in Minnesota. A bank spokeswoman said that members of the government relations staff are based in the nation’s capitol. From Mr. Stumpf’s Prepared Testimony “I am deeply sorry that we failed to fulfill our responsibilities to our customers, to our team members and to the American public. I have been with Wells Fargo through many challenges, none that pains me more than the one we will discuss this morning.” Continue Reading » This year, Wells Fargo departed the industry trade group Financial Services Forum, which has been working to improve the banking industry’s image, particularly in this election year. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said the bank decided to leave the forum because “other trade associations are more closely aligned to our business model and our footprint, which is concentrated in the United States.” For all the apple-pie image that Mr. Stumpf has sought to project over the years, his compensation is hardly humble. From 2011 to 2015 — the time during which regulators are focusing their investigation into the fake accounts — Mr. Stumpf’s compensation in cash, stock and other benefits totaled roughly $103 million. Indeed, he was paid more than any of the chief executives at the traditional Wall Street firms like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley, according to an analysis by Equilar, an executive research firm. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Analysts say Mr. Stumpf’s compensation was higher than that of his rivals because Wells’s stock price and profits generally outperformed those of other banks during that period. Mr. Stumpf’s first job was as a baker in his hometown, Pierz, Minn., which has a population of about 1,400. After attending St. Cloud State University, he began his banking career in the 1970s as a “repo” agent charged with collecting defaulted debt for a small bank in Minnesota. Photo John Stumpf, chief of Wells Fargo, at a conference in January. Mr. Stumpf will testify Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee. Credit Justin Sullivan/Getty Images In 1982, he joined Norwest, a large Minneapolis bank, where he worked under Richard M. Kovacevich, the bank’s larger-than-life chairman. Norwest and Wells Fargo merged in 1998. The newly merged bank adopted the Wells name and its stagecoach label, commemorating its history as a delivery service across the American West. Mr. Kovacevich is credited as the architect of Wells Fargo’s intense push to “cross-sell” customers as many accounts and services as they could. “Kovacevich is really the person who created what Wells is today,” said Fred Cannon, a banking analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. “Stumpf is his heir.” Mr. Stumpf became chief executive of Wells Fargo in 2007, as the broader financial system began to swoon from the trillions of soured mortgage debt on bank balance sheets. Advertisement Continue reading the main story While not totally immune, Wells avoided many of the crippling mortgage losses befalling other banks. Initially, Wells tried to reject bailout money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, even as federal officials emphasized that it was important for all large banks to accept the money for the greater stability of the financial system. As other banks’ profits were weighed down by the costs of settling government investigations over their mortgage practices, Wells’s auto and energy lending was booming. The bank also took advantage of a wave of home refinancings to become the nation’s largest mortgage lender. With its recent success, Wells had grown to become the nation’s largest bank by market capitalization. But the scandal over the sham accounts — which resulted in a $185 million settlement with regulators — has knocked Wells’s stock price down by as much as 7 percent. “Banks are built on trust, and this is a chink in that armor,” Mr. Cannon said. “It is still early days in how this plays itself out. We have a long way to go.” Correction: September 22, 2016 An article on Tuesday about John G. Stumpf, chief executive of Wells Fargo, whose company is facing a scandal over sham accounts set up by bank employees without customers’ knowledge, misidentified the industry trade group that Wells Fargo departed this year. It is the Financial Services Forum — not the Financial Services Roundtable, which lobbies for the financial industry. A version of this article appears in print on September 20, 2016, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Banker Faces the Music.

Done Editing Tags 120 Comments Share this article 59 59 59 Banks awash in coal—greenwash, that is. Deidre Fulton writes—Big Bank 'Greenwashing' Exposed as Major Climate Week Sponsors Fund Fossil Fuels: Big bank sponsorship of Climate Week 2016, which kicked off Monday in New York City, "amounts to little more than greenwashing," according one environmental organization, given financial institutions' business-as-usual investment in fossil fuels. Indeed, Rainforest Action Network (RAN) charges three major sponsors—Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, and Bank of the West (BNP Paribas)—with "helping [to] drive the climate crisis" through their ongoing funding of extreme fossil fuels such as coal and tar sands oil.  Citing its own 2016 report, Shorting the Climate, which was released in June, RAN notes that between 2013 and 2015, those three entities put $9.89 billion into coal mining companies, $30.7 billion into the largest coal power producers, $74.91 billion into companies building LNG export terminals in North America, and $77.3 billion into companies exposed to extreme oil. Furthermore, among the 25 major global banks analyzed in Shorting the Climate, JPMorgan Chase was the number one investor in two extreme fossil fuel subsectors: liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminals and extreme oil. Bank of America is a "Platinum Sponsor" of Climate Week, while JP Morgan Chase and Bank of the West are listed as "Affiliate" and "Supporting" sponsors, respectively. "Given their current investments in climate-wrecking activities, their sponsorship of 'Climate Week NYC' amounts to little more than greenwashing," said RAN climate and energy program director Amanda Starbuck on Monday. "If these banks aspire to be climate leaders, they must accelerate their exit from coal, and commit to getting out of extreme oil and fracked-gas terminals as well." Climate group 350.org separately took Bank of America to task on Monday for "playing a key role in financing dangerous fossil fuel infrastructure like the Dakota Access Pipeline"—even as it announces "new environmental operations goals" such as moving to 100 percent renewable electricity by 2020.

This has the benefit of being a step or two closer to the truth than his claim that Hillary Clinton calls him "all the time" when they'd spoken twice, and not in more than a year. But a step or two closer to the truth still puts it about five steps from reality. There's one ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and that's John McCain. You'd have to spread the idea of ranking members, plural, pretty thin to get to Scott Brown, who is the sixth Republican member on the committee. Brown is the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Airland, but with 68 subcommittees in the Senate as a whole, being a subcommittee ranking member is not exactly a unique identifier.

The company agreed to sell 107 million shares at $9.35 apiece through underwriters led by units of Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co., Calgary-based Encana said in a statement on Monday after the close of regular trading on North American markets. An additional 16.05 million shares can also be purchased, as part of the deal. The shares fell as much as 6.9 percent in New York on Tuesday to $9.18, the lowest intraday since Aug. 11. They traded at $9.29 as of 11:57 a.m. Encana joins producers including Crescent Point Energy Corp. in tapping equity investors in recent weeks to fund drilling as U.S. crude is up about 65 percent from its February low. Most of Encana’s investment next year will be targeted toward increasing output in the Permian Basin in West Texas, the largest U.S. oil field. The company may look at acquisitions, in addition to growth from its existing assets, according to Desjardins Capital Markets. “Our sense is that speculation of potential acquisitions could also remain a point of debate for investors going forward,” Kristopher Zack, an analyst at Desjardins based in Calgary, wrote in a research note, adding that any purchases would probably be in the U.S. Encana doesn’t have any debt maturities until 2019, he said. “In our view, this increases the incentive to improve the balance sheet through cash flow growth—both organically and possibly through acquisitions—which could also provide additional torque to higher commodity prices.” One of Canada’s largest gas producers, Encana has increasingly focused its attention on boosting oil and petroleum liquids production from shales including the Permian, where it established a position with the 2014 purchase of Athlon Energy for $7.1 billion. The company said it aims to double the number of wells on stream in the Permian in 2017, compared to this year. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan rejected a bid by Anthony Murgio to dismiss two charges related to his alleged operation of Coin.mx, which prosecutors have called an unlicensed bitcoin exchange. Murgio had argued that bitcoin did not qualify as "funds" under the federal law prohibiting the operation of unlicensed money transmitting businesses. But the judge, like her colleague Jed Rakoff in an unrelated 2014 case, said the virtual currency met that definition. "Bitcoins are funds within the plain meaning of that term," Nathan wrote. "Bitcoins can be accepted as a payment for goods and services or bought directly from an exchange with a bank account. They therefore function as pecuniary resources and are used as a medium of exchange and a means of payment." The decision did not address six other criminal counts that Murgio faces, Nathan wrote. Brian Klein, a lawyer for Murgio, said he disagreed with the decision. "Anthony Murgio maintains his innocence and looks forward to clearing his name at his upcoming trial," he added. Prosecutors last year charged Murgio over the operation of Coin.mx, and in April charged his father Michael with participating in bribery aimed at supporting it. Authorities have said Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli man who, along with two others, was charged with running a sprawling computer hacking and fraud scheme targeting a dozen companies, including JPMorgan, and exposing personal data of more than 100 million people. That alleged scheme generated hundreds of millions of dollars of profit through pumping up stock prices, online casinos, money laundering and other illegal activity, prosecutors have said. Shalon has pleaded not guilty, and is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. He hired new lawyers last month and is seeking permission to replace lawyers who joined the case in June, a Monday court filing showed. The case is U.S. v Murgio et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00769.

Posted 2 months ago. Connie Evans, Americas Wire Writers Group Leave a comment 26 reads TV Producer Nely Galán and Super Model Beverly Johnson promote minority small businesses. / Photo Credit: Ashleigh A.M. Bing After Noemi Prado devoted 29 years to working for Southwest Moulding in Grand Prairie, TX, the owners decided to close the business. But Ms. Prado gathered her retirement savings and other financing to purchase the company, a transaction that has sustained and created jobs for 40 people in her community. A key aspect of the financing was a $825,000 loan that she received from theValley Economic Development Corporation’s (VEDC), a non-profit organization that provides affordable business assistance services, direct financial assistance, and entrepreneurial training to minority businesses and entrepreneurs.  “If it wasn’t for VEDC, it wouldn’t have happened,” Ms. Prado said, noting that it was difficult to obtain traditional bank financing. Data collected by the Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO) shows that a large percentage of people want to be like Ms. Prado and run their own businesses.  At the same time, however, many would-be entrepreneurs lack the access to mentors, capital and support networks that could help them get up and running. That’s the problem our nation faces. Small businesses are actually creating a higher percentage of new jobs than big companies, but entrepreneurs and small business owners struggle to get the access to capital and the knowledge, known as ‘trusted guidance’ in the microbusiness industry, that they need to start or sustain their businesses. The reality is that significant barriers limit opportunities for business owners of color.  They face discrimination in the banking world, have fewer wealth assets, and often lack the technical skills to make their dreams and aspirations come true. Yet, there have been new developments that are slowly changing the landscape for minority entrepreneurs and small business owners. Perhaps the most powerful is the changing demographics of the country, which corporate and government leaders are starting to better understand.  The nation is moving towards a majority-minority status. Already, the majority of children born in the country are children of color.  Thus, it’s clear that the nation must become more inclusive with business opportunities or the pockets of poverty across the country will just grow larger.  And, smart corporate leaders recognize that the growing communities of color are where future growth and expansions of their businesses should concentrate for sustained growth. Certainly, part of the answer lies with Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), which are getting more attention than ever before from both the public and private sectors. These mission-based organizations, which receive federal resources to invest in disadvantaged communities, are frequently where minority business owners turn when they need financing.  But needless to say, the demand frequently outpaces their money supply. One of the positives is the collaborations now taking place between major banking institutions and CDFIs and other organizations, such as VEDC. For instance, this year JPMorgan Chase & Co. announced a Small Business Forward initiative, which will allocate $30 million over five years towards growing local, community-based small businesses. The program includes a combination of targeted lending to minority-owned businesses, innovative community development financing and technical assistance for entrepreneurs.  Through this work, JPMorgan Chase is helping minority- and community-based small business owners become engines of job growth and economic vitality in the neighborhoods they serve. At a recent event in Washington, DC that AEO co-sponsored with JP Morgan Chase, Janis Bowdler, their Head of Community Development for Global Philanthropy, put the institution’s thinking in perspective. “As the economy recovers, much of the growth is often channeled toward reviving commercial corridors and downtowns in U.S. cities,” she said. “As a result, many disadvantaged neighborhoods, where underserved people live, are being left behind.” Working with JPMorgan Chase, VEDC has created a National African American Small Business Loan Fund that will boost economic opportunity for minority-owned businesses and help them serve low-wealth communities by providing them with greater access to capital, technical assistance and financial consulting.  VEDC is a member AEO, which is a trade association for the microbusiness industry. A broad range of organizations are recognizing the power of “inclusive entrepreneurship,” which will help bring equity to communities and Main Streets across the nation.  The National Coalition of 100 Black Women and New Economics for Women partnered with AEO and JPMorgan Chase to celebrate minority business owners at the event in Washington, DC during the annual meetings of the Black and Hispanic Caucus Conventions.  Speakers specifically noted that minority women often need assistance in starting and running businesses, but frequently are unaware of how to get that help. Clearly, various partnerships and collaborations can help minorities overcome the barriers. Empowered mission-based community lenders are working with underserved entrepreneurs to help them build and sustain businesses that can fuel financial and social mobility, and create jobs that are boosting the economy — locally and nationally. We must make supporting entrepreneurs and small businesses a national priority. Ms. Evans is president and CEO of Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO), the voice of microbusiness in the United States. Also On Atlanta Daily World: comments – Add Yours DIGITAL EDITION!

JPMorgan Buys Stake in InvestCloud to Speed Digital Revamp By Tanaya Macheel September 21, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related How Banks Are Co-Opting the Robo-Advisory Revolution Big Firms Pour Millions into Wealth Management Tech Firm Krawcheck Launches Women's Digital Investment Adviser These Banks Are Funding Fintech JPMorgan Chase has made an equity investment of an undisclosed size in InvestCloud, a startup that provides cloud-based software to the securities industry. The partnership will allow the bank to accelerate the development of digital capabilities for individual investors at the JPMorgan and Chase franchises and expedite the introduction of online investing capabilities, it said in a Tuesday news release. The announcement comes as JPMorgan has been investing heavily in a digital overhaul. This year it has launched a redesign of its website, opened new digital headquarters in New York City with a Silicon Valley feel and started a fintech accelerator in which it invites startups to become "residents," with access to the bank's facilities, systems and expertise. "Across the wealth spectrum, our clients are increasingly engaging with us digitally," Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of asset management for JPMorgan Chase, said in the release. "We have been managing wealth for more than 200 years. Pairing these new technological capabilities with our trusted guidance will help our clients achieve their long-term financial goals with flexibility in how they interact with us and our advisors." InvestCloud, based in Los Angeles, will bring "easy-to-use dashboards, additional mobile functionalities, and seamless account opening" to JPMorgan's wealth management clients while the bank introduces digital features to enhance interactions with advisers and further personalize the integration of its market insights, beginning in 2017. JPMorgan follows UBS, which made a similar move in May when it took an equity stake in SigFig, as part of a partnership wherein SigFig develops technology and investment tools for the Swiss bank. Also this year, Royal Bank of Canada partnered with FutureAdvisor to integrate digital advice into its wealth management offerings. Wells Fargo has said it will pilot a digital advice platform early next year.

Here's A Way To Think About It (Seeking Alpha) Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC)'s largest shareholder, Warren Buffett, won't be commenting on the financial institution's growing scandal. Buffett, speaking to Fox Business, said he will wait until November to speak about the bank's scandal. The Oracle of Omaha owns nearly 10 percent of the bank, but there may be some cause for concern following the scandal given Buffett's philosophy of investing in quality leaders. Fox Business recalled the Salomon Brothers bond scandal, which occurred 25 years ago this month in which traders submitted false Treasury bond bids to avoid trading rules. Related Link: Elizabeth Warren Just Blasted Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf's 'Gutless' Leadership Buffett said during a Congressional sub-committee at that time that he would be "understanding" if a company loses money through legitimate business practices. However, he will be "ruthless" if a company "loses a shred of reputation" at his expense. Investors could be quick to point out that Wells Fargo has already lost more than just a "shred" of reputation given the stock's nearly $25 billion in market cap which was wiped out once the scandal came into light. The "shred" of reputation could also worsen as the House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling told Fox Business he plans on issuing a subpoena to Wells Fargo's top executives, including its Community Banking Chief Carrie Tolstedt who left the company in July with a $125 million pay package. However, Fox Business suggested Buffett could be forced to comment if more damaging revelations appear since he is after all the largest shareholder.

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton chimed in and said she was "deeply disturbed" by Wells Fargo illegal practices in an open letter to its customers on her website. "Gutless leadership" is how Sen. Elizabeth Warren described Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf's actions in front the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday. Since the scandal broke earlier in the month, Wells Fargo stock is down nearly 8 percent. Related Link: Buffett Buttons His Lips, Won't Speak On Election Or Wells Fargo Until November JPMorgan downgraded Wells Fargo to Neutral following the tough senate hearings "and mounting public scrutiny following the opening of fraudulent accounts." "We expect these will result in additional investigations which would likely pressure expenses and revenues and continued media scrutiny with an election year," the bank said. Morgan Stanley had a different take and feels that Wells Fargo's stock is now inexpensive, subsequently raising its rating to Overweight with an attached $53 dollar price target. "Wells is rarely this inexpensive. This is an opportunity," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. Some have felt that the relatively low fine for the bank, which has $1.8 trillion in assets, is just a blip on the radar. However, since the banking crisis in 2008, its common knowledge how difficult it is to improve public opinion about a bank when it has soured. At time of publication, Wells Fargo was seen trading at $45.73, down 1.78 percent on Wednesday. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 21, 2016 12:28pm   Comments Share: Related FLT Mid-Afternoon Market Update: Tandem Diabetes Drops Following Weak Q3 Results; Novocure Shares Spike Higher Mid-Day Market Update: Crude Oil Down Over 3%; Office Depot Shares Gain On Upbeat Earnings Barclays’ Darrin D. Peller believes FleetCor Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: FLT) is well positioned entering 2017, with upside potential driven by the STP acquisition, Comdata, Speedway, international expansion, incremental partnerships and improved comps on FX, gas and other macro drivers. Peller maintained an Overweight rating on the company, while raising the price target from $180 to $190. Upside Drivers The analyst mentioned that STP now offers toll tags across about 250 parking garages, while it's also testing tags to buy fuel at Shell stations across Brazil. “Coupled with the government doubling the number of private roads in Brazil over the next five years and potential pricing opportunities, we expect STP will maintain its 1H double-digit top-line run rate for the FY and grow in the teens for the foreseeable future,” Peller stated. Conservative Outlook The analyst believes the FleetCor Technologies’ accretion guidance continues to be conservative and the 2017 earnings could drive upside. “Speedway represents the fifth largest portfolio in the US and will represent the third largest in FLT's portfolio,” the analyst noted, while pointing out that “Comdata is expected to grow at a 10 percent rate over the medium term as FLT has found more opportunities to go down market where there is a superior margin profile relative to up market accounts.” In addition, demand for corporate payments continues to be robust and is expected to continue to grow in the high teens through 2017. The EPS estimate for 2017 has been raised from $7.72 to $8.20. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

neutral from overweight, citing the risks of more litigation costs and higher regulation after the Senate hearings with bank CEO John Stumpf. "We are downgrading Wells Fargo ... following tough Senate hearings and mounting public scrutiny following the opening of fraudulent accounts," analyst Vivek Juneja wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. "We expect these will result in additional investigations which would likely pressure expenses and revenues and continued media scrutiny with an election year — there is significant uncertainty about how much some issues will cost and how long they will take."

The firm cut its rating on WFC to Neutral and lowered its price target from $53.50 to $48.00, citing “tough Senate hearings and mounting public scrutiny following the opening of fraudulent accounts.” The analyst also notes that yesterday’s “senate hearings are likely to expand probes” against the company. Related: See what ETFs own the most WFC From the report: In our view: 1) Wells will need to spend a lot more on litigation, examining past violations in additional areas, and responding to requirements from more hearings, investigations and lawsuits; 2) revenues will likely face some slowdown in growth including potentially impact on cross-sell in Retail brokerage, a key focus in that area; 3) this is a material reputational hit given the large number of unauthorized accounts (2 million) and how long it went on; and 4) this will likely result in a shift to greater earnings growth from areas such as investment banking which carry lower multiple. Impact on earnings is hard to determine because of uncertainty about likely total expenses – no comparable lawsuit as this matter is very different from the mortgage crisis. The stock has fallen recently but the uncertain timeframe and earnings impact is likely to keep the stock under pressure. $1-2 bil increase in costs would lower EPS by $0.20-0.40 and imply 11.7x-12.3 P/E multiple respectively (if not tax deductible), which is within the range of regional banks – unclear if these penalties would be tax deductible. What is particularly disappointing to us is that we and investors have long held Wells Fargo management in very high regard – they have been smart contrarian thinkers and made thoughtful decisions. We expect management to turn this around but it will likely take some time and expense – hence the downgrade. WFC is in hot water with its customers, clients, regulators, and the general public over an account-opening scandal where it defrauded millions of customers over a period of several years. Agents of the company opened customer accounts without their consent in order to rack up fees and meet sales goals, according to reports. The company has admitted wrongdoing and fired over 5,000 employees who engaged in the practice, but the issue is far from being put to bed: It is unclear whether this will lead to criminal prosecutions and lawsuits will expand – State Attorneys General, SEC, and potentially criminal investigations. Wells Fargo has been viewed as a core long term holding for many investors – uncertainty around these issues could drive more investors to exit. There is significant uncertainty about some issues – 1) how to compensate customers whose credit scores were increased; 2) how to compensate employees who were fired for not meeting sales targets; and 3) how far back in time Wells will need to go to scrutinize sales. We expect the scrutiny is likely to require lot of investigations and increased compliance and training spending, pressuring expenses. CEO John Stumpf was grilled by regulators yesterday, but thus far is refusing to step down from his post amid the scandal. Wells Fargo shares fell $0.13 (-0.28%) to $46.43 in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, WFC has fallen 14.35%.

September 21, 2016 - ArcelorMittal (the "Company" or "ArcelorMittal") announces the early tender results of its tender offers (the "Offers") to purchase for cash, for a combined aggregate purchase price (exclusive of Accrued Interest (as defined herein)) of up to $1,500,000,000 (the "Initial Maximum Tender Cap"), its outstanding 6.125% notes due 2018 (CUSIP 03938LAF1/ISIN US03938LAF13; CUSIP 03938LAD6/ISIN US03938LAD64; CUSIP L0302DAN3/ISIN USL0302DAN32) (the "2018 Notes"), 9.850% notes due 2019 (CUSIP 03938LAM6/ISIN US03938LAM63) (the "2019 Notes"), 5.125% notes due June 2020 (CUSIP 03938LAY0/ISIN US03938LAY02) (the "June 2020 Notes"), 5.250% notes due August 2020 (CUSIP 03938LAQ7/ISIN US03938LAQ77) (the "August 2020 Notes" and together with the June 2020 Notes, the "2020 Notes"), 5.500% notes due 2021 (CUSIP 03938LAU8/ISIN US03938LAU89) (the "2021 Notes") and 6.250% notes due 2022 (CUSIP 03938LAX2/ISIN US03938LAX29) (the "2022 Notes" and, together with the 2018 Notes, the 2019 Notes, the 2020 Notes and the 2021 Notes, the "Notes"). The Company has decided to increase the Initial Maximum Tender Cap to $1,528,105,440 (such amended amount, the "Revised Maximum Tender Cap") so as to avoid proration of any series of validly tendered Notes with Acceptance Priority Levels 1 to 5 (as described below). This announcement does not contain the full terms and conditions of the Offers, which are contained in the offer to purchase dated September 7, 2016 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Offer to Purchase"), and is subject to the offer restrictions set out below and more fully described in the Offer to Purchase. The table above sets forth information with respect to the Notes that were validly tendered at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 20, 2016 (the "Early Tender Time") and not withdrawn. Because the Offers were oversubscribed (based on the Revised Maximum Tender Cap) as of the Early Tender Time, the Company has accepted for purchase on the Early Settlement Date Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time based on the Acceptance Priority Levels as provided in the Offer to Purchase. The Company has accepted for purchase all Notes that were tendered on or before the Early Tender Time with Acceptance Priority Levels 1 to 5 and none of the tendered Notes with Acceptance Priority Level 6. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, with respect to all such Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time and not validly withdrawn and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers, the Company expects to pay the Total Consideration, together with any accrued and unpaid interest from, and including, the immediately preceding interest payment date applicable to such Notes to, but excluding, the Early Settlement Date (the "Accrued Interest"), to the Holders on the third Business Day after the Early Tender Time, being September 23, 2016 (such date, the "Early Settlement Date"). The "Total Consideration" is the U.S. dollar amount payable per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes set forth in the table above and includes an early tender premium of $50 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (the "Early Tender Premium"). Since the Offers were fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Time, holders who validly tender Notes following the Early Tender Time will not have any of their Notes accepted for purchase. The Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on October 4, 2016, unless extended (as may be extended, the "Expiration Time"). The "Withdrawal Deadline" with respect to the Offers was 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 20, 2016. Notes already tendered pursuant to the Offers may no longer be withdrawn, and any Notes tendered after the Withdrawal Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration Time may not be withdrawn. ArcelorMittal will fund the Offers with existing cash and other sources of liquidity including temporary drawdowns on bilateral short term lines of credit.  The Offers are being made to reduce gross debt through the early repayment of certain of ArcelorMittal's short to medium-term maturing bonds.

Newsy Volkswagen shedding 30,000 jobs FRANKFURT, Germany — Automaker Volkswagen said Friday it will shed 30,000 jobs to cut costs as it tries to recover from its diesel emissions scandal and invests more in electric-powered vehicles and digital services. Company officials said that 23,000 of the job cuts will come in Germany. It said the measures will save some 3.7 billion euros ($4 billion) a year from 2020. Around 11 million cars worldwide have the deceptive software. CEO Matthias Mueller said it was "the biggest reform package in the history of our core brand."

Quotes in the article Wells Fargo & Co WFC ▲ 52.72 +0.23 +0.44% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 77.68 -0.35 -0.44% Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS ▲ 211.49 +1.86 +0.89% It's yet another exhausting example of how people working at a bank got up in the morning, cheated and lied to their customers, went home to their families, ate dinner, were fairly normal, went to bed, and then got up in the morning to lie and cheat at work again. Here's what happened at Wells Fargo: Under intense pressure to meet performance targets from above, thousands of them opened fake accounts for clients. The bank has agreed to pay a fine of $125 million (peanuts, really at a company with a market capitalization of $235 billion) and thousands — excluding the executives who ran this division, of course — were fired. In front of Congress, Stumpf was apologetic but weak and ineffectual.  He said said Wells Fargo was dealing with the issue for a number of year before he was made aware of the issue. "If I could turn the clock back, I, we all, wish we had done something earlier," said Stumpf. And then he said something that you could've seen coming. He couldn't remember details. Specifically, Stumpf said he couldn't remember when exactly in 2013 that he learned about the issue. He was repeatedly asked if he knew before an LA Times story on the practices, but didn't answer.  This, you see, is a Wall Street coping mechanism. It also happens to beget more disastrous behavior.© Provided by Business Insider John Stumpf Memories Let's go back to a few times when Wall Street executives have gone to Congress to answer for their sins. If you've ever watched one, you've probably been struck by one thing — these guys don't seem to remember anything. Two examples for you. Back in 2010 Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, had to take the hot seat to answer for packaging toxic mortgage bonds and shipping them off to customers around the world. This caused what we now know as our most recent global financial crisis. Big deal. Blankfein, however, couldn't really remember much of what was done surrounding those assets. Here's an exchange from the hearing: 6:59: Collins: There's an email from you to Tom Montag. "Should we have cleaned up these books before and are we doing enough now to sell off cats and dogs?" Blankfein: I got to the page!  Collins: That would seem to be you indicating that in early 2007, before you marketed more of these synthetic CDOs, you were saying let's clean up these residuals and push them to traders. Blankfein: I don't remember typing this but I can tell you how I use that statement. By "cats and dogs," I mean "miscellaneous stuff." This is quite an email. One that Blankfein likely typed under great duress. Goldman was incredibly diligent about clearing its books of bad assets so it wouldn't collapse like some of its peers. But, you know, sometimes you can just forget about that time you were trying to save your multi-billion dollar international financial corporation from impending doom. © Provided by Business Insider Lloyd Blankfein Then there was former JPMorgan Vice Chairman Douglas Braunstein's Congressional testimony back in 2013. He was getting grilled on whether or not JPMorgan's executives — including CEO Jamie Dimon — were hiding losses related to the infamous London Whale from regulators and investors. The Whale was a trader who blew a $6 billion hole in JPMorgan's trading book in London because he thought he could salvage a losing position (and likely because he was scared of admitting he was in deep trouble). The bank also seemed scared. During that period it stopped sending daily profit and loss reports to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. When it started again, apparently Dimon flipped out on Braunstein. Braunstein was asked about that in the hearing. From Bloomberg: “I don’t recall the specifics of his reaction,” answered Braunstein, in one of at least three exchanges in which he said he couldn’t remember details. A Senate report released this week said Dimon “reportedly raised his voice in anger” when told the profit and loss reports had resumed. Lawmakers expressed exasperation throughout the hearing as current and former JPMorgan executives deflected assertions that the bank, Dimon and other executives misled investors and dodged regulators while losses mounted on the so-called London Whale bets. Personally, I'd remember getting chewed out by my boss like that over a crisis like that. But hey, that's just me. © Provided by Business Insider Jamie Dimon The science The reality of these situations is that human beings naturally muddy their memories when they have done something bad. That's according to research from Professors Maryam Kouchaki at Northwestern and Francesca Gino at Harvard.  They call it "unethical amnesia." Here's how they described it in a recent research paper: We identify a consistent reduction in the clarity and vividness of people’s memory of their past unethical actions, which explains why they behave dishonestly repeatedly over time. Across nine studies using diverse sample populations and more than 2,100 participants, we find that, as compared with people who engaged in ethical behavior and those who engaged in positive or negative actions, people who acted unethically are the least likely to remember the details of their actions. That is, people experience unethical amnesia: unethical actions tend to be forgotten and, when remembered, memories of unethical behavior become less clear and vivid over time than memories of other types of behaviors. Our findings advance the science of dishonesty, memory, and decision making. In Kouchaki and Gino's experiments, their thousands of participants played games. Those who cheated would come back with sketchy memories. Those who didn't remembered what happened clearly. This even happened when they cheaters told they were allowed to cheat.   When the cheaters and non-cheaters were brought back in to do a new task, they were much more likely to cheat. They had become unethical — repeat cheaters. They had suppressed the memory of what was wrong to the point that they didn't recognize wrong anymore. This applies to all aspects of people lives, not just their jobs. People don't want to be bad people, so they conveniently forget when they've been bad people. That just makes them worse people. And here's the thing. When it comes to banking this happens time and time again, in part, because we as a society don't always do the best job making the industry and it's people remember when they've done something wrong. We allow banks to get away without admitting wrongdoing. We allow top executives to go unpunished even when behavior is systematic. We let history get rewritten. So don't be shocked that Stumpf can't remember details about a fraud perpetuated by thousands of employees at his bank. We've seen this kind of behavior from bankers from the top of the business to the bottom. Yet we're surprised when this kind of cheating happens over and over again. That has to be another form of amnesia in and of itself.

 What you need to know on Wall Street right now Business Insider Sep. 20, 2016, 1:00 PM 1,575 facebook linkedin twitter email print Win McNamee/Getty Images Welcome to Finance Insider, Business Insider's summary of the top stories of the past 24 hours.  To sign up, scroll to the bottom of this page and click "Get updates in your inbox," or click here. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf is in front of the Senate Banking Committee to answer questions about fraudulent accounts opened by Wells employees. Here's what you need to know:  Hillary Clinton on Tuesday published an open letter to Wells Fargo customers, slamming the bank's illegal account openings and outlining what should happen next. Stumpf said the business was dealing with the issue for a number of years before he knew of it. "If I could turn the clock back, I, we all, wish we had done something earlier," said Stumpf. Sen. Elizabeth Warren lit into Stumpf, saying he had exemplified "gutless leadership" and he should be personally "criminally investigated" for the scandal. Sen. Jeff Merkley also called for Stumpf's resignation. You can follow our live coverage here.  Here's Business Insider's Linette Lopez on why people on Wall Street cheat over and over again. A changing of the guard is taking place at Goldman Sachs. The securities division, which houses the bank's equities and fixed income, currencies, and commodities units, has seen at least 18 partner-level departures from key roles in the US and Europe in 2016. You can read all about the quiet shake-up taking place at the bank here.  Once again, we’ve asked some of the sharpest strategists, economists, and reporters for one chart that’s at the top of their minds right now.

West Virginia is accusing Mylan, the maker of the EpiPen, a life-saving autoinjector used to treat severe allergic reactions, of Medicaid fraud. And a group of drug companies just laid out a plan to combat superbugs. The next big tech IPO of the year is starting to look like a bummer, and Comcast plans to launch its own wireless service in 2017. Lastly, here are the 25 coolest new businesses in New York City.

One of Warren Buffett's top stock pickers, Todd Combs, has just been added to the JPMorgan Chase board of directors. Does that mean Berkshire Hathaway has bought a stake in the giant bank? Tuesday morning's news release from JPMorgan offers nothing definitive. Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon is quoted as praising Combs as an "extraordinary leader, investor and thinker,with a deep understanding of finance and business." Buffett has praised Dimon, telling CNBC he "writes the best annual letter in corporate America." But in that February 2012 interview, Buffett said his favorite bank stock was Wells Fargo and Berkshire reported owning more than $22 billion worth of Wells stock as of June 30. At the same time, Buffett revealed that he personally owns "some" shares of JPMorgan. Why buy them for himself and not on behalf of Berkshire? He told us, "Well, because Berkshire doesn't own it, and it's one that I can buy without having any possible problems about conflict." We don't know if Buffett still has JPMorgan shares in his personal portfolio and, if he does, whether that would be enough to stop Combs from buying some on behalf of Berkshire, if that's what he even wanted to do. A Berkshire stake in JPMorgan feels unlikely, but it is a possibility. Berkshire didn't respond to a request for comment. Another possibility has been raised by bank analyst Richard Bove at Rafferty Capital Markets. He wrote in a note today that Comb's appointment is a sign of Buffett's displeasure with Wells Fargo amid its very public fake accounts scandal. By placing one of his "key lieutenants" on Dimon's board when Berkshire doesn't own any of JPMorgan's stock, Buffett is "clearly walking away" from Wells Fargo. We'll know more in mid-November when Berkshire makes its quarterly filing with the SEC to reveal its U.S. publicly traded stock holdings as of the end of this month.

JPMorgan Names Warren Buffett Protégé to Board By Kristin Broughton September 20, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related Dimon's Call to Scrap Guidance Raises Transparency Concerns Wells Fargo Says Decision on Clawing Back Pay Rests with Board What Bankers Want (and Don't Want) from President Trump 'That's Just Really, Really Bad': Bank CEOs React to Wells Scandal Why Media Representation Matters for Women in Banking JPMorgan Chase on Tuesday named Todd Combs, a protégé of and possible successor to Warren Buffett, to its board of directors. Combs, 45, is an investment officer with Berkshire Hathaway. He joined the Omaha, Neb., company in 2010 after serving as chief executive and managing partner of Castle Point Capital, a hedge fund he founded in 2005. Earlier in his career he worked as an analyst for Florida's state financial regulator. In a press release, JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon praised Combs' "deep understanding of finance and business." Combs has not yet been appointed to a board committee, according to the release. Notably, the appointment comes as Wells Fargo — one of Buffett's favorite banks — has come under scrutiny, amid allegations that its bankers created phony customer accounts to meet sales targets. Berkshire Hathaway, which Buffett runs as chairman and CEO, owns about 10% of outstanding shares of Wells Fargo, compared with less than 1% of JPMorgan, according to Bloomberg.

Corporate headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York. Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 10:10 PM, September 20, 2016 NEW YORK - JPMorgan Chase & Co said it had hired and would take a stake in InvestCloud, which provides software that makes online transactions easier for customers with banking and investment accounts. The biggest U.S. bank by assets, JPMorgan did not disclose the amount of the stake in an announcement prepared for release on Tuesday and which Reuters saw. The investment reflects Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon's response to threats from new Silicon Valley companies, which he said in 2015 were coming to disrupt JPMorgan's business. Rather than vowing to block upstarts, Dimon has chosen to embrace those with technology that provides better customer service at lower costs. JPMorgan is competing with other banks and money managers to meet customers' rising expectations for easy but secure ways to keep up with their affairs, anywhere and anytime. The InvestCloud deal is also part of Dimon's commitment to spend $300 million over the next three years on digital improvements in asset management. Starting early next year, the bank will use InvestCloud to customize website dashboards and mobile apps for clients ranging from individuals with investments of $1,000 to managers of family investment offices with $1 billion or more. Over time, the tools will become more refined for people who make their own trading decisions, people who only check managed accounts, and people who manage part and hire out the rest. Compared with the costly slog of traditional programming, InvestCloud says it offers thousands of "lightweight applets" that can be configured within days rather than months. The company started selling products in 2012. It has 660 institutions using its tools in support of $1.5 trillion of assets, according to the announcement. In the announcement, Dimon cited InvestCloud's "record of driving innovation for its institutional clients" as a reason for making the deal. Since December, JPMorgan has struck deals with financial technology companies including OnDeck, which provides systems to speed small business lending; Virtu Financial Inc, which handles electronic trading in U.S. Treasuries; and TrueCar Inc, which provides online car shopping services. Kelli Keough, JPMorgan's global head of digital wealth management, said in an interview that she expected to sign additional financial technology companies. "We are exploring with a range of vendors," she said. "It allows us to get to market faster and bring in innovation."

Suspension of Potential Merger Negotiations By Published: Sept 20, 2016 8:33 a.m. ET Share BOSTON, Sep 20, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- JPMorgan China Region Fund, Inc. (‘JFC’ or the ‘Fund’) announced today that, following discussions between its Board and the Board of Korea Equity Fund, Inc. (‘KEF’), the Boards had mutually agreed to suspend discussions announced on July 19, 2016 concerning a potential merger. The discussions were suspended based on the mutual conclusion that the shareholder approval and appraisal requirements of the Maryland Business Combination Act created significant uncertainties concerning the successful consummation of the contemplated transaction. The Board of JFC will continue to consider alternatives to the merger, including seeking other merger partners, that are in the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders. The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company whose shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The Fund trades under the symbol “JFC.” The Fund seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation through investments primarily in equity securities of companies with substantial assets in, or revenues derived from, the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau—collectively, the China Region.

According to a Bloomberg report, Ant Financial's valuation has since risen to $75 billion, which would make the relatively unknown financial firm more valuable than one of the most iconic and recognizable financial firms, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS). Bloomberg cited Elinor Leung, a Hong Kong-based analyst with CLSA who provided a breakdown of Ant Financial's valuation. The analyst estimates that Alipay, a service that was created by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA) for its customers to more easily buy goods online, is worth $50 billion. Related Link: The Federal Reserve's Stress Tests May Be Illegal Ant Financial's micro loans service is worth another $8 billion, its wealth management unit is worth $7 billion and the remainder comes from investments and cash on hand. Goldman Sachs' valuation as of Tuesday morning was around $66 billion. Leung further suggested that Ant Financial's valuation could rise to $100 billion in just two years, as the current valuation doesn't include growth brought in by insurance, credit scoring and cloud computing. Investors dreaming of buying into an initial public offering may have to do so internationally. Bloomberg noted the company is considering an IPO in Hong Kong in the first half of the year. Ant Financial is controlled by Alibaba's chairman Jack Ma and Alibaba stands to benefit from an IPO through an option to buy a one third stake or receive a one-time payment.

U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan rejected a bid by Anthony Murgio to dismiss two charges related to his alleged operation of Coin.mx, which prosecutors have called an unlicensed bitcoin exchange. Murgio had argued that bitcoin did not qualify as "funds" under the federal law prohibiting the operation of unlicensed money transmitting businesses. But the judge, like her colleague Jed Rakoff in an unrelated 2014 case, said the virtual currency met that definition. Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images "Bitcoins are funds within the plain meaning of that term," Nathan wrote. "Bitcoins can be accepted as a payment for goods and services or bought directly from an exchange with a bank account. They therefore function as pecuniary resources and are used as a medium of exchange and a means of payment." The decision did not address six other criminal counts that Murgio faces, Nathan wrote. Brian Klein, a lawyer for Murgio, said he disagreed with the decision. "Anthony Murgio maintains his innocence and looks forward to clearing his name at his upcoming trial," he added. Prosecutors last year charged Murgio over the operation of Coin.mx, and in April charged his father Michael with participating in bribery aimed at supporting it. Authorities have said Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli man who, along with two others, was charged with running a sprawling computer hacking and fraud scheme targeting a dozen companies, including JPMorgan, and exposing personal data of more than 100 million people. That alleged scheme generated hundreds of millions of dollars of profit through pumping up stock prices, online casinos, money laundering and other illegal activity, prosecutors have said. Shalon has pleaded not guilty, and is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. He hired new lawyers last month and is seeking permission to replace lawyers who joined the case in June, a Monday court filing showed. The case is U.S. v Murgio et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00769. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
