Jordan Wathen (TMFValueMagnet) Oct 27, 2016 at 1:42PM Image source: Visa. Since its initial public offering, Visa's (NYSE:V) stock performance has been nothing short of extraordinary. In its very first day of trading, shares jumped 28% over their IPO price, kicking off a seemingly endless rally that continued for years. I've compiled what I believe to be 10 of the biggest events that define Visa's history as a publicly traded company, with each event marked on the chart below. 1. A record IPO On March 19, 2008, Visa's IPO prices at $44 per share ($11 per share when adjusted for a later stock split). The company earned the title of being the largest U.S. IPO in the history of the stock market. The next day, the first day in which shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock closed at $56.50 per share ($14.13 per split-adjusted share).   The IPO was remarkable in context. Remember, this was March 2008, just five days after JPMorgan offered to buy the remnants of the battered investment bank Bear Stearns for just $2 per share. It was a trying time for financial stocks, but Visa was a clear exception. 2. Visa can't shake its financial industry association What investors like most about Visa is that it isn't a lender. It doesn't make credit card loans, and it certainly wasn't issuing mortgages that caused the crisis in the first place. Visa is simply a payment network -- a toll road -- and it collects a fee on every swipe of a Visa card. But being far removed from problematic loans couldn't keep its share price from following the financial stock slump in 2009. On Jan. 20, 2009, Visa shares ended the day at their all-time closing low of $42.42 ($10.60 per split-adjusted share). 3. Regulators have a field day Just as the IPO window was open to Visa in 2008, the regulatory window was wide open in 2009 and 2010. On May 13, 2010, the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act was revealed, which, if passed, would have directed the Federal Reserve to ensure that debit interchange fees were "reasonable and proportional to the processing costs incurred." Stated differently, the goal of the Durbin Amendment was to make processing debit transactions less profitable. A statement by then-Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin (D-IL) made his targets quite clear. Wall Street reform is really about two things: holding the big banks accountable for how they operate and empowering consumers to make good financial choices. Passage of this amendment is a win for the public on both fronts. Passage of this measure gives small businesses and their customers a real chance in the fight against the outrageously high "swipe fees" charged by Visa and MasterCard. It will prevent the giant credit card companies from using anti-competitive practices, allow merchants to offer discounts to their customers and restore common sense and fairness to this broken system. By requiring debit card fees to be reasonable, and by cleaning up Visa's and MasterCard's worst abuses, small businesses and their customers will be able to keep more of their own money. Making sure small businesses can grow and prosper is vital to putting our country back on solid economic footing. You can tell from the language in Durbin's statement that this was no ordinary time. Financial companies of all stripes -- banks and non-banks -- were universally hated all the way from the halls of the Senate to Main Street USA. Visa shares plummeted after Durbin's statement was released.  4. The Fed shocks banks and card networks Empowered by the Durbin Amendment to oversee debit card fees, the Federal Reserve outlined a proposal to cap interchange fees on Dec. 16, 2010. It suggested capping interchange fees at $0.12 per transaction, a fraction of the then-estimated average fee of $0.44 per swipe. After recouping roughly half of the Durbin-inspired decline, Visa's stock took a nosedive. Investors broadly feared that profits would be regulated away. 5. Durbin's dustbin The Fed's plan to cap debit fees at $0.12 per transaction faced stiff opposition from the financial industry. On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve issued its final rule, which capped interchange fees at $0.21 plus 0.05% of the transaction amount. The Fed allowed for the fee to increase by $0.01 per transaction if certain security measures were implemented.  Visa shareholders breathed a sigh of relief, and share prices rocketed. Matthew Yglesias, a writer for Slate.com, may have written the best take on the company's rapid share price appreciation: A stock that sold for $75 on July 28 is suddenly worth more than $86 the next day. What happened? Did they invent some magical new form of credit card? Of course not. Instead, Visa joined its comrade MasterCard in popping the champagne over the Federal Reserve's surprisingly light regulatory touch. For reference, the split-adjusted prices of Visa in the above quote were $17.75 and $21.50, respectively. It's hard to overstate just how important the Durbin Amendment was to Visa stockholders. In its 2011 annual report, Visa reported that over $1 trillion of debit transactions moved over its network in the United States alone, substantially more than the $641 billion of credit transactions it processed the same year. If you held shares of Visa back then, you certainly remember the Durbin Amendment as being a very big deal. If not, you can rest assured this is the last time I'll mention it. But for the sake of closure, I must mention that the amendment went into effect on Oct. 1, 2011. 6. Visa links up with JPMorgan On Feb. 26, 2013, The Wall Street Journal reported that Visa and JPMorgan Chase quietly agreed to a 10-year deal that would allow JPMorgan to effectively lease Visa's network for its cards. Under the terms of the agreement, JPMorgan agreed to shift more of its card volume to Visa, while Visa gave the bank abilities that effectively created a quasi-closed loop card network akin to Discover and American Express. The bank wasted no time in putting Visa's network to work. Its merchant processing volume ramped up quickly as its customers began to work directly with JPMorgan for payment processing. In 2012, the bank processed $655 billion of merchant volume, which grew to $949 billion in 2015.  7. Becoming a "blue chip" Visa joined a very exclusive list on Sept. 23, 2013, when it became one of just 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Shortly thereafter, its biggest competitor, MasterCard (NYSE:MA), announced that it would split its shares 10-for-1 in what might have amounted to an effort -- albeit a late one -- to be the payment network of choice in the Dow 30.  Visa is still a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average today. 8. On the road to China, maybe Shares of Visa and MasterCard surged on Oct. 29, 2014, as China's announcement that it would loosen rules gave UnionPay an effective monopoly on transaction volume inside its borders. The news was compounded by Visa's and MasterCard's positive earnings releases and reports that the economy was growing at the fastest pace since the Great Recession -- 3.5% during the third quarter of 2014. Alas, for all the excitement about China then, little is happening now. Visa's 2015 annual report tells the tale: Though the Chinese State Council has announced that international schemes, such as Visa, would be able to participate in the domestic market and be eligible to apply for a license to operate a Bank Card Clearing Institution (BCCI) in China, legislation and implementation guidelines for BCCI's have yet to be published and finalized. 9. Visa does the splits On March 19, 2015, Visa began trading after completing a 4-for-1 split in which shareholders saw the shares they owned multiplied by four. After closing at $267.67 per share prior to the split, shares closed the following day at $66.81 each. 10. Reconnecting with a long-lost twin Long awaited by Wall Street, Visa announced its plan to acquire Visa Europe on Nov. 11, 2015. The deal, valued as richly as 21.2 billion euro, would unify its brand around the world. In the press release, Visa noted that acquiring its European brother would put more than 500 million more cards and more than 1.5 trillion euro of annual purchase volume under the Visa umbrella. The deal was finalized on June 21, 2016, putting all the pieces of Visa back together again. A trip down memory lane The most amazing thing about Visa is that at no point has it ever been statistically cheap. It frequently trades at significantly higher earnings multiples than the market at large. But multiples are backward looking, and its growth has been tremendous.  Even at 58 years of age, Visa is still delivering with double-digit annual increases in profits, buoyed by continuous growth in payment volume. With each passing year, inflation increases the amount of money in circulation and cash loses share to cards, pushing more transaction volume to Visa's network. Those two very simple themes have underlain its spectacular returns since its IPO, rewarding its most loyal investors very handsomely over the last eight years.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 27, 2016 at 12:22PM Image source: The Motley Fool. Generally speaking, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is a solid stock for investors who want to minimize downside risk without forgoing meaningful growth opportunities. But this shouldn't be interpreted to mean that there aren't risks associated with owning this bank stock. The biggest risk to JPMorgan Chase Above all, the scariest thing about JPMorgan Chase's stock is the fact that regulators have set their sights on making life difficult for the nation's biggest banks. And given that the New York-based bank is the largest bank in the country, it's safe to assume that it's high on regulators' list. Under legislation passed since the financial crisis, eight so-called global systemically important banks, or G-SIBs, must hold much more capital than their smaller, simpler peers. For its part, JPMorgan Chase has to keep 3.5% more capital in reserve than its competitors in the regional banking space. This is known as the G-SIB surcharge. Why Are Some Banks Too Big To Fail? from John J. Maxfield. The additional reserve requirement reduces the amount of leverage that JPMorgan Chase can use to juice its profits, and thereby weighs directly on its profitability. This is reflected in part in the bank's valuation. Prior to the 2008 crisis, JPMorgan's shares traded in the vicinity of 1.5 times book value or above. Today, they trade for only 1.1 times book value. This is in part because interest rates are unprecedentedly low, which limits how much banks can earn from making loans. But just as importantly, it can't be denied that JPMorgan's depressed valuation also stems from the fact that investors and analysts are concerned that regulators could continue to tighten the proverbial screws on large banks in an effort to eliminate the too-big-to-fail problem. Big banks are in regulators' crosshairs We got a taste for how aggressive bank regulators could become earlier this year, when two of the Federal Reserve's top officials intimated that they will continue to make things difficult for universal banks like JPMorgan Chase -- that is, banks with both investment and commercial banking operations. Here's the view of Fed governor Daniel Tarullo, whom The Wall Street Journal calls "The Most Powerful Man in Banking": "I think it likely that firms are going to have to change in some cases their size, in some cases their business model, and in some cases their organization." And here's Tarullo's colleague echoing the same sentiment: "I have not reached any conclusion that a particular bank needs to be broken up or anything like that," Fed governor Jerome Powell said at an industry conference earlier this year. The point is instead to "raise capital requirements to the point at which it becomes a question that banks have to ask themselves." This is an ominous sign for banks, and JPMorgan Chase in particular. As it is the nation's biggest bank by assets, and one that has a particularly robust presence on Wall Street, in addition to its sizable commercial banking operations, there's little doubt that regulators are talking specifically about it, as well as a handful of its competitors. All that said, I tend to think that investors can do a lot worse than JPMorgan Chase. Warren Buffett himself has expressed admiration for the bank's CEO, Jamie Dimon, on multiple occasions in the past. And one of Buffett's lieutenants has even joined the JPMorgan Chase board of directors. That's quite an endorsement, and it's enough for me to conclude that JPMorgan Chase is a solid stock to add to any long-term investor's portfolio.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 26, 2016 at 7:29PM JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. A bet on bank stocks right now is a bet on interest rates -- or, more specially, on whether the Federal Reserve will increase the Fed Funds rate. What's the likelihood this will happen in the near future? If JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has his way, it should happen sooner rather than later. Dimon's comments Speaking at The Economic Club of Washington D.C. recently, Dimon fielded a question about whether the central bank should raise rates at one of its next meetings. Here's what the 60-year-old JPMorgan Chase executive had to say: Let's just raise rates. You don't want to be behind the eight ball on this. The Fed has to maintain credibility. Normality is a good thing not a bad thing. An economy that's been going like this for seven years is a good thing not a bad thing. So, to me, the return to normal is a good thing. The rate itself gets a lot more psychological attention than the actual economic effect of raising rates. Then, in response to a follow-up question about when the Fed should pull the trigger, Dimon responded: I'd go sooner rather than later, but I'll leave the exact timing up to them. They've made it clear that they're going to raise rates when they see the whites of their eyes; when they see the economy is strong enough. It's for this reason that Dimon thinks now, or rather at the Fed's meeting in December, is the time to raise rates. As he noted, the unemployment rate is down to 4.9%, inflation is ticking up, household formation is improving, and asset prices are up. In his opinion, then, the economy is strong enough to justify a move by the Fed to boost the benchmark Fed Funds rate, from which all other interest rates derive. What this would mean for banks It's worth keeping in mind that, even if the central bank were to raise rates at its next meeting, the increase would likely be minimal. Last December, when it did so for the first time since the financial crisis, it boosted the Fed Funds rate by a quarter of a percent, or 0.25%. That's a tiny improvement. But at the same time, it'd signal to investors that the Fed believes the economy is strong enough to withstand another hike. This has been far from a foregone conclusion over the past year, given the uncertainty in financial markets tied to slowing economic growth in China, concerns about the United Kingdom's pending exit from the European Union, and ultralow oil and gas prices that have made it hard for energy companies to service their bank loans. If the Fed were to follow Dimon's advice, the move would almost certainly cause bank stocks to climb sharply. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) in particular would be major beneficiaries of such an announcement. Shares of these two banks trade for substantial discounts to book value -- Bank of America for a 30% discount, and Citigroup for a 33% discount. And the principal reason they're so cheap is because low interest rates have made it all but impossible for them to meet their profitability targets. Consider this: according to Bank of America's latest quarterly regulatory filing, the nation's second biggest bank by assets would earn an added $7.5 billion in net interest income if rates rose 100 basis points. Citigroup's net interest income would climb $2 billion. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase's would get a $3 billion boost. Suffice it to say that this would make all three of these banks much more profitable, which would almost certainly then be reflected in higher share prices.

The article posted in October 2016 and written by Troutman Sanders lawyers Alan Wingfield, John Lynch, and Meagan Mihalko – all of whom represented Chase in the class action lawsuit – states that the case of Amanda Mix v. JPMorgan Chase (No. 2:15-cv-01102-JJT) has “important positive implications for banks conducting federally-required background checks on job applicants and employees.” The authors explain how Chase uses an “authorized FBI-channeler” to obtain FBI background checks “to comply with its own federal obligations governing employee qualifications” and that “the background checks were not governed by the FCRA” because both the FBI and FBI-channeler did not meet the definition of a “consumer reporting agency” that would indeed be regulated by the FCRA. Chase argued that the background checks “are not consumer reports because the channeler does not assemble or evaluate the information, but instead passes the unadulterated information from the FBI to Chase as a conduit.” The Court rejected arguments by the Plaintiff on why the background checks and channeler should be governed by the FCRA and adopted Chase’s position “that the FCRA did not apply.” The article explains that the Court found Chase demonstrated the “absence of a genuine dispute” as to whether their FBI-approved channeler is a CRA: Specifically, the Court reasoned that Chase’s approved channeler was “akin to an agent acting at the behest of its principals—[Chase] and the FBI; therefore, as an agent without control over its principals’ employment decisions [the channeler] is not a CRA.” The authors concluded: Banks operate under a number of federal requirements to conduct background checks on employees. This opinion confirms that FBI background checks, relied on by many financial institutions in accordance the federal requirements, may not be subject to the FCRA disclosure requirements, especially where they are conducted through the use of an authorized-FBI channeler. The opinion contains favorable law for consumer reporting agencies as well. The opinion lends support that the definitional inquiry into whether an entity acts as a consumer reporting agency should be determined on a transaction-based analysis, and therefore the fact that the entity has an affiliate, or itself, has FCRA-lines of business does not mean that every part of the business is subject to the FCRA.

 JPMorgan bankers have been barred from reading the Financial Times at work Will Martin Oct. 26, 2016, 10:19 AM 28,438 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Employees at the US investment bank JPMorgan can no longer access the online version of the Financial Times on work computers, the bank confirmed on Wednesday, citing the desire to "avoid a potential copyright concern." Bankers have been blocked from accessing the site since last week, a bank spokeswoman told Business Insider by email on Wednesday. Workers can still use their own personal devices to access FT articles but only if "they respect intellectual property rights outlined in our Code of Conduct," the statement added. JPMorgan employs 235,000 people globally, according to the bank's 2015 annual report. It is unclear exactly what the "potential copyright concern" involves, though Paul Murphy, the founding editor of the FT's Alphaville blog, wrote on the blog's Markets Live section: "Well, no — it's not a copyright row — it's cos they were sharing FT content around the JPM buildings, but not paying for a license." "Journalism costs money," he added. A Bloomberg report, which cited people familiar with the matter, said JPMorgan carried out the block because of fears that some employees may have breached copyright by copying and pasting text from FT articles and sharing it. The Financial Times declined to comment. The story was first reported on Twitter by Harry Wilson, The Times' city editor. The FT has a heavily paywalled online product, with group online subscriptions costing £336 ($410.57) a person, according to its website. On an individual basis, a premium digital subscription costs £7.75 ($9.47) a week, equivalent to £403 ($492.44) annually. Without a subscription, readers can access only a tiny proportion of the FT's content. NOW WATCH: Richard Branson: Entrepreneurs need to fill the gap where government is lacking Loading video...

POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt reached out to Gensler for comment but didn’t hear anything back. The Warren wing of the party reacted in anger. From one senior figure in the progressive, Wall Street reform movement: “While the ‘Hill denizen’ is right that the Clintons returning to the White House is similar to the Roman Legions returning to Rome, they better include Gary Gensler in a very senior, genuinely powerful position or it will be like the historic defeat of the Roman Legions at the battle of Cannae. Gensler is a key symbol and dissing him will be a self-inflicted wound that will confirm Clinton is the untrustworthy, Janus-faced politician she has been accused of being for the last 2 years.” Story Continued Below BLANKFEIN ON BLANKFEIN — Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein spoke with David Rubenstein for the Carlyle Group co-CEO’s new Bloomberg show. The episode will appear [bloomberg.com/peertopeer]here by 9:00 a.m. and airs Wednesday evening at 8pm on Bloomberg TV. On why Goldman took big hits during the financial crisis: “We didn’t have a consumer business … [or] a relationship with the public … We managed our risk pretty well in that crisis … we came out relatively unscathed and looking like we needed to be punished in other ways” … On losing his beard during chemo treatments and growing it back: “It’s a sign of, I wouldn’t say victory, but it’s a sign that at least I’m gaining.” SHEILA BAIR: DITCH SUMMERS — POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt: “Former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairwoman Sheila Bair warned Hillary Clinton's nascent presidential campaign against taking advice from onetime Treasury Secretary Larry Summers because ‘the policies he has embraced have done a lot to help Wall Street but not much for Main Street’ according to documents from WikiLeaks. “The advice from Bair, who is now president of Washington College and served as an aide to former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, should not have come as a surprise to the Clinton camp. … Bair and Summers played major roles in the government's response to the 2008 financial crisis, and she has been critical of the former Harvard president in the years since. In 2013, she helped torpedo Summers becoming Federal Reserve chair because of his participation in the "deregulatory cabal that got us into the 2008 financial crisis.” Read more. MAYBE DEMS WILL UNITE ON NOMINATIONS? — Better Markets CEO Dennis Kelleher doesn’t really buy the prognosis for huge intra-party fights should Clinton win: “Regarding nominations, with Republicans already focused on the 2018 Senate races and already stating their intent to make Clinton a one-term President, Clinton, Warren and all the Dems know that they have no margin for error and that a divisive fight over a nomination or two will doom their agenda. “Absent an historic level of political malpractice, that mutual self-interest (plus the Senate’s new 50 vote threshold for confirmation) should make this the smoothest nomination process in memory.” WALL STREET GIVES BIG IN 2016 — Via a new Americans for Financial Reform study: “During the current election cycle, Wall Street banks and financial interests have already reported spending more than $1.4 billion to influence decision-making in Washington … That total … works out to more than $2.3 million a day. More than 350 financial sector companies or trade associations spent at least $500,000 each during this period. “Individuals and entities associated with the financial sector reported making $798,137,857 in contributions to federal candidates for office during the current election cycle … The financial sector’s contributions were more than twice that of any other specific business sector … The financial industry reported spending $667,171,847 on lobbying in 2015 and 2016 through the second quarter.” Full report. THE BIG IDEA: WHY AT&T DEAL MAY GET BLOCKED — James B. Stewart in the NYT: “Opponents of the proposed AT&T purchase of Time Warner don’t want to just block the $85.4 billion deal: They want to overturn decades of antitrust policy and case law. Until recently, that would have been all but unthinkable. But in today’s superheated and politically charged environment, they may just succeed.” Read more.

In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, Trump said defeating Islamic State is a higher priority than persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, playing down a long-held goal of U.S. policy. “Trump questioned how Clinton would negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin after demonizing him; blamed President Barack Obama for a downturn in U.S. relations with the Philippines under its new president, Rodrigo Duterte; bemoaned a lack of Republican unity behind his candidacy, and said he would easily win the election if the party leaders would support him” Read more. WELLS SPARKS NEW REGULATIONS — Bloomberg’s Jesse Hamilton: “To ensure Wells Fargo & Co.’s scandal over unauthorized customer accounts isn’t being repeated at other lenders, regulators are poised to start reviewing data and talking to employees inside the biggest U.S. banks, according to a person familiar with the matter. “Wells Fargo’s largest competitors have received regulators’ formal requests for information and have been preparing for their practices to be scrutinized by examiners in the coming days … Banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. have already been looking internally for any activities similar to those at Wells Fargo” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: Now delivering: Retirement security for life!

El-Erian on Bloomberg View: “The dollar has returned to highs it hasn't seen for nine months. The driver of this recent increase is similar to the cause of the currency's surge earlier this year. Yet, this time, the impact on financial markets has been quite different. And if this persists, the implications for Federal Reserve policy will also be different. “Traders have pushed the dollar higher based on their confidence of an approaching divergence in central bank policies … But in contrast to the earlier period, the impact on U.S. stocks has been very muted. … What is clear … is that the recent strengthening of the dollar is, as a standalone, unlikely to be a deterrent to a rate hike for the rest of this year. That is most likely in December rather than at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week” CLINTON CHAIR PLANNED FOR BIDEN — Business Insider’s Pamela Engel: “Hacked emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman showed how some of her top advisers reacted to speculation that Vice President Joe Biden might join the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. “The Clinton campaign emailed out a schedule that included a ‘Biden Plan meeting’ in late September 2015, around the time that speculation about Biden reached its peak.” Read more. APPLE BETS ON iPHONE 7 — WSJ’s Robert McMillan: “Apple Inc. posted its first annual revenue decline in 15 years, but projected a return to growth in the current quarter behind strong sales of its new iPhone 7. “Apple is running out of large untapped markets where it could reproduce its breakneck success in China in recent years. Sales in greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, declined 30 percent to $8.8 billion in the most-recent quarter. In the same quarter a year earlier, Apple sales to the region grew 99 percent.” Read more. CHINESE INFO SHARING RAISES CONCERNS — FT’s Charles Glover and Sherry Fei Ju: “China's largest internet companies have agreed to share data with government authorities in an effort to eliminate fake online reviews for services such as taxi rides and restaurants. “Despite the pro-consumer rhetoric, there were worries that tightening rules around online reviews and transactions would also help the government create more accurate online profiles of Chinese citizens. The NDRC would be compiling a “credit blacklist” as part of a “joint disciplinary scheme”, one official acknowledged.” Read more. AT&T’S LOBBYIST ARMY — NYT’s Cecilia Kang and Eric Lipton: “From the political right and the left, AT&T’s $85 billion bid for Time Warner has provoked pushback. But AT&T, in addition to its billions of dollars of capital, has another arsenal at its disposal: one of the most formidable lobbying operations in Washington. “The company’s list of nearly 100 registered lobbyists already on retainer in 2016 includes former members of Congress. AT&T is the biggest donor to federal lawmakers and their causes among cable and cellular telecommunications companies, with its employees and political action committee sending money to 374 of the House’s 435 members and 85 of the Senate’s 100 members this election cycle.” Read more. ARBS SKIP AT&T DEAL — WSJ’s Rob Copeland, Gunjan Banjeri and Liz Hoffman: “The once-mighty merger arbitrager has been humbled. Time Warner Inc. shares closed Tuesday some $20 a share below the price spelled out Saturday in AT&T’s $85 billion takeover bid. The big discount in Time Warner’s stock price means that an investor who buys the stock today and holds it would make around 17 percent annualized if the deal closes on schedule late next year. “Yet even at a time of ultralow interest rates and intense competitive pressure for investment returns, the tie-up is attracting little interest from Wall Street traders, thanks in part to concerns about potential regulatory action and lingering fear that the postcrisis stock-market boom could be on borrowed time. It is the latest sign that the once-lucrative field of betting on mergers isn’t the sure win it used to be. Wall Street is giving the deal just a 28 percent chance of closing at the stated terms as of Tuesday’s market close” Read more. GOOGLE FIBER CUTS STAFF — Bloomberg’s Mark Bergen: “Alphabet Inc.’s Access unit is cutting about 9 percent of its staff as it pulls back from an ambitious plan to spread high-speed internet service across many U.S. cities, according to a person familiar with the situation. “Craig Barratt, chief executive officer of Access, the Alphabet company that runs Google Fiber, announced his departure at a staff meeting on Tuesday. Barratt also wrote in a blog post that the company is pulling back fiber-to-the-home service from eight different cities where it had announced plans.” Read more. NEED CASH NOW? — Bloomberg’s Aaron Kirchfeld, Ruth David and Jan-Henrik Foerster: “Deutsche Bank AG, Europe’s biggest investment bank, is exploring alternatives to paying bonuses in cash as Chief Executive Officer John Cryan seeks to boost capital buffers and shore up investor confidence, according to people familiar with the matter. “Executives at the German lender have informally discussed options including giving some bankers shares in the non-core unit instead of cash bonuses, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. Another idea under review is replacing the cash component with more Deutsche Bank stock, they said.” Read more. EX-WELLS STAFF MAY GET JOBS BACK — FT’s Alistair Gray in New York: “Wells Fargo workers who were let go for failing to meet performance targets may be able to rejoin the bank, the new chief executive of the scandal-hit group said … as he apologised to the company’s workforce for its failures. Tim Sloan said the third-biggest US bank by assets had created a ‘special HR team’ to help some of those ‘who left retail banking for performance reasons’ apply for available positions. “The 5,300 employees who created the sham accounts over a five-year period are highly unlikely to get their jobs back. … However, former workers who did not turn to wrongdoing, and lost their jobs on performance grounds, may be ‘eligible for rehire’, Mr Sloan said. Wells would not say how many workers may qualify. In testimony on Capitol Hill last month, the bank’s former chief John Stumpf acknowledged there was ‘a lot of turnover’ at its retail business.” Read more. TRUMP KILLS BIG MONEY EVENTS — WP’s Sean Sullivan, Matea Gold and John Wagner: “Donald Trump’s campaign said Tuesday that it has scheduled no more big-money fundraising events to benefit the Republican Party, another sign of the GOP nominee’s struggling campaign and a serious blow to the party’s get-out-the-vote operations with less than two weeks to go until Election Day. “The consequences of halting major fundraisers will compound the challenges facing a candidate and a party already straining to match Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s much larger and better-financed operation. Unlike Clinton, who has an extensive turnout operation of her own, Trump and many other GOP candidates down the ballot are relying heavily on the Republican National Committee to bring voters to the polls” Read more. BIG STOCKS SOAR — Bloomberg: “These stocks are doing most of the work. The S&P 500 is sitting less than 2 percent off of its all-time high, much of it thanks to a few of the biggest companies in the index hitting new highs of their own. Only 14 stocks in the index touched new 52-week highs on Monday, but three of them are in the top five in terms of market cap, meaning they make up a larger portion of the index. “‘Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Facebook Inc., which rank as the second, third, and fifth largest publicly traded U.S. companies and represent more than $1.4 trillion market cap, all hit new 52-week highs yesterday,’ Bespoke Investment Group observed. ‘While overall market breadth hasn’t been bad, the largest stocks in the S&P 500 have definitely been doing a lot of the heavy lifting.’” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements. With longer lifespans, this often means saving for a longer retirement. These challenges have made planning and saving for retirement more difficult. But what if all Americans could get paychecks for life? Policymakers can help make this possible by supporting policies that encourage saving, make workplace retirement plans more broadly available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies. Let’s send Americans retirement security.

Investors are paying the most since early June to hedge against swings in the benchmark FTSE 100 Index relative to the regional Euro Stoxx 50 Index. The U.K. gauge, up 12 percent this year thanks to a slumping pound, has been hovering around 7,000 for most of the month, though it failed to maintain a record reached intraday on Oct. 11. It slipped 0.5 percent at 8:29 a.m. in London. Follow @Brexit for the latest news, and sign up to our Brexit Bulletin for a daily roundup. Traders are beginning to speculate on the form that Brexit will take, looking beyond the initial boost of a falling currency. Confidence in economic data, which surprised by how much they beat forecasts following the secession vote, is now giving way to inflation concerns, while economists are calling for the slowest quarterly expansion since 2012. JPMorgan Chase & Co. lowered its rating on U.K. shares this week, recommending instead to buy euro-area stocks. “Valuations became extremely stretched,” said Leigh Himsworth, who manages about $91 million of U.K. equities at Fidelity International in London. “When it comes to the economy, the reality of Brexit is really starting to kick in, and inflation is just one example of that. Nobody really knows what can happen. Investors need to work a lot harder to finds pockets of value.” As the pound tumbled to levels not seen since 1985, analysts estimated the FTSE 100 would benefit as its members get most of their revenue from abroad. They project company profits will slip just 0.8 percent this year, compared with a 8.5 percent contraction seen in June. But, since the index rallied to a record, strategists have begun saying the gains have gone too far. They’re calling for a 4.8 percent decline in the FTSE 100 from Tuesday’s close through the rest of the year, according to the average of nine forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. QuickTake Brexit JPMorgan, among the first to turn bullish on U.K. equities back in February, has cut its rating to neutral from overweight. The firm says investors may take any further drop in sterling negatively if politics become more uncertain, while an acceleration of inflation could hurt consumer stocks. With earnings expectations for British companies leaving little room for positive surprises, it’s time to switch to euro-area equities, down 5.5 percent this year, the bank said in an Oct. 24 note. As Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to start negotiations to leave the European Union, speculation has increased that by severing most ties to the common bloc, Britain will suffer. While data have stood up to the Brexit blow, a Bloomberg gauge tracking the degree to which the figures beat or miss forecasts has dropped to its lowest level since before the referendum. Economists forecast gross domestic product expanded 0.2 percent in the third quarter from 0.7 percent in the previous three months. That would mark a bigger slowdown than for any of Europe’s major economies and compares with the growth rate projected for Greece. And yet, even gauges of British mid- and small-cap shares reached record highs this month. The surge in the FTSE 100 pushed it to one of the best performances among developed markets this year, lifting its valuation to about 15 times estimated earnings, or 12 percent more than the multiple for the Euro Stoxx 50. But since mid-August, the cost of options on the British index has climbed 15 percent, while that of contracts on the European gauge has slipped, according to 30-day implied volatility data compiled by Bloomberg. Almost 44,000 bearish puts changed hands each day on average this month, the most since December 2014 and almost double the number of calls. “There is a 100 percent chance of leaving the European Union, and the FTSE valuation does not reflect that probability of a negative event,” said Ben Kumar, London-based investment manager at Seven Investment Management, which oversees about 10 billion pounds ($12 billion). “Europe has a lot further to bounce back.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Published Oct 27th, 2016 4:27 pm staff2@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Editor’s note: Each Thursday, Talk Business & Politics provides “Startup Talk,” a round-up of startup, technology and entrepreneurial news. ––––––––––––––– JPMORGAN COMMITS $75 MILLION TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR WOMEN, MINORITIES AND VETERAN-OWNED STARTUPS JPMorgan Chase said it is more than doubling the size of its global Small Business Forward program by committing $75 million over the next three years to support women, minority and veteran-owned small businesses. This includes a $1.9 million grant to the Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO) to support its programs to connect small business owners with alternative funding sources when they are unable to qualify for traditional loans. According to JPMorgan, small businesses are growing fastest among people of color, particularly Latinas and African American women. Yet, despite their importance to the economy, research shows minority-owned businesses rely significantly more on investments of personal or family wealth than on outside debt or equity. Launched in 2014, Small Business Forward is a global initiative developed by JPMorgan Chase to support small businesses with the potential to grow, offer quality employment, and create economic opportunity for vulnerable populations and their communities by facilitating access to flexible capital; seeding innovative new funds with trusted partners that support underrepresented businesses; extending entrepreneurial support systems to underserved entrepreneurs and neighborhoods; and expanding opportunities for diverse, women, and veteran founders within high-growth sectors. GLOBAL PHONE SHIPMENTS GREW 6% IN 3Q, SAMSUNG LEADS DESPITE GALAXY NOTE 7 RECALL Global smartphone shipments grew 6% annually to reach 375 million units in the third quarter, according to the latest research from Strategy Analytics. Samsung maintained first position with 20% global smartphone market share, while China-based OPPO grew 140% annually and was the standout performer. Samsung shipped 75.3 million smartphones worldwide in Q3 2016, falling 10% annually from 83.8 million units in Q3 2015. This was Samsung’s slowest growth rate for almost two years as market share has dipped from 24% percent to 20% in the past year as the Galaxy Note 7 recall dented its brand image and left a large product gap in its premium smartphone lineup. Samsung will now be looking to its next flagship launch, such as the rumored Galaxy S8 model, to recover momentum in 2017. Apple fell 5% annually and shipped a lackluster 45.5 million smartphones worldwide in Q3 2016. Apple’s global smartphone market share has softened from 14% to 12% in the past year. Apple has been given a slight boost by Samsung’s Note 7 missteps, but it continues to face iPhone fatigue among many consumers in major regions such as China and Europe. Huawei maintained third position with 9% global smartphone market share in the third quarter, up from 8% a year ago. Huawei’s smartphone growth rate has more than halved, to 26% annually in Q3 2016, compared with 62% annual growth in Q3 2015. Huawei is facing intense competition from OPPO, Vivo and other emerging Chinese rivals such as fast-growing LeEco. REPORT: 88% OF EMPLOYEES LACK THE AWARENESS NEEDED TO PREVENT COMMON CYBER INCIDENTS The results of a new survey testing employee data privacy and cybersecurity knowledge reveal that 88% lack the awareness to stop preventable cyber incidents. In “The 2016 State of Privacy and Security Awareness Report,” MediaPro revealed employee knowledge trends across eight risk domains, ranging from working remotely to identifying phishing attempts, and assigned three risk profiles indicating employees’ privacy and security awareness IQ. These risk profiles are Risk, Novice, and Hero, and are based on the number of proper behaviors correctly identified. The more correct behaviors an employee can identify, the less of a privacy or security risk they represent. Key findings show that 72% of respondents were given a “Novice” profile, meaning they understand the basics but are dangerously close to one wrong decision or mistake leading to a security or privacy incident. Nearly 40% of respondents chose to discard a potential password hint in an unsecure manner rather than disposing of it by secure means. MediaPro surveyed more than 1,000 employees across the U.S. to quantify the current state of privacy and security awareness. For the full results of the survey and to view an infographic, visit here.

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK NEW YORK A Florida man pleaded guilty on Thursday to obstructing a regulatory examination of a credit union linked to an illegal bitcoin exchange owned by an Israeli accused of being behind hacking attacks on companies including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N). Michael Murgio, 66, admitted in Manhattan federal court he drafted a letter in 2014 with a false statement that was sent to the National Credit Union Administration during an examination of the New Jersey-based credit union. "When I did this, I knew what I was doing was wrong," Murgio said. Under a plea deal, Murgio, a former member of the Palm Beach County School Board, agreed not to appeal any prison sentence of 16 months or less. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 27. Murgio was indicted in April, becoming one of eight people to face charges following an investigation connected to a data breach that JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 involving records for more than 83 million accounts. Among those charged was his son, Anthony Murgio, who prosecutors say operated Coin.mx, an unlicensed bitcoin exchange owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli accused of orchestrating a massive hacking scheme involving JPMorgan and other companies. Prosecutors contend Shalon along with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, and an American, Joshua Samuel Aaron, ran a criminal enterprise that hacked into a dozen companies' networks, stealing the personal information of over 100 million customers. While the Murgios were not accused of roles in the hacking offenses, prosecutors said they committed crimes linked to the operation of Coin.mx, which exchanged millions of dollars of the virtual currency bitcoin for customers. Prosecutors said that beginning in 2013, Anthony Murgio operated Coin.mx, with the assistance of others including Florida resident Yuri Lebedev. To evade scrutiny of Coin.mx, they acquired control in 2014 of the now-defunct Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, by paying $150,000 in bribes to its chairman, pastor Trevon Gross, an indictment said. Michael Murgio's guilty plea was the second in the case. Jose Freundt, another Florida resident who according to his lawyers worked for Coin.mx briefly, pleaded guilty to various charges on Oct. 13 and agreed to cooperate with authorities. Anthony Murgio, Lebedev and Gross have pleaded not guilty. They are scheduled to face trial in February. Shalon and Orenstein pleaded not guilty following their extradition from Israel in June. Aaron is currently in Russia. The case is U.S. v. Murgio, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00769.

Greff sees Norwegian as having relatively attractive EPS growth in 2017, though driven primarily by capacity. At the same, the analyst also cautioned that the company possesses the most EPS risk due to soft pricing in Europe and the Caribbean, where it has more exposure. “CCL trades at a valuation premium to both NCLH and RCL, reflective of its relatively better Europe exposure, its solid balance sheet position and dividend yield, in our view. We view RCL’s risk-reward as in between CCL and NCLH,” Greff continued. Greff pointed out at fewer North American passengers traveling to European destinations, capacity challenges in Caribbean, while price discipline hurting near term occupancy and onboard. On Royal Caribbean, the analyst is concerned over declining net yields from China coupled with the ongoing weakness in Europe and potential over-supply in the Caribbean. For Carnival, apart from rich valuation, the analyst said the company is pressured by slowing GDP growth, terrorism and Zika, along with ongoing near-term challenges in driving net ticket yields. These challenges offset the company’s strengths including leading market share, diversification potential and scale opportunities. Greff also slashed his price targets for all the three stocks. The target price for Royal Caribbean being cut to $73 from $96, Norwegian to $44 from $62 and Carnival to $46 from $58. Each of the three experienced negative investor reaction Thursday. At last check: Carnival was down 1.68 percent at $46.36. Norwegian was down 5.08 percent at $36.04. Royal Caribbean was down 2.86 percent at $67.90.

James Passeri Oct 27, 2016 12:17 PM EDT Shares of Royal Caribbean ( RCL) were lower Thursday after analysts with JPMorgan downgraded the cruise line to NEUTRAL from OVERWEIGHT. The analysts cited weakness in the European markets and rising supply in China and put a $73 price target on Royal Caribbean stock. Royal Caribbean shares have fallen sharply in 2016, prompting about a third of the company's market cap to vanish. Analysts with Jefferson Research recently saying the company deserves a BUY rating on the basis of improving operating efficiency and strong cash flow, which the analysts say could be the "ultimate measure of company performance and more reliable than reported earnings."

SPEAKING OF DREAM TEAMS — Via Beacon Policy Advisors: “We expect [Clinton] to keep her closest friends and advisors at the White House — some because they are unconfirmable given progressives' resistance (such as Tom Nides) and some because they will be more valuable to her as experienced insiders (such as John Podesta and Neera Tanden). … Huma Abedin … will remain by Clinton’s side in the White House … “Jake Sullivan is Clinton’s whiz kid policy wonk … will likely stick to the Clinton White House, where he could take the lead on foreign policy, or choose to pursue a larger portfolio that includes domestic policy. … Cheryl Mills … will likely take a senior role in the White House. … Phillipe Reines … is too aggressive to serve as Clinton’s official press secretary … but he will be her message shaper behind the scenes.” THREE PERCENT-PLUS GDP AHEAD? — Looks like Friday’s first look at Q3 GDP could be a significant political moment. A reading of three percent or more would offer Hillary Clinton a powerful closing argument weapon and refute some of Donald Trump’s complaining about “1 percent growth.” Pantheon’s Ian Shepherdson: “Trade boosted Q3 growth … The advance September trade numbers were supported by very high soybean exports, for the third straight month, as we expected, but the big story was the unexpected sharp drop in imports of both capital goods, down 3.6 percent, and consumer goods, down 1.8 percent. “With exports rising 0.9 percent, stronger than expected, the overall trade deficit substantially undershot the consensus forecast. … [T]he September trade numbers substantially increase the chance that third quarter growth exceeded 3 percent.” CLINTON WILL “CLOSELY FOLLOW” AT&T MERGER — CNN’s Brian Stelter: “Hillary Clinton says she will ‘closely’ follow AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner as the deal comes under regulatory scrutiny in Washington. The Justice Department's antitrust division will analyze the deal in the months ahead. The Federal Communications Commission may also take a look. There will be Congressional hearings too. The $85 billion deal was announced over the weekend. Clinton's campaign indicated that she had questions about the … but she didn't comment directly until Wednesday afternoon, when reporters asked about it during a Q&A session. “‘I think it raises questions and concerns and they should be looked into,’ she said, towing a common Democratic line about big business mergers. Clinton said she had heard that Congress ‘will start having bipartisan hearings’ about the deal, ‘which I think is appropriate.’ … ‘So I am going to follow it closely, and obviously if I am fortunate enough to be president, I will expect the government to conduct a very thorough analysis before making a decision,’ she said.” Read more. MORE PRESSURE ON BRAINARD — HuffPo’s Zachary Carter: “[Lael] Brainard’s record on trade is certain to ignite the ire of the Bernie Sanders base. When she joined Bill Clinton’s administration in 1997, Brainard helped implement [NAFTA] and manage China’s entrance on the stage of global commerce as a member of the World Trade Organization. “As the top diplomat at Treasury under .. Obama, Brainard advocated for disappointing trade pacts with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, and laid the groundwork for much of what eventually became the TPP” Read more. INSIDE BILL CLINTON INC. — POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein: “As a longtime Bill Clinton adviser came under fire several years ago for alleged conflicts of interest involving a private consulting firm and the Clinton Foundation, he mounted an audacious defense: Bill Clinton's doing it, too. The unusual and brash rejoinder from veteran Clinton aide and Teneo Consulting co-founder Doug Band is scattered across the thousands of hacked emails published by WikiLeaks … “[B]ut a memo released Wednesday provides the most-detailed look to date at the intertwined worlds of nonprofit, for-profit, official and political activities involving Clinton and many of his top aides. The memo at one point refers bluntly to the money-making part of Clinton’s life as ‘Bill Clinton Inc.’ and notes that in at least one case a company — global education firm Laureate International Universities — began paying Clinton personally after first being a donor to the Clinton Foundation” Read more.

DRIVING THE DAY — Hillary Clinton campaigns with Michelle Obama in Winston-Salem, N.C. … Donald Trump campaigns in Springfield, Toledo and Geneva, Ohio … Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will be in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. MORGAN STANLEY SETS OFF RETIRMENT ACCOUNT FIGHT — WSJ’s Michael Wursthorn: “Morgan Stanley will let its retirement brokerage customers keep commission-based accounts once new government conflict rules take effect, a move directly opposite the approach that its biggest rival on Wall Street, Merrill Lynch, is taking. … Under the move, Morgan Stanley will allow its nearly 16,000 brokers to use an exemption under the so-called fiduciary rule to continue offering individual retirement accounts that charge investors for each transaction made. “The fiduciary rule, drafted by the Labor Department and set to start taking effect in April, requires brokers to put the interests of retirement savers ahead of their own and firms to justify varying levels of compensation in IRAs. Morgan Stanley's decision differs from Bank of America Corp.-owned brokerage Merrill Lynch, which earlier this month said it planned a wholesale exit from the industry's traditional commission-based sales model in retirement accounts” Read more. HRC TO PARTY AT JAVITZ — POLITICO’s Jake Sherman: “Hillary Clinton's election night celebration will be at the Jacob K. Javits Center on the West Side of Manhattan. Clinton's campaign sent out a ‘save the date’ to offices on Capitol Hill alerting lawmakers and their aides about the event, noting that they will be sending out ‘additional information shortly.’ The email came from Clinton's ‘political team’ and it said ‘we wanted your boss to be the first to know’ about the plans” Read more. LEFT WANTS TO NAME A REG CZAR — POLITICO’s Ben Weyl: “Progressives are waging a behind-the-scenes campaign to install their preferred ‘regulatory czar’ in a Hillary Clinton administration, floating people who would forcefully use the president's executive powers to advance a liberal agenda. The effort underscores the heightened interest in a typically obscure post that will be especially important if Republicans hold onto Congress and Clinton must enact her domestic policies through the federal agencies she controls. “Lisa Heinzerling and David Vladeck, two Georgetown Law professors who have frequently criticized the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for failing to act aggressively, are among some progressives' top picks to lead that office, multiple activists tell POLITICO.” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: Now delivering: Retirement security for life! We know saving for retirement can be difficult, but policymakers can help by supporting policies to encourage saving, make retirement plans more widely available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies. Let’s send Americans paychecks for life. Learn more at: http://irionline.org/agenda. ** CLINTON TO LIMIT LOBBYISTS — POLITICO’s Anna Palmer and Andrew Restuccia: “Hillary Clinton’s presidential transition team has put in place strict rules that limit the influence of lobbyists in crafting the nominee’s policy agenda, POLITICO has learned, an early indication that Clinton is unlikely to abandon all of the lobbying restrictions imposed by Barack Obama. “The secretive transition operation, which has tried to keep a low profile in order to not appear overly confident in a Clinton victory, is limiting how federal lobbyists can work with the transition teams that are tasked with planning for the transfer of power at dozens of key agencies … The Clinton campaign's policy operation, which is a separate entity from the transition team, continues to be the point of contact for companies, consultants and lobbyists to send policy memos” Read more. FINANCE TRADE ASSOCIATIONS PUSH TPP — Eight major financial services trade associations have signed a letter urging congressional leadership to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership this year: “The TPP is a strong agreement which modernizes rules that will enable our member companies to support global value chains, to help expand participation by small and medium-sized enterprises in the Asia-Pacific region and to deliver quality banking, insurance and securities services to consumers and clients … “A failure to act on TPP this year will have real consequences and it is entirely possible that the other parties to the agreement will move ahead without us.” Read the letter. AMAZON’S GROCERY LIST — Business Insider’s Eugene Kim: “Amazon wants to open 20 brick-and-mortar grocery stores over the next two years and the online retailer believes the US market has room for up to 2,000 of its Amazon Fresh-branded grocery stores over the next decade, Business Insider has learned. “The company wants to experiment with different versions of stores during the pilot program. Ten of the grocery stores will be "click-and-collect" drive-up spots for Amazon customers to pick up their online orders. The other 10 will be traditional stores where cart-pushing shoppers can stroll the aisles, touching, smelling and inspecting produce and other goods for themselves.” Read more. SHARING IS CARING — Reuters’ Jessica Toonkel and David Shepardson: “Media companies plan to ask U.S. regulators to force AT&T Inc and Time Warner Inc to share their trove of customer data if the telecom and content companies merge, fearing the combined behemoth would have an unfair advantage selling targeted mobile advertising, a handful of media executives told Reuters this week. “AT&T's proposed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner would give the media company's networks, such as HBO, Cinemax and Turner, potentially unprecedented data about viewers who have AT&T cell phones and DirecTV accounts.” Read more. WELLS’ MEA CULPA — AP’s Ken Sweet: “Newly appointed Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan told employees Tuesday that he is "sorry for the pain" that the bank's employees have suffered as a result of the company's sales practices scandal. Sloan's company-wide speech, given Tuesday in Charlotte, North Carolina, is the latest effort by Wells Fargo's executives to atone for the fact that the bank's employees, pushed to the limit by impossible sales goals, opened as many as 2 million bank and credit card accounts without customers' authorization.” Read more. SENATE DEMS CALL FOR CLAWBACKS — LATimes’ James Rufus Koren: “On Wednesday, 16 Senate Democrats asked financial regulators to further tighten the proposed rules by forcing Wells Fargo and other banks to claw back executive pay when such misconduct occurs. “The senators, led by Robert Menendez of New Jersey, said allowing banks themselves to decide whether executives get to keep pay does not do enough to curtail the kind of wrongdoing uncovered at Wells Fargo, where thousands of employees created as many as 2 million accounts for customers without their authorization.” Read more. SNAPCHAT SEEKS $4 BILLION IPO — “Snapchat will seek to raise as much as $4 billion in its planned initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter. “The IPO could value Snapchat at about $25 billion to $35 billion, the people said, asking not to be identified as the details aren’t public. No final decision has been made and the size of the IPO may change, they said. The valuation could reach as much as $40 billion, one of the people said.” Read more. TESLA TURNS A PROFIT — WSJ’s Tim Higgins: “Tesla Motors Inc. posted a surprise $22 million profit in its latest period, buoyed by record sales of its pricey electric cars and boosting Chief Executive Elon Musk’s plan to sharply lift output ahead of its release of a sedan to compete against mass-market rivals. “The quarter’s profit — a record and only the second time ever — was driven higher by improved sales of the Model S sedan and Model X sport-utility vehicle, a reduction in spending and a boost from selling pollution tax credits to other auto makers.” Read more. VENZEULA ON THE BRINK — FT’s John Paul Rathbone: “Venezuela's opposition stepped up its dispute with the socialist government on Wednesday with mass street protests, calls for a general strike on Friday and a fresh march on the presidential palace next week if the administration does not allow a constitutionally-allowed referendum against President Nicolás Maduro to proceed. “Mercosur, the South American trade pact that includes Brazil and Argentina, is considering expelling Venezuela for its democratic failings. Luis Almagro, head of the Organization of American States, this week called Venezuela ‘a dictatorship’.” Read more. HOLDING WALL ST ACCOUNTABLE — POLITICO’S Victoria Guida: “The special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program is proposing to make it easier to charge bank executives when fraudulent activity occurs at their institution. “Christy Goldsmith Romero, in SIGTARP’s quarterly report to Congress, recommends that Congress require senior bank officials to sign an annual certification that they have done their due diligence to determine that there is no criminal conduct or civil fraud happening at their institution.” Read more. HUMANS NEED NOT APPLY — NYT’s Nathaniel Popper: “This week Bank of America, MasterCard and several financial start-ups announced new tools — known as chatbots — that will allow customers to ask questions about their financial accounts, initiate transactions and get financial advice via text messages or services like Facebook Messenger and Amazon’s Echo tower. “Many companies are betting that automated bots — both in text messaging and voice-activated form — could become the dominant interface of the future, surpassing phone apps and websites as the way to reach consumers.” Read more. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — GOOLSBEE JOINS ANALYSIS GROUP — Per release: “Analysis Group, one of the largest economics consulting firms in North America, welcomes Austan Goolsbee, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for the Obama Administration and a member of the President’s cabinet, as Academic Affiliate. … “Well known for his work shaping U.S. tax and economic policy, Dr. Goolsbee has held other key roles in the Obama administration over the past two terms, including serving on the Panel of Economic Advisers to the Congressional Budget Office, on the U.S. Census Advisory Commission, and as a special consultant for Internet Policy to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice” WALL STREET FUNDS CHARTER SCHOOL MEASURE — Via IBT: “Wall St firms are evading the SEC pay to play law to use profits off teacher pensions to finance the most expensive charter school ballot measure in American history.” Read more. NEW GSE POST — Treasury’s Antonio Weiss and Karen Dynan write on Medium that “affordability and access [are] central to GSE reform.” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements. With longer lifespans, this often means saving for a longer retirement. These challenges have made planning and saving for retirement more difficult. But what if all Americans could get paychecks for life? Policymakers can help make this possible by supporting policies that encourage saving, make workplace retirement plans more broadly available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies.

Lee Guest Blog: Small Business Comments Email Print Detroit Economy Marvin Ward Jr. Recently, I attended an event in Detroit's West Village where J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced a $5 million investment toward the establishment of a $30 million Strategic Neighborhood Fund to drive inclusive economic growth in Detroit's neighborhoods. This initial $5 million grant is part of a larger investment across three neighborhoods — West Village, Southwest Detroit and Livernois/Six Mile — over the next five years and will continue to expand economic and neighborhood development beyond Midtown and downtown. While listening to the speakers, my mind turned toward Detroit's overall revitalization efforts; specifically, how this region compares to others when it comes to small business development and its role in the city's revitalization. I recently came across a study by the J.P. Morgan Chase Institute of expenditure levels by industry and categories. The Local Consumer Commerce Index, which was first released in "Profiles of Local Consumer Commerce: Insights from 12 Billion Transactions in 15 U.S. Metro Areas" in December, featured Detroit and 14 other major metropolitan areas. Each of these areas was selected based on the depth of the Chase customer market, the volume of total U.S. economic activity captured and geographic coverage. The most recent LCCI update included more than 16 billion transactions from more than 54 million customers. I discussed the report's findings with J.P. Morgan Chase Institute's Marvin Ward Jr., a research lead with the local Consumer Commerce research group, to better understand consumer expenditures and their impact and implications for our region. Lee: What are the key highlights from recent trends in the LCCI data for Detroit? Ward: Detroit consumer spending tracks the national picture remarkably well. While growth in Detroit is a little more volatile – spending slowdowns dip lower than the corresponding national slowdowns – the city has largely transitioned from higher year-over-year growth in 2014 to a lower year-over-year growth in 2015 and 2016. The growth that Detroit experienced has largely been driven by residents under 35 years of age. Lee: So younger consumers are driving spending growth? Ward: In June 2016, spending in Detroit by consumers under 35 increased by over 8 percent, while spending by consumers over 35 increased by less than 3.2 percent. From an income perspective, most of the growth has come from lower income people, who tend to be younger. Spending in Detroit by consumers in the top 20 percent of the income distribution shrank by 1.4 percent in June 2016. Lee: How does Detroit's local consumer spending growth compare to the nation? Any specific industries where Detroit spending outpaces the rest of the country? Ward: Detroit is different with respect to the kinds of businesses that are growing. For example, fuel spending stood out as starkly different in 2015. Detroit fuel sales lagged the national sales by over 2 percentage points at times, but this disparity seems to have settled out in 2016. Durable goods (for instance, home improvement, appliances and furniture) are a particularly notable story in 2016, insofar as spending growth at durable's retailers in Detroit outpaces national growth within the same category. These are useful data points, but they provide an incomplete picture. They can, however, help to calibrate the nuanced on-the-ground assessments of Detroit officials and residents. Lee: What sets Detroit apart from the other cities and how are the suburban areas doing relative to spending growth? Ward: In addition to differences in the kinds of places consumers spend, Detroit seems to be departing from the spatial patterns of growth seen in the rest of the sample. Detroit has seen a volatile, yet probable, increase in spending growth from customers who live outside of the city, but within the metro area. Growth from the suburban portion of the metro area contributed virtually nothing to growth in January 2016. By June, the suburbs contributed 2.4 percentage points to overall growth. This suburban growth profile departs from trends in the other 14 metro areas we observe. Lee: How are consumers in Detroit spending at small businesses? What are the key trends and their implications? Ward: Small businesses have contributed more to overall growth in Detroit than medium and large businesses since the close of 2014. In 2014, Detroit lagged behind other cities with respect to small business growth, but it seems to have made up that ground. In fact, small businesses in Detroit are actually growing slightly faster than small businesses nationally. By contrast, medium-size businesses seem to be doing better elsewhere. Lee: So small business growth is, in fact, playing a major part in Detroit's revitalization. Ward: Small businesses appear to be a major component of revitalization in Detroit. This suggests that entrepreneurs continue to see Detroit as an attractive place to start a business. Lee: What types of consumer spending might indicate an improvement in the local economy? Ward: Detroit has seen consistently positive economic growth in recent years, but that growth has varied by industry. There are those who argue restaurants serve as a useful leading indicator of economic improvement. The rationale underlying this claim suggests that restaurants are a luxury that consumers engage when extra disposable cash is available. If this is the case, it is worth noting that Detroit has seen notably consistent year-over-year growth in spending at restaurants. Since late 2014, restaurants have contributed more to growth in each month than any other type of retail or service business we observe. Lee: Other key implications from the study? Ward: A robust economy needs growth in other sectors as well. Furthermore, strong medium and large firms need strong commercial ecosystems to support their work. That means a deep labor market that has a robust mix of low- and high-skilled workers, well-functioning infrastructure and a growing population that can spark additional demand for local goods and services. Detroit does seem to be making these investments, but the results of efforts to build this ecosystem can take time to materialize.

Photographer: Wang Zhao/AFP via Getty Images Housing curbs will drive funds into equities: JPMorgan Asset Shanghai Composite heads for biggest monthly gain since March Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp China’s speculative investors may finally be contemplating a return to stocks. That’s according to JPMorgan Asset Management, which has been buying mainland shares in a bet that a real-estate lending crackdown and lower valuations will draw investors to equities, more than a year after a rout that wiped out $5 trillion in value. Chinese shares are beginning to perk up, with the benchmark Shanghai index headed for its best month since March. Investors spending borrowed cash drove the stock boom and bust last year, before fleeing to bonds, commodity futures and, most recently, real estate. Average new-home prices in 70 cities surged the most in more than seven years in September amid a credit boom, Bloomberg calculations based on official data show. With at least 21 cities imposing curbs, the housing market is showing tentative signs of cooling, improving the relative attraction of stocks that are among the world’s worst performers this year. “They’ve underperformed every other asset class for a period of time by a shocking margin," said Howard Wang, Hong Kong-based head of greater China for JPMorgan Asset Management, which manages about $1.6 trillion. “The money that would have gone into property will find its way into equities." Since the People’s Bank of China started easing monetary policy in November 2014, various Chinese asset classes have seen bouts of strong inflows, which often prompted regulators to step in to slow price gains -- and investors to move their money elsewhere. Even before that, regulators had to impose curbs to avert a potential housing bubble in 2011, and speculators have also targeted everything from garlic to certain types of tea. After a string of Chinese cities imposed property curbs and measures limiting financing for developers, new-home prices dropped in the first weeks of October in Beijing and Shanghai. The Shanghai Composite Index is up 3.7 percent this month and rose on Tuesday to the highest close since January, even as the yuan extended declines to a six-year low and the cost of borrowing short-term funds in China’s money market jumped. Speculative Investment “If you don’t let me buy property, but I have a lot of money, some people speculate -- and we agree -- people will just put it back in the stock market," said Kevin Leung, director for global investment strategy at Haitong International Securities Group Ltd. in Hong Kong. "It’s underperformed all markets." Analysts at Citigroup Inc. also say the property curbs will buoy stocks. It’s a good time to buy shares in Chinese brokers because households will move funds to equities as housing measures tighten and bond prices are likely to peak, the U.S. bank said this month. China’s 10-year sovereign debt yield fell to a record low just last week, while the Shanghai Composite is trading at price-to-earnings ratio of about 18, down from 25 at its peak last year. Likely inclusion in MSCI Inc.’s benchmark measures next year will also draw more foreign funds, according to Haitong’s Leung. The index firm said last month it’s continuing to monitor whether to add mainland shares to its gauges. ‘Entrenched Disbelief’ Some analysts doubt that interest in shares will return. Homes and stocks are not interchangeable, said Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International Holdings Co. in Hong Kong, who predicted last year’s equity boom and bust. Economists are also seeing receding chances of aggressive monetary stimulus, which sparked the 2015 stock rally, and turnover in China’s two public equity markets remains tepid. “There’s an entrenched disbelief in the stock market," said Hong. “If you ask me what it’s going to take for people to go back, I would say a sustainable recovery. When the momentum comes back, people will chase it." For JPMorgan Asset Management’s Wang, the key is for the government to cool the property market -- but just by a little. It may take three to six months for a strong equity rebound to begin as investors assess the impact of the housing curbs, he said. “If we end up in the base case, which is that liquidity dries up, i.e. volumes fall, but you do not get a major price correction, it may end up redirecting liquidity into equities," he said, referring to a decline in the number of housing transactions. “If they get it wrong and cause a huge correction, then all bets are off. Then money will come out of a lot of the asset classes." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission “‘is not taking any further action at this time and has closed the [foreign exchange] investigation,’" Deutsche Bank said in its third-quarter earnings report Thursday, citing an Oct. 19 letter from the U.S. agency. The CFTC was part of a group of regulators in the U.S., U.K. and Switzerland that fined banks more than $10 billion over the manipulation of foreign exchange rates. Five global financial institutions -- JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citicorp, Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, Barclays Plc and UBS Group AG -- pleaded guilty in the U.S. last year in connection with a Department of Justice investigation into the conduct. The CFTC, which brought its own cases against those banks as well as HSBC Holdings Plc, accounted for $1.9 billion of that total.  It’s not clear how the CFTC’s move may relate to other agencies that have continued to look into similar allegations at other banks. Deutsche Bank, in its statement, said it is cooperating with other regulators around the world over allegations its traders were involved in manipulating currency rates. Steve Adamske, a CFTC spokesman, didn’t immediately return a request for comment. The CFTC isn’t the first agency to drop the pursuit. The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, which levied fines against the six banks beginning in November 2014, said earlier this year that it is dropping its investigation into alleged currency manipulation at firms including Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank continues to face civil litigation in the U.S. over its foreign currency trading. The bank dismissed several foreign exchange traders after starting an internal investigation into alleged manipulation in 2013. The bank hasn’t yet settled foreign-exchange matters with any agency. Deutsche Bank is the world’s fourth-largest currency dealer by market share, according to a 2016 survey from Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc. The bank held the top position from 2005 to 2013.

ZTO Express Underwhelms in IPO 24/7 Wall St. 10/27/2016 Chris Lange © Carlos Barria/Reuters Customers stand outside of a McDonald's store in downtown Shanghai. ZTO Express (ZTO) entered the market below its target in its initial public offering. The stock opened at $18.40 below its price of $19.50, but this was still at the high end of its expected pricing range of $16.50 to $18.50 per American depositary share (ADS). Quotes in the article Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA ▼ 93.39 -0.68 -0.72% JD.com Inc JD ▼ 26.45 -0.30 -1.12% Morgan Stanley MS ▲ 40.43 +0.46 +1.15% Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS ▲ 210.35 +0.72 +0.34% At the $19.50 price, the 72.1 ADSs, including the overallotment option for an additional 10.815 million, are valued up to $1.62 billion. Each ADS represents one share of the company’s common stock. The underwriters for the offering are Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, China Renaissance, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan. This is a leading express delivery company in China and one of the largest express delivery companies globally, in terms of total parcel volume in 2015, according to the iResearch Report. ZTO has demonstrated the fastest growth rate among the top five Chinese express delivery companies as of December 31, 2015, with its annual parcel volume growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 80.3% between 2011 and 2015, during which it recorded consecutive annual increases in market share. ZTO provides express delivery service through its nationwide network, as well as other value-added logistics services. The company has developed one of the most extensive and reliable delivery networks in China, covering over 96% of China’s cities and counties as of the end of June. China’s rapidly expanding e-commerce market, which reached $609 billion in terms of total retail gross merchandise volume in 2015, according to the iResearch Report, has created strong demand for its services. This company is both a key enabler and a direct beneficiary of China’s fast-growing e-commerce market. It has established itself as one of the largest express delivery service providers for millions of online merchants and consumers transacting on leading Chinese e-commerce platforms, such as Alibaba and JD.com. Globally, ZTO provides delivery services in key overseas markets through its business partners, while it is expanding coverage in international express delivery through collaborations with international industry players. In the filing, the company said: "Our total parcel volume increased from 279 million in 2011 to 2,946 million in 2015 and from 1,185 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015, to 1,913 million in the same period in 2016. Our total parcel volume in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was 3,015 million, compared to 1,917 million in the same period in 2015. Our revenues increased from RMB3.9 billion in 2014 to RMB6.1 billion (US$915.8 million) in 2015 and from RMB2.5 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2015, to RMB4.2 billion (US$638.8 million) in the same period in 2016. We generated operating profit of RMB600.3 million and RMB1.5 billion (US$230.1 million) and our operating profit margin was 15.4% and 25.1% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. We generated operating profit of RMB579.9 million and RMB1.1 billion (US$159.0 million) and our operating profit margin was 23.3% and 24.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2015, and 2016, respectively." ZTO intends to use the proceeds from this offering to purchase equipment and expand sorting capacity. The remainder will be put toward working capital and general corporate purposes. Shares of ZTO were last seen at $17.86, with a range of $17.50 to $18.45 on the day thus far. Also more than 33 million shares have moved.

The downgrade comes in the wake of competitor GNC Holdings, Inc (NYSE: GNC)’s earnings- and revenue-missing Q3 report. The analyst cited three main reasons for the Vitamin Shoppe downgrade: A lack of innovation in the vitamin and supplements category. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT)’s new focus on the category over the past year. GNC’s testing of significant changes into pricing and loyalty card practice following negative comps, “particularly in the e-commerce channel.” “In our view, these indicate the competitive environment is likely to only worsen with Vitamin Shoppe, Inc. squeezed between three larger competitors (GNC, WMT and AMZN) and this creates downside EPS risk as we look into 2017,” said Horvers. At last check, investor reaction was weighing on the stock; Vitamin Shoppe was seen down 7.5 percent at $25.30.

Home Economy Growth rebound in US masks demand picture that’s not as bright Growth rebound in US masks demand picture that’s not as bright The US economy’s third-quarter scorecard on Friday will probably show a notable pickup in growth following a sluggish first half. By: Bloomberg | Published: October 27, 2016 10:30 PM The figures surface days before the Federal Reserve’s rate-setting committee meets and Americans go to the polls to choose a new president. (Bloomberg) The US economy’s third-quarter scorecard on Friday will probably show a notable pickup in growth following a sluggish first half. The caveat: It occurred without an acceleration in consumer and business demand. Gross domestic product rose at a 2.5 percent annualized rate, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey, after averaging 1.1 percent in the previous six months. With the biggest part of the economy — consumer spending — moderating, much of the projected pickup stems from a narrower trade deficit and a rebuilding of inventories. While a report Wednesday showed a gain in merchandise exports last month, a broad-based drop in imports indicated domestic demand weakened as the quarter drew to a close. “The economy had a disappointing first half and now we’re getting back on our feet,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York. Household purchases “are settling down after some boomy times,” and “all the acceleration is in net exports and inventories. The pace of growth, overall, remains slow.” The figures surface days before the Federal Reserve’s rate-setting committee meets and Americans go to the polls to choose a new president. Central bank officials can point to evidence that growth is healthy enough to warrant raising interest rates, just not necessarily at the Fed’s gathering next week. Democrats and Hillary Clinton can claim the economy is improving, while Republicans and Donald Trump can just as plausibly say progress is tepid. GDP is the sum of spending by consumers and government, business investment, inventory building and net exports. To get a better sense of underlying domestic demand, however, economists look at the figure that excludes shipments overseas and inventories. That measure, so-called final sales to domestic purchasers, probably slowed from the second quarter’s 2.4 percent pace. The Commerce Department’s report is due at 8:30 a.m. in Washington. Growth close to or better than the median estimate would keep the Fed on track to raise interest rates in December, Feroli said. Investors see a slim chance for a rate move when policy makers meet Nov. 1-2, a week before the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. Upward Revisions An advance report on September inventories and trade, two of the most volatile parts of the GDP calculation, triggered upward revisions to economists’ tracking estimates for the third quarter. Net exports, or the difference between overseas sales of American-made goods and services and what the U.S. buys from abroad, may have contributed again to GDP growth. They added 0.9 percentage point, according to Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley, following a 0.18 point lift in the second quarter. The narrower goods-trade gap in September was hardly a sign of strength, as imports of industrial supplies, capital goods and consumer merchandise all declined. What’s more, exports are unlikely to be a reliable source of U.S. growth until global markets strengthen and the impact of a strong dollar fades, economists said. Unsold goods also probably played a role in boosting growth as businesses accumulated stockpiles after cutting them in the second quarter. A contribution to GDP would end a streak in which changes in inventories weighed on growth for five consecutive quarters, the longest period in almost six decades. Household consumption grew at a more moderate pace of 2.6 percent, after a 4.3 percent second-quarter jump that was the biggest since late 2014, according to the Bloomberg survey. Consumers, whose spending accounts for almost 70 percent of GDP, have benefited from a strong run of hiring, a pickup in wages, low inflation and cheap borrowing costs. Corporate spending on equipment probably declined for a fourth straight quarter for the first time since the U.S. expansion began in 2009. While figures released Thursday showed shipments of non-defense capital goods excluding airplanes — used in calculating GDP — rose in September, they still fell during the quarter at an annualized 4.4 percent rate. Companies’ Caution Southwest Airlines Co., which reported Wednesday that a key industry revenue measure may worsen this quarter, has joined American Airlines Group Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. in slowing expansion plans in an effort to boost ticket prices. Continued caution on the part of businesses, at a time household spending is moderating, would make it harder for the economy to rev up further. Trump, the Republican nominee, has said growth is down to 1 percent and headed lower, while his opponent, Clinton, has argued that she could help build on the economy’s improvement since the last recession. The GDP report probably “gives a little more fuel for Trump’s platform,” because he can point to things like weak business investment, said Tom Simons, a senior economist at Jefferies LLC. “It’s a less compelling source of evidence” for Clinton’s agenda, given that growth isn’t spectacular, he said.

Check Your Credit Score Your credit score is one of the greatest indicators of the overall health of your finances, so it pays to know where you stand. You can view two of your free credit scores, updated every 14 days, by signing up for an account on Credit.com, and by checking your score, you can see what areas you need to improve. For example, you may find out that you need to do a better job making loan payments on time or lowering your credit card balances. And if you have problems with your credit, then you can adjust your holiday shopping plans accordingly, so you don’t do any more damage.

Take Stock of Your Cards Before your holiday shopping begins, you’ll want to know which cards you have at home, in your wallet and elsewhere. Perhaps you have some credit cards that you keep in your car, or at work. Or you might have signed up for store credit cards in last year that you forgot about. In any case, make sure that you can find all of your cards, and double check that the accounts are still open (and, ideally, in good standing). 3. Check Your Available Credit One reason that you should take inventory of your credit cards is to see each card’s line of credit and how much of it is still available. That’s because your debt-utilization ratio — how much credit you’ve used versus how much is offered to you — is one of the biggest factors that determine your credit score. If you’re bumping up against your available credit limit, that’s a sign that you may have taken on too much debt and need to adjust your spending habits. 4. See Which Cards Offer the Most Rewards If you are in the habit of avoiding credit card interest charges by paying your statement balances in full, then you may be the type of credit card user who could benefit from a rewards credit card. You may be able to find credit cards that reward you for the kind of shopping you do over the holidays. For example, the Chase Freedom card (reviewed here) offers 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in spending each quarter on select categories of merchants. From October through December, that category is department stores, wholesale clubs and drug stores, and you can check Chase’s website for specific stores that fall into those categories. That’s just one example — you can see our roundup of the best cash back rewards cards here. 5. Examine Your Cardholder Benefits While most people focus on credit card rewards, your card’s purchase protection benefits could offer you tremendous value during the holidays. For example, a price protection policy could refund you the difference when an eligible purchase experiences a price drop. A return protection policy could come in handy if a merchant is unable to accept or offer a refund for an unwanted item. Damage and theft protection policies are commonly found on many credit cards, while extended warranty coverage can add a year to your manufacturer’s warranty. By knowing which policies your cards have, you can choose to use the ones that offer you the most valuable benefits. 6. Create a Budget The final, and perhaps most important, way to prepare for using your credit cards during the holidays is to examine your budget. It’s very easy to get carried away with your holiday spending, so it’s vital to create a budget before its too late. After all, you don’t want to bump up against your credit limit, as we mentioned earlier, or take on so much debt that it drags down your credit score. By deciding in advance how much is prudent to spend during the holidays, and by closely tracking how your actual charges compare to your budget, you can keep your spending under control. When you prepare your credit cards well in advance of the holidays, then you can start the new year off in a good financial situation, rather than making up for last year’s missteps. At publishing time, the Chase Freedom card is offered through Credit.com product pages and Credit.com is compensated if our users apply and ultimately sign up for this card.

However, this relationship does not result in any preferential editorial treatment. Hello, Reader! Thanks for checking out Credit.com. We hope you find the site and the journalism we produce useful. We wanted to take some time to tell you a bit about ourselves. Our People The Credit.com editorial team is staffed by a team of editors and reporters, each with many years of financial reporting experience. We’ve worked for places like the New York Times, American Banker, Frontline, TheStreet.com, Business Insider, ABC News, NBC News, CNBC and many others. We also employ a few freelancers and more than 50 contributors (these are typically subject matter experts from the worlds of finance, academia, politics, business and elsewhere). Our Reporting We take great pains to ensure that the articles, video and graphics you see on Credit.com are thoroughly reported and fact-checked. Each story is read by two separate editors, and we adhere to the highest editorial standards. We’re not perfect, however, and if you see something that you think is wrong, please email us at editorial team [at] credit [dot] com, The Credit.com editorial team is committed to providing our readers and viewers with sound, well-reported and understandable information designed to inform and empower. We won’t tell you what to do. We will, however, do our best to explain the consequences of various actions, thereby arming you with the information you need to make decisions that are in your best interests. We also write about things relating to money and finance we think are interesting and want to share. In addition to appearing on Credit.com, our articles are syndicated to dozens of other news sites. We have more than 100 partners, including MSN, ABC News, CBS News, Yahoo, Marketwatch, Scripps, Money Magazine and many others. This network operates similarly to the Associated Press or Reuters, except we focus almost exclusively on issues relating to personal finance. These are not advertorial or paid placements, rather we provide these articles to our partners in most cases for free. These relationships create more awareness of Credit.com in general and they result in more traffic to us as well. Our Business Model Credit.com’s journalism is largely supported by an e-commerce business model. Rather than rely on revenue from display ad impressions, Credit.com maintains a financial marketplace separate from its editorial pages. When someone navigates to those pages, and applies for a credit card, for example, Credit.com will get paid what is essentially a finder’s fee if that person ends up getting the card. That doesn’t mean, however, that our editorial decisions are informed by the products available in our marketplace. The editorial team chooses what to write about and how to write about it independently of the decisions and priorities of the business side of the company. In fact, we maintain a strict and important firewall between the editorial and business departments. Our mission as journalists is to serve the reader, not the advertiser. In that sense, we are no different from any other news organization that is supported by ad revenue. Visitors to Credit.com are also able to register for a free Credit.com account, which gives them access to a tool called The Credit Report Card. This tool provides users with two free credit scores and a breakdown of the information in their Experian credit report, updated twice monthly. Again, this tool is entirely free, and we mention that frequently in our articles, because we think that it’s a good thing for users to have access to data like this. Separate from its educational value, there is also a business angle to the Credit Report Card. Registered users can be matched with products and services for which they are most likely to qualify. In other words, if you register and you find that your credit is less than stellar, Credit.com won’t recommend a high-end platinum credit card that requires an excellent credit score You’d likely get rejected, and that’s no good for you or Credit.com. You’d be no closer to getting a product you need, there’d be a wasted inquiry on your credit report, and Credit.com wouldn’t get paid. These are essentially what are commonly referred to as "targeted ads" in the world of the Internet. Despite all of this, however, even if you never apply for any product, the Credit Report Card will remain free, and none of this will impact how the editorial team reports on credit and credit scores. Our Owners Credit.com is owned by Progrexion Holdings Inc. which is the owner and administrator of a number of business related to credit and credit repair, including CreditRepair.com, and eFolks. In addition, Progrexion also provides services to Lexington Law Firm as a third party provider. Despite being owned by Progrexion, it is not the role of the Credit.com editorial team to advocate the use of the company’s other services. In articles, reporters may mention credit repair as an option, for example, but we’ll also be sure to note the various alternatives to that service. Furthermore, you may see ads for credit repair services on Credit.com, but the editorial team isn’t responsible for the creation or implementation of those ads, anymore than reporters for the New York Times or Washington Post are responsible for the ads on their sites. Your Stories Lastly, much of what we do is informed by our own experiences as well as the experiences of our readers. We want to tell your stories if you’re interested in sharing them. Please email us at story ideas [at] credit [dot] com with ideas or visit us on Facebook or Twitter. Thanks for stopping by. - The Credit.com Editorial Team

The deal will make Qualcomm, which provides chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple, the top supplier of chips to the automotive industry and help to reduce its dependence on the smartphone market. Qualcomm, which gets most of its profit from wireless patents it licenses to the mobile industry, has been facing slowing smartphone sales and stiff competition from Chinese and Taiwanese rivals. Qualcomm had sat out the transformative consolidation sweeping the industry, but Thursday’s deal tops Avago’s $37 billion acquisition of Broadcom last year. The equity value of Qualcomm’s offer is $37.88 billion, according to Reuters calculations based on the company’s 344.4 million diluted shares as of Oct. 2. Including debt, it is worth roughly $47 billion, the companies said. The combined entity is expected to have annual revenue of more than $30 billion. Eindhoven-based NXP became the world’s biggest maker of automotive electronics after it acquired U.S.-based Freescale Semiconductor for about $12 billion last December. Qualcomm said it would offer $110 per share in cash, a premium of 11.5 percent to NXP Semiconductor’s Wednesday’s close. NXP’s shares, which had risen 20 percent since reports of a potential deal emerged on Sept. 29, were up 2.9 percent at $101.55 in premarket trading on Thursday. Qualcomm’s shares were up 2.1 percent at $69.64. The company said it intends to fund the transaction with cash on hand and new debt. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are providing committed debt financing for the transaction. The transaction, which is expected to close by the end of 2017, is structured to use offshore cash flow in a tax-efficient manner to rapidly reduce leverage, Qualcomm said. The company said it expects the deal to significantly add to adjusted earnings immediately upon its closing, and generate $500 million of cost savings annually within two years after the deal closes. Qualcomm report ______________________ Restoration of the Botanical Building, above, is one of the projects contemplated by the Balboa Park Conservancy (Photo by Manny Cruz) Balboa Park Conservancy Awarded $75,000 Grant to Hire Project Manager To Take Action on Park Upgrading The Balboa Park Conservancy has received a $75,000 grant from The Parker Foundation to help fund a project manager for two years who will further the group’s efforts on several initiatives. Among the current and upcoming projects are a comprehensive tree inventory of the park, the economic impact study, a signage inventory and analysis, the Cultural Landscape Report, and the restoration of the Botanical Building. To fulfill its mission of enhancing and sustaining Balboa Park for future generations, the Conservancy seeks to gain a greater understanding of the park’s fundamental ecological, cultural, and economic conditions and impacts. To that end, the Conservancy will enlist the expertise of a project manager experienced in construction, public landscapes, and environmental sustainability to successfully pursue the following projects over the next two years: Comprehensive Tree Inventory of the Park — to guide the planning of future reforestation and conservation efforts. An Economic Impact Study — to demonstrate the economic value of the park to the region. A Signage Inventory and Analysis — to improve the visitor experience and enhance access, circulation, and orientation in all areas of the park. A Cultural Landscape Report — to determine the historic value of various elements in the park and guide preservation and restoration planning. Restoration of the Botanical Building — to rehabilitate and preserve one of San Diego’s most iconic structures. The project manager will also assist the Conservancy in coordinating all of its activities with the city of San Diego Park and Recreation Department, consultants, and park stakeholder groups.

(Photo by Delle Willett) “The Conservancy is extremely grateful to The Parker Foundation for providing the financial resources that will enable us to move forward on a number of projects that are essential for sustaining and enhancing the beauty and accessibility of the region’s most cherished cultural resource for the enduring enjoyment of all visitors,” said Conservancy CEO and President Tomas Herrera-Mishler. ______________________ Hemp May be Next Gold Mine For Native American Tribes Reuters Casinos on Native American land have poured billions into tribal economies since the late 1980s, lifting many people from poverty. Now, some hope, cultivating industrial hemp could do the same. Under U.S. law, hemp — which comes from the same family of plants that produce marijuana — can be grown only for research, with a permit from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. However, the Department of Justice opened the door for hemp cultivation by Native American tribes in 2014 when it agreed that tribes can set cannabis-related laws just as states can. Native American-owned CannaNative LLC said on Monday it was in final talks with the Navajo Nation, the largest federally recognized tribe, to grow industrial hemp.

(Port of San Diego) Port Commissioners Approve Permit To Revamp Shelter Island Boat Launch The Board of Port Commissioners has approved a Coastal Development Permit for improvements to the Shelter Island Boat Launch facility. The next step for the project is to receive approval of an Army Corps of Engineers permit and advertising for bids from contractors. The Shelter Island Boat Launch was originally constructed in the 1950s and underwent upgrades in 1976 and 2005. Currently it services about 50,000 launches per year and is believed to be the busiest boat launch in California. Construction is anticipated to begin in early 2017 and take approximately 10 months to complete. The project will demolish and replace the existing 10-lane boat launch ramp and expand the interior of the facility by removing the rock revetment jetty and replacing it with a breakwater wall. The project will also construct public walking platforms with viewing areas that will be located on top of the breakwater walls. Other work will include replacing the existing docks and gangways, improving the kayak launch area, minor grading of the beach area to restore it to its pre-construction profile, improvements to the restroom, installation of signage, lighting and other associated improvements. More than 600 square feet of eelgrass will also be planted inside the basin.  ______________________ San Diego Lawmakers Praise National Guard Bonus Fix By City News Service San Diego-area lawmakers Wednesday applauded a decision by Defense Secretary Ash Carter to suspend an effort by the Pentagon to reclaim enlistment bonuses paid to around 10,000 California National Guard personnel. The bonuses were paid out around a decade ago to maintain force levels at the height of the country’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but subsequent investigations uncovered widespread overpayments, fraud and mismanagement by California National Guard officials. Soldiers who received the money said the Pentagon is reneging on agreements and imposing financial hardships on them. “First, I have ordered the Defense Finance and Accounting Service to suspend all efforts to collect reimbursement from affected California National Guard members, effective as soon as is practical,” Carter said in a statement released by the Defense Department. “This suspension will continue until I am satisfied that our process is working effectively.” “This isn’t just the right action to take, it’s the only action to take — and I’m pleased that the Secretary of Defense is waiving repayment for most guardsmen,” said Rep. Duncan D. Hunter, R-El Cajon. Hunter and Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista, both sent letters to Carter earlier this week demanding a stop to the so-called “clawback” effort by the Pentagon. Via a Twitter posting, Rep. Scott Peters, D-San Diego, said, I applaud this decision from the Secretary of Defense, but I am committed to finding a permanent fix.”  ______________________ Google Halting Rollout of Fiber Internet in San Diego, Other Cities Reuters Google is halting the rollout of its much-talked about high-speed Internet service, Google Fiber in San Diego and some other cities. The company’s Google Access division, which provides the service, also said its chief executive, Craig Barratt, would step down but stay on as an adviser. The division will also lay off some employees in some cities where the service is not fully operational, it said in a blog post on Tuesday, but did not provide further details. Tech news website Ars Technica reported, citing a source familiar with the matter, that the division would lay off about 9 percent of its staff. Google had been expanding the service, which promises Internet speeds of up to 1,000 megabits per second, in several cities in the United States. “The (blog) post suggests a greater focus on technology and deployment methods, implying a shift toward wireless,” said Stifel analyst Noelle Dilts. Google bought Internet service provider Webpass, which uses both wireless and fiber technologies, earlier this year for an undisclosed sum. The rollout of Google Fiber will be paused in Chicago, Dallas, Jacksonville, Los Angeles, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego, San Jose, and Tampa, Dilts added. However, services will continue in cities where it is already available, and Webpass is available in San Diego.

The caveat: It occurred without an acceleration in consumer and business demand. Gross domestic product rose at a 2.6 percent annualized rate, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey, after averaging 1.1 percent in the previous six months. With the biggest part of the economy -- consumer spending -- moderating, much of the projected pickup stems from a narrower trade deficit and a rebuilding of inventories. While a report Wednesday showed a gain in merchandise exports last month, a broad-based drop in imports indicated domestic demand weakened as the quarter drew to a close. “The economy had a disappointing first half and now we’re getting back on our feet,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York. Household purchases “are settling down after some boomy times,” and “all the acceleration is in net exports and inventories. The pace of growth, overall, remains slow.” The figures surface days before the Federal Reserve’s rate-setting committee meets and Americans go to the polls to choose a new president. Central bank officials can point to evidence that growth is healthy enough to warrant raising interest rates, just not necessarily at the Fed’s gathering next week. Democrats and Hillary Clinton can claim the economy is improving, while Republicans and Donald Trump can just as plausibly say progress is tepid. GDP is the sum of spending by consumers and government, business investment, inventory building and net exports. To get a better sense of underlying domestic demand, however, economists look at the figure that excludes shipments overseas and inventories. That measure, so-called final sales to domestic purchasers, probably slowed from the second quarter’s 2.4 percent pace. The Commerce Department’s report is due at 8:30 a.m. in Washington. Growth close to or better than the median estimate would keep the Fed on track to raise interest rates in December, Feroli said. Investors see a slim chance for a rate move when policy makers meet Nov. 1-2, a week before the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. Upward Revisions An advance report on September inventories and trade, two of the most volatile parts of the GDP calculation, triggered upward revisions to economists’ tracking estimates for the third quarter. Net exports, or the difference between overseas sales of American-made goods and services and what the U.S. buys from abroad, may have contributed again to GDP growth. They added 0.9 percentage point, according to Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley, following a 0.18 point lift in the second quarter.  The narrower goods-trade gap in September was hardly a sign of strength, as imports of industrial supplies, capital goods and consumer merchandise all declined. What’s more, exports are unlikely to be a reliable source of U.S. growth until global markets strengthen and the impact of a strong dollar fades, economists said. Unsold goods also probably played a role in boosting growth as businesses accumulated stockpiles after cutting them in the second quarter. A contribution to GDP would end a streak in which changes in inventories weighed on growth for five consecutive quarters, the longest period in almost six decades. Household consumption grew at a more moderate pace of 2.6 percent, after a 4.3 percent second-quarter jump that was the biggest since late 2014, according to the Bloomberg survey. Consumers, whose spending accounts for almost 70 percent of GDP, have benefited from a strong run of hiring, a pickup in wages, low inflation and cheap borrowing costs.  Corporate spending on equipment probably declined for a fourth straight quarter for the first time since the U.S. expansion began in 2009. While figures released Thursday showed shipments of non-defense capital goods excluding airplanes -- used in calculating GDP -- rose in September, they still fell during the quarter at an annualized 4.4 percent rate. Companies’ Caution Southwest Airlines Co., which reported Wednesday that a key industry revenue measure may worsen this quarter, has joined American Airlines Group Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. in slowing expansion plans in an effort to boost ticket prices. Continued caution on the part of businesses, at a time household spending is moderating, would make it harder for the economy to rev up further. Trump, the Republican nominee, has said growth is down to 1 percent and headed lower, while his opponent, Clinton, has argued that she could help build on the economy’s improvement since the last recession. The GDP report probably “gives a little more fuel for Trump’s platform,” because he can point to things like weak business investment, said Tom Simons, a senior economist at Jefferies LLC. “It’s a less compelling source of evidence” for Clinton’s agenda, given that growth isn’t spectacular, he said.

JPMorgan reiterated its underweight rating on Tesla shares as the company's September quarter results, boosted by one-off benefits, didn't lower its high execution risk in the coming year. The electric car maker reported better-than-expected third-quarter financial results Wednesday. "A good quarter — but not as good as it looks; We remain cautious [on Tesla]," analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a note to clients Thursday. "Tesla reported 3Q16 earnings yesterday that at first glance appear to represent a very strong beat to consensus and JPM estimates across all metrics.

(NYSE: ZTO) entered the market below its target in its initial public offering. The stock opened at $18.40 below its price of $19.50, but this was still at the high end of its expected pricing range of $16.50 to $18.50 per American depositary share (ADS). At the $19.50 price, the 72.1 ADSs, including the overallotment option for an additional 10.815 million, are valued up to $1.62 billion. Each ADS represents one share of the company’s common stock. The underwriters for the offering are Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, China Renaissance, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan. This is a leading express delivery company in China and one of the largest express delivery companies globally, in terms of total parcel volume in 2015, according to the iResearch Report. ZTO has demonstrated the fastest growth rate among the top five Chinese express delivery companies as of December 31, 2015, with its annual parcel volume growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 80.3% between 2011 and 2015, during which it recorded consecutive annual increases in market share. ZTO provides express delivery service through its nationwide network, as well as other value-added logistics services. The company has developed one of the most extensive and reliable delivery networks in China, covering over 96% of China’s cities and counties as of the end of June. China’s rapidly expanding e-commerce market, which reached $609 billion in terms of total retail gross merchandise volume in 2015, according to the iResearch Report, has created strong demand for its services. This company is both a key enabler and a direct beneficiary of China’s fast-growing e-commerce market. It has established itself as one of the largest express delivery service providers for millions of online merchants and consumers transacting on leading Chinese e-commerce platforms, such as Alibaba and JD.com. Globally, ZTO provides delivery services in key overseas markets through its business partners, while it is expanding coverage in international express delivery through collaborations with international industry players. In the filing, the company said: Our total parcel volume increased from 279 million in 2011 to 2,946 million in 2015 and from 1,185 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015, to 1,913 million in the same period in 2016. Our total parcel volume in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was 3,015 million, compared to 1,917 million in the same period in 2015. Our revenues increased from RMB3.9 billion in 2014 to RMB6.1 billion (US$915.8 million) in 2015 and from RMB2.5 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2015, to RMB4.2 billion (US$638.8 million) in the same period in 2016. We generated operating profit of RMB600.3 million and RMB1.5 billion (US$230.1 million) and our operating profit margin was 15.4% and 25.1% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. We generated operating profit of RMB579.9 million and RMB1.1 billion (US$159.0 million) and our operating profit margin was 23.3% and 24.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2015, and 2016, respectively. ZTO intends to use the proceeds from this offering to purchase equipment and expand sorting capacity. The remainder will be put toward working capital and general corporate purposes. Shares of ZTO were last seen at $17.86, with a range of $17.50 to $18.45 on the day thus far. Also more than 33 million shares have moved.

Hillary Clinton (D-NY), at a groundbreaking ceremony for the investment bank Goldman Sachs in 2005. (Photo: via imgur.com) As this endless election limps toward its last days, while spiraling into a bizarre duel over vote-rigging accusations, a deep sigh is undoubtedly in order. The entire process has been an emotionally draining, frustration-inducing, rage-inflaming spectacle of repellent form over shallow substance. For many, the third debate evoked fatigue. More worrying, there was again no discussion of how to prevent another financial crisis, an ominous possibility in the next presidency, whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton enters the Oval Office -- given that nothing fundamental has been altered when it comes to Wall Street’s practices and predation. At the heart of American political consciousness right now lies a soul-crushing reality for millions of distraught Americans: the choices for president couldn’t be feebler or more disappointing. On the one hand, we have a petulant, vocabulary-challenged man-boar of a billionaire, who hasn’t paid his taxes, has regularly left those supporting him holding the bag, and seems like a ludicrous composite of every bad trait in every bad date any woman has ever had. On the other hand, we’re offered a walking photo-op for and well-paid speechmaker to Wall-Street CEOs, a one-woman money-raising machine from the 1% of the 1%, who, despite a folksiness that couldn’t look more rehearsed, has methodically outplayed her opponent. With less than two weeks to go before E-day -- despite the Trumptilian upheaval of the last year -- the high probability of a Clinton win means the establishment remains intact. When we awaken on November 9th, it will undoubtedly be dawn in Hillary Clinton’s America and that potentially means four years of an economic dystopia that will (as would Donald Trump’s version of the same) leave many Americans rightfully anxious about their economic futures. None of the three presidential debates suggested that either candidate would have the ability (or desire) to confront Wall Street from the Oval Office. In the second and third debates, in case you missed them, Hillary didn’t even mention the Glass-Steagall Act, too big to fail, or Wall Street. While in the first debate, the subject of Wall Street only came up after she disparaged the tax policies of “Trumped-up, trickle down economics” (or, as I like to call it, the Trumpledown economics of giving tax and financial benefits to the rich and to corporations). In this election, Hillary has crafted her talking points regarding the causes of the last financial crisis as weapons against Trump, but they hardly begin to tell the real story of what happened to the American economy. The meltdown of 2007-2008 was not mainly due to “tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy” or a “failure to invest in the middle class,” two subjects she has repeatedly highlighted to slam the Republicans and their candidate. It was a byproduct of the destruction of the regulations that opened the way for a too-big-to-fail framework to thrive. Under the presidency of Bill Clinton, Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era act that once separated people’s bank deposits and loans from any kind of risky bets or other similar actions in which banks might engage, was repealed under the Financial Modernization Act of 1999. In addition, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act was passed, which allowed Wall Street to concoct devastating unregulated side bets on what became the subprime crisis. Given that the people involved with those choices are still around and some are still advising (or in the case of one former president living with) Hillary Clinton, it’s reasonable to imagine that, in January 2017, she’ll launch the third term of Bill Clinton when it comes to financial policy, banks, and the economy. Only now, the stakes are even higher, the banks larger, and their impunity still remarkably unchallenged. Consider President Obama’s current treasury secretary, Jack Lew. It was Hillary who hit the Clinton Rolodex to bring him back to Washington. Lew first entered Bill Clinton’s White House in 1993 as special assistant to the president.  Between his stints working for Clinton and Obama, he made his way into the private sector and eventually to Wall Street -- as so many of his predecessors had done and successors would do.  He scored a leadership role with Citigroup during the time that Bill Clinton’s former Treasury Secretary (and former Goldman Sachs co-Chairman) Robert Rubin was on its board of directors.  In 2009, Hillary selected him to be her deputy secretary of state. Lew is hardly the only example of the busy revolving door to power that led from the Clinton administration to the Obama administration via Wall Street (or activities connected to it). Bill Clinton’s Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, Timothy Geithner worked with Robert Rubin, later championed Wall Street as president and CEO of the New York Federal Reserve while Hillary was senator from New York (representing Wall Street), and then became Obama’s first treasury secretary while Hillary was secretary of state. One possible contender for treasury secretary in a new Clinton administration would be Bill Clinton’s Under Secretary of Domestic Finance and Obama’s Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, Gary Gensler (who was -- I’m sure you won’t be shocked -- a Goldman Sachs partner before entering public service). These, then, are typical inhabitants of the Clinton inner circle and of the political-financial corridors of power. Their thinking, like Hillary’s, meshes well with support for the status quo in the banking system, even if, like her, they are willing on occasion to admonish it for its “mistakes.” This thru-line of personnel in and out of Clinton World is dangerous for most of the rest of us, because behind all the “talking heads” and genuinely amusing Saturday Night Live skits about this bizarre election lie certain crucial issues that will have to be dealt with: decisions about climate change, foreign wars, student-loan unaffordability, rising income inequality, declining social mobility, and, yes, the threat of another financial crisis. And keep in mind that such a future economic meltdown isn’t an absurdly long-shot possibility. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve, the nation’s main bank regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the government entity that insures our bank deposits, collectively noted that seven of our biggest eight banks -- Citigroup was the exception -- still have inadequate emergency plans in the event of another financial crisis. Exploring a Two-Faced World Politicians regularly act one way publicly and another privately, as Hillary was “outed” for doing by WikiLeaks via its document dump from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta’s hacked email account. Such realities should be treated as neither shockers nor smoking guns. Everybody postures. Everybody lies. Everybody’s two-faced in certain aspects of their lives. Politicians just make a career out of it. What’s problematic about Hillary’s public and private positions in the economic sphere, at least, isn’t their two-facedness but how of a piece they are. Yes, she warned the bankers to “cut it out! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors!” -- but that was no demonstration of strength in relation to the big banks. Her comments revealed no real understanding of their precise role in exacerbating a fixable subprime loan calamity and global financial crisis, nor did her finger-wagging mean anything to Wall Street. Keep in mind that, during the build-up to that crisis, as banks took advantage of looser regulations, she collected more than $7 million from the securities and investment industry for her New York Senate runs ($18 million during her career). In her first Senate campaign, Citigroup was her top contributor.  The four Wall-Street-based banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) all feature among her top 10 career contributors. As a senator, she didn’t introduce any bills aimed at reforming or regulating Wall Street. During the lead-up to the financial crisis of 2007-2008, she did introduce five (out of 140) bills relating to the housing crisis, but they all died before making it through a Senate committee. So did a bill she sponsored to curtail corporate executive compensation. Though she has publicly called for a reduction in hedge-fund tax breaks (known as “closing the carried interest loophole”), including at the second debate, she never signed on to the bill that would have done so (one that Obama co-sponsored in 2007). Perhaps her most important gesture of support for Wall Street was her vote in favor of the $700 billion 2008 bank bailout bill. (Bernie Sanders opposed it.) After her secretary of state stint, she returned to the scene of banking crimes. Many times. As we know, she was also paid exceedingly well for it. Friendship with the Clintons doesn’t come cheap. As she said in October 2013, while speaking at a Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments’ Symposium, “running for office in our country takes a lot of money, and candidates have to go out and raise it. New York is probably the leading site for contributions for fundraising for candidates on both sides of the aisle.” Between 2013 and 2015, she gave 12 speeches to Wall Street banks, private equity firms, and other financial corporations, reaping a whopping $2,935,000 for them. In her 2016 presidential run, the securities and investment sector (aka Wall Street) has contributed the most of any industry to PACs supporting Hillary: $56.4 million. Yes, everybody needs to make a buck or a few million of them. This is America after all, but Hillary was a political figure paid by the same banks routinely getting slapped with criminal settlements by the Department of Justice. In addition, the Clinton Foundation counted as generous donors all four of the major Wall Street-based mega-banks. She was voracious when it came to such money and tone-deaf when it came to the irony of it all. Glass-Steagall and Bernie Sanders One of the more illuminating aspects of the Podesta emails was a series of communications that took place in the fall of 2015. That’s when Bernie Sanders was gaining traction for, among other things, his calls to break up the big banks and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.  The Clinton administration’s dismantling of that act in 1999 had freed the big banks to use their depositors’ money as collateral for risky bets in the real estate market and elsewhere, and so allowed them to become ever more engorged with questionable securities. On December 7, 2015, with her campaign well underway and worried about the Sanders challenge, the Clinton camp debuted a key Hillary op-ed, “How I’d Rein in Wall Street,” in the New York Times. This followed two months of emails and internal debate within her campaign over whether supporting the return of Glass-Steagall was politically palatable for her and whether not supporting it would antagonize Senator Elizabeth Warren. In the end, though Glass-Steagall was mentioned in passing in her op-ed, she chose not to endorse its return. She explained her decision not to do so this way (and her advisers and media apostles have stuck with this explanation ever since): “Some have urged the return of a Depression-era rule called Glass-Steagall, which separated traditional banking from investment banking. But many of the firms that contributed to the crash in 2008, like A.I.G. and Lehman Brothers, weren’t traditional banks, so Glass-Steagall wouldn’t have limited their reckless behavior. Nor would restoring Glass-Steagall help contain other parts of the ‘shadow banking’ sector, including certain activities of hedge funds, investment banks, and other non-bank institutions.” Her entire characterization of how the 2007-2008 banking crisis unfolded was -- well -- wrong.  Here’s how traditional banks (like JPMorgan Chase) operated: they lent money to investment banks like Lehman Brothers so that they could buy more financial waste products stuffed with subprime mortgages that these traditional banks were, in turn, trying to sell. They then backed up those toxic financial products through insurance companies like AIG, which came close to collapse when what it was insuring became too toxically overwhelming to afford.  AIG then got a $182 billion government bailout that also had the effect of bailing out those traditional banks (including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which became “traditional” during the crisis). In this way, the whole vicious cycle started with the traditional banks that hold your deposits and at the same time could produce and sell those waste products thanks to the repeal of Glass-Steagall. So yes, the loss of that act caused the crisis and, in its wake, every big traditional bank was fined for crisis-related crimes. Hillary won’t push to bring back Glass-Steagall. Doing so would dismantle her husband’s legacy and that of the men he and she appointed to public office. Whatever cosmetic alterations may be in store, count on that act remaining an artifact of the past, since its resurrection would dismay the bankers who, over the past three decades, made the Clintons what they are. No wonder many diehard Sanders supporters remain disillusioned and skeptical -- not to speak of the fact that their candidate featured dead last (39th) on a list of recommended vice presidential candidates in the Podesta emails. That's unfortunately how much his agenda is likely to matter to her in the Oval Office. Go Regulate Yourselves! Before he resigned with his nine-figure golden parachute, Wells Fargo CEO and Chairman John Stumpf addressed Congress over disclosures that 5,300 of his employees had created two million fake accounts, scamming $2.4 million from existing customers. The bank was fined $185 million for that (out of a total $10 billion in fines for a range of other crimes committed before and during the financial crisis). In response, Hillary wrote a letter to Wells Fargo’s customers. In it, she didn’t actually mention Stumpf by name, as she has not mentioned any Wall Street CEO by name in the context of criminal activity. Instead, she simply spoke of “he.”  As she put it, “He owes all of you a clear explanation as to how this happened under his watch.” She added, “Executives should be held individually accountable when rampant illegal activity happens on their watch.” She does have a plan to fine banks for being too big, but they’ve already been fined repeatedly for being crooked and it hasn’t made them any smaller or less threatening.  As their top officials evidently view the matter, paying up for breaking the law is just another cost of doing business. Hillary also wrote, “If any bank can’t be managed effectively, it should be broken up.” But the question is: Why doesn’t ongoing criminal activity that threatens the rest of us correlate with ineffective management -- or put another way, when was the last time you saw a major bank broken up? And don’t hold your breath for that to happen in a new Clinton administration either. In her public letter, she added, “I’ll appoint regulators who will stand with taxpayers and consumers, not with big banks and their friends in Congress.”  On the other hand, at that same Goldman Sachs symposium, while in fundraising mode, she gave bankers a pass relative to regulators and commented: “Well, I represented all of you for eight years. I had great relations and worked so close together after 9/11 to rebuild downtown, and [I have] a lot of respect for the work you do and the people who do it.” She has steadfastly worked to craft explanations for the financial crisis and the Great Recession that don’t endanger the banks as we presently know them. In addition, she has supported the idea of appointing insider regulators, insisting that “the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.” (Let’s not forget that former Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Hank Paulson ran the Treasury Department while the crisis brewed.)  Among the emails sent to John Podesta that were posted by WikiLeaks is an article I wrote for TomDispatchon the Clintons' relationships with bankers.  “She will not point fingers at her friends," I said in that piece in May 2015. She will not chastise the people who pay her hundreds of thousands of dollars a pop to speak or the ones who have long shared the social circles in which she and her husband move.” I also suggested that she wouldn't call out any CEO by name. To this day she hasn’t. I said that she would never be an advocate for Glass-Steagall. And she hasn’t been. What was true then will be no less true once she’s in the White House and no longer has to make gestures toward the platform on which Bernie ran and so can once again more openly embrace the bankers’ way of conducting business. There’s a reason Wall Street has a crush on her and its monarchs like Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Lloyd Blankfein pay her such stunning sums to offer anodyne remarks to their employees and others. Blankfein has been coy about an official Clinton endorsement simply because he doesn’t want to rock her campaign boat, but make no mistake, this Wall Street kingpin’s silence is tantamount to an endorsement. To date, $10 trillion worth of assets sits on the books of the Big Six banks. Since 2008, these same banks have copped to more than $150 billion in fines for pre-crisis behavior that ranged on the spectrum of criminality from manipulating multiple public markets to outright fraud. Hillary Clinton has arguably taken money that would not have been so available if it weren’t for the ill-gotten gains those banks secured. In her usual measured way, albeit with some light admonishments, she has told them what they want to hear: that if they behave -- something that in her dictionary of definitions involves little in the way of personalized pain or punishment -- so will she. So let’s recap Hillary’s America, past, present, and future. It’s a land lacking in meaningful structural reform of the financial system, a place where the big banks have been, and will continue to be, coddled by the government. No CEO will be jailed, no matter how large the fines his bank is saddled with or how widespread the crimes it committed.  Instead, he’s likely to be invited to the inaugural ball in January. Because its practices have not been adequately controlled or curtailed, the inherent risk that Wall Street poses for Main Street will only grow as bankers continue to use our money to make their bets. (The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act was supposed to help on this score, but has yet to make the big banks any smaller.) And here’s an obvious corollary to all this: the next bank-instigated economic catastrophe will not be dealt with until it has once again crushed the financial stability of millions of Americans. The banks have voted with their dollars on all of this in multiple ways. Hillary won’t do anything to upset that applecart. We should have no illusions about what her presidency would mean from a Wall Street vs. Main Street perspective. Certainly, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon doesn't. He effectively endorsed Hillary before a crowd of financial industry players, saying, "I hope the next president, she reaches across the aisle." For Wall Street, of course, that aisle is essentially illusory, since its players operate so easily and effectively on both sides of it. In Hillary’s America, Wall Street will still own Main Street.
