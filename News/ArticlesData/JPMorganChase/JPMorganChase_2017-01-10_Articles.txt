(Mark Blinch/Reuters) January 11 BANKS Biggest fourth-quarter trading haul expected Wall Street firms are expected to post the biggest fourth-quarter trading haul since the financial crisis as the U.S. election triggered a frenzy of global markets activity. Fixed-income and stock-trading revenue at the five biggest U.S. investment banks rose 20 percent from a year earlier to $17.3 billion, fueled by a 32 percent surge in bond trading, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The rebound probably will be strongest at Morgan Stanley, the group’s smallest bond shop, with revenue projected to climb 82 percent to $1 billion. The question analysts have for bank executives is whether the fourth quarter heralds a return for bond trading — traditionally the biggest driver of Wall Street profits — or a false dawn created by President-elect Donald Trump’s surprise victory in November. The election upended expectations for interest rates, economic growth and financial regulation, factors that support higher trading volumes if Trump realizes his economic goals. Investors will need reason to believe further gains are possible, given that the KBW Bank Index climbed 23 percent since the Nov. 8 election. “We need to hear from management” on how much potential upside there is for profits in trading and other areas, including lending, said Fred Cannon, head of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, especially on “the sustainability of trading increases.” (Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post) Driven by higher trading results, particularly on rates and currencies desks, banks’ total fourth-quarter profit is expected to rise 17 percent to $20.7 billion. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase are scheduled to post results on Friday. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs will report next week. The election boosted stock-trading volumes as institutional investors snatched up shares of financial firms and smaller companies. Banks are expected to post $6.39 billion in equities-trading revenue, 4 percent more than the previous year, driven by gains at JPMorgan and Citigroup. The coming year could be the first since 2012 that both trading and dealmaking revenue increases, Barclays analysts, led by Jason Goldberg, wrote in a note this month. Fixed-income trading will expand as companies reprice debt and big U.S. banks gain market share from European firms. Investment banks’ fee-generating businesses will be boosted as mega-mergers are completed and stock sales pick up following a lull, the analysts predicted. One note of caution is coming from the banks themselves. Morgan Stanley President Colm Kelleher said he’s seen “over-exuberance” about how well trading desks were doing. While the first quarter is typically the strongest for traders, in 2016 it was unusually weak as uncertainty over global growth roiled markets. “If you look at underlying flows, yes, they’ve picked up, particularly since the election, but the overall fee pool that relates to fixed income and equities is only marginally up on the year,” Kelleher said in a Bloomberg Television interview last month. — Bloomberg AUTO industry Carmakers see no end to boom in sales 2017 has been tabbed in Detroit as the year that will mark the end to a nearly decade-long boom in U.S. auto sales. And maybe it will. But there’s little sign of that right now. One after another this week, the world’s biggest carmakers signaled that they don’t see an end to their prosperity anytime soon. General Motors on Tuesday projected another year of profit growth and heaped a $5 billion share buyback plan on top of the $9 billion it started repurchasing in 2015. Hours later, Ford Motor added $200 million cash to its regular first-quarter dividend. Japanese and German carmakers also joined the hometown players at this week’s Detroit auto show in expressing optimism. Nissan Motor — just two months after calling a U.S. market peak — now sees an even better 2017 after the election of Trump and the rise in consumer confidence that’s followed. BMW AG pointed to the good times rolling on Wall Street as one reason luxury vehicle sales will be sustained. The optimism is translating into returns for shareholders. U.S. automakers and suppliers have outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since the beginning of the year, with gains of 7.2 percent at GM and 5.9 percent at Ford. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, benefiting from a bet on shifting its lineup almost exclusively to light trucks, has surged 19 percent in part on speculation that it’s more likely to get a pass from a loosening of environmental regulations under Trump. — Bloomberg Also in Business ● United Airlines plans to fly its last Boeing 747 jumbo jet late this year, retiring its largest airplanes a year ahead of schedule as the iconic aircraft glides into the sunset. The decision marks the end of an era for U.S. airlines, which have relied on the humpbacked 747 to bring jet travel to a mass consumer market since the plane debuted in 1970. United flew its first jumbo between California and Hawaii that year. — Bloomberg Coming Today ● 8:30 a.m.: Labor Department releases weekly jobless claims ● 10 a.m.: Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, releases weekly mortgage rates ● 2 p.m.: Treasury releases federal budget for December ● Earnings: Delta Air Lines business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

"There's been a lot of optimism in capital markets." Sinegal also said the Fed's December rate increase and the rise in government bond yields in recent months will act as additional tailwinds for the bank.  If you liked this article you might like Trifecta Stocks: Now It Gets Really Interesting Earnings season heats up next week as Donald Trump is sworn in as president.

This money comes from a grant, funded by JP Morgan Chase & Co. The U.S. economy is projected to produce millions of high-skill, well-paying jobs over the next decade, but more and more kids are graduating from high school unprepared for college or a career. So JP Morgan Chase is pumping $20 million dollars in to ten states to change that. Oklahoma is one of those states. State Superintendent Joy Hofmeister says Oklahoma will use this money to implement individualized academic plans for kids, and increase the number of high school students concurrently earning college credit or career certifications. "This will enable families to engage early with their own student’s academic strengths, needs and aspirations for the careers and jobs of the future and will equip schools to support that work." As a recipient of the grant, the state Department of Education is tasked with bringing business and government leaders together to achieve these goals. More details on the grant can be found here.

That depends on how you measure value. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 11, 2017 at 2:03PM Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. If you're a current or prospective investor in JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), one of the questions you should be wrestling with right now is whether its shares are cheap or expensive. The answer to that question, in my opinion, is: It depends. JPMorgan Chase vs. other bank stocks Let's start by comparing JPMorgan Chase's valuation to other big bank stocks. This will give us a sense for whether the nation's biggest bank by assets is an outlier in its own industry. It's not. JPMorgan's stock trades for a 68% premium to the bank's tangible book value per share, the preferred valuation metric used by analysts and commentators. The average big bank stock, by contrast, trades for a 102% premium to tangible book value, according to YCharts.com. Based on this, it looks like JPMorgan's stock is reasonably priced, if not cheap. Data source: JPMorgan Chase, YCharts.com. Chart by author. You can make a similar argument about JPMorgan Chase's valuation on an absolute level. In normal times, bank stocks tend to trade for between one and two times tangible book value. When the economy is struggling, they'll go for even less, oftentimes for a discount to tangible book value. When the economy is soaring, alternatively, shares of good banks will often trade for more than twice their tangible book value. Right now, the economy is doing neither. The unemployment rate is low, at 4.6%, but that's in large part because discouraged workers have stopped looking for jobs, which excludes them from factoring into the unemployment rate. GDP growth is decent but far from extraordinary -- 3.5% in the third quarter of last year, though only 1.4% in the second quarter. And while the economy seems to have escaped the deflationary fears from 2015, inflation remains meaningfully below the Federal Reserve's 2% target rate. Given this, it seems safe to say that JPMorgan Chase's stock is, once again, neither overtly cheap or expensive. A 68% premium to tangible book value certainly isn't low, but it's also not as high as it might otherwise be given how well-run JPMorgan Chase is.  JPMorgan Chase vs. other large-cap stocks Looking at this another way, though, could change your perspective. If you look at JPMorgan's price-to-earnings ratio, which is the standard valuation metric used for most stocks, banks being the main exception, then it comes across as materially discounted. Based on its projected earnings over the next 12 months, JPMorgan's stock trades for 15 times earnings. That's a quarter less than the average stock on the S&P 500, which trades for 19 times forward earnings, according to The Wall Street Journal. Data source: YCharts.com, The Wall Street Journal. Chart by author. Consequently, any reasonable answer to the question of whether JPMorgan's stock is cheap or expensive is: It depends on how you're measuring value. If you measure it as a multiple to tangible book value, then its shares seem reasonably priced. But if you measure it as a multiple to earnings, then its shares seem cheap. The fundamentals Either way, it's important to keep in mind that this is a comfortably profitable bank -- and consistently so, which wan't easy over the past decade. Today, even though it's the biggest bank in America, and thereby subject to the toughest capital requirements of any bank, it's still able to generate a 13% return on tangible common equity. That's well above its cost of capital, which means it's creating value for shareholders. On top of this, it's got the second-best banker alive today at the helm -- the best being M&T Bank's Robert Wilmers. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is truly an extraordinary banker. Totally befitting of the venerable JPMorgan brand. He reminds me of the two bankers that led the bank after the Morgan's relinquished control, both of whom were extraordinary bankers themselves. Warren Buffett praises Dimon frequently, most recently calling a 2015 interview of Dimon "off the charts." In light of these two points, it's clear that JPMorgan Chase deserves a premium to its tangible book value. Its current premium of 68% over tangible book isn't cheap by any means, being well above tangible book value, but it's also not expensive, being comfortably below two times tangible book value. To me, it thus seems reasonably priced for a long-term investor -- though, I would personally wait to buy shares until the next market correction.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States JPMorgan Makes Big Changes to US Analyst Focus List for January By Lee Jackson January 11, 2017 9:35 am EST Print Email Tweet That sure didn’t take long. And it probably should come as no surprise that many of the top firms we cover here at 24/7 Wall St. are already tweaking their high conviction stock lists for 2017. They are trying to take into account macro changes that could make a difference this year, such as higher inflation, a stronger dollar and rising interest rates. They are also trying to factor in positives like lower nominal tax rates and less of the ever burdensome regulations that some feel have stifled business. So JPMorgan has made changes to its U.S. Analyst Focus List for January, and some of the additions have solid upside potential. Each month, the firm asks its equity analysts for one to three of their best stock picks targeted to five different investment strategies: near term, growth, income, value and short ideas. Some 16 companies are added this month, while 14 are removed. Here we focused on five that look to have outstanding upside potential. All are rated Overweight at JPMorgan. Alexion Pharmaceuticals Rumors have flown for some time that this may be a potential acquisition target. Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ALXN) develops and commercializes life-transforming therapeutic products. It offers Soliris (eculizumab), a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a genetic blood disorder, and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, a genetic disease. It also provides Strensiq (asfotase alfa), a targeted enzyme replacement therapy for patients with hypophosphatasia, and Kanuma (sebelipase alfa) for the treatment of patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. The company conducts Phase 4 clinical trials on Soliris for the treatment of PNH registry; Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of myasthenia gravis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, and delayed kidney transplant graft function; and Phase 2 clinical trials for antibody mediated rejection in presensitized renal transplant patients. The JPMorgan price target for the stock is $170. The Wall Street consensus target is $169.41. Shares closed on Tuesday at $143.67. Eli Lilly This stock also has substantial upside potential. Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY) is a global health care company with numerous core products in a number of primary-care pharmaceutical markets. The company generates revenues from its pharmaceutical product and animal health segments. The product portfolio includes Zyprexa (for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), Gemzar (pancreatic cancer), Evista (osteoporosis), Cymbalta (depression), Cialis (erectile dysfunction), Strattera (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), Erbitux (cancer) and Alimta (chemotherapy). Eli Lilly also has a strong presence in the diabetes market. The company posted third-quarter sales and earnings well below Wall Street’s expectations, prompting shares to plummet to a four-month low before rebounding. The stock is down almost 10% on the year and offering investors an outstanding entry point. Top analysts on Wall Street are still very focused on the company’s outstanding late-stage product pipeline, which they and others on Wall Street view as very undervalued. Recently the company announced a disappointing Phase 3 trial for its Alzheimer’s drug solanezumab, which missed the primary and secondary endpoints. While the analysts are forced to remove potential earnings from their model due to the failure, most remain positive on the stock based on “Underappreciated growth, driven by the diabetes base business, baricitinib and abemaciclib.” Shareholders receive a 2.75% dividend. JPMorgan has an $85 price objective, and the consensus target is $84.80. Shares closed Tuesday at $76.27.

(NYSE: JPM) shares are trading higher by $0.10 at $86.53 in Wednesday's session. Ahead of its Q4 earnings report, UBS has initiated coverage with a Buy rating and a $98.00 price target. Following its post-election rally, from its November 8 close to its closing high for the move on January 3 at $87.23, the issue has been in a trading range. Since December 20, the trading range has been defined by its December 29 low ($85.04) and its high for move on January 3 (S87.76). It should be noted the issue has made multiple highs in the $87 handle, but hasn't closed above $87.00 since posting its high close for the move. After a flat open, it had a brief decline which found support just ahead of Tuesday's low ($85.72), only reaching $85.91. So far, the ensuing rally has come up shy of Tuesday's high ($85.90), as $85.75 stands as the current high. Posted-In: Technicals Intraday Update Movers Trading Ideas © 2017 Benzinga.com.

Developed as part of JPMorgan Chase’s $75 million global New Skills for Youth initiative, each winning state will work with government, business and education leaders to strengthen career education and create pathways to economic success. Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Wisconsin will each receive $2 million over three years to expand and improve career pathways for all high school students. An independent advisory committee recommended the states to receive grants from the New Skills for Youth initiative after a rigorous review process. These 10 states demonstrated the strongest plans to work across sectors to transform how they design and develop career preparedness education programs and provide young people with the skills they need to compete for high-skill, well-paying jobs. They have also committed to bring together education leaders, business partners and community partners to set ambitious benchmarks for achieving these goals. “The number of young people who graduate from high school without the necessary skills to compete is one of the greatest moral and economic inequities of our time,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase. “These investments will help states build career education programs that align with the needs of growing industries and give young people a chance to succeed.” “These states are leading the way to improve career pathways for all kids through partnerships with communities, higher education and leaders in industry,” said CCSSO Executive Director Chris Minnich. “I applaud their efforts and look forward to working with these grantees and other states across the country as they continue to strengthen career preparation for kids.” “Providing opportunities for all students to participate in high-quality career readiness programs is critical to their future success and the future of our country,” said Advance CTE Executive Director Kimberly Green. “I am thrilled at the progress made by these states and excited at the prospects this initiative offers for all learners and all states.” Too many students leave high school without being prepared for college or a career. Nationwide, the unemployment rate for young people ages 16-24 is 9.3 percent, with many more working only part-time or in low-wage jobs with little opportunity to advance. At the same time, the U.S. economy is projected to produce millions of well-paying jobs over the next decade, about two-thirds of which will require some post-secondary education but not necessarily a four-year college degree. For all states, this is an opportunity to work across sectors and pull together stakeholders in business, industry, higher education and within communities to research what has worked and what career pathways are most needed for kids in their state. These state grants are one part of the $75 million, five-year New Skills for Youth initiative developed by JPMorgan Chase, in collaboration with CCSSO, Advance CTE and Education Strategy Group, aimed at strengthening career-focused education starting in high school and ending with postsecondary degrees or credentials aligned with high-skill jobs. In recent years, more than 40 states have committed to transforming career education for all students. In March 2016, JPMorgan Chase and CCSSO awarded $100,000 grants to 24 states and the District of Columbia for planning and early implementation of long-term career readiness education programs that align with the needs of area employers. These states received targeted coaching and support to begin implementing these programs over the past year. The grants awarded today represent the second phase of the New Skills for Youth initiative. All of today’s recipients were selected from the original 24 state grantees. These states will now leverage this additional grant funding to execute the career readiness-plans they developed during phase one of the initiative. Delaware Governor Jack Markell: “In Delaware this year, nearly 6,000 students in 38 of 44 public high schools are enrolled in state-model pathway programs aligned to areas of high demand in Delaware’s economy. This grant will support initiatives like this that are critical to preparing all students for success after high school. In the process, we will come closer to achieving our Delaware Promise, which is that by 2025 the percentage of Delawareans with a college degree or professional certificate will match the percentage of our jobs that will require one – 65 percent.” Delaware Secretary of Education Steven Godowsky: “By earning industry-recognized credentials and college credits while in high school, our students graduate prepared for success. This grant supports the alignment of our education and workforce systems through the Delaware Pathways initiative.” Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin: “If we are to achieve our goal of making Kentucky the hub of excellence in engineering and manufacturing in America, we must work diligently to be more economically competitive. Ensuring we have the most highly skilled and well trained workforce is critical to this effort. The current shortage of skilled workers, makes it difficult for Kentucky employers to create and expand their businesses. This grant will ensure career and technical education is better aligned with the needs of employers and business leaders. This, in turn, will bring about increased economic prosperity for both current and future generations of Kentuckians.” Kentucky Commissioner of Education Stephen Pruitt: “We are excited to expand educational and economic opportunities for young people across Kentucky. The initial New Skills for Youth grant allowed us to really take stock of the career pathways we were offering to ensure students receive the skills, knowledge and credentials they need to compete for the hot jobs of the future. This second phase grant will allow us to dramatically increase opportunities for Kentucky students to complete rigorous and relevant Career and Technical Education programs and earn industry-recognized credentials that will prepare them for postsecondary success and high-skill, high-demand jobs in our state.” Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards: “This New Skills for Youth grant will provide tremendous support for our state’s high school teachers and students in accessing high-quality workforce training, particularly in rural school districts and in support of our students with disabilities. I’m confident that Louisiana’s team of state and local education, economic development and workforce partners will make excellent use of these funds to dramatically improve the number of our young citizens prepared for college, career and life success. This grant funding will advance our state’s efforts to create a seamless system of career and technical education from secondary through post-secondary education, focusing on those industry sectors essential to Louisiana’s prosperity.” Louisiana Superintendent of Education John White: “The Louisiana Department of Education looks forward to utilizing the New Skills for Youth grant to expand Jump Start, the state’s premier career and technical education program. These additional funds will allow the state to build upon that program’s strong foundation by further increasing the opportunities and resources that enable our students to earn the credentials needed to attain employment in Louisiana’s most promising industries.” Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker: “Our administration has focused on aligning our K-12 schools and higher education system with the needs of our workforce so that our students, employers, and communities will share a stronger future. Lieutenant Governor Polito and I are honored that Massachusetts and the potential of our students will be recognized through this grant.” Massachusetts Elementary and Secondary Education CommissionerMitchell Chester: “I am thrilled that Massachusetts students will be among the beneficiaries of this generous grant. I look forward to continuing our collaboration with educators and industry to set students on a clear path toward their own career goals.” Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval: “Nevada was hit harder than any state in the nation by the Great Recession. That’s why my strategic priorities when I took office were to build a vibrant and sustainable economy in addition to ensuring we have an educated and healthy citizenry. The New Skills for Youth grant is another wonderful resource that will help Nevada refocus and transform its economy.” Nevada Superintendent of Public Instruction Steve Canavero: “The New Skills for Youth grant will provide additional support to Nevada and ensure our students gain the skills necessary to compete for jobs in the emerging new Nevada economy. It ensures that our education system and other agencies across the state are aligned with the demands of industry and by working together there will be an increase in the number of students completing relevant and effective career pathways in high demand and high skill areas.” Ohio Governor John Kasich: “Getting kids excited about job opportunities can begin to capture their imagination. By connecting employers with qualified workers, we’re changing the lives of our students and strengthening Ohio’s economy.” Ohio Superintendent of Public Instruction Paolo DeMaria: “In Ohio, we want every student to see a connection between what they are learning and future career options. Ohio’s Governor John Kasich observed that, ‘Getting kids excited about what the job opportunities are, when presented in an exciting way, can begin to capture their imagination.’ The New Skills for Youth grant will drive a comprehensive and strategic approach to excite and inspire every student about career opportunities and students’ future success. Ohio’s strong business and education partnership will have a tremendous new opportunity to expand the rich array of career-focused assets resulting in a deep impact on individual lives and the prosperity of our state.” Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin: “A postsecondary degree, credential or certificate is the new minimum for success in the workforce. The New Skills for Youth Grant builds on my Oklahoma Works Initiative to align education to the needs of the workforce. Through increased cooperation between business and education stakeholders, the grant will put students on a pathway to provide Oklahoma’s employers with a future-ready workforce.” Oklahoma Superintendent of Public Instruction Joy Hofmeister: “As Oklahoma continues to recover from a recession, the $2 million in funding over three years will help us fast-track college- and career-readiness initiatives including redefining the senior year, securing braided funding and creating a career advising toolkit for Oklahoma students. We are grateful to be partnering with the Governor’s Council for Workforce and Economic Development, the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, the business community and school districts around the state on this work that is so critical to our students’ success and future economic development in our state.” Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo: “Rhode Island’s New Skills for Youth grant is intended to turn our bold vision for improving career readiness in K-12 education into a reality. We are honored to have been recognized for our vision to prepare Rhode Island students for good-paying jobs in our state’s leading industries. By creating pathways between our existing K-12, higher education and workforce development systems, we will meet the needs of our existing employers while also providing jobs that pay for Rhode Islanders.” Rhode Island Education Commissioner Ken Wagner: “We’re committed to offering students opportunities that will strengthen their educational foundation, including early college offerings, career-and-technical education programs aligned to industry standards, and hands-on learning experiences that will prepare them for success in the workforce of tomorrow. This grant affords a wonderful opportunity for us to accelerate our work and link high-quality programs to students that will have lasting benefits for our region and state.” Tennessee Education Commissioner Candice McQueen: “Our work in K-12 education is to prepare students for success beyond our classrooms, and Tennessee is fully committed to strengthening postsecondary and workforce readiness for all students. Funding from this grant will allow us to expand opportunities for students to access early postsecondary opportunities that can equip them for jobs and open doors for them as they graduate from high school, particularly in rural or economically distressed areas and in expanding industries. The grant will also better equip our state to invest more in research and analysis to ensure we are learning from what works and using evidence-based practices to drive students’ success.” Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker: “As we move forward, one of things we want to focus on is ensuring the next generation of Wisconsin workers possess the practical skills and knowledge they need to thrive in their careers. The New Skills for Youth grant helps jump start this process by helping students think about, plan for, and implement a strategy to reach their career goals at an early age. Thanks to the Council of Chief State School Officers and JPMorgan Chase & Co for this opportunity.” Wisconsin Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers: “One of my biggest priorities for Wisconsin schools is connecting educational experiences to the workplace. This grant gives us a chance to bring our education partners together with private businesses to build a structure that will benefit kids in whatever profession they choose. I want to thank JPMorgan Chase and our Wisconsin partners for their work to make this a reality.” Through several targeted philanthropic initiatives, JPMorgan Chase is investing over $325 million in skills development around the world. In addition to the New Skills for Youth initiative, these investments include a separate five-year, $250 million global initiative called New Skills at Work to help fill the skills gap for employers and simultaneously provide adult workers with a real and tangible pathway to economic opportunity, as well as a $5.8 million effort to support summer youth employment programs for youth around the country. New Skills for Youth also builds on CCSSO’s Career Readiness Initiative, which is guided by the recommendations made in Opportunities and Options, a report of CCSSO’s Career Readiness Task Force. The goal is to ensure that all students are not only college-ready, but also graduate from high school prepared for careers in high-skill, high-demand fields.

Home World news Trump rally makes stock options great again for some CEOs Trump rally makes stock options great again for some CEOs Trump's proposed policies for lower taxes, less Wall Street regulation and more infrastructure spending have energized the U.S. stock market since the real estate magnate's Nov. 8 victory. By: Reuters | Boston | Published: January 11, 2017 2:19 PM Donald Trump. (Reuters) Donald Trump once described Jamie Dimon as “the worst banker in the United States,” but the president-elect has helped make the boss of JPMorgan Chase & Co $50 million richer. Dimon is the top beneficiary among the 30 chief executives who run companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index from a stock rally inspired by Trump’s election, according to a Reuters analysis of their option grants. Trump’s proposed policies for lower taxes, less Wall Street regulation and more infrastructure spending have energized the U.S. stock market since the real estate magnate’s Nov. 8 victory. The post-election rally even resurrected the value of an option award held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein that was worthless on the eve of the election. Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has seen his stock options surge in value by more than $50 million to $146 million since the Republican candidate’s White House win.Trump criticized Dimon in 2013 for reaching a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government over the sale of toxic mortgages instead of fighting the case. Nevertheless, he appointed Dimon to the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of high-profile business leaders he set up last month to advise him on economic growth and job creation. Dimon declined to comment on Trump’s criticism or the rise in value of his holdings. You may also like to watch this video: JACKPOT Stock options held by Dow 30 CEOs surged in value by 23 percent to about $1 billion in 2016, with most of the gain coming after Trump’s election win. The figures reflect outstanding stock options that could be exercised at the end of 2015. Options that expired or vested in 2016 were excluded from the analysis. In a few cases, CEOs exercised some of those options during 2016, U.S. regulatory filings show. Visa Inc CEO Charles Scharf did not need a Trump-led stock rally to hit the jackpot. About two weeks before the election, he exercised nearly 800,000 options for gross proceeds of almost $33 million, U.S. regulatory filings show. He resigned from Visa effective Dec. 1. For a look at how the post-election rally has affected Dow 30 stock options, click here (http://tmsnrt.rs/2iCbvvT) Trump campaigned on the slogan “Make America Great Again,” vowing to bolster the prospects of the American working class by preventing jobs from moving abroad, restricting immigration and renegotiating trade pacts. In 2015, Trump called high salaries paid to CEOs a “joke” and a “disgrace” and said these were often approved by company boards stacked with CEOs’ friends. PRO-BUSINESS AGENDA To be sure, Trump’s election has helped investors big and small. Hopes of a pro-business agenda have driven the Dow 30 close to 20,000 – a level it has never breached – in a boon for workers’ retirement plans.”With the recent Trump/Republican win, it appears that investors are getting more excited about potential growth and animal spirits are on the rise,” top investment strategists at Morgan Stanley said this month in a wealth management report. “This is likely to lead to the final euphoric stage of this cyclical bull market which could be quite powerful in 2017’s first half.” Big stock option gains for Goldman Sachs head Blankfein, American Express Co CEO Kenneth Chenault and JP Morgan’s Dimon may be a surprise, given that their companies have reduced or even eliminated option grants in recent years in favor of stock awards tied to hitting financial targets. Blankfein’s 322,104 outstanding options, granted in 2007 with a $204.16 strike price, were under water by $7.3 million on the eve of the presidential election. But by the end of 2016, their value had soared to $11.4 million. That was an $18.7 million swing, thanks to the Trump-inspired stock market rally and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to increase interest rates, a boost for banks and credit card companies. Blankfein declined to comment. Alan Johnson, managing director of pay consulting firm Johnson Associates in New York, said the big gains for the leaders of American Express, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan reflect how stock option compensation can magnify gains in a company’s share price.”When the stock goes up, with options, you get more leverage,” he said. MEDIOCRE PERFORMANCE Critics of stock options say the grants can produce large amounts of wealth for CEOs even with mediocre performance. One reason is that grants often are not linked to any financial performance metric, such as return on equity. And so as the United States nears the eighth year of a bull market, options can increase in value even if the CEOs are running companies whose share price has lagged broad benchmarks during their tenure. For example, shares of Caterpillar Inc rose 54 percent during Douglas Oberhelman’s tenure as CEO of the big equipment maker from mid-2010 to the end of 2016, while the Dow 30 more than doubled during that span. But the value of Oberhelman’s options rallied during his last year as CEO, climbing to $20.3 million after being under water by nearly $9 million at the start of 2016. The options’ value got a $10.6 million booster shot after Trump’s victory. Caterpillar shares rose 36 percent in 2016, making it one of the best performing stocks on the Dow. Trump has said he would use Caterpillar tractors to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Caterpillar and Oberhelman declined to comment. Not all CEOs have been winners, however. Coca-Cola Co CEO Muhtar Kent, who contributed $2,700 to Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic rival for president, saw the value of his options decline by $11.3 million to $143 million. Coca-Cola shares are off 3 percent since Trump was elected amid lingering concerns about consumers cutting their consumption of sugary drinks. A Coca-Cola spokesman declined to comment.

The regulation is likely to add to analysts' concern about moves to strike back over unfavourable investment commentary after Indonesia punished the U.S. bank for its downgrade of the country's stocks in November. Primary dealers "have the duty to safeguard the partnership with the Indonesian government based on professionalism, integrity, the avoidance of conflict of interest, and looking at the interests of the Republic of Indonesia," according to documents uploaded to the ministry's website on Wednesday. The documents, dated Dec. 30, said the finance minister can revoke the appointment of a primary dealer if it does not fulfill the stated conditions. The finance minister also has the authority to accept or reject an application to be a primary dealer by taking into consideration the track record of the bank or securities firm, including its working experience with the ministry. A primary dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov. 25. Foreigners hold more than 37 percent of Indonesia's government bonds. The local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for Southeast Asia's biggest economy. The Finance Ministry dropped the JPMorgan's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. Suahasil Nazara, the head of the ministry's fiscal policy office, on Jan. 4 defended the penalising of JPMorgan, saying its research was "not credible and not objective".

But Goldman (ticker: GS), remains, as before the crisis, the largest pure investment bank and institutional broker in the business, serving big companies and asset managers in raising capital and moving it around the world. Sure, the company hurriedly filed paperwork in late 2008, along with Morgan Stanley, to convert to a bank holding company. But this was a change in legal status, meant simply to enable possible help from the Federal Reserve, not an alteration of Goldman's business endeavors, which remain more lucrative than most others in the financial-services industry. Enlarge Image Close Rob Bennett/Redux WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE before the generational asset-value collapse of 2008 is the market's perception of Goldman, and the way it has been converted into the valuation of the company's shares. In the boom years, encompassing 2006, when Barron's last took a close look at Goldman in an admiring cover story ("Minting Money: The Goldman Sachs Way," April 10, 2006), the company was viewed as a can't-miss money machine, and slandered as a hedge fund in investment-banking disguise, for its tendency to win the greatest spoils in a spoiled era. Its shares traded at a heady premium to the broader financial sector, and routinely fetched more than 2.5 times tangible book value. Today, in contrast, Goldman is viewed as an exemplar of Wall Street's hamstrung, postcrisis fate: forced to carry more inert capital, unable to trade as much for its own book, embarrassed by criticism of some past sales practices, hampered by lethargic trading and merger volumes, and tangled in a regulatory regime whose only certainty is that it will be more onerous than what came before. The shares, which closed Friday at $113.68, are well off their 2007 peak of $248, and below tangible book value of $126. Granted, all major bank stocks trade below book, and none would be immune to another financial scare. But the negative perception of Goldman is far more dour than the reality justifies. The company maintains an abiding leadership position in most of its activities, and is financially sturdier and less burdened by irrational competition than it was a half-decade ago. Based on the likely outlook for capital-markets activity and Goldman's ability to continue growing its book value, it is easy to conclude that the shares could rise at least 25% within a year. Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA known for his apt skepticism toward many bank strategies and stocks, recently upgraded Goldman's shares to Buy, with an upside target of $142. He argues that the company is less financially risky than it had been when its stock was much higher, and that it remains "one of the more adept financial firms at dynamically allocating capital." Enlarge Image Close CEO Lloyd Blankfein (left) and heir-apparent, President Gary Cohn, are revered risk managers. Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg News (left), Simon Dawson/Bloomberg News Goldman has been building its capital cushion carefully, while buying back as much stock as is prudent, and maintaining its leading role in advising companies on mergers and in helping them raise capital. As of June 30, its "global core excess"—the trove of equity capital and cash-like instruments that is the foundation of its balance sheet—hit $175 billion, up from $111 billion at the end of 2008. Total balance-sheet assets are down to $950 billion from $1.1 trillion, and leverage—the ratio of assets to equity capital—is now 13 times, versus a peak around 26. Goldman is better capitalized than most large peers, and well on its way to meeting the global Basel III capital standards that take effect in 2019. While most banks issued large amounts of stock and slashed their dividends in the crisis, Goldman has bought in 7% of its shares since the end of 2009 and continues to buy its stock below tangible book value. It never cut its dividend, currently at $1.84 a share. The stock yields 1.6%. KEEPING ALL THAT CAPITAL ON HAND has punished profitability. Return on equity, the key measure of a securities firm's earnings, has hovered in the high single digits for the past year and a half. On some level, this represents a decision by management to "under-earn" for a time as regulatory rules and market conditions sort themselves out, while simultaneously taking costs out of the firm. Goldman is in the midst of a $500 million expense-reduction program on top of $1.4 billion last year, relying in part on relocating support functions to lower-cost venues, such as Salt Lake City and Dallas. Enlarge Image Close Says Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura Securities in New York: "Goldman has been more aggressive than most...[in] reducing head count at higher levels" to ensure both that it can make an adequate return at low activity levels and retain operating leverage in the event markets heat up. Thus, it's playing defense without sacrificing its ability to get aggressive as opportunities arise, a tack echoed by senior Goldman executives in recent conversations. The bear case on Goldman, and by extension all firms operating by the traditional rules of Wall Street economics, is that regulation, lower financial leverage, reputational damage and a long-lasting ebb in capital-market volume will prevent the firm from earning an acceptable rate of return on shareholders' capital, even as it continues to overpay teams of trading cowboys to take undue risks. Each point can be countered, at least enough to suggest that Goldman's share price currently discounts them. TO BE SURE, LOWER LEVERAGE will dampen absolute levels of profitability: The bank is expected to net $6.5 billion, or $12.55 a share, in 2013, below its precrisis peak of $11.4 billion. But not all the profits of the precrisis period owed to leverage. What's more, in this year's first quarter, in a modestly better environment for client risk-taking and deal-making, Goldman notched a 12% return on equity, respectable enough to keep book value and the stock price rising nicely if it becomes the new norm. Plus, Goldman's valuation reflects barely, if at all, the value of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, one of the world's top 10 investment firms, whose performance recently has revived, and which provides steadier revenue and earnings than the market-sensitive businesses. As for regulation, no one knows what its precise impact will be. But the Volcker Rule prohibiting proprietary trading has mostly been implemented at the firm level. And, contrary to the popular view, pure "prop" trading was never a major source of profit at Goldman and other firms. Goldman has been resolute in assuming it still will be able to post its own capital in the service of client needs for liquidity, hedging, and market positioning, which in truth has been the basis for its dominant fixed-income, currencies, and commodities business for decades. Money Machine Investment banking is Goldman's most profitable unit, followed by securities. Trading and deal volumes have been undeniably soft. Global wholesale market-related revenue across the industry, encompassing investment banking, equities, credit trading, foreign exchange, commodities, and interest-rate trading, was down 21% last year from 2006 levels, according to consultants Oliver Wyman. Discussion at many a post-close Wall Street happy hour revolves around how much of this reduced trading and deal flow is cyclical, and how much is a long-lived response to the financial crisis and an impaired financial industry. Likely, it's a bit of both. But the long-term backdrop continues to suggest that global capital flows will quicken again. McKinsey & Co. says that global financial assets totaled $219 trillion last year, with 22% overseen by professional asset managers. Capital will continue to move around in search of good returns. And emerging-market economies will produce plenty of capital-raising and conglomerate-building activity, and the long-tenured Western banks will remain in the middle of the action. All this bodes well for Goldman, among the first firms to bet on emerging-markets growth. With professionals on the ground in developing nations and financial capitals, it could see an outsized portion of the global underwriting and investing business, especially with the Swiss universal banks retrenching and Britain shortening the leash on its largest institutions. IN RISK MANAGEMENT, Goldman operates via institutionalized paranoia. Even in 2006, carefree times in the markets, outgoing CFO David Viniar, who has held the job for 13 years, would begin discussions of the firm's performance by noting his zeal for maintaining far more capital and liquidity than Goldman was likely to need. The company promotes executives known for risk management, including CEO Lloyd Blankfein and his odds-on successor, President Gary Cohn, who are both revered for such. Goldman keeps its trading inventory fresh, turning over 50% of assets every 45 days and 80% every six months, while marking nearly everything to market. The firm charges its trading desks the full cost of financing positions, and makes traders pay for the cost of insuring the liquidity they use. No investment bank can sidestep every market hazard, but Goldman has come closer to doing so than most. That's why an investor paying 90% of current tangible book value, and about 75% of what book value likely will be in a couple of years, looks like a pretty good risk manager, too.  E-mail: editors@barrons.com Email Print 0 Comments Order Reprints Facebook Share Twitter Google+ smaller Larger Latest in Barron's Cover 1.

Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup, and Chris Ashton, formerly of Barclays, were charged in an indictment filed in federal court in Manhattan with conspiring to restrain trade. The case came after JPMorgan, Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Citigroup unit pleaded guilty in May 2015 to conspiring to manipulate currency prices, agreeing at that time to pay more than $2.5 billion in criminal fines. Those plea deals contributed to the more than $10 billion some of the biggest banks in the world have agreed to pay to resolve U.S. and European probes into the manipulation of foreign exchange rates. The indictment said that from 2007 to 2013, Usher, Ramchandani and Ashton participated with other euro-dollar traders belonging to an electronic chat group called "The Cartel" to suppress competition in the foreign currency exchange spot market. Usher, JPMorgan's former chief currency trader, and Ramchandani, Citigroup's ex-head of European spot foreign exchange trading, left both banks in 2014. Ashton, Barclays' former global head of spot trading, was a trader at the British bank until 2015. All three traders were based in the United Kingdom, according to court papers and their lawyers. The U.S. charges came after the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in March said it had closed its own investigation without any individuals being charged, saying there was "insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction." Lawyers for Ramchandani and Usher in statements criticized the Justice Department's decision to bring charges after the SFO had decided not to do so. "The UK authorities looked at the matter very carefully and concluded that there were no offences, and we continue to believe that Mr. Usher has done nothing wrong," said Jonathan Pickworth, a lawyer for Usher. Stephen Pollard, a lawyer for Ramchandani, said his client had been investigated for over 18 months in the UK and was not prosecuted. "It is unacceptable for the American DoJ to by-pass the SFO decision and seek to prosecute conduct undertaken on British soil by British citizens where the British regulators have confirmed there was no criminal offense," Pollard said in a statement. A lawyer for Ashton declined to comment. To date, three other individuals have faced U.S. charges stemming from the foreign exchange probe. Last week, a former trader at Barclays and BNP Paribas SA , Jason Katz, pleaded guilty to participating in a price-fixing conspiracy, becoming the first person to admit criminal wrongdoing in the probe. In July, an HSBC Holdings Plc executive, Mark Johnson, was arrested and charged along with a former executive for participating in a fraudulent scheme involving a $3.5 billion currency transaction. Johnson has pleaded not guilty. The case is U.S. v. Usher et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-cr-19.

All three remain out of custody, the Justice Department said.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 10 January 2017 | MYT 11:44 PM S&P, Nasdaq flat; Goldman leads Dow lower At 9:40am ET (Tuesday) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 39.38 points, or 0.2%, at 19,848. The AFP photo shows traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. NEW YORK: The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were flat on Tuesday morning, while Goldman Sachs led the Dow lower, as investors await the earnings season to test if Wall Street’s record levels are justified by corporate earnings in the fourth quarter. Goldman Sachs fell 1.4% after Citigroup downgraded the stock, a move that comes ahead of reports by JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo on Friday. JPMorgan was down 0.4%, while the other two were flat. Banks have led a record-breaking run in US equities since Donald Trump’s election on Nov 8. But the rally’s momentum has stalled of late as investors now wait to see if he can deliver on his promises of fiscal stimulus. The US President-elect will hold a news conference on Wednesday, his first since his election. Wall Street’s rally has also led to soaring valuations - the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. “It’s the increasing weight of valuation in the market that maybe leading to less enthusiasm in 2017. The dollar is going to be a very important factor for the earnings season,” said Stephen Wood, chief market strategist, North America for Russell Investments. “We expect a choppy, range-bound US equity market until we get more clarity on earnings.” At 9:40am ET (1440 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 39.38 points, or 0.2%, at 19,848, the S&P 500 was down 1.42 points, or 0.06%, at 2,267.48 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.56 point, or 0.01%, at 5,532.37. The dollar index has risen 4.3% since Trump’s victory. A strong dollar crimps US companies’ revenue from overseas markets. However, S&P 500 companies overall are set to post their strongest quarterly growth in three years, with earnings estimated to have risen 5.8% in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Three of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were flat on Tuesday, while five were lower, led by a 0.6% drop in telecom services sector. A jump in healthcare stocks helped limit losses. Illumina surged 17.4% to US$166.17 and was the top boost to the S&P after the diagnostics company gave a strong quarterly forecast and launched a new product. Valeant jumped 10% following a deal to sell its Dendreon cancer business and three skincare brands for about US$2.12bil as the troubled firm looks to pay down its more than US$30bil debt. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,502 to 1,063. On the Nasdaq, 1,365 issues rose and 829 fell. The S&P 500 index showed one new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 21 new highs and three new lows. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks , Wall Street Related Stories Wall St gains as bank earnings boost confidence US stocks off to worst start in 2017 after Trump speech Banks, oil stocks weigh on Wall St, keep Dow from 20,000 Wall St flat as banks, discretionary stocks fall, tech rises Wall St opens 2017 with big gains as banks surge You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Glamorous nights with nature Tourism industry ecstatic at Penang making it into CNN Travel list Do we really need to fear China money?

The Dow's 20,000 milestone remained elusive as it was weighed down by declines in IBM (IBM.N), Merck & Co (MRK.N), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Procter & Gamble (PG.N). Traders were holding fire ahead of the upcoming corporate earnings season and the Jan. 20 inauguration after which they expect a better sense as to whether President-elect Donald Trump will fulfil campaign promises of fiscal stimulus, lower tax and lighter regulation. "Investors are now waiting for the inauguration and the first 100-day agenda," said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at brokerage Convergex in New York. "They just want a little more information about what the new administration is planning before the Dow takes the plunge over 20,000. There's a lot of high expectations about what happens after January 20." The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI ended down 31.85 points, or 0.16 percent, at 19,855.53, the S&P 500 .SPX was unchanged at 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 20.00 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,551.82. The S&P Energy sector .SPNY ended down 0.95 percent as oil futures fell 2 percent on doubts about output cuts. [O/R] Following a 9 percent jump in the S&P since Nov. 4, investors will also monitor earnings season, which starts this week, to assess if the record levels are justified. "We've shifted from that exuberance post the election and the rotation into some of the sectors and now we are entering a wait-and-see mode with earnings knocking at the front door," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets in News York. "Earnings may be the pivot to move things higher." S&P 500 companies are set to post their strongest quarterly growth in three years, with earnings estimated to have risen 5.8 percent in the fourth quarter, mainly driven by financials, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P financial sector .SPSY, which has risen 17.4 percent since the election, closed up 0.4 percent. Bank of America (BAC.N), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N) - scheduled to report results on Friday - were its biggest drivers on Tuesday with 1.7 percent, 0.7 percent and 0.3 percent rises respectively. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors ended higher. S&P Healthcare stocks .SPXHC gained 0.33 percent and the Nasdaq biotech index .NBI ended 0.8 percent higher, both enjoying their sixth session of gains in a row. Illumina (ILMN.O) surged 16.6 percent to $165.04 after the diagnostics company gave a strong quarterly forecast and launched a new product. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.90-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 18 new lows. More than 6.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Continue Reading Below A number of bank stock analysts have worked through broad tax proposals by Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump and estimate that a new tax law could increase Citigroup earnings per share only half as much as some rivals. At the same time, Citigroup may have to slash $4 billion or more of the value of an unusually large income tax asset that the bank holds as a result of losses it suffered during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. "If the U.S. cuts corporate tax rates, they will still benefit, just benefit less," said Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg. The differences between Citigroup and its competitors highlight how corporations have different interests in the details of a new tax law, such as how foreign income is treated and how bank business customers might be favored less than individuals. The blueprint for tax reform put forward by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives calls for reducing the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has proposed 15 percent. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Banks are expected to benefit more from corporate tax cuts than other industries as they tend to pay more taxes as a result of receiving fewer investment credits and deductions, such as those available for oil and gas exploration. Tax cuts could be the icing on the cake for banks as they look forward to higher profits in the coming year. They are already benefiting from higher U.S. interest rates, and lighter regulation under the Trump administration could allow Wall Street banks to re-enter risky but potentially profitable trading business.   EARNINGS LIFT The impact of a new tax law is among the topics likely to come up this Friday when JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, the three biggest U.S. banks by assets, report quarterly results. Citigroup reports the following Wednesday, Jan. 18. The New York-based bank earns about half of its profits overseas, where corporate tax rates are mostly lower than the United States, so it stands to benefit less from lower U.S. tax rates than its rivals with more domestic business, analysts said. A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment on the matter. Goldberg estimates Citigroup will get an 11 percent lift to earnings per share this year due to tax cuts, much less than the 21.4 percent gain he is projecting for JPMorgan. Citigroup executives disclosed a few days after the Nov. 8 election that the bank could have to write down the value of deferred tax assets by $4 billion to $12 billion depending on how the tax law changed and when. The tax assets would be less useful offsetting future taxes if corporate rates were lower. "There's nothing they can do other than explain it," said Fred Cannon, global director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Cannon estimates Citigroup annual earnings per share could be 9.6 percent better with tax changes, about half as much as the 18.9 percent improvement he sees for JPMorgan.   MORE MONEY FOR DIVIDENDS More profits left after taxes should make more capital available for additional dividends and share repurchases that could help lift bank stock prices. Analyst Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley said in a research note on Friday that the most pressing question she is getting from clients is how lower taxes will impact banks. Graseck has estimated that lower taxes would boost Citigroup earnings per share by 7 percent, Wells Fargo by 19 percent and JPMorgan by 22 percent. John McDonald of Bernstein Research estimates a 10 percent lift for Citigroup, compared with a 13 percent boost for JPMorgan and 19 percent for Wells Fargo. The differences in the analysts' estimates underscore how much uncertainty there is about tax reform. The estimates vary with different assumptions about the tax rate that ultimately comes out of Washington, as well as a possible shift in how foreign income is taxed and when the changes would take effect. A tax overhaul in 1986 took more than two years, Cannon noted. Cannon based his estimates on a 25 percent cut in the corporate tax rate, arguing that concerns about funding the federal budget and tax cuts for individuals will temper the corporate rate reduction proposed by Republicans and Trump. The more the rate is cut, the less Citigroup would benefit compared with competitors, generally. But the degree of its relative benefits could change, too, if congress also shifts how foreign income is taxed, which Republicans have proposed. How the final U.S. rate compares with rates in particular countries where Citigroup does more or less business than other banks would then come into play, said Cannon. "The devil is in the details," said Goldberg. "There is a lot of uncertainty how this plays out."   (Editing by Carmel Crimmins and Bill Rigby) Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

The 'best ideas' portfolio, which generally comprises 60-80 holdings, currently numbers 63. Stocks are selected on a bottom-up basis from a universe of c 1,000 companies, which constitute the Euromoney Smaller Companies ex-UK index, the trust's benchmark. Long-term performance has been strong, as evidenced by its 10- and 20-year NAV and share price returns, which comfortably outstrip the benchmark and the MSCI Europe ex-UK index. JPMorgan European Smaller Companies Trust (JESC) aims to achieve capital growth from a diversified portfolio of shares in smaller European companies (excluding the UK). Liquidity and borrowings are actively managed (investments 80-120% of net assets) with a view to enhancing returns to shareholders. As JESC's investment policy emphasises capital growth, rather than income, the dividend is expected to vary from year to year. JESC is benchmarked against the Euromoney (formerly HSBC) Smaller European Companies ex-UK total return index in sterling terms. Click here [1] to view the full report.

Indonesia has barred US bank JPMorgan Chase & Co from submitting submitting an underwriting proposal for its next issuance of dollar-denominated Islamic bonds. (Reuters) JAKARTA: Indonesia has barred US bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. from submitting an underwriting proposal for its next issuance of dollar-denominated Islamic bonds, a finance ministry official said on Monday. The government has asked other banks to submit proposals by Thursday for a planned dollar sukuk offering, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, reported on Monday. The government’s exclusion of JPMorgan comes shortly after the finance ministry said it was penalyzing the US bank following its issuance of a negative report on Indonesia in November. “The point is (JPMorgan) will no longer do business with the government,” said Suahasil Nazara, head of the ministry’s fiscal policy office, when asked if JPMorgan could make a proposal for the US dollar sukuk offering. A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment. In the report issued after Donald Trump’s election as US president, JPMorgan downgraded its Indonesian stocks recommendation to “underweight” from “overweight.” On Jan. 4, Nazara defended the penalyzing of JPMorgan, saying its research was “not credible and not objective.” Research rule coming Indonesia is planning to issue a rule to ensure primary bond dealers produce only “factual” research, senior government officials said last week. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov. 25. Officials have met with primary dealers to convey the message that they should “help the government to maintain stability,” Nazara said on Monday. In the JPMorgan case, the Finance Ministry dropped the US bank’s services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. Before the punishment, JPMorgan helped Indonesia to raise at least $11 billion by selling global bonds between 2012 and 2016, according to data from the Finance Ministry and the central bank. JPMorgan was part of a syndicate of banks working on Indonesia’s sale of $3.16 billion worth of bonds last June, but it was not listed for two more offerings in US dollar and yen since then. In 2015, JPMorgan was one of the lead managers for a dollar sukuk offering for Indonesia that raised $2 billion. Foreigners hold more than 37 percent of Indonesia’s sovereign bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for Southeast Asia’s biggest economy.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced a new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa card that awards Prime members a 5% point payback on all purchases at Amazon.com along with point rewards at other merchants. Amazon automatically will upgrade existing Prime members who have an Amazon Rewards Visa to the new card. The Amazon Rewards card pays a 3% point reward for purchases made at Amazon.com and does not require Prime membership. Both cards offer 2% in points rewards at restaurants, gas stations and drugstores, and 1% on all other card purchases. At a 5% reward rate ($5 per $100 in purchases), a Prime membership would be free if a consumer spent $2,000 a year at Amazon. In 2015 the average U.S. household spent about $2,000 on gasoline, so the 2% rewards deal is worth $400 and the 1% reward on all other spending would further reduce the out-of-pocket amount a customer would have to pay to recoup the Prime membership fee. Points may be redeemed at any time, and every 100 points cuts your purchase price by $1.00. The Amazon Prime rewards card carries an interest rate of 14.74% to 22.74%, depending on a customer’s creditworthiness. There is no annual fee for the card, and late payment fees range from $15 to a maximum of $37. There is no foreign transaction fee. Note that this is not a cashback card; it is a rewards point card and the points may only be used at Amazon.com. Another major retail that put a massive credit card rewards scheme into play recently is Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST). The company ended its long-standing exclusive deal with American Express and did an exclusive deal with Citi and Visa. The Costco Anywhere Visa card offers Costco members 4% cash back on gasoline purchases at any service station nationwide, 3% cash back on restaurants and eligible travel purchases, 2% cash back on all purchases at Costco stores and the Costco website, and 1% cashback on all other purchases. Costco does not charge an annual fee for the card and offers a 0% introductory rate for seven months, according to NerdWallet. The APR on the card varies and begins at 15.74%. The penalty rate can rise as high as 29.99%. Costco also charges a 3% foreign transaction fee. Costco pays earned rewards once a year on a customer’s February statement, and customers can only redeem their annual rewards payments in person at Costco stores. Prime members who shop a lot at Amazon’s website are the company’s target with this card. Because points can only be spent at Amazon, the company’s top line benefits from the points customers build up at gas stations and every other retail store or website where they shop before spending at Amazon. Sure it’s a discount to Amazon’s selling price, but selling for a tiny margin has never bothered Amazon before and almost surely doesn’t this time.

BankThink Flashback: When banks tried to end screen scraping … in 2004 BankThink Financial data gathering needs a common standard BankThink OCC's new charter — only serious fintechs need apply Reimagine the joint bank account search goes here Do banks belong on Snapchat? By Mary Wisniewski Published January 11 2017, 4:56pm EST More in Social media Mobile technology Millennials Digital banking Print Email Reprints Share Share on Snapchat, once dismissed as just a sexting app, has become banks' latest playground for connecting with millennials over playful filters, emojis and videos. In July, Bank of America paid for a sponsored lens that turned willing users into llamas to promote its mobile app. To woo young talent, JPMorgan Chase has advertised on the app. Citigroup is using the company's trendy sunglasses to make short videos that illustrate the bank's culture. Community banks are fiddling with the filters, too. CenterState Banks in Davenport, Fla., has been testing how different content ideas could potentially resonate with the app's users. CenterState's conclusion so far on banks having Snapchat accounts, however, is grim: it is likely a waste of time, said Chris Nichols, the chief strategy officer for the bank. CenterState is still exploring if it can create useful content on the app, but Nichols said he is skeptical. "It is a great medium, but it is just not conducive for most banks," he said. "If you had a bank that specialized in banking professional athletes or celebrities, or if a bank had a CEO with a really big personality, it might be a different story." "We explore any new social media that we believe is getting major traction," says Chris Nichols, the chief strategy officer of CenterState Banks. A feature that superimposes dog ears and a muzzle on users is among the most popular things on Snapchat. That's a path some are exploring. For instance, the Bank of Ireland is hiring celebrity Snapchat personalities to share money savings tips with students. Still, Nichols said the effort has not been in vain — banks have to be constantly thinking of new ways of connecting with people. "My job is to look at different tech and channels and see what works," he said. "For instance, Pokémon Go. We were one of the first banks to use it for marketing. Snapchat is no different." With more than 150 million people — particularly 18 to 24-year olds — using it every day to send or watch messages, it is important for banks to understand the platform as they seek to reach potential customers, too. "You can't ignore it," said Terry Golesworthy, president of The Customer Respect Group, a research and consultancy firm. "It's the channel to the audience you are struggling to reach. Also, there are lessons in communication that bankers can learn from Snapchat, similar to learning to get a point across in 140 characters for Twitter. The trend toward short videos and transparent social messages on Snapchat — or whatever popular app comes next — is only getting stronger, said Stessa Cohen, a research director at Gartner. "Banks need to understand how these things work," said Cohen. It is also a great playground because the stakes are low. The content is temporary and, unlike so many other social media platforms, the number of followers a user has is not published. "You are not going to be embarrassed if you don't get traction," Nichols said. Snapchat, like any newer platform, requires some fresh thinking of bankers. Snapchat messages are intended to disappear. That raises compliance questions for banks that have to record communications. Also, visuals take center stage on the app — for an industry that sells intangible products and services, and historically, has relied on corporate-looking stock imagery, that's not a strong suit. "There are only so many pictures of money you can show," Nichols said. Using the app as a recruitment tool is an easy initial use case for a bank, Golesworthy said. Banks can use Snapchat as a modern — and visual — "About Us" section to woo young talent "Recruitment is the easy place to play now," he said. Already Citi, has been using Spectacles — sunglasses sold by Snap to record things — to offer a glimpse of what life is like at the bank. Citi equipped a handful of employees with the sunglasses to record short videos of their days. The big idea, of course, is to show off the culture in a different manner than reading about it or hearing about it from someone else. After all, banks are struggling to recruit younger talent. "It allows for the end-person to watch a quick, bird's eye view of what's going on at the firm," said Courtney Storz, head of global campus recruitment and program management at Citi. Citi does not have a Snapchat account, but the institution shares the videos on other social platforms like Twitter and Facebook. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, have advertised on Snapchat for a similar end goal: to woo recent college graduates. Early Lessons — the Dutch Bank Example As banks in the U.S. explore using products from Snapchat, ABN Amro in the Netherlands is getting feedback in using the app as a customer support tool. In 12 months on Snapchat, the bank said it has gained about 2,000 followers, and typically receives one question per day. If the Dutch bank posts a story, it may get a handful of questions in response, said spokeswoman Brigitte Seegers. Most questions are about interest rates, online banking and opening hours. Among the learnings so far? Adjust the brand to Snapchat. "Don't be too serious (unless people ask serious questions), use photos, videos, emojis and filters instead of screen shots, seek for interaction and ask questions," Seegers said in an email. That echoes CenterState's experience. Nichols said his team has posted behind-the-scenes footage at the bank, including playing pranks on one another and that has garnered some interest. But until the bank cracks the nut of producing compelling content on a regular basis, Nichols said the bank won't formally launch a Snapchat account. Either way, it isn't costing the bank anything additional to explore the platform. "While we have an R&D budget, we spent nothing on exploring Snapchat," Nichols said.

Morgan Securities LLC To Pay $900,000 For Supervision Failures - Firm’s Supervisory Failures Over Exchange And Clearing Fee Processing Led To Customer Overcharges At Times Press Events News RSS Videos Newsletters About Mondo Visione Vendors Polls Glossary Acronyms FT Trading Room Elsevier and Mondo Visione Media Contacts NYSE Exchanges Blog White Papers Newsletter Subscription Form Newsletter Enter your email address to receive regular updates CFTC Orders J.P. Morgan Securities LLC To Pay $900,000 For Supervision Failures - Firm’s Supervisory Failures Over Exchange And Clearing Fee Processing Led To Customer Overcharges At Times Date 11/01/2017 The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling charges against J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMS), a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York City, for failing to diligently supervise its officers’, employees’, and agents’ processing of exchange and clearing fees it charged customers for trading and clearing Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (CME) products and products from certain other exchanges during 2010 to 2014. JPMS is registered with the CFTC as a Futures Commission Merchant and a swap dealer. The CFTC Order requires JPMS to pay a $900,000 civil monetary penalty and cease and desist from violating the CFTC regulation governing diligent supervision. The CFTC Order explains that customer transactions executed on exchanges are subject to payment of exchange and clearing fees that are applied to each transaction in the normal course of business. Clearing firms such as JPMS receive invoices for these fees from the exchange clearinghouses, which the firms pass on to their customers, the CFTC Order states. Here, the CFTC Order finds that JPMS failed to implement and maintain adequate systems for reconciling invoices from exchange clearinghouses with the amounts of fees actually charged to its customers. JPMS’ fee reconciliation process was largely manual and carried out by only one employee at the end of the month using three different JPMS systems. In addition to insufficient staff to complete the fee reconciliation process accurately, JPMS did not have adequate written policies and procedures in place regarding its clearing and exchange fee reconciliations. According to the CFTC Order, this led to instances in which JPMS overcharged some customers in an aggregate amount of approximately $7.8 million. The CFTC Order finds that JPMS discovered the problem in 2014, self-reported it to the CFTC, and thereafter took remedial steps, including refunding adversely affected customers. The Order recognizes JPMS’ significant cooperation with the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement during the investigation of this matter. Third Such Action Brought by the CFTC This is the third action that the CFTC has brought over a clearing firm’s supervisory failures over fee processing: • In August 2016, the CFTC ordered Barclays Capital, Inc. to pay an $800,000 penalty relating to its processing of futures exchange and clearing fees charged to customers (see CFTC Order and Press Release 7419-16, August 4, 2016); and, • In August 2014, the CFTC ordered Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated to pay a $1.2 million penalty relating to is processing of futures exchange and clearing fees charged to customers (see CFTC Order and Press Release 6984-14, August 26, 2014). The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Susan Gradman, Joseph Patrick, Elizabeth Pendleton, Brigitte Weyls, Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

Morgan Securities to pay $900,000 for supervision failures: CFTC WASHINGTON The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Wednesday it ordered J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to pay $900,000 to settle charges it had failed to properly supervise employees over fees charged to customers trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The CFTC said in a statement the company, a unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), had failed to implement and maintain adequate systems for reconciling invoices from exchange clearinghouses with the amounts of fees actually charged to its customers from 2010 to 2014. J.P. Morgan Securities overcharged customers by about $7.8 million, the statement said. The company discovered the problem in 2014 and reported it to the CFTC, the commission said. "We have refunded nearly all affected customers and implemented new systems and pricing arrangements to improve the accuracy of the firm’s exchange fee procedures and process," JPMorgan Chase spokesman Brian Marchiony said in a statement.

Perron and the United States Bankruptcy Trustee for the Southern District of Indiana on behalf of Christine M. Jackson v. J.P. Morgan Chase Bank N.A. 15-2206 U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Indianapolis Division. Judge Tanya Walton Pratt. Civil. Affirms summary judgment for Chase Bank in ex-couple Perron and Jackson’s lawsuit claiming the bank’s response to a misapplied insurance payment, seeking more than $300,000 in damages, caused their divorce. To the extent that any requested information was missing, Perron and Jackson suffered no actual damages and thus have no viable claim, nor did the bank breach the duty of good faith and fair dealing.

Affirms the revocation of Dominique Castillo’s probation and order that he serve the whole of his suspended sentence, which was four years in the Indiana Department of Correction with 2 ½ years suspended. Finds given Castillo’s blatant disregard for the terms of his probation, the Harrison Superior Court was well within its discretion to sanction him by ordering him to serve his previously suspended sentence. Also finds the trial court did not consider inappropriate testimony and, thus, did not abuse its discretion. Fernando J. Alvarez, Jr. v. State of Indiana (mem. dec.) 02A04-1608-CR-1766 Criminal.

Those running court systems, have most substance abuse issues. Probably self medicating to cover conscience issues arising out of acts furthering govt corruption I whole-heartedly agree with Doug Church's comment, above. Indiana lawyers were especially fortunate to benefit from Tom Pyrz' leadership and foresight at a time when there has been unprecedented change in the legal profession. Consider how dramatically computer technology and its role in the practice of law have changed over the last 25 years. The impact of the great recession of 2008 dramatically changed the composition and structure of law firms across the country. Economic pressures altered what had long been a routine, robust annual recruitment process for law students and recent law school graduates. That has, in turn, impacted law school enrollment across the country, placing upward pressure on law school tuition. The internet continues to drive significant changes in the provision of legal services in both public and private sectors. The ISBA has worked to make quality legal representation accessible and affordable for all who need it and to raise general public understanding of Indiana laws and procedures. How difficult it would have been to tackle each of these issues without Tom's leadership. Tom has set the tone for positive change at the ISBA to meet the evolving practice needs of lawyers of all backgrounds and ages. He has led the organization with vision, patience, flexibility, commitment, thoughtfulness & even humor. He will, indeed, be a tough act to follow. Thank you, Tom, for all you've done and all the energy you've invested in making the ISBA an excellent, progressive, highly responsive, all-inclusive, respectful & respected professional association during his tenure there. The is putting restrictions on vaping just because big tobacco companies are losing money. http://vapingisthefuture.com Oh, and I should add ... the stigma JLAP attaches lasts forever. As my documents show, I had good reason to reject the many conflicted diagnoses for not thinking like the state wanted me to. BUT when I resisted and raised constitutional and even ADA "regarded as" arguments I was then denied licensed in Indiana for LIFE. As in until death does us part.

JPMorgan said it will appeal the finding, which awarded Johnny Burris $64,400 in back wages and $100,000 for reputational damage, pain and suffering. The finding by an investigator for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was released on Tuesday. OSHA, which is part of the Labor Department, said there was “reasonable cause” to conclude that JPMorgan’s decision to terminate Burris resulted in part from employee behavior protected under the anti-retaliation provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. An appeal would be considered by an administrative law judge. “Mr. Burris previously raised these same claims to a Finra panel, with the same basic evidence, and the claims were denied,” JPMorgan spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said in an emailed statement. She was referring to a 2014 ruling by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street’s industry-funded brokerage regulator, that he wasn’t wrongfully dismissed. “We look forward to presenting our case in the next step of this process and putting this to rest.” Burris disputes the validity of the Finra ruling. The arbitrators made their decision based on a client complaint that OSHA later found to have been written by a JPMorgan manager, Burris said. Under the OSHA finding, JPMorgan would have to clear that complaint and expunge his industry employment record, known as a U5. It would also have to pay him reasonable attorneys’ fees. Burris expressed dissatisfaction with the OSHA decision. “They ruled in my favor but tried to limit the damages to the bank,” he said. OSHA’s San Francisco office, which handled the case, didn’t respond to a request seeking comment on the finding. Burris isn’t the only former JPMorgan adviser to complain of retaliation. A trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 23 in Manhattan federal court to reconsider the case of Jennifer Sharkey, a former JPMorgan wealth manager who alleges that the bank fired her in violation of Sarbanes-Oxley whistle-blower protections after she recommended that it investigate whether a wealthy client was involved in illegal activity. Last September, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed an earlier dismissal of the case and sent it back to the lower court. Last June, a Finra arbitration panel found that JPMorgan had defamed three former New Jersey wealth managers by falsely amending their employment records. The bank was ordered by the arbitrators to expunge the advisers’ records. Burris began working as a Chase Private Client adviser in Sun City West, Arizona, in June 2010. Shortly afterward, he started voicing complaints internally about being pressured by managers to sell more of the bank’s products to his elderly clientele, even if there were better investment options for them. Burris also provided information about his concerns to the New York Times, which featured him in a July 2012 article. In the ensuing months, Burris’ managers frequently discussed how he was selling a low percentage of JPMorgan-managed products, according to OSHA’s written finding. Burris was fired by the bank in November 2012. A JPMorgan manager went outside firm procedure, turned an oral customer complaint into a written one and required Burris to list it on his employment record, “likely blacklisting him and causing him reputational harm,” according to the OSHA finding.

Speaking as a guest on CNBC, the analyst doesn't believe bank stocks have moved ahead of themselves in the recent stock market surge. Mayo justified his bullish stance by highlighting President-elect Donald Trump's economic policies, which will support jobs and GDP growth. He added that a vital component of accelerating jobs and GDP growth is counting banks as a key partner. Mayo said Trump's administration is expected to help banks in the regulatory environment, not necessarily be removing regulations by stop piling on new ones. "The most important point - even if you don't get a 'Trump-bump' to the banks, and we think a 'Trump-bump' can add 20 percent to bank earnings, even without that we still think that banks create value for the first time in a decade," Mayo said. "Banks in the U.S. earn their cost of capital and that is what the market is collectively missing." Here are Mayo's stock ratings and price targets: Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) - Outperform rating, $27 price target. Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC) - Outperform rating, $64 price target. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) - Outperform rating, $275 price target. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) - Buy rating, $54 price target. Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) - Buy rating, $80 price target.

COURTESY OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR Print Email Comment Tweet Posted: Wednesday, January 11, 2017 12:47 pm By PBN Staff Twitter: @ProvBusNews secondary education State funds Prepare RI initiative and program doubles enrollment in first year (Sept. 20, 2016) higher education U.S. News: NEIT online program 8th best in U.S. (Jan. 11, 2017) government Raimondo proposing programs designed to make college more affordable and accessible in R.I. (March 11, 2015) PROVIDENCE – Over the next three years, Rhode Island will receive $2 million to improve career readiness and postsecondary attainment for all Rhode Island youth through a program called “PrepareRI.” The Ocean State is one of 10 states nationally, including Massachusetts, to receive a Phase Two New Skills for Youth grant, part of the $75 million New Skills for Youth initiative developed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. in collaboration with the nonprofit Council of Chief State School Officers and Advance CTE, a Silver Spring, Md.-based nonprofit representing state leaders responsible for secondary, postsecondary and adult career technical education. Rhode Island received $100,000 through the program’s first phase last March for planning and implementation. “Rhode Island’s New Skills for Youth grant is intended to turn our bold vision for improving career readiness in K-12 education into a reality,” Gov. Gina M. Raimondo said in a statement Wednesday. “We are honored to have been recognized for our vision to prepare Rhode Island students for good-paying jobs in our state’s leading industries. By creating pathways between our existing K-12, higher education and workforce development systems, we will meet the needs of our existing employers while also providing jobs that pay for Rhode Islanders.” <a href="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=1&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> <img src="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1&pid=0&position=1" height="60" width="468" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </a> According to information from the R.I. Department of Education, currently, less than 45 percent of Rhode Islanders have a post-secondary degree or industry-recognized certificate, and 70 percent of jobs in the coming years will require them. The grant’s purpose is to bridge the skills gap so all Rhode Island young people have the opportunity to attain life-sustaining jobs, the agency said. The grant was awarded after an examination of the state’s plan to transform how it designs and develops career preparedness education programs. PrepareRI, a three-year action plan, expands the Prepare RI Dual Enrollment Fund that allows high school students to receive both high school and college credits at no cost to them or their families. The goal of the program is that by 2020, all Rhode Island youth will have access to work-based learning and advanced coursework opportunities in every Rhode Island high school. To that end, the state will partner with the employer community to create job shadowing opportunities, internships and apprenticeships. PrepareRI is committed to four specific goals: K-12, higher education and business alignment Demand-driven programs and investments targeted towards Rhode Island’s growing industry clusters Student-centered and personalized learning opportunities that help young people develop interests and talents, consider options for the future, and allow for evolving interests A commitment to performance management, accountability and continuous improvement to achieve these goals “Preparing our youth for high-quality and in-demand careers is critical to the future strength of our communities,” said Rick MacDonald, head of Commercial Banking in New England for JPMorgan Chase.

Morgan earnings: Expect a strong trading quarter and improved credit markets By Ciara Linnane Published: Jan 13, 2017 7:26 a.m. ET Share Bank has enjoyed a stock rally on expectations the president-elect will scale back post-crisis regulations Getty Images for Fortune J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon By CiaraLinnane Corporate news editor J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings before the bell on Friday, and investors are expecting another strong quarter for trading. See also: Bank ETFs still favored as investors see growth and Trump bump ahead Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in December he expects trading revenue to rise about 15% from the year-earlier period, as activity in fixed-income trading picked up after the November presidential election, while equity indexes surged to record levels, The Wall Street Journal reported. The surprise victory of Donald Trump is expected to lead to a major rollback of regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, creating growth opportunities for banks. Dimon said his bank JPM, +0.53%  has benefited in fixed-income trading from the exit from that business by many European banks that are dealing with their own issues. Fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading rebounded in 2016 after a long period of weakness that led many banks to cut staff on trading desks. Jamie Dimon on 'The Door to Diversity'(2:59) JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon says that embracing diversity means running a company "where people are respected and trusted and treated equally and everyone can speak up in the room." If you don’t have that, he says, the women won’t have a chance. Meanwhile, the prospect of higher interest rates is expected to boost margins on lending. “Corporate tax reform is another potentially positive for the space as is the expectation of an elevated growth trajectory for the U.S. economy,” said Zacks Research Director, Sheraz Mian. “All in all, the industry’s operating and regulatory outlook has never been this favorable in a long time. “This has started showing up in bank stock EPS estimates as well, though the impact is most pronounced in expectations for the outer periods.” See also: End of a stock-market era: Alcoa breaks tradition of being first to report earnings Here’s what to expect from J.P. Morgan’s quarter: Earnings: Analysts polled by FactSet are expecting the bank to post per-share earnings of $1.42, up from $1.32 in the same period a year ago. Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from buy-side and sell-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, academics and others, is expecting a higher number of $1.47 a share. Revenue: Revenue is expected to total $23.912 billion, up from $23.747 billion a year ago. Estimize is expecting revenue of $23.641 billion. Stock price action: Like many of its peers, J.P. Morgan stock has rallied since the presidential election, tacking on about 23% amid expectations for deregulation. The KBW Nasdaq Bank exchange-traded fund BKX, +0.87%  has gained about 23% since the election, while the S&P SPX, +0.18%  has added 6.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03%  has gained 8.5% in the same period. Read: Why Goldman sees only 90 good days for U.S. stocks in 2017 J.P. Morgan stock has gained 46% in the last 12 months, after setting a fresh record of $87.23 on Jan. 3, the first trading day of the new year. FactSet analysts have an average rating of overweight on the stock with an average stock price target of $88.52. Other issues: TD Securities analysts are expecting overall U.S. bank earnings to reflect improving credit trends, meaning lower net charge-offs, nonperforming loans and delinquency trends. At the same time, they expect banks to report a stabilization in the credit quality of their oil and gas exposures, following the recent recovery in oil prices. “JPM specifically commented that the capital markets are open to oil-and-gas companies, and that they do not expect further significant energy-related builds in Q4/16 provided the market environment does not deteriorate from its current state,” TD analysts wrote in a note. UBS said it expects J.P. Morgan’s corporate and investment banking business to benefit from what is a potentially more benign regulatory environment that could spur capital markets velocity and increase risk appetite. Analysts initiated coverage on the stock Wednesday with a buy rating and raised their stock price target to $98 from $91. UBS is expecting J.P. Morgan’s return on tangible common equity to move closer to a midteen range by 2019 from about 12% currently. “Continued good operating momentum, higher interest rates, moderately improved efficiency, a lesser drag from the cards business, and elevated capital returns (70-75% of earnings) should help,” they wrote.

Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup, and Christopher Ashton, formerly of Barclays, were charged with conspiring to restrain trade in an indictment filed at a federal court in Manhattan. The three were members of the "Cartel" chatroom in which they are alleged to have shared sensitive client order information to manipulate exchange rates. Below is a timeline on the scandal that consumed the largely unregulated $5.3 trillion-a-day market. 2017 Jan. 10: U.S. Department of Justice indicts three London-based former traders and members of "The Cartel" chatroom, Rohan Ramchandani, Richard Usher and Chris Ashton. Jan. 4: Former Barclays trader Jason Katz becomes the first person to admit criminal wrongdoing in the FX probe, pleading guilty to U.S. charges to participating in a price-fixing conspiracy. 2016 March: Britain's SFO closes its FX investigation without having brought any charges, saying "the alleged conduct, even if proven and taken at its highest, would not meet the evidential test required to mount a prosecution for an offence contrary to English law." 2015 Nov.: Ex-Citi trader Perry Stimpson wins his unfair dismissal hearing at an employment tribunal in London. May: The U.S. DOJ fines six banks (Citi, JP Morgan, HSBC, RBS, Barclays and Bank of America Merrill Lynch) a total of $6 billion. The first five pleaded guilty to felony charges, while BAML was fined for compliance failures. 2014 Dec.: Former RBS trader Paul Nash is the first individual to be arrested. Nov.: British and U.S. authorities fine six of the world's biggest banks - Citi, JP Morgan, HSBC, RBS, UBS and Bank of America Merrill Lynch - a total of $4.3 billion for failing to prevent their traders sharing clients' order information and attempting to manipulate the market. Nov.: The Bank of England fires chief dealer Martin Mallett, and announces it has scrapped the regular chief dealers meetings for good. July: Britain's Serious Fraud Office formally opens investigation into FX rigging. March: The Bank of England suspends Martin Mallett, and appoints Lord Anthony Grabiner to lead an independent investigation into what the Bank knew of alleged currency market collusion and manipulation. Feb.: The Financial Stability Board, the world's top financial regulator which coordinates policy for the G20, says it will review FX fixings. Feb.: New York's banking regulator opens its investigation. Jan.: Citi fires chief dealer Rohan Ramchandani, a member of the BoE-chaired chief dealers group and the first trader in the unfolding scandal to be sacked. 2013 Dec.: Several banks, including JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank ban traders from multi-dealer electronic chatrooms. Oct.: The investigation goes global. The DOJ, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England, and Switzerland's market regulator all open probes. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority says it is cooperating. Sept.: Swiss bank UBS provides the U.S. Department of Justice with information on FX allegations in the hope of gaining antitrust immunity if charged with wrongdoing. July: A scheduled chief dealers meeting for July 4 never takes place. June: Bloomberg News reports dealers used electronic chatrooms to share client order information to manipulate benchmark exchange rates at the 4:00 p.m. London "fixing". These chatrooms had names such as "The 3 Musketeers" and "The Cartel". Feb.: The chief dealers group meets for what will be the last time. 2012 April: As the Libor scandal reaches its zenith, the regular FX chief dealers meeting included a "brief discussion on extra levels of compliance that many bank trading desks were subject to when managing client risks around the main set piece benchmark fixings," BoE minutes say. 2008 July: A meeting of the BoE's FX Joint Standing Committee's chief dealers sub-group discusses the suggestion "that using a snapshot of the market may be problematic, as it could be subject to manipulation," BoE minutes say. May: Minutes of a meeting of the FX chief dealers say there was "considerable discussion" on the benchmark "fixings" again. Spring: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York makes enquiries into concerns surrounding benchmark Libor interest rates, sharing its analysis and suggestions for reforms with "the relevant authorities in the UK." 2006 July: Minutes of a chief dealers meeting say the group discussed "evidence of attempts to move the market around popular fixing times by players that had no particular interest in that fix. It was noted that 'fixing business' generally was becoming increasingly fraught due to this behaviour." 2005 July: The first meeting of the Bank of England's FX Joint Standing Committee's chief dealers sub-group. These get-togethers between top London-based FX traders and senior BoE officials will become known as the chief dealers meetings. They will be held regularly every year up to 2013, where the traders and Bank officials will discuss market trends and issues. Every meeting will be chaired by BoE chief dealer Martin Mallett.

That worked well until the company's income taxes had to be paid. "Even if you have a good amount in the bank, it's not really your money till you pay your taxes," says Romis, owner of Weberous Web Design. "At the end of the year, it disappeared and we started the new year completely strapped." Romis, whose company is located in Los Angeles, had to use personal savings to restore Weberous' cash reserves. "Cash is king" is an axiom business owners try to live by. If revenue isn't coming in, and owners can't get loans or investors, there's no way to run day-to-day operations, buy inventory and equipment or hire workers. But many companies struggle to maintain a healthy cash flow and create a buffer for an event like a storm that keeps customers home. Companies with cash problems often have overestimated how much revenue they'd have and underestimated expenses, says George Solomon, a George Washington University management professor. It's especially a problem for new owners. These owners may also not be adequately prepared for the seasonality of their business, or for the slow payment practices of their customers " particularly if the customer is a government. "They can literally have millions of dollars on their book in terms of procurement (contracts) for the federal government and literally be filing for bankruptcy," Solomon says. Businesses like restaurants with low profit margins are particularly at risk of running through their cash buffers, since any interruption to their revenue can put them in danger of closing. Massachusetts restaurants and retailers had a 50 percent drop in revenue between Jan. 26 and Feb. 22, 2015, as massive snowstorms hit the state, according to Boston University researchers. Hidden Boston, a website that tracks restaurant openings and closings, counted 20 restaurants that shut down in the metropolitan area in March 2015, compared to 11 a year earlier and five in March 2013. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. studied 597,000 of its small business customers last year, it found their cash flow was lower than expected. Half the businesses had cash reserves that would last just 27 days. Restaurants had the smallest buffer, 16 days, while repair and maintenance businesses had 18 and retailers had 19. Personal service providers like hairdressers and dry cleaners had 21. The biggest buffer, 47 days, was held by real estate companies. The median small company had an average daily cash balance of $12,100, and personal service providers averaged just $5,300. "The typical small business has a low margin of error in the face of economic headwinds and shocks," JPMorgan Chase said. Continued below.

If business slows, he's willing to take on smaller projects " ones that will bring in $8,500 compared to $10,000 for his company's more typical jobs " to keep cash coming in. He considered using credit cards, but when he took at $7,500 cash advance on a card with a $15,000 credit line, the bank immediately reduced his limit to $7,500, eliminating that alternative. Tate Tullis has learned to bank money during his road sign company's busy months to give Sign Wise a buffer equal to 20 percent of its annual revenue. The 3-year-old business gets most of its sales during warmer weather, since during the winter fewer roads and parking lots are being built or overhauled. When business drops off, the Logan, Utah, company looks at its inventory and raw materials like aluminum, assesses how much it really needs, and sells the surplus. It also does more marketing to overseas customers. All these steps leave Tullis feeling comfortable with his company's cash position. "If everything went south, we'd probably have enough cash for two or three months," he says. The recession taught many business owners some lessons about cash flow, says Thomas Basilo, a certified public accountant with Withum Smith & Brown in Morristown, New Jersey. They've given themselves more wiggle room negotiating flexible payment terms with vendors, sometimes as long as 90 days after an invoice is sent. They've also gotten better terms from lenders. Many startup owners forgo a salary as a way to boost cash flow. But that's a sign of trouble to Basilo " they're not considering all the contingencies that might come up, in their personal lives as well as with their companies. "That's how they think when they start their business. They're very unprepared," he says. Dan and Darla Robinson aim to have $30,000 in cash in the bank by October, to help run their six sweetFrog franchise yogurt shops when sales slow during colder weather. Dan Robinson estimates cash flow falls about 30 percent during the slow months. The Robinsons, whose stores are in California and Maryland, have increased cash flow by cutting expenses, offering fewer toppings and paying off most of their debt. They have a smaller staff during the stores' down time, and when they need new equipment, they rely on their franchisor's ability to negotiate better prices. While they do have savings, they don't want to tap them for cash flow. "We pretend that the savings doesn't exist," Dan Robinson says. _____ Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrongfully fired a financial adviser in retaliation for publicly complaining that managers pressured him to sell the bank’s own investment products, a federal investigator found. JPMorgan said it will appeal the finding awarding Johnny Burris $64,400 in back wages and $100,000 for reputational damage, pain and suffering. The finding by an investigator for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration was released Tuesday. OSHA, which is part of the Labor Department, determined that JPMorgan’s decision to terminate Burris resulted in part from employee behavior protected under the anti-retaliation provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. An appeal would be considered by an administrative law judge. “Mr. Burris previously raised these same claims to a FINRA panel, with the same basic evidence, and the claims were denied,” JPMorgan spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said in an e-mailed statement. “We look forward to presenting our case in the next step of this process and putting this to rest.” Under the OSHA finding, JPMorgan would have to clear an industry complaint it wrongfully listed against him and expunge his industry employment record, known as a U5. It would also have to pay him reasonable attorneys fees. Limited Damages Burris expressed dissatisfaction with the decision. “They ruled in my favor but tried to limit the damages to the bank," he said. The arbitration decision by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority was based on a complaint faulted by the OSHA investigator, Burris said. OSHA’s San Francisco office, which handled the case, didn’t respond to a request seeking comment on the finding. Burris began working as a Chase Private Client adviser in Sun City West, Arizona, in June 2010. Shortly afterward, he started voicing complaints internally about being pressured by managers to sell more of the bank’s products to his elderly clientele, even if there were better investment options for them. Burris also provided information about his concerns to the New York Times, which featured him in a July 2012 article.

ROSENBERG January 11, 2017 11:13 am Share NEW YORK (AP) — When Rafael Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid. “Even if you have a good amount in the bank, it’s not really your money till you pay your taxes,” says Romis, owner of Weberous Web Design. “At the end of the year, it disappeared and we started the new year completely strapped.” Romis, whose company is located in Los Angeles, had to use personal savings to restore Weberous’ cash reserves. OPM tells DC-area feds how to plan for Inauguration Day “Cash is king” is an axiom business owners try to live by. If revenue isn’t coming in, and owners can’t get loans or investors, there’s no way to run day-to-day operations, buy inventory and equipment or hire workers. But many companies struggle to maintain a healthy cash flow and create a buffer for an event like a storm that keeps customers home. Advertisement Companies with cash problems often have overestimated how much revenue they’d have and underestimated expenses, says George Solomon, a George Washington University management professor. It’s especially a problem for new owners. These owners may also not be adequately prepared for the seasonality of their business, or for the slow payment practices of their customers — particularly if the customer is a government. “They can literally have millions of dollars on their book in terms of procurement (contracts) for the federal government and literally be filing for bankruptcy,” Solomon says. Businesses like restaurants with low profit margins are particularly at risk of running through their cash buffers, since any interruption to their revenue can put them in danger of closing. Massachusetts restaurants and retailers had a 50 percent drop in revenue between Jan. 26 and Feb. 22, 2015, as massive snowstorms hit the state, according to Boston University researchers. Hidden Boston, a website that tracks restaurant openings and closings, counted 20 restaurants that shut down in the metropolitan area in March 2015, compared to 11 a year earlier and five in March 2013. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. studied 597,000 of its small business customers last year, it found their cash flow was lower than expected. Half the businesses had cash reserves that would last just 27 days. Restaurants had the smallest buffer, 16 days, while repair and maintenance businesses had 18 and retailers had 19. Personal service providers like hairdressers and dry cleaners had 21. The biggest buffer, 47 days, was held by real estate companies. The median small company had an average daily cash balance of $12,100, and personal service providers averaged just $5,300. “The typical small business has a low margin of error in the face of economic headwinds and shocks,” JPMorgan Chase said. Romis says his cash flow has improved as the company has grown, and he now aims to have a two-month cash buffer. If business slows, he’s willing to take on smaller projects — ones that will bring in $8,500 compared to $10,000 for his company’s more typical jobs — to keep cash coming in.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Posted: Wednesday, January 11, 2017 8:59 pm | Updated: 9:16 pm, Wed Jan 11, 2017. Asian shares mixed after Trump offers scant policy details Associated Press | KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Asian shares were mixed Thursday following President-elect Donald Trump's press conference. Trump offered scant details on policies, disappointing investors hoping for a clearer sense of his plans for trade and economic stimulus. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.9 percent to 19,192.76. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent to 22,916.85, and the Shanghai Composite was also down 0.1 percent at 3,133.80. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,784.40 and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent at 2,080.39. Shares in Southeast Asia were mostly higher. WALL STREET: The Nasdaq hit a fifth record-high close in a row, gaining 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. TRUMP NEWS: Trump's first news conference in nearly six months was an anti-climax, with scant details on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Trump attacked U.S. intelligence services and big pharmaceutical companies, instead of outlining his platform. His comment that the government should change bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder," drove health care stocks lower THE QUOTE: "It is what he didn't mention - fiscal stimulus — that worries market participants. The U.S. dollar rally was based on the assumption that Trump's administration will push through a massive infrastructure building and fiscal stimulus package, which will lead to higher inflation in the future," said Margaret Yang Yan, market analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. "The slump in the U.S. dollar index last night indicated that assumption is now unwinding because the president-elect never even mentioned that key word 'stimulus'." ENERGY: Benchmark crude oil dipped 8 cents to $52.17 a barrel. It rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, fell 2 cents to $55.08. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 114.74 yen from 115.43 on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0576. © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

That worked well until the company's income taxes had to be paid. "Even if you have a good amount in the bank, it's not really your money till you pay your taxes," says Romis, owner of Weberous Web Design. "At the end of the year, it disappeared and we started the new year completely strapped." Romis, whose company is located in Los Angeles, had to use personal savings to restore Weberous' cash reserves.

Hong) "Cash is king" is an axiom business owners try to live by. If revenue isn't coming in, and owners can't get loans or investors, there's no way to run day-to-day operations, buy inventory and equipment or hire workers. But many companies struggle to maintain a healthy cash flow and create a buffer for an event like a storm that keeps customers home. Companies with cash problems often have overestimated how much revenue they'd have and underestimated expenses, says George Solomon, a George Washington University management professor. It's especially a problem for new owners. These owners may also not be adequately prepared for the seasonality of their business, or for the slow payment practices of their customers — particularly if the customer is a government. "They can literally have millions of dollars on their book in terms of procurement (contracts) for the federal government and literally be filing for bankruptcy," Solomon says. Businesses like restaurants with low profit margins are particularly at risk of running through their cash buffers, since any interruption to their revenue can put them in danger of closing. Massachusetts restaurants and retailers had a 50 percent drop in revenue between Jan. 26 and Feb. 22, 2015, as massive snowstorms hit the state, according to Boston University researchers. Hidden Boston, a website that tracks restaurant openings and closings, counted 20 restaurants that shut down in the metropolitan area in March 2015, compared to 11 a year earlier and five in March 2013. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. studied 597,000 of its small business customers last year, it found their cash flow was lower than expected. Half the businesses had cash reserves that would last just 27 days. Restaurants had the smallest buffer, 16 days, while repair and maintenance businesses had 18 and retailers had 19. Personal service providers like hairdressers and dry cleaners had 21. The biggest buffer, 47 days, was held by real estate companies. The median small company had an average daily cash balance of $12,100, and personal service providers averaged just $5,300. "The typical small business has a low margin of error in the face of economic headwinds and shocks," JPMorgan Chase said. Romis says his cash flow has improved as the company has grown, and he now aims to have a two-month cash buffer. If business slows, he's willing to take on smaller projects — ones that will bring in $8,500 compared to $10,000 for his company's more typical jobs — to keep cash coming in. He considered using credit cards, but when he took at $7,500 cash advance on a card with a $15,000 credit line, the bank immediately reduced his limit to $7,500, eliminating that alternative. Tate Tullis has learned to bank money during his road sign company's busy months to give Sign Wise a buffer equal to 20 percent of its annual revenue. The 3-year-old business gets most of its sales during warmer weather, since during the winter fewer roads and parking lots are being built or overhauled. When business drops off, the Logan, Utah, company looks at its inventory and raw materials like aluminum, assesses how much it really needs, and sells the surplus. It also does more marketing to overseas customers. All these steps leave Tullis feeling comfortable with his company's cash position. "If everything went south, we'd probably have enough cash for two or three months," he says. The recession taught many business owners some lessons about cash flow, says Thomas Basilo, a certified public accountant with Withum Smith & Brown in Morristown, New Jersey. They've given themselves more wiggle room negotiating flexible payment terms with vendors, sometimes as long as 90 days after an invoice is sent. They've also gotten better terms from lenders. Many startup owners forgo a salary as a way to boost cash flow. But that's a sign of trouble to Basilo — they're not considering all the contingencies that might come up, in their personal lives as well as with their companies. "That's how they think when they start their business. They're very unprepared," he says. Dan and Darla Robinson aim to have $30,000 in cash in the bank by October, to help run their six sweetFrog franchise yogurt shops when sales slow during colder weather. Dan Robinson estimates cash flow falls about 30 percent during the slow months. The Robinsons, whose stores are in California and Maryland, have increased cash flow by cutting expenses, offering fewer toppings and paying off most of their debt. They have a smaller staff during the stores' down time, and when they need new equipment, they rely on their franchisor's ability to negotiate better prices. While they do have savings, they don't want to tap them for cash flow. "We pretend that the savings doesn't exist," Dan Robinson says. _____ Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

JPMorgan said it will appeal the finding awarding Johnny Burris $64 400 in back wages and $100 000 for reputational damage, pain and suffering. The finding by an investigator for the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration was released Tuesday. OSHA, which is part of the Labour Department, determined that JPMorgan’s decision to terminate Burris resulted in part from employee behaviour protected under the anti-retaliation provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. An appeal would be considered by an administrative law judge. “Burris previously raised these same claims to a FINRA panel, with the same basic evidence, and the claims were denied,” JPMorgan spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said in an e-mailed statement. “We look forward to presenting our case in the next step of this process and putting this to rest.” Read also: Latter joins JP Morgan Under the OSHA finding, JPMorgan would have to clear an industry complaint it wrongfully listed against him and expunge his industry employment record, known as a U5. It would also have to pay him reasonable attorney’s fees. Limited damages Burris expressed dissatisfaction with the decision. “They ruled in my favour but tried to limit the damages to the bank," he said. The arbitration decision by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority was based on a complaint faulted by the OSHA investigator, Burris said. OSHA’s San Francisco office, which handled the case, didn’t respond to a request seeking comment on the finding. Burris began working as a Chase Private Client adviser in Sun City West, Arizona, in June 2010. Shortly afterward, he started voicing complaints internally about being pressured by managers to sell more of the bank’s products to his elderly clientele, even if there were better investment options for them. Burris also provided information about his concerns to the New York Times, which featured him in a July 2012 article. In the following months, Burris’s managers frequently discussed how he was selling a low percentage of JPMorgan-managed products, according to OSHA’s written finding. Burris was fired by the bank in November 2012. A JPMorgan manager went outside firm procedure, turned an oral customer complaint into a written one and required Burris to list it on his employment record, “likely blacklisting him and causing him reputational harm,” according to the OSHA finding.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Donald Trump once described Jamie Dimon as "the worst banker in the United States," but the president-elect has helped make the boss of JPMorgan Chase & Co $50 million richer. Dimon is the top beneficiary among the 30 chief executives who run companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index from a stock rally inspired by Trump's election, according to a Reuters analysis of their option grants. Trump's proposed policies for lower taxes, less Wall Street regulation and more infrastructure spending have energized the U.S. stock market since the real estate magnate's Nov. 8 victory. The post-election rally even resurrected the value of an option award held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein that was worthless on the eve of the election. Trump criticized Dimon in 2013 for reaching a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government over the sale of toxic mortgages instead of fighting the case. Nevertheless, he appointed Dimon to the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of high-profile business leaders he set up last month to advise him on economic growth and job creation. Dimon declined to comment on Trump's criticism or the rise in value of his holdings.   JACKPOT Stock options held by Dow 30 CEOs surged in value by 23 percent to about $1 billion in 2016, with most of the gain coming after Trump's election win. The figures reflect outstanding stock options that could be exercised at the end of 2015. Options that expired or vested in 2016 were excluded from the analysis. In a few cases, CEOs exercised some of those options during 2016, U.S. regulatory filings show. Visa Inc CEO Charles Scharf did not need a Trump-led stock rally to hit the jackpot. About two weeks before the election, he exercised nearly 800,000 options for gross proceeds of almost $33 million, U.S. regulatory filings show. He resigned from Visa effective Dec. 1. For a look at how the post-election rally has affected Dow 30 stock options, click here Trump campaigned on the slogan "Make America Great Again," vowing to bolster the prospects of the American working class by preventing jobs from moving abroad, restricting immigration and renegotiating trade pacts. In 2015, Trump called high salaries paid to CEOs a "joke" and a "disgrace" and said these were often approved by company boards stacked with CEOs' friends.   PRO-BUSINESS AGENDA To be sure, Trump's election has helped investors big and small. Hopes of a pro-business agenda have driven the Dow 30 close to 20,000 - a level it has never breached - in a boon for workers' retirement plans. "With the recent Trump/Republican win, it appears that investors are getting more excited about potential growth and animal spirits are on the rise," top investment strategists at Morgan Stanley said this month in a wealth management report. "This is likely to lead to the final euphoric stage of this cyclical bull market which could be quite powerful in 2017's first half." Big stock option gains for Goldman Sachs head Blankfein, American Express Co CEO Kenneth Chenault and JP Morgan's Dimon may be a surprise, given that their companies have reduced or even eliminated option grants in recent years in favor of stock awards tied to hitting financial targets. Blankfein's 322,104 outstanding options, granted in 2007 with a $204.16 strike price, were under water by $7.3 million on the eve of the presidential election. But by the end of 2016, their value had soared to $11.4 million. That was an $18.7 million swing, thanks to the Trump-inspired stock market rally and the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates, a boost for banks and credit card companies. Blankfein declined to comment. Alan Johnson, managing director of pay consulting firm Johnson Associates in New York, said the big gains for the leaders of American Express, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan reflect how stock option compensation can magnify gains in a company's share price. "When the stock goes up, with options, you get more leverage," he said.   MEDIOCRE PERFORMANCE Critics of stock options say the grants can produce large amounts of wealth for CEOs even with mediocre performance. One reason is that grants often are not linked to any financial performance metric, such as return on equity. And so as the United States nears the eighth year of a bull market, options can increase in value even if the CEOs are running companies whose share price has lagged broad benchmarks during their tenure. For example, shares of Caterpillar Inc rose 54 percent during Douglas Oberhelman's tenure as CEO of the big equipment maker from mid-2010 to the end of 2016, while the Dow 30 more than doubled during that span. But the value of Oberhelman's options rallied during his last year as CEO, climbing to $20.3 million after being under water by nearly $9 million at the start of 2016. The options' value got a $10.6 million booster shot after Trump's victory. Caterpillar shares rose 36 percent in 2016, making it one of the best performing stocks on the Dow. Trump has said he would use Caterpillar tractors to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Caterpillar and Oberhelman declined to comment. Not all CEOs have been winners, however. Coca-Cola Co CEO Muhtar Kent, who contributed $2,700 to Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival for president, saw the value of his options decline by $11.3 million to $143 million. Coca-Cola shares are off 3 percent since Trump was elected amid lingering concerns about consumers cutting their consumption of sugary drinks. A Coca-Cola spokesman declined to comment.   © 2017 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved. Click Here to comment on this article Close  More ways to share...

The grain-yielding grass is such a hearty plant that it is grown on more land than any other crop in the world. After four straight seasons of record harvests, bins are bulging from Kansas to Western Australia and prices are near the lowest in a decade. But there are signs the glut may not last much longer, or at least that supplies may tighten enough to halt the four-year slump in wheat futures. Farmers are planting less because many are losing money. At the same time, global consumption is at an all-time high. And the risk of crop-damaging weather lingers over key exporting countries this year. “It’s difficult to be overly bullish,” said Benjamin Bodart, a director at adviser CRM AgriCommodities in Newmarket, England. “The world is still awash with wheat. You cannot deny it. But when you dig a bit further, the downside now is fairly limited.” While many money managers remain bearish — they’ve bet on lower prices for 17 months straight — wheat is expected to gain in 2017 for the first time in five years, according to a Bloomberg survey of 13 analysts. Rabobank says there is a “real possibility” of a supply shock in the U.S. and Europe if farmers shift to more profitable crops, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. predicts a stockpile drop this year of 8.4 percent. It’s not difficult to see why the market slumped for so long. Wheat used in everything from bread to cakes and noodles thrives in all sorts of climates, and every few months there are crops being harvested somewhere in the world. Global production will reach an all-time high of 751.3 million metric tons once the current Southern Hemisphere harvest is complete, leaving stockpiles at 252.1 million tons, the most ever, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Lower Prices Prices tumbled 13 percent last year to $4.08 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, touching a 10-year low of $3.8675 on Aug. 31 and extending the longest stretch of annual losses since 1999. The grain was one of the biggest commodity losers of 2016 and is down by more than half from its high in 2012. Milling wheat in France dropped 3.2 percent to 168 euros a ton, capping a four-year slide of 32 percent. Russia, the world’s top exporter, said on Dec. 28 that its 2016 wheat harvest jumped 19 percent, more than analysts forecast. Farmers in Argentina are harvesting what will probably be their biggest crop since 2012, according to CRM AgriCommodities. And because wheat is sold in dollars on global markets, the currency’s strength is boosting the incentive for growers outside the U.S. to ship more, even with lower prices. “For prices to move substantially higher from here, we need to see some signs of supply being restricted, either by a weather event or by the fact that production levels are curtailed,” said Fiona Boal, director of commodity research at London-based Fulcrum Asset Management LLP, which oversees about $5.2 billion. Already the prolonged slump in prices has discouraged farmers. The London-based International Grains Council in November predicted a decline in global planting. That includes fewer acres for top consumer China and declines for major exporters, including the U.S., Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan. Century Low In the U.S., the No. 2 exporter, growers probably seeded the fewest acres of winter wheat in at least 104 years, according to the average estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before a Jan. 12 USDA report. Winter wheat, the most-common variety grown in the country, is sown in the fall, goes dormant during the coldest months of the year, and is harvested in the spring. Some farmers in Kansas, the largest U.S. producer of winter wheat, could lose money on every bushel, according to data from Kansas State University in Manhattan. The crop cost about $5.04 a bushel to grow in the state’s south-central areas, including land and labor expenses. That’s below the average national cash price for hard red wheat of $3.38 as of Jan. 6. Wheat Surplus A big reason for the wheat glut in recent years was mostly beneficial weather, which allowed crops to flourish and yields to improve. That may not last, Tracey Allen, an agricultural commodities analyst at JPMorgan in London, said in a Nov. 23 report. In December, the condition of dormant U.S. wheat crops declined, including in Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado, the USDA reported on Jan. 3. Parts of those states have received less than half of normal precipitation since early October, according to U.S. Drought Monitor. Through March 31, drought is likely to persist in western Kansas, eastern Colorado and most of Oklahoma, according a seasonal outlook from National Weather Service. In parts of Ukraine, the fifth-largest exporter, the layer of snow that protects plants from freeze damage may be insufficient to shield some crops during a cold snap, researcher UkrAgroConsult said Jan. 5. The country has since been hit by snow blizzards and storms with temperatures of minus 25 degrees Celsius (minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit) in western regions, broker Veles-Agro said on Jan. 9. Wheat Stockpiles With the USDA predicting global wheat consumption rising 3.5 percent to a record 734.3 million tons in the 2016-17 season, JPMorgan says inventories will drop in 2018 to 228 million tons from an estimated 249 million this year. Prices in 2017 will reach $4.50 a bushel and advance to $4.81 in 2018, according to the median estimates of analysts in the Bloomberg survey.

Analysts say there are signs a global wheat glut won’t last much longer and that prices for wheat have bottomed out. Comments aAFont Size Wheat is the weed that feeds. The grain-yielding grass is such a hardy plant that it is grown on more land than any other crop in the world. After four straight seasons of record harvests, bins are bulging from Kansas to Western Australia and prices are near the lowest in a decade. But there are signs the glut may not last much longer, or at least that supplies may tighten enough to halt the four-year slump in wheat futures. Farmers are planting less because many are losing money. At the same time, global consumption is at an all-time high. And the risk of crop-damaging weather lingers over key exporting countries this year. "It's difficult to be overly bullish," said Benjamin Bodart, a director at adviser CRM AgriCommodities in Newmarket, England. "The world is still awash with wheat. You cannot deny it. But when you dig a bit further, the downside now is fairly limited." While many money managers remain bearish -- they've bet on lower prices for 17 months straight -- wheat is expected to gain in 2017 for the first time in five years, according to a Bloomberg survey of 13 analysts. Rabobank says there is a "real possibility" of a supply shock in the U.S. and Europe if farmers shift to more profitable crops, and JPMorgan Chase predicts a stockpile drop this year of 8.4 percent. It's not difficult to see why the market slumped for so long. Wheat, used in everything from bread to cakes and noodles, thrives in all sorts of climates, and every few months there are crops being harvested somewhere in the world. Global production will reach an all-time high of 828.1 million tons once the current Southern Hemisphere harvest is complete, leaving stockpiles at 278 million tons, the most ever, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Prices tumbled 13 percent last year to $4.08 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, touching a 10-year low of $3.87 on Aug. 31 and extending the longest stretch of annual losses since 1999. The grain was one of the biggest commodity losers of 2016 and is down by more than half from its high in 2012. Milling wheat in France dropped 3.2 percent to $161 a ton, capping a four-year slide of 32 percent. Russia, the world's top exporter, said on Dec. 28 that its 2016 wheat harvest jumped 19 percent, more than analysts forecast. Farmers in Argentina are harvesting what will probably be their biggest crop since 2012, according to CRM AgriCommodities. And because wheat is sold in dollars on global markets, the currency's strength is increasing the incentive for growers outside the U.S. to ship more, even with lower prices. "For prices to move substantially higher from here, we need to see some signs of supply being restricted, either by a weather event or by the fact that production levels are curtailed," said Fiona Boal, director of commodity research at London-based Fulcrum Asset Management, which oversees about $5.2 billion. Already the prolonged slump in prices has discouraged farmers. In November, the London-based International Grains Council predicted a decline in global planting. That includes fewer acres for top consumer China and declines for major exporters, including the U.S., Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan. In the U.S., the No. 2 exporter, growers probably seeded the fewest acres of winter wheat in at least 104 years, according to the average estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before a Jan. 12 USDA report. Winter wheat, the most-common variety grown in the country, is sown in the fall, goes dormant during the coldest months of the year, and is harvested in the spring. Some farmers in Kansas, the largest U.S. producer of winter wheat, could lose money on every bushel, according to data from Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kan. The crop cost about $5.04 a bushel to grow in the state's south-central areas, including land and labor expenses. That's below the average national cash price for hard red wheat of $3.38 as of Friday. A big reason for the wheat glut in recent years was mostly beneficial weather, which allowed crops to flourish and yields to improve. That may not last, Tracey Allen, an agricultural commodities analyst at JPMorgan in London, said in a Nov. 23 report. In December, the condition of dormant U.S. wheat crops declined, including in Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado, the USDA reported on Jan. 3. Parts of those states have received less than half of normal precipitation since early October, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Drought is likely to persist through March 31 in western Kansas, eastern Colorado and most of Oklahoma, according a seasonal outlook from the National Weather Service. In parts of Ukraine, the fifth-largest exporter, the layer of snow that protects plants from freeze damage may be insufficient to shield some crops during a cold snap, researcher UkrAgroConsult said last week. The country has since been hit by snow blizzards and storms with temperatures of minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit in western regions, broker Veles-Agro said on Monday. With the USDA predicting global wheat consumption rising 3.5 percent to a record 734.3 million tons in the 2016-17 season, JPMorgan said inventories will drop in 2018 to 228 million tons from an estimated 249 million this year. Prices in 2017 will reach $4.50 a bushel and advance to $4.81 in 2018, according to the median estimates of analysts in the Bloomberg survey. They are up 4.7 percent so far this year in Chicago at $4.27 a bushel, off to the best start since 2010. Rabobank predicts futures will rally in each quarter this year, ending at at an average of $4.60 in the fourth quarter. "Right now, we've fully digested all these big supplies, meaning big Russian crop, European crop, Australia, Canada, U.S.," which means the slump in prices is mostly over, said Matt Ammermann, a commodity risk manager at brokerage INTL FCStone in Plymouth, Minn.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 3:30 PM, January 11, 2017 Updated: 4:40 PM, January 11, 2017 BOSTON - Donald Trump once described Jamie Dimon as "the worst banker in the United States," but the president-elect has helped make the boss of JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> $50 million richer. Dimon is the top beneficiary among the 30 chief executives who run companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index from a stock rally inspired by Trump's election, according to a Reuters analysis of their option grants. Trump's proposed policies for lower taxes, less Wall Street regulation and more infrastructure spending have energized the U.S. stock market since the real estate magnate's Nov. 8 victory. The post-election rally even resurrected the value of an option award held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N> CEO Lloyd Blankfein that was worthless on the eve of the election. Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has seen his stock options surge in value by more than $50 million to $146 million since the Republican candidate's White House win. Trump criticized Dimon in 2013 for reaching a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government over the sale of toxic mortgages instead of fighting the case. Nevertheless, he appointed Dimon to the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of high-profile business leaders he set up last month to advise him on economic growth and job creation. Dimon declined to comment on Trump's criticism or the rise in value of his holdings. JACKPOT Stock options held by Dow 30 CEOs surged in value by 23 percent to about $1 billion in 2016, with most of the gain coming after Trump’s election win. The figures reflect outstanding stock options that could be exercised at the end of 2015. Options that expired or vested in 2016 were excluded from the analysis. In a few cases, CEOs exercised some of those options during 2016, U.S. regulatory filings show. Visa Inc <V.N> CEO Charles Scharf did not need a Trump-led stock rally to hit the jackpot. About two weeks before the election, he exercised nearly 800,000 options for gross proceeds of almost $33 million, U.S. regulatory filings show. He resigned from Visa effective Dec. 1. For a look at how the post-election rally has affected Dow 30 stock options, click here (http://tmsnrt.rs/2iCbvvT) Trump campaigned on the slogan "Make America Great Again," vowing to bolster the prospects of the American working class by preventing jobs from moving abroad, restricting immigration and renegotiating trade pacts. In 2015, Trump called high salaries paid to CEOs a "joke" and a "disgrace" and said these were often approved by company boards stacked with CEOs' friends. PRO-BUSINESS AGENDA To be sure, Trump's election has helped investors big and small. Hopes of a pro-business agenda have driven the Dow 30 close to 20,000 - a level it has never breached - in a boon for workers' retirement plans. "With the recent Trump/Republican win, it appears that investors are getting more excited about potential growth and animal spirits are on the rise," top investment strategists at Morgan Stanley said this month in a wealth management report. "This is likely to lead to the final euphoric stage of this cyclical bull market which could be quite powerful in 2017’s first half." Big stock option gains for Goldman Sachs head Blankfein, American Express Co <AXP.N> CEO Kenneth Chenault and JP Morgan's Dimon may be a surprise, given that their companies have reduced or even eliminated option grants in recent years in favor of stock awards tied to hitting financial targets. Blankfein's 322,104 outstanding options, granted in 2007 with a $204.16 strike price, were under water by $7.3 million on the eve of the presidential election. But by the end of 2016, their value had soared to $11.4 million. That was an $18.7 million swing, thanks to the Trump-inspired stock market rally and the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates, a boost for banks and credit card companies. Blankfein declined to comment. Alan Johnson, managing director of pay consulting firm Johnson Associates in New York, said the big gains for the leaders of American Express, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan reflect how stock option compensation can magnify gains in a company’s share price. “When the stock goes up, with options, you get more leverage,” he said. MEDIOCRE PERFORMANCE Critics of stock options say the grants can produce large amounts of wealth for CEOs even with mediocre performance. One reason is that grants often are not linked to any financial performance metric, such as return on equity. And so as the United States nears the eighth year of a bull market, options can increase in value even if the CEOs are running companies whose share price has lagged broad benchmarks during their tenure. For example, shares of Caterpillar Inc <CAT.N> rose 54 percent during Douglas Oberhelman's tenure as CEO of the big equipment maker from mid-2010 to the end of 2016, while the Dow 30 more than doubled during that span. But the value of Oberhelman's options rallied during his last year as CEO, climbing to $20.3 million after being under water by nearly $9 million at the start of 2016. The options' value got a $10.6 million booster shot after Trump's victory. Caterpillar shares rose 36 percent in 2016, making it one of the best performing stocks on the Dow. Trump has said he would use Caterpillar tractors to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Caterpillar and Oberhelman declined to comment. Not all CEOs have been winners, however. Coca-Cola Co <KO.N> CEO Muhtar Kent, who contributed $2,700 to Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival for president, saw the value of his options decline by $11.3 million to $143 million. Coca-Cola shares are off 3 percent since Trump was elected amid lingering concerns about consumers cutting their consumption of sugary drinks. A Coca-Cola spokesman declined to comment.

"With the recent Trump/Republican win, it appears that investors are getting more excited about potential growth and animal spirits are on the rise," top investment strategists at Morgan Stanley said this month in a wealth management report. "This is likely to lead to the final euphoric stage of this cyclical bull market which could be quite powerful in 2017’s first half." Big stock option gains for Goldman Sachs head Blankfein, American Express Co CEO Kenneth Chenault and JP Morgan's Dimon may be a surprise, given that their companies have reduced or even eliminated option grants in recent years in favour of stock awards tied to hitting financial targets. Blankfein's 322,104 outstanding options, granted in 2007 with a $204.16 strike price, were under water by $7.3 million on the eve of the presidential election. But by the end of 2016, their value had soared to $11.4 million. That was an $18.7 million swing, thanks to the Trump-inspired stock market rally and the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates, a boost for banks and credit card companies. Blankfein declined to comment. Alan Johnson, managing director of pay consulting firm Johnson Associates in New York, said the big gains for the leaders of American Express, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan reflect how stock option compensation can magnify gains in a company’s share price. “When the stock goes up, with options, you get more leverage,” he said. MEDIOCRE PERFORMANCE Read More Critics of stock options say the grants can produce large amounts of wealth for CEOs even with mediocre performance. One reason is that grants often are not linked to any financial performance metric, such as return on equity. And so as the United States nears the eighth year of a bull market, options can increase in value even if the CEOs are running companies whose share price has lagged broad benchmarks during their tenure. For example, shares of Caterpillar Inc rose 54 percent during Douglas Oberhelman's tenure as CEO of the big equipment maker from mid-2010 to the end of 2016, while the Dow 30 more than doubled during that span. But the value of Oberhelman's options rallied during his last year as CEO, climbing to $20.3 million after being under water by nearly $9 million at the start of 2016. The options' value got a $10.6 million booster shot after Trump's victory. Caterpillar shares rose 36 percent in 2016, making it one of the best performing stocks on the Dow. Trump has said he would use Caterpillar tractors to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Caterpillar and Oberhelman declined to comment. Not all CEOs have been winners, however. Coca-Cola Co CEO Muhtar Kent, who contributed $2,700 to Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival for president, saw the value of his options decline by $11.3 million to $143 million. Coca-Cola shares are off 3 percent since Trump was elected amid lingering concerns about consumers cutting their consumption of sugary drinks. A Coca-Cola spokesman declined to comment.

Dimon is the top beneficiary among the 30 chief executives who run companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index from a stock rally inspired by Trump's election, according to a Reuters analysis of their option grants. Trump's proposed policies for lower taxes, less Wall Street regulation and more infrastructure spending have energized the U.S. stock market since the real estate magnate's Nov. 8 victory. The post-election rally even resurrected the value of an option award held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein that was worthless on the eve of the election. Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has seen his stock options surge in value by more than $50 million to $146 million since the Republican candidate's White House win. Trump criticized Dimon in 2013 for reaching a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government over the sale of toxic mortgages instead of fighting the case. Nevertheless, he appointed Dimon to the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of high-profile business leaders he set up last month to advise him on economic growth and job creation. Dimon declined to comment on Trump's criticism or the rise in value of his holdings. JACKPOT Stock options held by Dow 30 CEOs surged in value by 23 percent to about $1 billion in 2016, with most of the gain coming after Trump's election win. The figures reflect outstanding stock options that could be exercised at the end of 2015. Options that expired or vested in 2016 were excluded from the analysis. In a few cases, CEOs exercised some of those options during 2016, U.S. regulatory filings show. Visa Inc CEO Charles Scharf did not need a Trump-led stock rally to hit the jackpot. About two weeks before the election, he exercised nearly 800,000 options for gross proceeds of almost $33 million, U.S. regulatory filings show. He resigned from Visa effective Dec. 1. For a look at how the post-election rally has affected Dow 30 stock options, click here (http://tmsnrt.rs/2iCbvvT) Trump campaigned on the slogan "Make America Great Again," vowing to bolster the prospects of the American working class by preventing jobs from moving abroad, restricting immigration and renegotiating trade pacts. In 2015, Trump called high salaries paid to CEOs a "joke" and a "disgrace" and said these were often approved by company boards stacked with CEOs' friends.

JPMorgan said it will appeal the finding, which awarded Johnny Burris $64,400 in back wages and $100,000 for reputational damage, pain and suffering. The finding by an investigator for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration was released on Tuesday. OSHA, which is part of the Labor Department, said there was “reasonable cause” to conclude that JPMorgan’s decision to terminate Burris resulted in part from employee behavior protected under the anti-retaliation provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. An appeal would be considered by an administrative law judge. “Mr. Burris previously raised these same claims to a Finra panel, with the same basic evidence, and the claims were denied,” JPMorgan spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said in an e-mailed statement. She was referring to a 2014 ruling by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street’s industry-funded brokerage regulator, that he wasn’t wrongfully dismissed. “We look forward to presenting our case in the next step of this process and putting this to rest.” Burris disputes the validity of the Finra ruling. The arbitrators made their decision based on a client complaint that OSHA later found to have been written by a JPMorgan manager, Burris said. OSHA found that the same manager turned two more oral complaints into written ones after Burris was terminated. Expunge Order Under the OSHA finding, JPMorgan would have to clear that complaint and expunge his industry employment record, known as a U5. It would also have to pay him reasonable attorneys’ fees. Burris expressed dissatisfaction with the OSHA decision. “They ruled in my favor but tried to limit the damages to the bank,” he said. OSHA’s San Francisco office, which handled the case, didn’t respond to a request seeking comment on the finding. Burris isn’t the only former JPMorgan adviser to complain of retaliation. A trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 23 in Manhattan federal court in the case of Jennifer Sharkey, a former JPMorgan wealth manager who alleges that the bank fired her in violation of Sarbanes-Oxley whistle-blower protections after she recommended that it investigate whether a wealthy client was involved in illegal activity. Last September, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed an earlier dismissal of the case and sent it back to the lower court. Last June, a Finra arbitration panel found that JPMorgan had defamed three former New Jersey wealth managers by falsely amending their employment records. The bank was ordered by the arbitrators to expunge the advisers’ records. Adviser’s Complaints Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter.

Shortly afterward, he started voicing complaints internally about being pressured by managers to sell more of the bank’s products to his elderly clientele, even if there were better investment options for them. Burris also provided information about his concerns to the New York Times, which featured him in a March 2013 article. In the ensuing months, Burris’s managers frequently discussed how he was selling a low percentage of JPMorgan-managed products, according to OSHA’s written finding. Burris was fired by the bank in November 2012. A JPMorgan manager went outside firm procedure, turned an oral customer complaint into a written one and required Burris to list it on his employment record, “likely blacklisting him and causing him reputational harm,” according to the OSHA finding.

The one-count indictment, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Richard Usher (former Head of G11 FX Trading-UK at an affiliate of The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, as well as former Managing Director at an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase & Co.), Rohan Ramchandani (former Managing Director and head of G10 FX spot trading at an affiliate of Citicorp) and Christopher Ashton (former Head of Spot FX at an affiliate of Barclays PLC) with conspiring to fix prices and rig bids for U.S. dollars and euros exchanged in the FX spot market. “Whether a crime is committed on the street corner or in the corner office, no one gets a free pass simply because they were working for a corporation when they broke the law,” said Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates.  “Today’s indictment reiterates our commitment to holding individuals accountable for corporate misconduct.”   “The charged conspiracy involved competitors manipulating the exchange rate for the hundreds of billions of dollars traded on foreign exchange markets for their benefit and to the detriment of their customers,” said Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Bill Baer.  “We previously secured criminal convictions of the financial institutions involved in the misconduct. Today we seek to hold accountable the individuals who conspired on their behalf.” “These former bank traders are alleged to have gained an unfair advantage on their counterparts by committing corporate fraud involving the manipulation of the foreign currency exchange,” said Assistant Director in Charge Paul M. Abbate of the FBI’s Washington Field Office.  “Their actions affected worldwide trading positions in the global marketplace.  Today’s announcement reinforces the FBI’s commitment to investigate and prosecute individuals responsible for criminally interfering with the global financial markets.” The indictment follows the May 20, 2015 agreements of Barclays PLC, Citicorp, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc to plead guilty to conspiring to fix prices and rig bids for U.S. dollars and euros exchanged in the FX spot market, and to pay criminal fines totaling more than $2.5 billion.  On Jan. 5, 2017, the federal district court in Connecticut accepted those plea agreements and sentenced the banks accordingly. The charge in the indictment carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine.  The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by victims if either amount is greater than $1 million. According to the indictment, from at least December 2007 through at least January 2013, Usher, Ramchandani and Ashton (along with unnamed co-conspirators) conspired to fix prices and rig bids for the euro – U.S. dollar currency pair.  Called “the Cartel” or “the Mafia,” this group of traders participated in telephone calls and electronic messages, including near-daily conversations in a private electronic chat room, to carry out their conspiracy.  Their anticompetitive behavior included colluding around the time of certain benchmark rates known as fixes, such as coordinating their orders and trading to manipulate the price of the currency pair by the time of the fix.  In another example of collusion, the conspirators coordinated their orders and trading to manipulate the price of the currency pair, such as by refraining from entering orders or trading at certain times. The charge in the indictment is merely an allegation, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. The Department of Justice has now charged six individuals in the FX investigation.  On July 20, 2016, fraud charges were brought by the Justice Department’s Criminal Division against two FX executives for conspiring to defraud a client of their bank through a front running scheme.  On Jan. 4, 2017, an antitrust charge and plea agreement were announced for a trader in connection with a conspiracy to manipulate emerging market FX rates. This investigation is being conducted by the FBI’s Washington Field Office.  This prosecution is being handled by the Antitrust Division’s New York Office.  The Criminal Division’s Fraud Section also provided substantial assistance in this matter. The charge in this case was brought in connection with the President Obama’s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force.  The president established the task force to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes.  With more than 20 federal agencies, 94 U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and state and local partners, it is the broadest coalition of law enforcement, investigatory and regulatory agencies ever assembled to combat fraud.  Since fiscal year 2009, the Justice Department has filed over 18,000 financial fraud cases against more than 25,000 defendants.    For more information about the task force, please visit www.StopFraud.gov.  Anyone with information concerning price fixing or other anticompetitive conduct in the FX market should contact the Antitrust Division’s Citizen Complaint Center at (888) 647-3258, visit www.justice.gov/atr/contact/newcase.html or call the FBI tip line at (415) 553-7400.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Jan 10, 2017 at 12:01PM It's been a busy week for owners of Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) stock -- and it's only Tuesday. As explained in a series of reports from TheFly.com, Illumina appeared at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference yesterday, where it announced: New guidance indicating that it will report $619 million in sales for Q4 2016 (analysts are still looking for $610 million) The launch of a "single-cell" gene sequencing solution in cooperation with Bio-Rad Labs (NYSE:BIO) A new partnership with IBM (NYSE:IBM) to integrate IBM's Watson artificial intelligence supercomputer with Illumina's own BaseSpace Sequence Hub and tumor sequencing process A separate partnership with Phillips (NYSE:PHG) aimed at large-scale analysis of genetic variation and function A new NovaSeq Series scalable sequencing architecture, to replace its HiSeq architecture dating from 2010, which the company predicts will "one day" permit gene sequencing for just $100 Big news on several fronts. Today, Illumina is reaping its reward in the form of a series of price target hikes from the likes of Leerink and Piper Jaffray -- and scoring a big upgrade to "buy" from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Here are three things you need to know. Gattaca: For Illumina, it's more than a movie; it's a business model. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Up 15% -- and heading higher? Illumina stock is already up 15% today on the news, but according to Bank of America's Merrill Lynch brokerage unit, it could be headed higher. Priced at $163 after today's surge in stock price, Merrill thinks Illumina stock won't stop running before it hits $175 a share -- a gain of 7% more. Of course, even if Merrill Lynch is right, this means that two-thirds of the potential gains have already been priced into Illumina's stock. 2. Is it too late to buy? Once that realization sinks in, many investors may decide that even if Merrill Lynch is right, it is now too late to buy Illumina stock. In fact, Leerink seems to have already come to this conclusion. As TheFly reports, Illumina is planning to sell its new sequencers for anywhere from $850,000 to $985,000 per unit, with shipments to begin in March. But while Leerink praises the introduction of NovaSeq as "meaningful," the analyst also warns that the gene sequencing market is still oversupplied with more machines than its end users can absorb. Leerink grudgingly raised its price target back to $132 this morning (the analyst had just finished cutting its price target less than a month ago), but even so, with Illumina stock selling for nearly $164 a share already, Leerink sees little prospect for further gains in share price -- rather, the opposite. 3. Even Merrill may have second thoughts For that matter, I wouldn't be too awfully surprised if even Merrill Lynch begins rethinking its endorsement of Illumina stock in rather short order -- given how quickly the market has already reacted to its upgrade, and to Illumina's own announcements. Yes, the partnerships with Phillips, IBM, and Bio-Rad are important. Yes, the introduction of new products is also a revenue driver. But as Merrill explains in a write-up (reported on StreetInsider.com this morning), Illumina's real prize is the oncology market, and Merrill doesn't see NovaSeq as cracking that open for Illumina just yet. Ultimately, Merrill would love to see cancer doctors using Illumina's products, and the gene sequencing data they provide, to treat individual cancer patients. But in the meantime, Merrill will be satisfied if the company simply grows its revenue through "the increasing prevalence of precision medicine and use of sequencing by pharmaceutical companies, large scale population studies (including GRAIL), and an emphasis on bioinformatics." The most important thing: Valuation So what kind of growth rates are we looking at here? According to estimates posted on S&P Global Market Intelligence, most analysts still see Illumina growing at no more than 10% annualized over the next five years, and earning $3.27 per share this year, and perhaps $3.77 the year after that. Those are nice numbers to be sure -- but they still leave Illumina stock trading for a current-year price-to-earnings ratio of 50, which seems a bit pricey for a stock growing at 10%. Meanwhile, the $619 million revenue estimate that Illumina provided yesterday, while ahead of estimates, still works out to a growth rate of only 5% when compared to Q4 2015 revenue, so even the 10% growth rate isn't set in stone. Long story short? Illumina has a great story. It's a story that's getting a lot of investors -- and analysts -- excited. But at these prices, maybe it's time they all curbed their enthusiasm a bit.

Nate Raymond NEW YORK — Reuters Published Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017 10:04AM EST Last updated Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017 10:25AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print The U.S. Justice Department was set to bring charges on Tuesday against three ex-traders at JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Barclays Plc arising from a probe into the manipulation of foreign-exchange prices at major banks, a person familiar with the matter said. Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup, and Chris Ashton, formerly of Barclays, are expected to face criminal charges in a case filed in federal court in New York, the person said. The expected charges were first reported by Bloomberg News. Lawyers for Usher, Ramchandani and Ashton could not be immediately identified. The case comes after JPMorgan, Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Citigroup unit pleaded guilty in May 2015 to conspiring to manipulate currency prices, agreeing at that time to pay more than $2.5-billion in criminal fines. Prosecutors have said that from 2007 to 2013, euro-dollar traders at the banks belonging to an electronic chat group called “The Cartel” manipulated benchmark exchange rates in an effort to increase their profits. Last week, a former trader at Barclays and BNP Paribas SA , Jason Katz, pleaded guilty to participating in a price-fixing conspiracy, becoming the first person to admit criminal wrongdoing in the probe. He was the third person to date to face U.S. criminal charges in connection with the foreign-exchange probe. In July, an HSBC Holdings Plc executive, Mark Johnson, was arrested and charged along with a former executive for participating in a fraudulent scheme involving a $3.5-billion currency transaction. Johnson has pleaded not guilty.

REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Illustration By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK NEW YORK The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday brought charges against three former traders at JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Barclays Plc arising from a global probe into the manipulation of foreign exchange rates at major banks. Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup, and Christopher Ashton, formerly of Barclays, were charged with conspiring to restrain trade in an indictment filed at a federal court in Manhattan. The case came after JPMorgan, Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Citigroup unit pleaded guilty in May 2015 to conspiring to manipulate currency rates, agreeing at that time to pay more than $2.5 billion in criminal fines. Those plea deals contributed to the more than $10 billion that some of the world's biggest banks have agreed to pay to resolve U.S. and European probes into the manipulation of foreign exchange rates. The indictment said that from 2007 to 2013, Usher, Ramchandani and Ashton schemed with other euro-dollar traders belonging to an electronic chat group called "The Cartel" to suppress competition in the currency spot market. Usher, JPMorgan's former head of G10 spot trading, and Ramchandani, Citigroup's ex-head of European spot foreign exchange trading, left both banks in 2014. Ashton, Barclays' ex-global head of spot trading, was at the British bank until 2015. All three traders were based in the United Kingdom, according to court papers and their lawyers. All three remain out of custody, the Justice Department said. In addition to the criminal case, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined Usher and Ramchandani $5 million each, and the banking regulator banned them from working in the U.S. banking industry. The U.S. charges came after the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in March said it had closed its own investigation without any individuals being charged, saying there was "insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction." Lawyers for Ramchandani and Usher in statements criticized the Justice Department's decision to bring charges after the SFO had decided not to do so. "The UK authorities looked at the matter very carefully and concluded that there were no offences, and we continue to believe that Mr. Usher has done nothing wrong," said Jonathan Pickworth, a lawyer for Usher. Stephen Pollard, a lawyer for Ramchandani, said his client had been investigated for over 18 months in the UK and was not prosecuted. "It is unacceptable for the American DoJ to by-pass the SFO decision and seek to prosecute conduct undertaken on British soil by British citizens where the British regulators have confirmed there was no criminal offence," Pollard said in a statement. A lawyer for Ashton declined to comment. To date, three other individuals have faced U.S. charges stemming from the probe. Last week, a former trader at Barclays and BNP Paribas SA, Jason Katz, pleaded guilty to participating in a rate-fixing conspiracy, becoming the first person to admit criminal wrongdoing in the probe. In July, an HSBC Holdings Plc executive, Mark Johnson, was arrested and charged along with a former executive for participating in a fraudulent scheme involving a $3.5 billion currency transaction. Johnson has pleaded not guilty. The case is U.S. v. Usher et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-cr-19.

Goldman Sachs fell 1.4 percent after Citigroup downgraded the stock, a move that comes ahead of reports by JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo on Friday. JPMorgan was down 0.4 percent, while the other two were flat. Banks have led a record-breaking run in U.S. equities since Donald Trump's election on Nov. 8. But the rally's momentum has stalled of late as investors now wait to see if he can deliver on his promises of fiscal stimulus. The U.S. President-elect will hold a news conference on Wednesday, his first since his election. Wall Street's rally has also led to soaring valuations - the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "It's the increasing weight of valuation in the market that maybe leading to less enthusiasm in 2017. The dollar is going to be a very important factor for the earnings season," said Stephen Wood, chief market strategist, North America for Russell Investments. "We expect a choppy, range-bound U.S. equity market until we get more clarity on earnings." At 9:40 a.m. ET (1440 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 39.38 points, or 0.2 percent, at 19,848, the S&P 500 was down 1.42 points, or 0.06 percent, at 2,267.48 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.56 points, or 0.01 percent, at 5,532.37. The dollar index has risen 4.3 percent since Trump's victory. A strong dollar crimps U.S. companies' revenue from overseas markets. However, S&P 500 companies overall are set to post their strongest quarterly growth in three years, with earnings estimated to have risen 5.8 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Three of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were flat on Tuesday, while five were lower, led by a 0.6 percent drop in telecom services sector. A jump in healthcare stocks helped limit losses. Illumina surged 17.4 percent to $166.17 and was the top boost to the S&P after the diagnostics company gave a strong quarterly forecast and launched a new product. Valeant jumped 10 percent following a deal to sell its Dendreon cancer business and three skincare brands for about $2.12 billion as the troubled firm looks to pay down its more than $30 billion debt. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,502 to 1,063. On the Nasdaq, 1,365 issues rose and 829 fell. The S&P 500 index showed one new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 21 new highs and three new lows.

Tim Shufelt The Globe and Mail Published Sunday, Jan. 08, 2017 5:18PM EST Last updated Sunday, Jan. 08, 2017 7:11PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article As the first earnings season since the U.S. election gets started, investors are eager for evidence that corporate executives’ optimism matches their own. Fourth-quarter earnings season begins in earnest this week with a number of big U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., and Wells Fargo & Co., among the S&P 500 companies to report their results. Amid the wave of financial statements and management conference calls this week, investors will be looking for confirmation that the profit backdrop is strong enough to justify the remarkable rally in stocks. “Will management start to hint at what they expect under different policy prescriptions?” asked Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Royal Bank of Canada’s investment arm. In the two months since Mr. Trump became U.S.president-elect, the market has been bidding up stocks, confident that his agenda will translate into policies that strengthen the U.S. economy. Promises he made through the campaign, such as cuts to household and corporate taxes, increased infrastructure spending, reduced regulations and the repatriation of foreign cash, helped lift U.S. equities to record highs. American banks are arguably the segment of the market set to benefit the most from Donald Trump’s policy agenda. Fewer regulations, rising interest rates and lower taxes could together disproportionately boost bank profits. Plus, if the new administration’s policies mean improving business and consumer confidence, that should translate into a higher propensity to borrow. As of Friday’s close, the S&P 500 index has increased by nearly 10 per cent since early November and 6.4 per cent since election night. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average came within a hair of breaking through the 20,000-point mark for the first time. The KBW bank index, which tracks U.S. financial shares, is up 23 per cent since the vote. Canadian markets have been nearly as strong, rising 5.7 per cent since Mr. Trump’s victory, led by energy and some financial stocks. This equity strength has happened despite an absence of much concrete news on the earnings front; stock valuations have been rising largely on sentiment. The S&P 500 index now trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 17, based on earnings estimates for the next year, according to FactSet. That compares to a five-year average of about 15 times. As a result, further stock gains are more likely going to have to come from earnings growth rather than continued multiple expansion, according to a number of strategists. That’s what makes this earnings season so important. The fourth quarter is expected to add to the evidence of a turnaround in U.S. profit growth, following the worst earnings recession since the financial crisis. Dragged down by the collapse in energy prices, S&P 500 earnings declined for five consecutive quarters before hitting an inflection point in the third quarter of 2016. Building on that growth, FactSet estimates that when the final numbers are in, fourth-quarter earnings will prove to have grown by 3.2 per cent. If that estimate proves true, earnings growth for the entire 2016 calendar year will amount to 0.1 per cent, with an energy sector decline of 75 per cent proving the overwhelming negative influence, according to FactSet data. Excluding oil and gas stocks, the S&P 500’s earnings growth rate rises to 3.4 per cent for last year. “The stagnation in earnings wasn’t quite what it appeared to be. You had a huge drag from the energy sector and the rest of the market looked quite reasonable,” Mr. Golub said. With the global energy market having stabilized, and with West Texas Intermediate trading at more than double its $26 (U.S.) low set last February, the sector’s growth is expected to turn modestly positive in the fourth quarter, after grinding through eight straight quarters of decline, according to Zacks Investment Research. In addition to energy, the market will be keen for results from the financial sector, which has driven the equity gains of the last two months more than any other. Of course, the policy changes yet to come will have had no effect on fourth-quarter bank profits. Any potential boost to corporate earnings from Mr. Trump’s policies is not likely to materialize for several more quarters. But earnings calls could shed some light on the level of confidence within the financial sector, Mr. Golub said. “If you look at Wall Street analysts, they are unwilling to adjust their estimates, without having more specificity around policies, or at least guidance from management on what those policies might mean for earnings.” Report Typo/Error Follow Tim Shufelt on Twitter: @tshufelt   WFC-NWells Fargo & Co Latest Price$55.31 +0.81 (+1.49%) BAC-NBank of America Corp Latest Price$23.01 +0.09 (+0.39%) JPM-NJPMorgan Chase & Co Latest Price$86.70 +0.46 (+0.53%) SPXS&P 500 INDEX Latest Price2,274.64 +4.20 (+0.18%) Updated January 13 4:00 PM EST. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

The grain-yielding grass is such a hearty plant that it is grown on more land than any other crop in the world. After four straight seasons of record harvests, bins are bulging from Kansas to Queensland and prices are near the lowest in a decade. But there are signs the glut may not last much longer, or at least that supplies may tighten enough to halt the four-year slump in wheat futures. Farmers are planting less because many are losing money. At the same time, global consumption is at an all-time high. And the risk of crop-damaging weather lingers over key exporting countries this year. “It’s difficult to be overly bullish,” said Benjamin Bodart, a director at adviser CRM AgriCommodities in Newmarket, England. “The world is still awash with wheat. You cannot deny it. But when you dig a bit further, the downside now is fairly limited." While many money managers remain bearish - they’ve bet on lower prices for 17 months straight - wheat is expected to gain in 2017 for the first time in five years, according to a Bloomberg survey of 13 analysts. Rabobank says there is a “real possibility” of a supply shock in the US and Europe if farmers shift to more profitable crops, and JPMorgan Chase & Co predicts a stockpile drop this year of 8.4 percent. It’s not difficult to see why the market slumped for so long. Wheat used in everything from bread to cakes and noodles thrives in all sorts of climates, and every few months there are crops being harvested somewhere in the world. Global production will reach an all-time high of 751.3 million metric tons once the current Southern Hemisphere harvest is complete, leaving stockpiles at 252.1 million tons, the most ever, US Department of Agriculture data show. Prices tumbled 13 percent last year to $4.08 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, touching a 10-year low of $3.86 3/4 on August 31 and extending the longest stretch of annual losses since 1999. The grain was one of the biggest commodity losers of 2016 and is down by more than half from its high in 2012. Milling wheat in France dropped 3.2 percent to 168 euros a ton, capping a four-year slide of 32 percent. Shipping more Russia, the world’s top exporter, said on December 28 that its 2016 wheat harvest jumped 19 percent, more than analysts forecast. Farmers in Argentina are harvesting what will probably be their biggest crop since 2012, according to CRM AgriCommodities. And because wheat is sold in dollars on global markets, the currency’s strength is boosting the incentive for growers outside the US to ship more, even with lower prices. “For prices to move substantially higher from here, we need to see some signs of supply being restricted, either by a weather event or by the fact that production levels are curtailed,” said Fiona Boal, director of commodity research at London-based Fulcrum Asset Management, which oversees about $5.2 billion.

The London-based International Grains Council in November  predicted a decline in global planting. That includes fewer acres for top consumer China and declines for major exporters, including the US, Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan. Century low In the US, the number 2 exporter, growers probably seeded the fewest acres of winter wheat in at least 104 years, according to the average estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before a Jan. 12 USDA report. Winter wheat, the most-common variety grown in the country, is sown in the fall, goes dormant during the coldest months of the year, and is harvested in the spring. Some farmers in Kansas, the largest US producer of winter wheat, could lose money on every bushel, according to data from Kansas State University in Manhattan. The crop cost about $5.04 a bushel to grow in the state’s south-central areas, including land and labour expenses. That’s below the average national cash price for hard red wheat of $3.38 as of January 6.  A big reason for the wheat glut in recent years was mostly beneficial weather, which allowed crops to flourish and yields to improve. That may not last, Tracey Allen, an agricultural commodities analyst at JPMorgan in London, said in a November 23 report. In December, the condition of dormant US wheat crops declined, including in Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado, the USDA reported on January 3. Parts of those states have received less than half of normal precipitation since early October, according to US Drought Monitor. Through March 31, drought is likely to persist in western Kansas, eastern Colorado and most of Oklahoma, according a seasonal outlook from National Weather Service. Deep freeze In parts of Ukraine, the fifth-largest exporter, the layer of snow that protects plants from freeze damage may be insufficient to shield some crops during a cold snap, researcher UkrAgroConsult said January 5. The country has since been hit by snow blizzards and storms with temperatures of minus 25 degrees Celsius (minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit) in western regions, broker Veles-Agro said on January 9.

Prices in 2017 will reach $4.50 a bushel and advance to $4.81 in 2018, according to the median estimates of analysts in the Bloomberg survey. Rabobank predicts futures will rally in each quarter this year, ending at an average of $4.60 in the fourth quarter. “Right now, we’ve fully digested all these big supplies, meaning big Russian crop, European crop, Australia, Canada, US,” which means the slump in prices is mostly over, said Matt Ammermann, a commodity risk manager at brokerage INTL FCStone in Plymouth, Minnesota. “We are not going substantially lower."

Bobbi Rebell reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Research in Motion reporting a huge $192 million fiscal first-quarter loss after the closing bell. The BlackBerry maker says shipments for its smart phones fell sharply for the second straight quarter and that it will cut 5,000 jobs. It is also delaying the launch of its next generation phone until early next year. Investors caught off guard by the Supreme Court ruling, which upheld a key part of President Obama's healthcare overhaul. It requires Americans to get health insurance by 2014 - or face a penalty. Shares of insurance companies were under pressure- because of concerns about how much the ruling could cost their bottom lines: Jeffrey Kraws of Crystal Research: SOUNDBITE: JEFFREY KRAWS, CEO, CRYSTAL RESEARCH (ENGLISH) SAYING: "In the insurance sector right now the insurance companies are picking up 30 plus million people who previously weren't included in their coverage. For them unfortunately you are going to have a lot of people who have pre-existing conditions who are very expensive to them that they have to now pick up and cover for a very small premium." The court did strike down the requirement that states dramatically expand Medicaid health insurance for the poor. Banks getting hit hard. JPMorgan Chase will likely lose between $4 and $6 billion on its botched trade according to a person familiar with the matter. That is two to three times the original estimate. The source also said JPMorgan has exited more than half its losing position. U.S. consumer spending still sputtering. The commerce department confirmed the economy grew at an annual pace of 1.9 percent in the first quarter of the year. But consumer spending, which is 70 percent of U.S. economic activity - grew at a lower rate than previously reported. A separate report showed fewer Americans filed for jobless claims last week. In the end it was a losing day on Wall Street; all the major indexes closing to the downside. In Europe, shares closed lower, dragged down by Barclays. Its stock down 15 percent after the bank agreed to pay $453 million dollars to settle allegations it manipulated key interest rates. Bobbi Rebell, Reuters.

The grain-yielding grass is such a hearty plant that it is grown on more land than any other crop in the world. After four straight seasons of record harvests, bins are bulging from Kansas to Western Australia and prices are near the lowest in a decade. But there are signs the glut may not last much longer, or at least that supplies may tighten enough to halt the four-year slump in wheat futures. Farmers are planting less because many are losing money. At the same time, global consumption is at an all-time high. And the risk of crop-damaging weather lingers over key exporting countries this year. “It’s difficult to be overly bullish,” said Benjamin Bodart, a director at adviser CRM AgriCommodities in Newmarket, England. “The world is still awash with wheat. You cannot deny it. But when you dig a bit further, the downside now is fairly limited." While many money managers remain bearish -- they’ve bet on lower prices for 17 months straight -- wheat is expected to gain in 2017 for the first time in five years, according to a Bloomberg survey of 13 analysts. Rabobank says there is a “real possibility” of a supply shock in the U.S. and Europe if farmers shift to more profitable crops, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. predicts a stockpile drop this year of 8.4 percent. It’s not difficult to see why the market slumped for so long. Wheat used in everything from bread to cakes and noodles thrives in all sorts of climates, and every few months there are crops being harvested somewhere in the world. Global production will reach an all-time high of 751.3 million metric tons once the current Southern Hemisphere harvest is complete, leaving stockpiles at 252.1 million tons, the most ever, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Lower Prices Prices tumbled 13 percent last year to $4.08 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, touching a 10-year low of $3.8675 on Aug. 31 and extending the longest stretch of annual losses since 1999. The grain was one of the biggest commodity losers of 2016 and is down by more than half from its high in 2012. Milling wheat in France dropped 3.2 percent to 168 euros a ton, capping a four-year slide of 32 percent. Russia, the world’s top exporter, said on Dec. 28 that its 2016 wheat harvest jumped 19 percent, more than analysts forecast. Farmers in Argentina are harvesting what will probably be their biggest crop since 2012, according to CRM AgriCommodities. And because wheat is sold in dollars on global markets, the currency’s strength is boosting the incentive for growers outside the U.S. to ship more, even with lower prices. “For prices to move substantially higher from here, we need to see some signs of supply being restricted, either by a weather event or by the fact that production levels are curtailed,” said Fiona Boal, director of commodity research at London-based Fulcrum Asset Management LLP, which oversees about $5.2 billion. Already the prolonged slump in prices has discouraged farmers. The London-based International Grains Council in November predicted a decline in global planting. That includes fewer acres for top consumer China and declines for major exporters, including the U.S., Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan. Century Low In the U.S., the No. 2 exporter, growers probably seeded the fewest acres of winter wheat in at least 104 years, according to the average estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before a Jan. 12 USDA report. Winter wheat, the most-common variety grown in the country, is sown in the fall, goes dormant during the coldest months of the year, and is harvested in the spring. Some farmers in Kansas, the largest U.S. producer of winter wheat, could lose money on every bushel, according to data from Kansas State University in Manhattan. The crop cost about $5.04 a bushel to grow in the state’s south-central areas, including land and labor expenses. That’s below the average national cash price for hard red wheat of $3.38 as of Jan. 6.  Wheat Surplus A big reason for the wheat glut in recent years was mostly beneficial weather, which allowed crops to flourish and yields to improve. That may not last, Tracey Allen, an agricultural commodities analyst at JPMorgan in London, said in a Nov. 23 report. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

Parts of those states have received less than half of normal precipitation since early October, according to U.S. Drought Monitor. Through March 31, drought is likely to persist in western Kansas, eastern Colorado and most of Oklahoma, according a seasonal outlook from National Weather Service. In parts of Ukraine, the fifth-largest exporter, the layer of snow that protects plants from freeze damage may be insufficient to shield some crops during a cold snap, researcher UkrAgroConsult said Jan. 5. The country has since been hit by snow blizzards and storms with temperatures of minus 25 degrees Celsius (minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit) in western regions, broker Veles-Agro said on Jan. 9. Wheat Stockpiles With the USDA predicting global wheat consumption rising 3.5 percent to a record 734.3 million tons in the 2016-17 season, JPMorgan says inventories will drop in 2018 to 228 million tons from an estimated 249 million this year. Prices in 2017 will reach $4.50 a bushel and advance to $4.81 in 2018, according to the median estimates of analysts in the Bloomberg survey. They are up 4 percent so far this year in Chicago at $4.24 1/4 a bushel, off to the best start since 2010. Rabobank predicts futures will rally in each quarter this year, ending at at an average of $4.60 in the fourth quarter. “Right now, we’ve fully digested all these big supplies, meaning big Russian crop, European crop, Australia, Canada, U.S.,” which means the slump in prices is mostly over, said Matt Ammermann, a commodity risk manager at brokerage INTL FCStone in Plymouth, Minnesota. “We are not going substantially lower."

Will it happen? By Alex Eule Jan. 11, 2017 4:27 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Tesla is scheduled to begin production on its new $35,000 Model 3 car by the middle of the year. Photo: Tesla Motors As the new year hit, executives at Tesla Motors had plenty of reasons to look nervously at their watch. They’re officially on the clock. The company has promised to deliver its first Model 3 cars by the end of the year, with production starting in “mid 2017.” The Model 3 is Telsa’s most important effort yet, as it attempts to become a mass-market car company. The new electric model starts at $35,000 before incentives. Any 2017 deliveries will go to buyers who have already placed orders. New buyers will have to wait until “mid-2018 or later,” according to Tesla’s Model 3 website. But there are still questions about whether Tesla’s timeline is achievable. In a research report on Tuesday that summarized the first day of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman added some details about Tesla’s big year. “We believe Tesla is at a heightened risk of Model 3 timing not beginning on the targeted July 1 start date, and progressing more slowly than implied by Tesla’s guidance for 100,000 to 200,000 Model 3 units in 2017,” Brinkman wrote. Meanwhile, Tesla has some new competition in the affordable electric-car business. General Motors’ Chevrolet unit has already made the first deliveries of its own affordable electric car known as the Bolt. It’s worth noting that Brinkman is one of Tesla’s leading skeptics on Wall Street. He rates the stock at Underweight -- one of four analysts, out of 21, with a Sell or equivalent rating on Tesla shares. But skepticism is probably warranted around Tesla’s big Model 3 delivery goals. Tesla delivered a total of 76,200 vehicles in all of 2016, a figure that came in below the company’s guidance. Big Picture: Tesla has made big promises for 2017, but one analyst is skeptical about the company meeting its targets. More from Barron’s Next Is This As Good as It Gets for T-Mobile?

(Denis Balibouse/Pool Photo via AP) Execs keep tabs on Washington from biotech conference By Paige Winfield Cunningham (@pw_cunningham) • 1/11/17 5:55 PM Paige Winfield Cunningham Senior Healthcare Correspondent The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/Cunningham-4.jpg Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More SAN FRANCISCO — As they duck in and out of investor meetings and company presentations, healthcare executives at the JPMorgan Healthcare Investor Conference are keeping a close eye on Obamacare repeal discussions in Washington. William Carpenter, chief of executive of Lifepoint Health, said his company's lobbyists were texting him Wednesday morning about support for a three-point plan released by Sen. Lamar Alexander, which calls for repealing and replacing the law simultaneously. "Our government relations people have been texting me ... to say Sen. Enzi, chairman of [the Senate Budget Committee], seems to like the Alexander proposal, so we'll see how that plays out," Carpenter said hopefully. Lifepoint, one of the country's largest rural hospital networks, is dreading the possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act by Republicans. Its facilities have been hugely affected by the influx of patients who have health coverage for the first time. Carpenter said about 80 percent of the company's benefits through the law are because of its Medicaid expansion and 20 percent from its marketplace coverage.

Carpenter doesn't want the law repealed, as President-elect Trump has promised. But if that's the route Congress is going, lawmakers should at least pass a replacement concurrently, he said. "Obviously, we are advocates for repeal and replace," he said. "At the same time, we're realistic to know that the campaign was run on 'repeal immediately' and that we'll likely see repeal ahead of replace. "But we're encouraged about the number of Republican senators ... who are speaking up to say we should repeal and replace at the same time," Carpenter added. "So I think there's some positive momentum, and I'm hopeful in that regard."

They currently have $96.00 price target on the financial services provider’s stock. According to Zacks, “JPMorgan's shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Major Regional Banks industry over the last six months. Estimates have been going up ahead of the company’s fourth-quarter 2016 earnings release. Notably, Q4 results should benefit from higher trading revenues driven by increased volatility in the quarter. Also, it is expected to continue witnessing a rise in interest income driven by solid loan growth. Moreover, it remains well positioned to benefit from the latest Fed rate hike. Further, synergies from retail banking performance and cost-containment efforts will help improving its profitability.

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive Dow closes up 99 points Wednesday Jan 11, 2017 at 11:12 AM Jan 11, 2017 at 4:49 PM The Associated Press Energy companies led U.S. stocks modestly higher Wednesday, nudging the Nasdaq composite to its fifth record-high close in a row. Rising crude oil prices gave energy companies a boost, including oil rig operator Transocean, which rose 4 percent. Traders also bid up shares in utilities. Health care stocks fell after President-elect Donald Trump spoke about the need for the government to stem drug costs by creating new bidding procedures. Pharmaceutical company Endo International led the decliners in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, sliding 8.5 percent. The stock market spent much of the day wavering between small gains and losses as investors sized up outlooks from several companies ahead of the latest batch of corporate earnings reports. "The heavy load comes in the coming weeks," said Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "There's a little bit of a wait-and-see on what those earnings numbers look like." The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. The Nasdaq gained 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The index has risen every day this year. During a press conference Wednesday morning, Trump said the government has to create new bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder." The remarks sent health care stocks broadly lower, particularly pharmaceutical companies. At one point, drugmakers and one prescription drug distributor accounted for the nine biggest losers in the S&P 500. Endo International posted the biggest loss, tumbling $1.30 to $14.01. Perrigo slid $5.77, or 6.9 percent, to $77.88. Mallinckrodt slumped $3.31, or 6.2 percent, to $50.44. Not all drugmakers had a bad day. Merck rose 2.9 percent on news that the Food and Drug Administration will do a quick review of one of the company's drugs for its potential to treat a type of lung cancer. The stock added $1.71 to $61.63. Big U.S. companies start reporting fourth-quarter earnings this week. On Friday JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America release their results. "As we look into 2017, we still expect equities are going to be able to grind higher, because we still have enough of an economic push to do that," Dreiling said. "But a move up in equities is going to have to come from earnings, otherwise, these valuations ... look pretty stretched, pretty rich at these levels." Investors had their eye Wednesday on companies that released earnings or forecasts of their upcoming quarterly results. SuperValu slid 7.5 percent after the grocery store operator announced a weak third-quarter profit, partly because of falling food prices. The stock shed 36 cents to $4.43. Traders bid up shares in several companies that projected strong fourth-quarter results. Intuitive Surgical gained $15.96, or 2.4 percent, to $678.16, while medical device maker Stryker added $1.76, or 1.4 percent, to $123.66. Quarterly outlooks from other companies failed to impress investors. Signet Jewelers cut its profit forecast for the fourth quarter and current fiscal year, noting its sales fell 5 percent over the holidays. The stock fell $2.76, or 3.2 percent, to $84.70. Auto parts supplier BorgWarner slid 1.6 percent after it issued a profit and sales forecast that fell short of what Wall Street was anticipating. The stock shed 65 cents to $40.12. The major indexes in Europe were mixed. Germany's DAX rose 0.5 percent, while France's CAC 40 was essentially flat. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.2 percent. Earlier in Asia, a strong earnings forecast from Samsung Electronics helped drive gains on the South Korean stock market, where the Kospi added 1.5 percent and hit its highest close in over a year. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.3 percent. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.8 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, gained $1.46, or 2.7 percent, at $55.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 5 cents to $1.59 a gallon and heating oil rose 4 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures slipped 5 cents to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.36 percent from 2.38 percent late Tuesday. In currency markets, the dollar fell to 115.43 yen from 115.73 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0576 from $1.0560. The pound, which has been declining amid concern that Britain might break off completely from the European Union's single market, gained ground on the dollar. The British currency strengthened to $1.2208 from $1.2163. Among metals, the price of gold rose $11.10 to $1,196.60 an ounce. Silver slipped 2 cents to $16.83 an ounce. Copper was little changed at $2.61 a pound.

The defence giant’s shares nosedived yesterday as management said profit for 2016 was £245million, below the range set out in its update last October. It pointed to uncertainty around payments for refuelling gear supplied to Boeing’s KC-46 aircraft, adding it was still in talks with the client. Cobham's shares nosedived yesterday as management said profit for 2016 was £245m, below the range set out in its update of last October Analysts from JPMorgan said a second rights issue could not be ruled out given the company’s debt position and potential writedown for troubled contracts.

FILE - This July 16, 2013, file photo, shows a Wall Street street sign outside the New York Stock Exchange. The major U.S. stock indexes edged higher in early trading Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2017, as investors looked ahead to the start of corporate earnings reports later in the week. Energy stocks led the gainers as crude oil prices headed higher, while phone and real estate stocks lagged the most. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Energy companies led U.S. stocks modestly higher Wednesday, nudging the Nasdaq composite to its fifth record-high close in a row. Rising crude oil prices gave energy companies a boost, including oil rig operator Transocean, which rose 4 per cent. Traders also bid up shares in utilities. Health care stocks fell after President-elect Donald Trump spoke about the need for the government to stem drug costs by creating new bidding procedures. Pharmaceutical company Endo International led the decliners in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, sliding 8.5 per cent. The stock market spent much of the day wavering between small gains and losses as investors sized up outlooks from several companies ahead of the latest batch of corporate earnings reports. “The heavy load comes in the coming weeks,” said Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve. “There’s a little bit of a wait-and-see on what those earnings numbers look like.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 2,275.32. The Nasdaq gained 11.83 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5,563.65. The index has risen every day this year. During a press conference Wednesday morning, Trump said the government has to create new bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry “because they’re getting away with murder.” The remarks sent health care stocks broadly lower, particularly pharmaceutical companies. At one point, drugmakers and one prescription drug distributor accounted for the nine biggest losers in the S&P 500. Endo International posted the biggest loss, tumbling $1.30 to $14.01. Perrigo slid $5.77, or 6.9 per cent, to $77.88. Mallinckrodt slumped $3.31, or 6.2 per cent, to $50.44. Not all drugmakers had a bad day. Merck rose 2.9 per cent on news that the Food and Drug Administration will do a quick review of one of the company’s drugs for its potential to treat a type of lung cancer. The stock added $1.71 to $61.63. Big U.S. companies start reporting fourth-quarter earnings this week. On Friday JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America release their results. “As we look into 2017, we still expect equities are going to be able to grind higher, because we still have enough of an economic push to do that,” Dreiling said. “But a move up in equities is going to have to come from earnings, otherwise, these valuations … look pretty stretched, pretty rich at these levels.” Investors had their eye Wednesday on companies that released earnings or forecasts of their upcoming quarterly results.

Home Tools Solano News US / World Opinion Features Entertainment Sports Business Real Estate Obituaries Gallery Classifieds Commentary NewsFeed 10,254 219 FAIRFIELD-SUISUN, CALIFORNIA State, national columnists Does Dow hitting 20,000 really matter? By Mohamed El-Erian From page A9 | January 11, 2017 The Dow Jones Industrial Average came tantalizing close to 20,000 on Jan. 6, a record level that is being closely watched (and hyped) by the financial media. At one point during the trading session, it was within 0.37 points, or 0.0002 percent. Most agree that it is just a matter of time before this milestone is attained. The longer-term significance, however, is subject to more debate. Let’s start by acknowledging that the DJIA is far from comprehensive when it comes to analytical content. The index covers a very narrow set of stocks and therefore is lacking in representation. Its calculation methodology also is problematic, placing way too much emphasis on the absolute share price, as opposed to market capitalization. As a result, a few names can move the index significantly – as has occurred recently with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, which account for a substantial part of the upward surge since early November. Nonetheless, the Dow is heavily mentioned when it comes to headline information about stock market performance. Moreover, it is not the only U.S. flirting with record levels. The more representative Standard & Poor’s 500 and Nasdaq are at or near their all-time highs. Accordingly, assessing the implications of the hype about the Dow reaching 20,000 comes down to evaluating the volume of the signal, the influence on investing and business behaviors, and the implications for economic governance. We should have little doubt about the signaling outcomes. Dow 20,000 will be the stuff of front-page headlines of both general-interest and financial newspapers, and will be a trending topic in social media. Photos of celebratory hats and banners will be published widely. And the majority of market professionals will remember where they were when this milestone was attained. Many hope that all this will act as a catalyst for wider participation of the general population – and millennials in particular – in stock ownership. After all, a bigger investor base is the best contributor to a fundamentally healthy and less volatile market. The problem is that it may take a lot more than headlines and social media likes for this to happen. At the most fundamental level, Dow 20,000 does little to reduce the general mistrust of the financial establishment that was heightened by the 2008 global financial crisis and its aftermath. Still too many people believe that the financial markets are “rigged” to benefit “insiders.” Moreover, the stock market’s strong performance stands in stark contrast to the general malaise and unsettling feelings resulting from too many years of low and insufficiently inclusive growth, along with an unusual level of uncertainty regarding economic, financial and political conditions. The same caution is also warranted when it comes to “animal spirits” in the corporate sector. The exuberance associated with the impressive post-election surge in stocks has, until now, been mainly a financial phenomenon. It has made it easier for companies to issue bonds, but has yet to translate into consequential changes in business investment and other productivity-enhancing behaviors that fuel more durable drivers of corporate profitability and economic growth. And this is unlikely to change just with the attainment of a financial milestone. The most consequential immediate impact of Dow 20,000 may in fact have less to do with broadening the investor base and turbo-charging productive business behavior, and more to do with encouraging politicians to step up to their economic governance responsibilities. After all, politicians like to be popular. The main reason the Dow is so close to this record level is the combination of pro-growth policy announcements by the president-elect and the hope that a less-dysfunctional Congress will act on these proposals. Politics can help change market and economic sentiment and, with that, set up a more enabling environment for growth. Indeed, the real hope for investors – and, more importantly, the broader economy – is that this financial milestone ends up helping to encourage and empower a Congress that, for too many years, has failed to step up to its economic governance responsibilities.

Britain intercepted, deciphered and shared the "Zimmermann Telegram."More >    By EILEEN NG Associated Press KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Asian shares were mixed Thursday following President-elect Donald Trump's press conference. Trump offered scant details on policies, disappointing investors hoping for a clearer sense of his plans for trade and economic stimulus. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.9 percent to 19,192.76. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent to 22,916.85, and the Shanghai Composite was also down 0.1 percent at 3,133.80. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,784.40 and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent at 2,080.39. Shares in Southeast Asia were mostly higher. WALL STREET: The Nasdaq hit a fifth record-high close in a row, gaining 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. TRUMP NEWS: Trump's first news conference in nearly six months was an anti-climax, with scant details on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Trump attacked U.S. intelligence services and big pharmaceutical companies, instead of outlining his platform. His comment that the government should change bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder," drove health care stocks lower THE QUOTE: "It is what he didn't mention - fiscal stimulus - that worries market participants. The U.S. dollar rally was based on the assumption that Trump's administration will push through a massive infrastructure building and fiscal stimulus package, which will lead to higher inflation in the future," said Margaret Yang Yan, market analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. "The slump in the U.S. dollar index last night indicated that assumption is now unwinding because the president-elect never even mentioned that key word 'stimulus'." ENERGY: Benchmark crude oil dipped 8 cents to $52.17 a barrel. It rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, fell 2 cents to $55.08. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 114.74 yen from 115.43 on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0576.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Wall Street firms are expected to post the biggest fourth-quarter trading haul since the financial crisis as the U.S. election triggered a frenzy of global markets activity from government bonds to currencies. Fixed-income and stock-trading revenue at the five biggest U.S investment banks rose 20 percent from a year earlier to $17.3 billion, fueled by a 32 percent surge in bond-trading, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The rebound probably will be strongest at Morgan Stanley, the group’s smallest bond shop, with revenue projected to climb 82 percent to $1 billion. The question analysts have for bank executives is whether the fourth quarter heralds a return for bond trading -- traditionally the biggest driver of Wall Street profits -- or a false dawn created by Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election. The election upended expectations for interest rates, economic growth and financial regulation, factors that support higher trading volumes if Trump realizes his economic goals. Investors will need reason to believe further gains are possible, given that the KBW Bank Index climbed 23 percent since the Nov. 8 election. “We need to hear from management” on how much potential upside there is for profits in trading and other areas including lending, said Fred Cannon, head of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, especially on “the sustainability of trading increases.” Driven by higher trading results, particularly on rates and currencies desks, banks’ total fourth-quarter profit is expected to rise 17 percent to $20.7 billion. Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are scheduled to post results on Friday. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will report next week. The election boosted stock-trading volumes as institutional investors snatched up shares of financial firms and smaller companies. Banks are expected to post $6.39 billion in equities-trading revenue, 4 percent more than the previous year, driven by gains at JPMorgan and Citigroup. The coming year could be the first since 2012 that both trading and dealmaking revenue increases, Barclays Plc analysts led by Jason Goldberg wrote in a note this month. Fixed-income trading will expand as companies reprice debt and big U.S. banks gain market share from European firms. Investment banks’ fee-generating businesses will be boosted as mega-mergers are completed and stock sales pick up following a lull, the analysts predicted. One note of caution is coming from the banks themselves. Morgan Stanley President Colm Kelleher said he’s seen “over-exuberance” about how well trading desks were doing. While the first quarter is typically the strongest for traders, in 2016 it was unusually weak as uncertainty over global growth roiled markets. “If you look at underlying flows, yes they’ve picked up, particularly since the election, but the overall fee pool that relates to fixed income and equities is only marginally up on the year,” Kelleher said in a Bloomberg Television interview last month.   © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

With the upward move, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed higher for the seven straight session, reaching a new record closing high. The major averages moved to the upside going into the close, with the S&P 500 reaching a new high for the session. The Dow climbed 98.75 points or 0.5 percent to 19,954.28, the Nasdaq edged up 11.83 points or 0.2 percent to 5,563.65 and the S&P 500 rose 6.42 points or 0.3 percent to 2,275.32. The volatility seen on Wall Street was partly in reaction to President-elect Donald Trump's comments during his first press conference in several months. In his opening remarks, Trump called for new bidding procedures for the drug industry in order to lower prices, claiming the industry is "getting away with murder." "We're the largest buyer of drugs in the world, and yet we don't bid properly," Trump said. "We're going to start bidding and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time." The comments from Trump led to a sell-off by drug stocks, which initially contributed to a sharp pullback by the major averages. During the press conference, Trump also indicated he would hand over control of his companies to his sons Eric and Donald Jr. but not divest from his wide business holdings. Ahead of the press conference, the World Bank said Trump's proposed tax cuts and spending plans could boost U.S. and global growth but noted uncertainty about his trade policies adds to risks. The focus on the comments from Trump came amid another quiet day on the U.S. economic front, with traders looking ahead to closely watched reports on producer prices and retail sales on Friday. Financial giants Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) are also scheduled to release their quarterly results later this week. Sector News Steel stocks showed a strong move to the upside as the day progressed, resulting in a 1.9 percent jump by the NYSE Arca Steel Index. With the gain, the index reached its best closing level in a month. Posco (PKX) and Gerdau (GGB) turned in two of the steel sector's best performances, surging up by 6.7 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively. Considerable strength was also visible among energy stocks, which rebounded along with the price of crude oil. Crude for February delivery surged up $1.43 to $52.25 a barrel after falling sharply in the two previous sessions. The Philadelphia Oil Service Index advanced by 1.6 percent, while the NYSE Arca Oil & Gas Index climbed by 1.3 percent. While software and railroad stocks also saw notable strength, biotechnology stocks posted steep losses following the comments by Trump. The NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index plunged by 3.5 percent, pulling back off its best closing level in well over a month. Significant weakness also emerged among pharmaceutical stocks, as reflected by the 1.7 percent drop by the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in another mixed performance during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.3 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index slid by 0.8 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets all moved to the upside on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index closed just above the unchanged line, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index edged up by 0.2 percent and the German DAX Index rose by 0.5 percent. In the bond market, treasuries closed nearly flat for the second consecutive session. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, edged down by less than a basis point to 2.370 percent. Looking Ahead Trading on Thursday could be impacted by reaction to reports on weekly jobless claims and import and export prices as well as speeches by several Federal Reserve officials. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Trump Takes Power, Manufacturing In Focus -- Economic Preview For Week of January 16 Lazy, or Inefficient?

Banks were among the biggest gainers of last year, with most of their advance coming in the final two months of 2016, following the election of Donald Trump. The sector, which accounted for the bulk of the overall market’s postelection rise, is expected to benefit from two concurrent tailwinds: deregulation under the incoming administration, as well as a rising interest rate environment. The upcoming earnings season—J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.53% Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +1.49% and Bank of America Corp. BAC, +0.39%  are all scheduled to report on Friday—is expected to reinforce bullish sentiment towards the group. Read: Trump effect is the big theme for this earnings season “Are banks growth stocks now? Yes, they are,” Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients published on Tuesday. “The Republican sweep with its lower tax and deficit-led economic growth plans is a major tailwind for banks. We expect more growth, higher rates, less regulation and lower taxes, all of which should drive significant upward revisions to [earnings per share] in 2017.” The firm sees upside of 6% for the group in 2017, with 30% upside looking out to 2018. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF, +0.56%  has seen inflows of $737.5 million thus far in 2017, the second-most of any ETF. The flows have remained positive even as the sector has underperformed both the broader market (the S&P 500 SPX, +0.18%  is up 1.4%), as well as a number of other sectors, including health care XLV, +0.10% and consumer discretionary XLY, +0.37%  . Both of those have gained more than 2% in 2017, while financials are up less than 1%. The flows continued a trend see last year, when the ETF saw inflows of $3.1 billion, the most of any sector fund. Among other funds that track the sector, the PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio KBWB, +0.74%  has seen inflows of $26.4 million in 2017 while the First Trust Nasdaq Bank FTXO, +1.03%  has seen inflows of $2.6 million. On the downside, the SPDR S&P Bank ETF KBE, +1.11%  has seen outflows of $84.9 million. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analysts wrote that “positive results in the fourth quarter could lead to further upward revisions and continued increases in stock prices for the group.” Earnings for components of the Financial Select fund are expected to hit $1.67 a share in 2017, according to a mean estimate of analysts polled by FactSet, which would represent growth of 12.1% over 2016. Double-digit growth is also expected in 2018. See: J.P. Morgan earnings: Expect a strong trading quarter and improved credit markets This story was first published on Jan. 11, 2017.

Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Jan 11, 2017 at 1:32PM Income investors like stocks that pay high dividends, and the companies that create exchange-traded funds have tapped into investors' demand for dividend stocks by creating dividend ETFs like the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM). 2016 was a strong year for the ETF, as it produced a total return of 17%, outpacing gains in the Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 indexes. Yet even though the Vanguard ETF topped the overall market last year, what most investors want to know is whether its 2016 performance points to the likelihood of longer-term success for the fund. Let's take a closer look at the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF to learn more about how it works and why it did so well last year. Image source: Getty Images. Stats on Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF 2016 Total Return 17% Total Assets Under Management $22.7 billion Expense Ratio 0.09% SEC Yield 3.06% 10-Year Average Annual Return 7.1% Data source: Vanguard Group. How Vanguard High Dividend Yield invests Most exchange-traded funds are tied to indexes, with the management team having the goal of matching the performance of the index. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which includes more than 400 stocks of U.S. companies that have paid above-average dividends over the past 12 months. The index excludes real estate investment trusts, which means the ETF doesn't include REITs in its holdings. Over time, the Vanguard ETF has done a good job of matching the performance of its index. Only about 0.10 percentage points separates the index's theoretical return from the actual performance of the Vanguard ETF. That's directly in line with the fund's current expense ratio of 0.09%, suggesting that when you look solely at the way the ETF invests, it's doing a good job of matching performance with minimal friction from transaction costs. What helped the ETF in 2016? The overall gain in the U.S. stock market was the clearest contributor to performance for the Vanguard ETF. But more specifically, strength in many of the fund's largest holdings played a key role in driving its performance, especially because the ETF has almost a third of its assets invested in its 10 top stocks. Among its top 10 stocks as of Nov. 30, the most obvious standouts were in the energy sector. ExxonMobil and Chevron both did well in 2016, with Chevron in particular posting gains of more than 30%. The rise in crude oil and natural gas prices helped bolster the entire sector, and a large number of smaller stocks enjoyed even larger gains that contributed to the ETF's overall gains. Financial stocks also played a role in the Vanguard ETF's outperformance. JPMorgan Chase was a top 10 holding, and it climbed by about a third as conditions in the banking world became more favorable. With rising interest rates and healthier levels of economic activity, JPMorgan and many of its high-yield banking peers were in a position to rebound from a long malaise. What hurt the ETF in 2016? Not all of the Vanguard ETF's picks did that well. General Electric was a high-profile underperformer, rising just 2% in 2016 as prospects for the industrial giant didn't keep up with the rest of the market. Procter & Gamble was another slight disappointment, with mid-single-digit percentage returns that held the ETF back. Beyond the top 10, the ETF had some significant losing stocks. L Brands did particularly poorly, falling more than 27% in a tough retail environment. Still, most of the losses were relatively small, such as Coca-Cola's mild decline in the face of challenges to its sugary soft drink franchise. Does Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF belong in your portfolio? Based on its 2016 performance, Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF got the job done last year. It didn't dramatically outperform the broader market, but it did take advantage of the favorable conditions that helped support many dividend stocks as the bull market continued. Looking forward, the prospects for dividend stocks remain attractive, and the Vanguard ETF will give you a healthy helping of stocks with above-average yields. Although high yields by themselves don't necessarily reflect the health of a dividend stock, Vanguard's process has done a good job of producing good long-term performance for investors.

The new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature card, in partnership with JPMorgan Chase, will be offered exclusively to Amazon Prime members. It will grant 5% back on all Amazon.com purchases, as well as 2% back at restaurants, gas stations, and drugstores, and 1% back on every other purchase, the companies said in a press release Wednesday. Amazon currently offers a rewards credit card to all account holders with 3% back on all Amazon.com purchases. Prime members with this card will be upgraded to the new card — made with metal, like the popular Chase Sapphire Reserve card — and start earning rewards immediately. The card awards $1 for every 100 points. Once members reach 2,000 points, they can redeem them for cash. There's no cap on the amount in rewards that members can earn, and there's no expiration date as long as the account stays open. All points will be lost if a member closes the account linked to the rewards card. While there's no annual fee or foreign transaction fees for the new rewards card, it's available only to those who pay for a Prime account, which costs $99 a year and includes access to free two-day shipping and TV and movie streaming, among other perks. Non-Prime members can upgrade their accounts to apply for the new card. They'll also get a $70 Amazon.com gift card upon approval. The new Amazon-Chase rewards card comes on the heels of the bank's announcement last week that it was slashing its 100,000-point sign-up bonus in half for the Chase Sapphire Reserve, effective January 12.

 Amazon just upgraded its no-fee credit card to offer 5% back on all Amazon purchases — but there's a catch Tanza Loudenback Jan. 11, 2017, 12:21 PM 107,751 facebook linkedin twitter email print The new Amazon rewards card is available only to Prime members. Amazon Amazon just announced an attractive upgrade to its existing rewards credit card — but it's for Prime members only. The new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature card, in partnership with JPMorgan Chase, will be offered exclusively to Amazon Prime members. It will grant 5% back on all Amazon.com purchases, as well as 2% back at restaurants, gas stations, and drugstores, and 1% back on every other purchase, the companies said in a press release Wednesday. Amazon currently offers a rewards credit card to all account holders with 3% back on all Amazon.com purchases. Prime members with this card will be upgraded to the new card — made with metal, like the popular Chase Sapphire Reserve card — and start earning rewards immediately. The card awards $1 for every 100 points. Once members reach 2,000 points, they can redeem them for cash. There's no cap on the amount in rewards that members can earn, and there's no expiration date as long as the account stays open. All points will be lost if a member closes the account linked to the rewards card. While there's no annual fee or foreign transaction fees for the new rewards card, it's available only to those who pay for a Prime account, which costs $99 a year and includes access to free two-day shipping and TV and movie streaming, among other perks. Non-Prime members can upgrade their accounts to apply for the new card. They'll also get a $70 Amazon.com gift card upon approval. The new Amazon-Chase rewards card comes on the heels of the bank's announcement last week that it was slashing its 100,000-point sign-up bonus in half for the Chase Sapphire Reserve, effective January 12. That credit card, which has a $450 annual fee, made waves for its lucrative rewards offerings when it debuted in August. But it included benefits that were perhaps too generous. In December, JPMorgan Chase said it expected an earnings dip in the fourth quarter to the tune of $200 million to $300 million as a result of the card's popularity, according to CEO Jamie Dimon.

The major averages have been bouncing back and forth across the unchanged line. Currently, the major averages are all in positive territory. The Dow is up 84.03 points or 0.4 percent at 19,939.56, the Nasdaq is up 1.45 points or less than a tenth of a percent at 5,553.27 and the S&P 500 is up 3.42 points or 0.2 percent at 2,272.32. The volatility recently seen on Wall Street came as President-elect Donald Trump began his first press conference in several months. In his opening remarks, Trump called for new bidding procedures for the drug industry in order to lower prices. "We're the largest buyer of drugs in the world, and yet we don't bid properly and we're going to start bidding and save billions of dollars over a period of time," Trump said. The comments from Trump led to a sell-off by drug stocks, which initially contributed to a sharp pullback by the major averages. During the press conference, Trump also indicated he would hand over control of his companies to his sons Eric and Donald Jr. but not divest from his wide business holdings. The focus on the comments from Trump come amid another quiet day on the U.S. economic front, with traders looking ahead to closely watched reports on producer prices and retail sales on Friday. Financial giants Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) are also scheduled to release their quarterly results later this week. Sector News Biotechnology stocks showed a substantial move to the downside following the comments from Trump, dragging the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index down by 2.8 percent. The index is pulling back off its best closing level in well over a month. Considerable weakness has also emerged among pharmaceutical stocks, as reflected by the 1.4 percent drop by the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index. Gold stocks are also seeing notable weakness in mid-day trading, with the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index down by 2 percent. The weakness in the sector comes amid a modest decrease by the price of gold. On the other hand, oil service stocks are seeing notable strength, regaining some ground after falling sharply over the two previous sessions. Reflecting the strength in the sector, the Philadelphia Oil Service Index is up by 1.7 percent. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in another mixed performance during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.3 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index slid by 0.8 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets all moved to the upside on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index closed just above the unchanged line, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index edged up by 0.2 percent and the German DAX Index rose by 0.5 percent. In the bond market, treasuries continue to show a lack of direction after ending the previous session nearly flat. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by less than a basis point at 2.370 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Trump Takes Power, Manufacturing In Focus -- Economic Preview For Week of January 16 Lazy, or Inefficient?

Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup, and Christopher Ashton, formerly of Barclays, were charged with conspiring to restrain trade in an indictment filed at a federal court in Manhattan. The three were members of the "Cartel" chatroom in which they are alleged to have shared sensitive client order information to manipulate exchange rates. Below is a timeline on the scandal that consumed the largely unregulated $5.3 trillion-a-day market. 2017 Jan. 10: U.S. Department of Justice indicts three London-based former traders and members of "The Cartel" chatroom, Rohan Ramchandani, Richard Usher and Chris Ashton. Jan. 4: Former Barclays trader Jason Katz becomes the first person to admit criminal wrongdoing in the FX probe, pleading guilty to U.S. charges to participating in a price-fixing conspiracy. 2016 March: Britain's SFO closes its FX investigation without having brought any charges, saying "the alleged conduct, even if proven and taken at its highest, would not meet the evidential test required to mount a prosecution for an offence contrary to English law." 2015 Nov.: Ex-Citi trader Perry Stimpson wins his unfair dismissal hearing at an employment tribunal in London. May: The U.S. DOJ fines six banks (Citi, JP Morgan, HSBC, RBS, Barclays and Bank of America Merrill Lynch) a total of $6 billion. The first five pleaded guilty to felony charges, while BAML was fined for compliance failures. 2014 Dec.: Former RBS trader Paul Nash is the first individual to be arrested. Nov.: British and U.S. authorities fine six of the world's biggest banks - Citi, JP Morgan, HSBC, RBS, UBS and Bank of America Merrill Lynch - a total of $4.3 billion for failing to prevent their traders sharing clients' order information and attempting to manipulate the market. Nov.: The Bank of England fires chief dealer Martin Mallett, and announces it has scrapped the regular chief dealers meetings for good. July: Britain's Serious Fraud Office formally opens investigation into FX rigging. March: The Bank of England suspends Martin Mallett, and appoints Lord Anthony Grabiner to lead an independent investigation into what the Bank knew of alleged currency market collusion and manipulation. Feb.: The Financial Stability Board, the world's top financial regulator which coordinates policy for the G20, says it will review FX fixings. Feb.: New York's banking regulator opens its investigation. Jan.: Citi fires chief dealer Rohan Ramchandani, a member of the BoE-chaired chief dealers group and the first trader in the unfolding scandal to be sacked. 2013 Dec.: Several banks, including JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank ban traders from multi-dealer electronic chatrooms. Oct.: The investigation goes global. The DOJ, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England, and Switzerland's market regulator all open probes. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority says it is cooperating. Sept.: Swiss bank UBS provides the U.S. Department of Justice with information on FX allegations in the hope of gaining antitrust immunity if charged with wrongdoing. July: A scheduled chief dealers meeting for July 4 never takes place. June: Bloomberg News reports dealers used electronic chatrooms to share client order information to manipulate benchmark exchange rates at the 4:00 p.m. London "fixing". These chatrooms had names such as "The 3 Musketeers" and "The Cartel". Feb.: The chief dealers group meets for what will be the last time. 2012 April: As the Libor scandal reaches its zenith, the regular FX chief dealers meeting included a "brief discussion on extra levels of compliance that many bank trading desks were subject to when managing client risks around the main set piece benchmark fixings," BoE minutes say. 2008 July: A meeting of the BoE's FX Joint Standing Committee's chief dealers sub-group discusses the suggestion "that using a snapshot of the market may be problematic, as it could be subject to manipulation," BoE minutes say. May: Minutes of a meeting of the FX chief dealers say there was "considerable discussion" on the benchmark "fixings" again. Spring: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York makes enquiries into concerns surrounding benchmark Libor interest rates, sharing its analysis and suggestions for reforms with "the relevant authorities in the UK." 2006 July: Minutes of a chief dealers meeting say the group discussed "evidence of attempts to move the market around popular fixing times by players that had no particular interest in that fix. It was noted that 'fixing business' generally was becoming increasingly fraught due to this behaviour." 2005 July: The first meeting of the Bank of England's FX Joint Standing Committee's chief dealers sub-group. These get-togethers between top London-based FX traders and senior BoE officials will become known as the chief dealers meetings. They will be held regularly every year up to 2013, where the traders and Bank officials will discuss market trends and issues. Every meeting will be chaired by BoE chief dealer Martin Mallett.

The major U.S. stock indexes edged higher in early trading Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2017, as investors looked ahead to the start of corporate earnings reports later in the week. Energy stocks led the gainers as crude oil prices headed higher, while phone and real estate stocks lagged the most. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Asian shares were mixed Thursday following President-elect Donald Trump's press conference. Trump offered scant details on policies, disappointing investors hoping for a clearer sense of his plans for trade and economic stimulus. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.9 percent to 19,192.76. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent to 22,916.85, and the Shanghai Composite was also down 0.1 percent at 3,133.80. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,784.40 and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent at 2,080.39. Shares in Southeast Asia were mostly higher. WALL STREET: The Nasdaq hit a fifth record-high close in a row, gaining 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. TRUMP NEWS: Trump's first news conference in nearly six months was an anti-climax, with scant details on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Trump attacked U.S. intelligence services and big pharmaceutical companies, instead of outlining his platform. His comment that the government should change bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder," drove health care stocks lower THE QUOTE: "It is what he didn't mention - fiscal stimulus — that worries market participants. The U.S. dollar rally was based on the assumption that Trump's administration will push through a massive infrastructure building and fiscal stimulus package, which will lead to higher inflation in the future," said Margaret Yang Yan, market analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. "The slump in the U.S. dollar index last night indicated that assumption is now unwinding because the president-elect never even mentioned that key word 'stimulus'." ENERGY: Benchmark crude oil dipped 8 cents to $52.17 a barrel. It rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, fell 2 cents to $55.08. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 114.74 yen from 115.43 on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0576.

His comment that the government should change bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry “because they’re getting away with murder,” drove health care stocks lower Advertisement THE QUOTE: “It is what he didn’t mention – fiscal stimulus — that worries market participants. The U.S. dollar rally was based on the assumption that Trump’s administration will push through a massive infrastructure building and fiscal stimulus package, which will lead to higher inflation in the future,” said Margaret Yang Yan, market analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. “The slump in the U.S. dollar index last night indicated that assumption is now unwinding because the president-elect never even mentioned that key word ‘stimulus’.” ENERGY: Benchmark crude oil dipped 8 cents to $52.17 a barrel. It rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, fell 2 cents to $55.08. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 114.74 yen from 115.43 on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0576.

Energy stocks led the gainers as crude oil prices closed higher. Health care stocks were down the most after President-elect Donald Trump said the government needs to overhaul how it buys drugs from pharmaceutical companies. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average was up 68 points, or 0.3 percent, to 19,923 as of 1:22 p.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,272. The Nasdaq composite index gained 5 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,557. The Nasdaq has closed at a record high the past four days in a row. VIDEOS TOP JOBS THE QUOTE: The stock indexes have been drifting between small gains and losses for much of the day, likely because investors are looking ahead to the next wave of corporate earnings reports, which kick off Friday, noted Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "The heavy load comes in the coming weeks," Dreiling said. "There's a little bit of a wait-and-see on what those earnings numbers look like." TRUMP FACTOR: During a press conference Wednesday morning, Trump said the government has to create new bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder." The remarks sent health care stocks broadly lower. Several pharmaceutical companies slumped, with Endo International falling 7.6 percent, the biggest decliner in the S&P 500. The stock slid $1.16 to $14.15. Perrigo lost $6.33, or 7.6 percent, to $77.33. Mallinckrodt tumbled $3.24, or 6 percent, to $50.51. UNAPPETIZING RESULTS: SuperValu slid 7.1 percent after the grocery store operator announced a weak third-quarter profit, partly because of falling food prices. The stock shed 34 cents to $4.45. SALES SLUMP: Signet Jewelers fell 3.5 percent after the company cut its profit forecast for the fourth quarter and current fiscal year. Signet said its total sales fell 5 percent over the holidays, citing technical problems at its e-commerce business. The stock fell $3.09 to $84.37. DISAPPOINTING FORECAST: Auto parts supplier BorgWarner was down 1.7 percent after it issued a profit and sales forecast that fell short of what Wall Street was anticipating. The stock shed 69 cents to $40.08. FASTER IS BETTER: Drugmaker Merck rose 2.3 percent on news that the Food and Drug Administration will do a quick review of one of the company's drugs for its potential to treat a type of lung cancer. The stock added $1.41 at $61.33. HEALTHY OUTLOOK: Intuitive Surgical gained 2.4 percent after the robotic surgical systems maker delivered a strong fourth-quarter sales forecast. The stock rose $15.86 to $678.06. EARNINGS SEASON: Big U.S. companies start reporting fourth-quarter earnings this week. On Friday JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America release their results. Still, investors had their eye on a few companies that released quarterly results Wednesday. MARKETS OVERSEAS: Germany's DAX rose 0.5 percent, while France's CAC 40 was essentially flat. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.2 percent. In Asia, a strong earnings forecast from Samsung Electronics helped drive gains on the South Korean stock market, where the Kospi added 1.5 percent and hit its highest close in over a year. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.3 percent. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.8 percent. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, gained $1.46, or 2.7 percent, at $55.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 5 cents to $1.59 a gallon and heating oil rose 4 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures slipped 5 cents to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. BONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.37 percent from 2.38 percent late Tuesday. CURRENCIES: The pound continued to weaken amid concern that Britain might break off completely from the European Union's single market. The currency was trading at $1.2201, up from $1.2163 the day before. The dollar fell to 115.49 yen from 115.73 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0575 from $1.0560. METALS: The price of gold rose $11.10 to $1,196.60 an ounce. Silver slipped 2 cents to $16.83 an ounce. Copper was little changed at $2.61 a pound.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Kirby: Wait'll you see how much the Mormon church pays me How much do top Mormon leaders make?

The OCC also fined Messrs. Usher and Ramchandani $5 million each for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act, engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, and breaching their fiduciary duties related to their conduct in the foreign exchange (FOREX) market. The OCC found that beginning in as early as December 2007 and continuing until at least January 2013 (Relevant Period), Messrs. Usher and Ramchandani were FOREX spot traders with their respective banks who primarily traded the euro, including the euro/U.S. dollar (EUR/USD) currency pair.  Throughout the relevant period, Usher and Ramchandani engaged in near daily conversations with each other and other EUR/USD spot traders at competing financial institutions in a permanent electronic chat room that referred to itself, and was known in the market, as the “Cartel.” Through their participation in the Cartel chat room, Messrs. Usher and Ramchandani engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, breached their fiduciary duties, and entered into and engaged in a conspiracy with other euro traders in the chat room to suppress or eliminate competition and increase, decrease, fix, maintain, or stabilize prices in the FOREX Spot Market. Specifically, Messrs. Usher and Ramchandani and other traders in the Cartel chat room:  (i) coordinated trading in the EUR/USD currency pair in connection with the World Markets/Reuters FOREX spot benchmarks and European Central Bank reference rates (known as “fixes”); (ii) agreed to withhold bids and offers when one trader in the conspiracy was actively trading so that the price of the currency would not move in a direction adverse to the trader who was actively trading in the market; and (iii) disclosed, discussed, and coordinated currency pair spreads to be quoted to customers.  Messrs. Usher and Ramchandani also disclosed confidential, commercially sensitive bank information, such as customer orders and currency pair spreads, to their respective banks’ competitors in the Cartel chat room. Concurrent with the OCC’s enforcement action, the Department of Justice also issued indictments against Messrs. Usher and Ramchandani for violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act.  In addition, the Federal Reserve announced enforcement actions against another trader in the Cartel chat room. Pursuant to federal law, Messrs. Usher and Ramchandani may request a hearing challenging their respective notice of charges for prohibition and notice of assessment of civil money penalties.

Fixed-income and stock-trading revenue at the five biggest U.S investment banks rose 20 percent from a year earlier to $17.3 billion, fueled by a 32 percent surge in bond-trading, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The rebound probably will be strongest at Morgan Stanley, the group’s smallest bond shop, with revenue projected to climb 82 percent to $1 billion. The question analysts have for bank executives is whether the fourth quarter heralds a return for bond trading -- traditionally the biggest driver of Wall Street profits -- or a false dawn created by Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election. The election upended expectations for interest rates, economic growth and financial regulation, factors that support higher trading volumes if Trump realizes his economic goals. Investors will need reason to believe further gains are possible, given that the KBW Bank Index climbed 23 percent since the Nov. 8 election. “We need to hear from management” on how much potential upside there is for profits in trading and other areas including lending, said Fred Cannon, head of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, especially on “the sustainability of trading increases.” Driven by higher trading results, particularly on rates and currencies desks, banks’ total fourth-quarter profit is expected to rise 17 percent to $20.7 billion. Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are scheduled to post results on Friday. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will report next week. The election boosted stock-trading volumes as institutional investors snatched up shares of financial firms and smaller companies. Banks are expected to post $6.39 billion in equities-trading revenue, 4 percent more than the previous year, driven by gains at JPMorgan and Citigroup. The coming year could be the first since 2012 that both trading and dealmaking revenue increases, Barclays Plc analysts led by Jason Goldberg wrote in a note this month. Fixed-income trading will expand as companies reprice debt and big U.S. banks gain market share from European firms. Investment banks’ fee-generating businesses will be boosted as mega-mergers are completed and stock sales pick up following a lull, the analysts predicted. One note of caution is coming from the banks themselves. Morgan Stanley President Colm Kelleher said he’s seen “ over-exuberance” about how well trading desks were doing. While the first quarter is typically the strongest for traders, in 2016 it was unusually weak as uncertainty over global growth roiled markets. “If you look at underlying flows, yes they’ve picked up, particularly since the election, but the overall fee pool that relates to fixed income and equities is only marginally up on the year,” Kelleher said in a Bloomberg Television interview last month. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Login Search Futures Pointing To Roughly Flat Open On Wall Street - U.S. Commentary January 11, 2017, 08:52:00 AM EDT By RTT News Shutterstock photo (RTTNews.com) - After closing mixed for two consecutive sessions, stocks may continue to show a lack of direction in early trading on Wednesday. The major index futures are currently pointing to a roughly flat open for the markets, with the Dow futures up by just 4 points. Another quiet day on the U.S. economic front may keep some traders on the sidelines ahead of the release of closely watched reports on producer prices and retail sales on Friday. Financial giants Bank of America ( BAC ), JPMorgan ( JPM ), and Wells Fargo ( WFC ) are also scheduled to release their quarterly results later this week. Ahead of the press conference, the World Bank said Trump's proposed tax cuts and spending plans could boost U.S. and global growth but noted uncertainty about his trade policies adds to risks. The press conference, Trump's first since late July, comes amid reports that the Russian government has collected compromising information about the incoming president. Trump blasted the reports in a series of posts on Twitter, calling the news "fake" and accusing "crooked opponents" of trying to belittle his victory. Among individual stocks, shares of SuperValu ( SVU ) may come under pressure in early trading after the supermarket operator reported third quarter adjusted earnings that came in well below analyst estimates. Jewelry retailer Signet Jewelers ( SIG ) could also move to the downside after saying its same store sales fell 4.6 percent during the holiday season. The company subsequently lowered the high end of its fourth quarter earnings guidance. Meanwhile, shares of MSC Industrial (MSM) may see early strength after the company reported better than expected first quarter results and provided upbeat guidance. Stocks turned in another relatively lackluster performance during trading on Tuesday before eventually ending the day mixed. The major averages closed on opposite sides of the unchanged line for the second consecutive session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed higher for the sixth straight session, climbing 20.00 points or 0.4 percent to a new record closing high of 5,551.82. The S&P 500 ended the day unchanged at 2,269.90, while the Dow dipped 31.85 points or 0.2 percent to 19,855.53. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in another mixed performance during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.3 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index slid by 0.8 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets have all moved modestly higher on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index has inched up by 0.1 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the German DAX Index are both up by 0.3 percent. In commodities trading, crude oil futures are climbing $0.29 to $51.11 a barrel after tumbling $1.14 to $50.82 a barrel on Tuesday. Gold futures, which inched up $0.60 to $1,185.50 an ounce in the previous session, are rising $2.30 to $1,187.80 an ounce. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 116.14 yen compared to the 115.77 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Tuesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0508 compared to yesterday's $1.0554 For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com http://www.rttnews.com This article appears in: News Headlines Referenced Symbols: BAC , JPM , SIG , SVU , WFC More from RTT News Subscribe Canadian Stocks Rise, Led By Financials -- Canadian Commentary Stocks Close Mostly Higher But Dow Dips Slightly - U.S. Commentary The Swiss Stock Market Climbed On The Strength Of The Bank Stocks Related stocks Articles Subscribe How a Roth IRA Can Help You Make the Most of Social Security 1/15/2017 08:02 PM 1 Company Pioneering the AI Revolution 1/15/2017 06:21 PM Simple Ways to Maximize Your Social Security Benefits 1/15/2017 06:08 PM See headlines for BAC Follow on: Featured Brokers Compare Online Brokers Most Popular Highest Rated Argentina sparks trade war by nationalizing YPF Eurozone risk grows as Spanish yields top 6 percent End of the euro as we know it End of a nuclear era in Japan helps push oil prices higher Mad Men 2.0: Advertising in the Digital Age Medical Marijuna, Inc.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average pushed their way into the green after beginning Tuesday below their respective closes on Monday. The two indexes aim to push forward despite the broad decline across sectors and blue-chip companies. The Nasdaq was also striving to finish in the green after the tech-focused index closed at an all-time high for a second consecutive session on Monday. About the Author Milad Nourmohammadi is an associate data analyst for Morningstar. Contact Author | Meet other investing specialists Many investors and market participants will be anxiously awaiting President-elect Donald Trump's news conference Wednesday. Analysts expect the stock rally to continue if Trump is able to provide optimism regarding the markets. Additionally, major companies will commence the corporate earnings season on Friday, as  JPMorgan Chase  and  Bank of America  will be leading the banks due to report. Stocks on the Move Shares of  Valeant Pharmaceuticals   were on the rise Tuesday after the company announced Monday night that it would be selling its Dendreon cancer business to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower Group Co. for $819.9 million in cash. Quebec-based Valeant also disclosed on Monday that it was selling three skin care brands to French giant L'Oréal for $1.3 billion. Valeant CEO Joseph Papa stated that the sale will help the company better align its product portfolio and repay its outstanding loan debt.  Yahoo  shares were also on the move Tuesday after the company reported that CEO Marissa Mayer and co-founder David Filo would be resigning from Yahoo's board of directors once  Verizon  completes its acquisition. Yahoo will also change its post-acquisition name to Altaba to reflect its stake in  Alibaba  assets. Foreign Markets Asian markets slumped on Tuesday following less-than-stellar economic news from major countries in the region and uneasiness ahead of Trump's news conference Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was down 0.79%, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.80%. Chinese markets fared no better as the Shanghai Composite Index finished in negative territory, down 0.30% after consumer inflation was shown to have slowed down in December. There are fears among traders that Trump's news conference will include comments criticizing Asian manufacturers. In Japan, specifically, there is worry that the United States may turn on the country as the president-elect looks to place a greater emphasis on American manufacturing. Economic data releases led to Australian markets trading in the red as the country's economy was reported to have contracted in the third quarter--the first time it has done so since early 2011. Rallies from supermarket chains and mining companies had the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index trading higher on Tuesday. Not only has the U.K. benchmark been trading in the green for 11 straight sessions, but it also looks to finish out the trading day with a ninth-straight all-time closing high. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index's momentum slowed, however, after disappointing business updates from major companies, including Lufthansa.

Another quiet day on the U.S. economic front may keep some traders on the sidelines ahead of the release of closely watched reports on producer prices and retail sales on Friday. Traders are likely to keep an eye on a press conference by President-elect Donald Trump scheduled to begin at 11 am ET. The press conference, Trump's first since late July, comes amid reports that the Russian government has collected compromising information about the incoming president. Stocks turned in another relatively lackluster performance during trading on Tuesday before eventually ending the day mixed. The major averages closed on opposite sides of the unchanged line for the second consecutive session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed higher for the sixth straight session, climbing 20.00 points or 0.4 percent to a new record closing high of 5,551.82. The S&P 500 ended the day unchanged at 2,269.90, while the Dow dipped 31.85 points or 0.2 percent to 19,855.53. The choppy trading on Wall Street came as traders seemed reluctant to make significant moves amid uncertainty about the near-term outlook for the markets. Traders also continue to keep an eye on the performance by the Dow, which climbed within striking distance of 20,000 but was once again unable to break through that key psychological level. The lackluster performance also came amid a relatively quiet day on the U.S. economic front, with traders looking ahead to reports on producer prices and retail sales due on Friday. Financial giants Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are also due to report their quarterly results later this week. While many of the major sectors ended the day showing only modest moves, steel stocks showed a substantial move to the upside. The NYSE Arca Steel Index surged up by 4.9 percent to its best closing level in almost a month. Considerable strength was also visible among airline stocks, as reflected by the 2.4 percent gain posted by the NYSE Arca Airline Index. The rebound by the index came after it ended the previous session at a one-month closing low. On the other hand, oil service stocks came under pressure as the day progressed amid another steep drop by the price of crude oil. Reflecting the weakness in the oil service sector, the Philadelphia Oil Service Index slumped by 1.5 percent. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures are climbing $0.29 to $51.11 a barrel after tumbling $1.14 to $50.82 a barrel on Tuesday. Gold futures, which inched up $0.60 to $1,185.50 an ounce in the previous session, are rising $2.30 to $1,187.80 an ounce. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 116.14 yen compared to the 115.77 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Tuesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0508 compared to yesterday's $1.0554 Asia Most Asian stocks rose on Wednesday even as the recent oil rally appeared to run out of steam and the dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's press conference later in the day. Trump's proposed tax cuts and spending plans could boost U.S. and global growth, while uncertainty about his trade policies adds to the risks, the World Bank said in its latest outlook on the global economy. Japanese shares eked out modest gains as a weaker yen boosted exporters. The Nikkei 225 Index rose 63.23 points or 0.33 percent to 19,364.67, snapping a three-day losing streak. The broader Topix index closed 0.52 percent higher at 1,550.40. Toshiba soared 4.3 percent after its main creditors decided to continue providing financial support to the struggling firm. Australian shares also saw modest strength as resources stocks rallied on higher commodity prices. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index edged up 10.80 points or 0.10 percent to finish at 5,771.50, while the broader All Ordinaries index closed 10.70 points or 0.18 percent higher at 5,823.70. Miners BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group climbed 3-4 percent after iron ore and copper prices surged amid further signs of a pick-up in the Chinese economy and forecasts of strong growth in the U.S. Gold Miners Newcrest and Northern Star rallied 1-2 percent as gold hovered near six-week high on safe-haven demand amid fears of a "hard" Brexit and policy uncertainty in the U.S. ANZ Bank shed 0.3 percent after announcing the sale of its New Zealand-focused asset finance business UDC Finance to Chinese logistics company HNA Group for A$626 million. Bellamy's Australia plunged almost 20 percent as shares in the infant formula maker returned to trade after a nearly month in suspension. Meanwhile, China's Shanghai Composite Index bucked the regional trend to end 24.92 points or 0.79 percent lower at 3,136.75 as the yuan held largely unchanged against the dollar and investors waited for cues from Trump's press conference. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 190.50 points or 0.84 percent to 22,935.35. Europe The major European markets have moved modestly higher on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index has inched up by 0.1 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the German DAX Index are both up by 0.3 percent. Supermarket giant Sainsbury has surged higher in London after posting better-than-expected sales for the third quarter. Volkswagen has also rallied after the German automaker confirmed it is closing in on a deal to settle a U.S. probe into the rigging of diesel-powered cars to cheat emissions tests. Meanwhile, engineering firm Cobham has plunged after its group trading profit for the year ended December 31st fell short of guidance. On a light day on the economic front, official data showed that U.K. industrial production recovered at a faster than expected pace in November. Industrial output climbed 2.1 percent in November from October, when production eased 1.1 percent. Economists had forecast output to rise 1 percent. A separate report showed the U.K. visible trade deficit widened more than expected in November. U.S. Economic Reports At 10:30 am ET, the Energy Information Administration is scheduled to release its weekly report on oil inventories. Crude oil inventories are expected to rise by about 1.2 million barrels in the week ended January 6th. The Treasury Department is also scheduled to release the results of auction of $20 billion worth of ten-year notes at 1 pm ET. Shortly afterward, New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley is due to speak about banking culture from a regulatory perspective at the Culture Imperative -- An Interbank Symposium in New York. Stocks in Focus Shares of SuperValu (SVU) may come under pressure in early trading after the supermarket operator reported third quarter adjusted earnings that came in well below analyst estimates. NOVADAQ Technologies (NVDQ) is also moving sharply lower in pre-market trading after forecasting fourth quarter revenues of $20.2 million and providing revenue guidance for 2017. Jewelry retailer Signet Jewelers (SIG) said its same store sales fell 4.6 percent during the holiday season. The company subsequently lowered the high end of its fourth quarter earnings guidance. Meanwhile, shares of MSC Industrial (MSM) may see early strength after the company reported better than expected first quarter results and provided upbeat guidance. Medical device maker Stryker (SYK) said it expects 2016 adjusted earnings at the high end of its previously stated range of $5.75 to $5.80 per share. Southwest Airlines (LUV) announced the promotion of Thomas Nealon as president and Michael Van de Ven as chief operating officer.

There’s a high likelihood that Bank of America will boost its quarterly payout in 2017. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 11, 2017 at 8:48AM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Nothing is for sure, but I believe it's safe for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) shareholders to assume that the nation's second biggest bank by assets will raise its dividend in 2017, marking the second consecutive year in which it's done so. I say this with a high degree of confidence because it's essentially just echoing what Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan has said since he took over in 2010. In one of his earliest interviews, in 2011, he told Fortune's Shawn Tully that his goal was to first build up the bank's capital levels after which he'd return most of the bank's earnings to shareholders. Moynihan has now accomplished that first objective. As I detailed at the end of last year, Bank of America has more capital than any other big bank. It has $270 billion worth of shareholders' equity compared to JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) $254 billion. Citigroup and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) round out the four biggest banks by capital, at $232 billion and $203 billion, respectively. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. The fact that Bank of America has an abundance of capital is also clear when you look at its regulatory capital ratios. To be considered well-capitalized from the perspective of regulators, Bank of America needs to maintain a 5.875% common equity tier 1 capital ratio. That equates to roughly $90 billion worth of common equity tier 1 capital, or about $80 billion less than Bank of America had at the end of the third quarter. On top of this, one reason Bank of America has so much capital is because its requests to increase its dividend over the past eight years have either been denied by the Federal Reserve, which has veto power over big bank dividend plans, or because it hasn't requested permission in the first place for fear that it would be denied. This is in contrast to JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, the North Carolina-based bank's closest competitors, both of which have increased their dividends annually since 2011. JPM Dividend data by YCharts. The net result is that Bank of America's payout ratio, the share of earnings distributed via dividends, is only 17%. That's half as much as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, which pay out between 30% and 40% of their earnings. This is why Moynihan hopes the incoming presidential administration will follow through on its campaign promise to defang the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, the source of the Fed's veto power over bank dividend plans. As he noted at a recent conference in response to a question about what regulatory changes he would like to see most: For us as a company, just because of where we are, it's about capital return.... It's about getting certainly around the ability to have access to your capital return once you've met all the hurdles. And whether those hurdles move up or down because of various peoples' points of view, the issue is the industry's above them, and now we need to be able to get the capital out. But even if these changes don't come about in 2017, it still seems to me like Bank of America will raise its dividend this year. Unless something bad and unexpected happens at the bank between now and this year's stress tests, the Fed just won't have a credible reason to deny its expected request to return more of its abundant capital to shareholders.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) will soon launch its own branded credit card exclusively for Prime members, which will offer 5% cash back on all Prime purchases. The move is aimed at spurring more buying among the company’s most loyal customers. The car will feature a Visa logo and will be issued by J.P. Morgan Chase. It will also have no annual fee not any foreign transaction fees. There’s no word yet on what sort of interest rate it will carry, but considering Amazon’s legendary low-price business model, it’s probably safe to assume the rate will be very competitive. Along with the 5% cash back on Amazon purchases, the card also rewards shoppers elsewhere. Users will earn 2% back at restaurants, gas stations and drugstores, and 1% back on any other purchase outside of those outlets. The company commented via press release: “We are adding even more value to Prime by offering rewards on Amazon and everywhere else you shop,” said Max Bardon, Vice President at Amazon. … “Hundreds of millions of people shop at Amazon.com and there is no better way to earn rewards for their purchases than Chase’s new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card,” said Kevin Watters, CEO of Chase Card Services. “We are thrilled to be working with Amazon to offer even more value to our cardmembers.” Other features of the new credit card include no cap on earning rewards (which never expire and can be redeemed on Amazon.com), zero fraud liability, and 24/7 concierge service, which is offered through Visa Signature. Amazon.com, Inc. shares rose $0.6 (+0.08%) in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, AMZN has gained 6.14%, versus a 1.31% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Top of the list will be the latest allegations that representatives of the Russian government coordinated with Trump surrogates during the presidential campaign and that the Russians allegedly posses damaging personal information about the president-elect. CNN has that crazy story. Trump’s plans to replace Obamacare will also be high on the list along with how he plans to eliminate potential conflicts of interest with his business, the original purpose of the press conference. Story Continued Below On the economic front, MM hopes someone asks how Trump will decide when America is great again. Will it be a further drop in the jobless rate from an already low 4.7 percent? Will it be a further spike in wages? More manufacturing jobs? A lower trade deficit? And what does he think about Janet Yellen and the Fed possibly hiking rates three more times this year? And what about those tax returns Trump has longed promised? Here’s POLITICO’s list of 13 Questions for Trump. TRUMP RESPONDS TO RUSSIA REPORTS — Via POLITICO: “Trump on Tuesday lashed out at multiple reports that intelligence officials last week presented to him allegations that Russia had compromising information about him, dismissing the articles as ‘fake news’ peddled by his political opponents. ‘FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!’ Trump tweeted on Tuesday evening” Read more. DIGGING IN THE DOCUMENT — Per a DC source: “Once you get past the salacious stuff, one of the more interesting tidbits in ‘the memo’ is meetings in July between Trump intermediaries (Carter Page) and Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin and his crew. … Will be interesting to see how Trump Administration and Congress deal with approval of Rosneft’s biggest deal every with Glencore.” ED DEPARTMENT REACT — Via a GOP Capital Hill aide on Tuesday’s MM item: “It’s good to see Rohit Chopra finally recognize the outsized role the Education Department plays in the student loan market. It is indeed the largest bank in the United States, yet not subject to any of the ‘too big to fail requirements’ that Democrats imposed on SIFIs. “But with this public bank, taxpayers are left holding the entire bag as we watch Title IV programs lurch towards failure — even President Obama’s Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee recognizes this. When will Rohit Chopra and the CFA call for the Education Department to be supervised by the Fed?” FIRST LOOK: THE STATE OF BUSINESS — U.S. Chamber President and CEO Tom Donohue’s at 9:30 a.m. will deliver his annual State of American Business address. Here’s a sneak peak at some of what he will say: “Most of all, business is optimistic because we see a once-in-a-generation opportunity to enact major reforms that could transform the American economy from a low-growth to a high-growth economy … “As a new government comes to town, the Chamber’s overriding focus will be on those policies and reforms that can return robust growth to the American economy.” MNUCHIN HEARING DETAILS — POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt: “Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch … cast doubt on whether Steven Mnuchin will be confirmed as Treasury secretary before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. “The Utah Republican told reporters he hoped to hold a hearing on Mnuchin's nomination before Jan. 20 but ‘I don't know that we will.’ ‘I haven't got his paperwork complete yet,’ Hatch said. ‘We've got to do that before we have the hearing.’” Read more. ROSS ALSO PUSHED BACK — Via POLITICO: “The confirmation hearing for Wilbur Ross … Trump's pick to lead the Commerce Department, has been delayed until next week, the Senate Commerce Committee announced Tuesday night. The hearing, now scheduled for Jan. 18, was planned for Thursday. “Committee Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) and ranking member Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said they postponed the hearing because they had not received Ross's ethics agreement, which the billionaire private equity investor is working on with the Office of Government Ethics and the Department of Commerce, and they wanted to give the officials enough time to finish the review before the hearing.” MM FLASH BACK — From last Thursday: “MM HEARS … things are going a bit slowly with Wilbur Ross’s financial disclosure ahead of his confirmation hearing to be Commerce Secretary. It’s not that there’s anything particularly troubling there, MM hears, it’s just complicated and held pretty tightly by Ross himself.” BALDWIN WANTS GOLDEN PARACHUTE DISCLOSURE — A group of Democratic Senators led by Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.) on Tuesday evening sent a letter “calling for disclosure of [Trump] nominees’ golden parachute bonuses to make sure his administration is free from conflicts of interest.” BESS LEVIN IS BACK — Via POLITICO’s Joe Pompeo: “This one’s sure to become a must-read: A new daily column from Bess Levin, the fearsome former Dealbreaker blogger who joined Vanity Fair’s Hive website a few months ago. It’s called The Levin Report, and it was described to Morning Media as ‘a Playbook of Wall Street culture and bad behavior.’ It’ll go up everyday around 4 pm after trading closes, and it could eventually morph into an email newsletter. (We hope it does!) Check it out. MORE SOARING TRUMP-THUSIASM — HFE’s Jim O’Sullivan: “[W]e … suspect hopes have been raised a bit too much by the Republican sweep, and at least some of the surge in optimism will be reversed. If not, the Fed will probably have to start tightening aggressively. “The latest example of hopes rising was the surge in the NFIB small business optimism index, to 105.8 in December from 98.4 in November and 94.9 in October. The surge was broad-based, but it was led by expectations for the economy to improve and for sales to rise. The 105.8 reading for the NFIB index is the highest since 2004. The level looks high enough now to be consistent with 5 percent-plus real GDP growth.” DAILY … SAY WHAT NOW? — POLITICO’s Madeline Conway: “Donald Trump’s inauguration will feature a ‘soft sensuality’ rather than be a “circus-like celebration,’ according to the chairman of the president elect’s planning committee. “‘What we've done instead of trying to surround him with what people consider A-listers is we are going to surround him with the soft sensuality of the place,’ Tom Barrack, who heads the president-elect’s inaugural committee, told reporters gathered in Trump Tower on Tuesday” Read more. JAMIE DIMON, BULLISH — JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon to Fox Business: “I like the fact that the focus has been on growth and you see it when the — and the talk about the tax policy, you know, regulatory policy. I think growth is going to be very good for all Americans, not just for companies. … On election results: “I was surprised. I think most people were surprised with the results. But I went to sleep at, you know, at one point and woke up and drove to work and was thinking, oh, maybe this would be good for the economy and for the average American. And so I've kind of moved on.” See more. GOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING — So just a few things going on today, from Trump presser to confirmation hearings to who knows what from the intelligence community.

Dems could ask about her tenure on the Wells Fargo board and what she knew about the abuses at the bank … Senate Foreign Relations at 9:00 a.m. holds a hearing on Wayne Tillerson’s nomination to be Secretary of State with Russia ties top of mind. ONE LAST TIME — President Obama gave his farewell address in Chicago Tuesday night, issuing a call for a less poisonous politics and celebrating progress under his administration: “The good news is that today the economy is growing again. Wages, incomes, home values and retirement accounts are all rising again. Poverty is falling again. … “The wealthy are paying a fair share of taxes. Even as the stock market shatters records, the unemployment rate is near a 10-year low. The uninsured rate has never, ever been lower.” Full text; Video. And here’s Edward-Isaac Dovere on Obama’s farewell, which contained lovely tributes to his wife, daughters, the Biden family and his many dedicated staffers. DEVOS DELAY, EXPLAINED — POLITICO’s Kimberly Hefling: “The time it's taking to complete the ethics check related to Betsy DeVos' vast financial holdings contributed to Republican leaders' decision to delay her Senate confirmation hearing, sources tell POLITICO. The Office of Government Ethics' work is still very preliminary, and Republican leadership was concerned that the paperwork review wasn't complete, sources briefed on the decision told POLITICO. “DeVos is a Michigan billionaire and education activist who is … Trump’s pick to be Education secretary. Democrats, including Sen. Patty Murray, (D-Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the HELP Committee handling her confirmation, have been calling for days for DeVos' confirmation hearing to be delayed until the ethics check is complete.” Read more. ** A message from Financial Services Roundtable: This week, the Financial Services Roundtable’s FinTech Ideas Festival is bringing together leading CEOs from finance and technology to envision the biggest ideas that will shape the future. Follow @FinTechIdeas and checkout the livestream on CNBC.com for the latest out of the Festival in San Francisco. http://bit.ly/FinTechIdeas ** CORPORATE AMERICA GIRDS FOR TRUMP — Reuters’ Lauren Hirsch and Mike Stone: “Some U.S. companies are reviewing potential mergers while others are rethinking job cuts or looking at their manufacturing operations in China for fear of being cast as ‘anti-American’ by … Trump, according to Wall Street bankers, company executives and crisis management consultants. “Having seen some of America's largest companies, including General Motors Co, Lockheed Martin Corp and United Technologies Corp, bluntly and publicly rebuked by Trump on Twitter, many others are worried they may be his next target - especially if they have significant overseas manufacturing, have had U.S. job cuts or price increases for consumers.” Read more. TILLERSON TAX TROUBLES — NYT’s Jesse Drucker: “As he prepares for a confirmation hearing on becoming secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, Exxon Mobil’s former chief executive, wants to hold on to a big benefit: deferring income taxes on company shares worth around $174 million. “But tax experts say the plan devised by Exxon Mobil to let him do that could run into trouble with the Internal Revenue Service.” Read more. WELLS OVERHAUL — AP’s Ken Sweet: “Wells Fargo announced a complete restructuring Tuesday of how it pays tellers and other bank branch employees, with incentives now tied to how often customers use their accounts, as the company tries to right itself after a scandal over its aggressive sales practices. “The long-anticipated plan has been considered a high priority for CEO Tim Sloan and Mary Mack, the head of Wells Fargo's community bank division - both of whom took those jobs after the scandal emerged. Wells Fargo had already announced in September that it was getting rid of the sales goals that led employees to open up to 2 million unauthorized accounts.” Read more. CROSS PARTY MERGER — Business Insider’s Matt Turner: “Electronifie, a bond-trading platform led by former Goldman Sachs trader Amar Kuchinad, is in exclusive talks to be acquired by TruMid, another trading startup backed by George Soros and Peter Thiel. “The two firms are new entrants to the world of electronic bond trading, and set out to help match buyers and sellers in the bond market at a time when many are complaining about reduced liquidity. The combination would combine the two platforms' user bases, creating a single platform with 350 institutional users and 60 broker-dealers.” Read more. VW TO PLEA GUILTY — Washington Post’s Steven Overly and Todd C. Frankel: “German automaker Volkswagen said Tuesday it plans to admit guilt to settle criminal and civil investigations brought by U.S. officials related to its diesel emissions cheating scandal, a rare admission of criminal wrongdoing by a major company. “VW’s admission of guilt struck analysts as both a sign of the strength of the government’s case and the fastest route for an automaker trying to escape damaging headlines that have poured out for more than a year, since the scandal broke.” Read more. CORPORATE BOND BOOM — CNBC’s Patti Domm: “Companies have issued a whopping $65 billion in high-grade debt so far since Jan. 2, the most ever for this time of year. The beginning of the year is normally an active period, but the amount issued so far is already more than half the $125.6 billion issued during the full month of January 2016 — and that was also a record, according to data analysis firm Informa Global Markets. “The gusher of new debt also coincidentally comes as Congress is about to discuss corporate tax reform, which could include eliminating the deductibility of interest paid on debt.” Read more. DOJ CHARGES UK TRADERS — FT’s David Lynch and Caroline Binham: “British-based currency traders who dubbed themselves the ‘Cartel’ were charged by US prosecutors on Tuesday as part of their investigation into manipulation of the $5.3tn-a-day foreign exchange market. “The DoJ is said to be keen to press ahead with various investigations still on its books before the change in administration on January 20. Many senior staff at the DoJ will be replaced once Donald Trump becomes president.” Read more. OIL BOOST — Bloomberg’s Rakteem Katakey: “Seven of the world’s largest energy companies will together boost oil and natural gas output by 398,000 barrels a day, the most since 2010, according to data from Oslo-based consultant Rystad Energy AS.

Take Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock on a Bullish Test Drive View All Posts Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), a Dow Jones Industrial Average constituent and the country’s second largest financial institution, reports fourth-quarter earnings Friday morning. The big question that awaits: Will BofA’s corporate confessional be enough to drive BAC stock even higher, or will the mega-bank miss expectations? Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr We’ll take a look at recent announcements from Bank of America, BAC’s stock chart and what the options market is suggesting to traders. Bank of America’s Earnings Picture Ahead of Bank of America’s Q4 earnings release, analysts are forecasting profits of 38 cents per share. Range estimates are from 35 cents to 42 cents. Wall Street expectations imply an increase of 35% in earnings growth over the year-ago period’s result of 28 cents and a sequential decline of 7.25%. Revenues are estimated to grow by 7% to $20.9 billion compared to 2015’s sales of $19.5 billion. Sequentially, BAC is forecast to decline modestly by 3%. Most recently, Credit Suisse chimed in on BAC stock and other financials such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) with a bullish stance. Unsurprisingly, they see an improving yield curve, GDP and more supportive regulatory environment as translating into upwardly-revised top and bottom-lines. Short-Term Trading Record for BAC Stock Bank of America has established a consistent pattern of beating Street profit views by topping estimates in 9 of its last 12 reports. Investor reaction has proven even stronger. Shares have gained immediately following earnings in five of the past six announcements. Working backwards from the most recent release, BAC has moved 0.31%, 3.32%, 2.57%, -1.54%, 0.79% and 3.22% on a close-to-close basis. The net reaction has produced an average gain of 2.19% in the first full session of trading. Variability of 2.02% based on a one-standard-deviation reading yields an estimated range of 0.02% to 4.21%. BAC’s seven-day stock performance has shown a similar net positive result 83% of the time. The average gain has been 3.29%, though a higher standard deviation of 5.69% sets up a bumpier range of -2.40% to 8.98%. BofA’s Stock Chart Click to Enlarge BAC stock has gained more than 100% since last February’s ignominious low of $10.99. And looking at the current price chart, it’s easy enough to establish that Bank of America is in fact in a bullish uptrend. What’s also apparent is an overbought condition in Bank of America shares. Weekly stochastics now are turning lower from extremes. The aggressive way in which BAC stock climbed to its current levels are typically exhaustive and lead to backing and filling.

Now, we must figure out how to achieve this. We can begin by giving young people the skills they need to succeed and modernizing our nation’s education system to help every child to pursue a career after high school. Simply graduating from high school used to lead to a good paying job, but that’s no longer the case. Forty years ago, nearly 75 percent of jobs were for people with a high school degree or less. Flash forward, that number has dropped to below 40 percent today, while wages for these jobs have declined by 15 percent. While it’s clear our economy has changed since the 1970s, our education system has not always kept up. Young people who head straight into the workforce after high school are often not adequately prepared with the right skills that employers desperately need. Moreover, too many of those who go on to post-secondary schools and programs are not aware of the opportunities in the growing number of “middle skill” occupations in our labor market. These are jobs that pay good wages and lead to careers in high-growth industries, such as healthcare, advanced manufacturing and information technology. The ticket to entry for these jobs is a high school degree and some type of post-secondary degree or credential, which they can earn while in high school or soon after graduating. Across the country, employers are struggling to fill positions for machinists, radiology technicians and software developers—jobs that range from middle skill to high skill. The U.S. economy will create more than 16 million good-paying jobs through 2024 that do not require a bachelor’s degree. But employers will find it difficult to find enough people with the skills to fill them. We owe it to America’s young people to prepare them for all of the opportunities available. We put our country’s long-term economic prospects at risk if we don’t invest in the skills that workers and businesses need to succeed. Part of the solution is to invest in education pathways that adequately prepare all students with the technical skills they need to go on to pursue a career. With these pathways, students can graduate and go on to four-year colleges or into post-secondary programs that provide them with in-demand labor market credentials for many advanced-skill jobs and well-paying careers. One area is the healthcare profession, which is in dire need of skilled workers. With more than 44 million Baby Boomers likely in need of greater medical attention over the next decade, the healthcare workforce is not big or skilled enough to meet the demand. For example, we will need to train an additional 28,000 phlebotomists by 2024. These healthcare support workers who draw blood from patients have a bright future in the industry. They earn a median annual wage of over $31,000 and gain access to pathways to other jobs in hospitals, laboratories and healthcare organizations. Ultimately, we must invest more in career preparedness programs. We can’t just look to the president, Congress or state leaders to develop a solution. It is the responsibility of all of us—businesses, educators, labor leaders and elected officials. This week, JPMorgan Chase and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) invested $20 million in 10 state programs to dramatically increase the number of students who graduate from high school prepared for well-paying careers. Developed as part of JPMorgan Chase’s $75 million global New Skills for Youth initiative, each awarded state will work with government, business and education leaders to strengthen career education and create pathways to economic success for all students. This investment is critical because states and local school districts have typically lacked the resources to innovate and strengthen their career education programs. In Washington, D.C., there is also an opportunity to reform career education, which has bipartisan support. ADVERTISEMENT Federal dollars to support high-quality career education programs should be aligned with the progress being made at the state level to increase every child’s prospect of a good job in growing industries nationwide. For example, the U.S. Department of Education recently launched a pilot program to provide federal aid to students for certain non-traditional training programs. This is welcome news for the technology community, which has vacancies for 500,000 jobs and another million jobs that need to be added in the coming decade. We are committed to working with the leaders in every state and city, as well as the new president and Congress, to modernize career education in our schools by shining a spotlight and investing in the programs that are making a measurable difference for all kids. We owe it to our young people to give them a chance to hit the ground running when they finish school in a job that gives them hope and a real shot at a better future.

Business Mitchell Feierstein: Abolish central banks and slay the zombies Mitchell Feierstein Wednesday 11 January 2017 10:38 BST Click to follow The Evening Standard Mitchell Feierstein: The central banking bubble factory forces investors to chase yields resulting in zombie corporations and zombie banks that inhibit growth Matt Writtle It’s different this time — or is it? The US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank have become gargantuan, out-of-control, rogue hedge funds. Global central banks have magicked up hundreds of trillions of dollars in debt and guarantees. Worldwide stock-market valuations are stratospheric — buoyed by share buybacks, funded by record corporate debt and enabled by reckless central bank zero-interest-rate policies. The European Central Bank’s purchase of massive amounts of corporate debt is pouring petrol on this blaze. In 2013, the Bank’s “swerving Mervyn” (King) was replaced by Mark Carney. The Canadian promised “forward guidance,” “escape velocity” and “macro-prudential policies” that would drive the UK’s economy forward by “controlling the business cycle — ending boom and bust”. In my opinion, what Carney has delivered amounts to policy failure. He instituted policies that seemingly avoided regulation, resolution and restructuring of toxic assets. This policy direction will surely end in a UK economic collapse.  As far as I’m concerned, Carney and former chancellor George Osborne used the levers of monetary policy to distort market-pricing mechanisms and normal price signals. As a result, insurance companies and pension-fund portfolios were loaded to the gills with “risky assets” that will bankrupt them when — not if — markets normalise. The manipulation of asset prices, the use of fear to influence the Brexit referendum and the lobbying around climate-change issues present clear evidence that the Bank is anything but “politically independent”. The policies pursued by Carney are to my view clear abuses of its mandate. These actions are farcical and the Bank must be reined in.  A non-elected, Canadian, Bank boss trampled the myth of the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street’s independence. Carney loaded the monetary policy committee with like-minded apparatchiks — creating an idyllic groupthink to rubber-stamp misguided policies that keep the UK’s asset bubbles frothy. His reward for all this? A contract extension until 2019. What could possibly go wrong?  Read more Bank of England urges clarity on EU exit and warns of Trump trade risk All of this has resulted in a UK commercial and residential property bubble that is ready to explode. In Chelsea and Kensington, property transaction volumes have plummeted. Prices collapsed nearly 15% in November as property agents quietly close shop and sack employees across London.  Have the Bank-enabled grotesque bubbles in the bond, stock and property markets or the eight years of “temporary emergency measures” and zero-interest-rate policies created infrastructure investment? Job creation? Savings? No, no and no. It has killed savers, students and seniors while generating record bonuses for chief executives. While earnings may have peaked almost 18 months ago, stock prices keep bubbling and wealth inequality continues to surge to record highs — along with homelessness and underemployment.  Will Carney blame Brexit, Putin or Trump for the upcoming problems? Why not? Certainly, extreme valuations enabled by the Bank recklessly allowing debt, credit and leverage to skyrocket out of this universe had nothing to do with the coming collapse — nothing to see here, look away. It is not only the UK but also global central bank policies that have broken our financial system beyond repair. The world’s oldest bank, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, founded in 1472, is now an insolvent zombie bank thanks to the handiwork of JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and Nomura. They sold Monte billions of dollars of derivative trades it did not understand. These  predictably exploded, leaving the  bank bust.  Read more Monte dei Paschi see-saws as Italian bailout looms JPMorgan, Deutsche and Nomura made a fortune — and Monte’s shareholders and depositors, and EU taxpayers, will get slammed with the massive bailout tab. The new normal is apparently a world of financial fraud where the only rules which apply are too big to fail, bail or jail and too connected to prosecute —steal all you can, while you can,  with impunity.  After the financial crisis, I wrote extensively exposing the toxic “culture of fraud” at Deutsche, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, RBS, Lloyds and Barclays. So what was done? Can you guess the number of staff at these banks jailed for the numerous frauds committed during the Great Financial Crises? Zero. That’s not capitalism! Capitalism doesn’t have zero accountability or zero transparency. This is ethically, financially and socially wrong. Much of it is also, in my opinion, illegal and should be punished by long jail terms. No need for new regulation — we need to enforce existing rules rather than repeatedly turning a blind eye. Market manipulation by central banks has destroyed price discovery in every asset class and market. This has crushed the basic concept of capitalism. Central banks now pick winners and losers rather than letting free markets decide. The Swiss National Bank holds $140 billion in stocks, including shares in Apple, Google and Amazon. Valuations, growth projections and normal business cycles are all unnecessary. The central banking bubble factory forces investors to chase yields resulting in zombie corporations and zombie banks that inhibit growth, infrastructure spending and the creation of productive assets.  Reckless central bank policies have caused mal-investment en masse as the risk of a zombie failure is grossly mispriced. As Albert Einstein said: “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting to achieve a different result.” Our elites, the pay-to-play politicians and their lapdog corporate media, will never allow any changes to the status quo or a disruption to the “illusion of democracy”.  The logic behind this is the belief that the wizards and warlocks at our central banks will bail us out by doing “whatever it takes”. Unfortunately, this won’t happen. We are approaching a collapse of the global financial system that will make 2007–09 look minuscule. Capitalism without bankruptcy is like Catholicism without hell. And right now, we need to audit and abolish the Fed, the Bank and the ECB, which started this mess, and slay the zombies.  Desperate times call for desperate measures; we must create a “new global banking paradigm” — pivoting far away from the West’s broken models, which rely on the same PhD economists, academics and government bureaucrats who have destroyed our global financial system and capitalism, replacing it with a combination of Keynesian economic Kool-Aid and central bank “new normal” Marxism.  My sleeves are rolled up; when can I start?

 The US charged 3 former London-based FX traders over currency rigging Ben Moshinsky Jan. 11, 2017, 3:08 AM 1,036 facebook linkedin twitter email print Traders from BGC, a global brokerage company in London's Canary Wharf financial centre react, as European stock markets open early June 24, 2016 after Britain voted to leave the European Union. REUTERS/Russell Boyce/File Photo US prosecutors accused three former London currency traders of arranging a "conspiracy" to rig the foreign exchange markets. Richard Usher, who worked at both Royal Bank of Scotland and JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, a former Citi banker, and Christopher Ashton, who used to be at Barclays, were charged with "conspiring to fix prices and rig bids for US dollars and euros exchanged in the FX spot market," the DoJ said in a statement. According to the indictment, from 2007 to 2013 the traders were part of a group that called itself "the Cartel" or "the Mafia," which communicated via phone, messages and chat-rooms to collude on the setting of benchmark FX rates known as the fix. They tried to manipulate the fix by "refraining from entering orders or trading at certain times," the DoJ said.  "Today’s indictment reiterates our commitment to holding individuals accountable for corporate misconduct." "Whether a crime is committed on the street corner or in the corner office, no one gets a free pass simply because they were working for a corporation when they broke the law," said Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates. Stephenson Harwood's Sara George, representing Chris Ashton, said:  "He complied fully with what he understood to be the legal and compliance requirements of an English Bank." "The UK Serious Fraud Office conducted a thorough and independent investigation lasting over one and a half years and involving in excess of half a million documents," George said in an emailed statement. "A detailed review of the evidence led the SFO to the conclusion that the alleged conduct, even if proven and taken at its highest, would not meet the evidential test required to mount a prosecution for an offence contrary to English law." The charges follow fines of more than $2.5 billion levied on RBS, Barclays, JP Morgan and Citi in May 2015 after the banks pleaded guilty to conspiring to rig the FX market. "These former bank traders are alleged to have gained an unfair advantage on their counterparts by committing corporate fraud involving the manipulation of the foreign currency exchange,” Paul Abbate, assistant director of the FBI's Washington office, said in the statement. "Their actions affected worldwide trading positions in the global marketplace." The action against the three traders takes the number of individuals charged in the US FX probe to six.  In July last year, two FX executives were charged with conspiring to defraud a client by front-running, which involves trading ahead of a large order to take advantage of the upcoming price move.  This month, another trader was charged with attempting to manipulate emerging market currency rates.

News Business Business News WhatsApp, Brexit, forex cartel: Business news in brief, Wednesday 11 January Tech firms face tough EU privacy crackdown, London banks take Brexit fight to Europe and US prosecutors poised to charge currency ‘cartel’ traders Ben Chapman Wednesday 11 January 2017 07:31 BST Click to follow The Independent Online WhatsApp is one of several technology firms who will be affected by new EU rules Reuters WhatsApp and Gmail face tough EU privacy proposal Online messaging and email services such as WhatsApp, iMessage and Gmail will face tough new rules on how they can track users under a proposal presented by the European Union executive on Tuesday. The web players will have to guarantee the confidentiality of their customers’ conversations and ask for their consent before tracking them online to serve them personalised ads. The proposal by the European Commission extends some rules that now only apply to telecom operators to web companies offering calls and messages using the internet. The Commission is seeking to close a perceived regulatory gap between the telecoms industry and internet giants such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft. The proposal would also allow telecom companies to use customer metadata – such as the duration and location of calls – to provide additional services and make more money, something they are barred from doing under the current rules. However the telecoms industry said the proposal still imposed stricter obligations on them than on web companies. Lise Fuhr, director general of Etno, the European telecoms lobby: “Unlike others, telcos risk being prevented from expanding consumer choice by using traffic and location data for big data analytics, the Internet of Things and connected driving services.” The review of the so-called e-privacy law will also require web browsers to ask users upon installation whether they want to allow websites to place cookies on their browsers. A previous leaked version would have forced browsers to set the default settings as not allowing cookies. Reuters London banks’ Brexit concerns falling on deaf ears Banks with large London operations say they will step up lobbying European officials because they are running out of arguments to convince the Government the industry needs single market access after Britain leaves the European Union. Banks have focussed on pressuring British officials to push for as much market access as possible since voters decided seven months ago to leave the EU. They held fewer meetings with European officials, according to several senior sources in the financial services industry. The focus is shifting because after scores of meetings and research reports, banks, which say they may begin moving staff and operations out of London in the next few months if there is no clarity, feel they are running out of new points to make. The Prime Minister said on Sunday she was not interested in Britain keeping “bits” of its EU membership, interpreted by some as signalling she will favour immigration controls over access to the single market. Banks are now planning a new round of lobbying to highlight how a hard Brexit could harm the EU and the UK. They have identified French politicians, EU regulators and government officials, as key groups to win over. “The battle for Britain is over, the battle for France is about to begin,” said one senior lobbyist. Another senior lobbyist for one of the major global banks said he will spend more time in Brussels this year to target the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and his teams as well as Didier Seeuws, a Belgian diplomat, who is helping coordinate the Brexit negotiations. Reuters ‘Cartel’ traders set to face rigging charges Prosecutors are poised to charge the currency traders at the heart of one of the biggest US market-rigging investigations, according to Bloomberg’s sources. The imminent criminal charges are against members of ‘The Cartel’ chat group, the people said. These traders used instant messages to coordinate the rigging of foreign-exchange benchmarks by sharing confidential customer information, prosecutors have said in antitrust cases that led to guilty pleas by five banks in 2015. The senior dealers who participated in The Cartel were Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup and Chris Ashton, former global head of spot trading at Barclays. Another member, Matt Gardiner, formerly of UBS, has been helping prosecutors build cases against the traders, sources have told Bloomberg. Lawyers for Mr Ashton, Mr Gardiner and Mr Ramchandani declined to comment. Mr Usher’s lawyer didn’t immediately respond to phone and e-mail requests for comment. The men are located outside of the US, meaning they would have to be extradited, a process that can take months, if not years. They are probably going to fight back against the charges, one of the sources said. Bloomberg Boohoo sees sales soar 55% in bumper Christmas Online retailer boohoo.com has upgraded its full-year revenue forecasts following a bumper Christmas trading period. The group said sales in four months to 31 December rose 55 per cent to £114m, driven by a 31 per cent increase in UK sales to £65m. As a result, boohoo expects sales growth of between 43 per cent and 45 per cent in the year to 28 February 2017 – above previous guidance of between 38 per cent and 42 per cent. In December, the online retailer revealed plans to acquire the brand of collapsed US fashion firm Nasty Gal in a $20m (£16m) deal. It came weeks after boohoo acquired rival fashion website Pretty Little Thing for £3.3m and upped its profit outlook following bumper Black Friday trading. Including Pretty Little Thing, the firm now expects group revenue growth to be between 46 per cent and 48 per cent. Joint chief executives Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane said: “Trading in the four months to 31 December 2016 has been strong across all regions. Our strategy offering great pricing, enticing promotions and an ever-broader range of the latest fashion continues to drive growth and enhance customer lifetime value. “In particular, sales momentum in the USA has continued robustly, helped by our strong customer proposition across the Black Friday weekend.” PA Majestic Wine reports best ever Christmas Majestic Wine has notched up its best ever Christmas trading figures as boss Rowan Gormley presses ahead with a transformation plan following a difficult six months. The warehouse wine retailer said like-for-like sales rose 7.5 per cent in the 10 weeks to 2 January, an improvement on the 7.3 per cent increase it recorded last year. Total sales were up 12.4 per cent during the period, with Majestic saying it is on track to meet full year expectations. Mr Gormley said: “Our transformation plan is working and we remain on track to achieve our £500m sales goal. We said that we would be better prepared for Christmas than ever – and the numbers show that we did what we said we would do. “At this stage we are not predicting a change to long-term margin expectations, but we need to retain flexibility to compete in a competitive market.” Majestic Wine swung into the red in November, racking up half-year losses of £4.4m, but said it was at a “tipping point” in its return to profit growth. The company has embarked on a three-year turnaround plan aimed at expanding and retaining its customer base, slowing down branch network expansion, and acquiring new customers for Naked Wines. PA Toshiba ‘asks creditors not to call in loans’ Toshiba met creditors on Tuesday and asked them not to use provisions in debt agreements to call in their loans early, giving the troubled company time to work out a turnaround plan, sources with knowledge of the matter said. It was the first such meeting since the conglomerate, which is still recovering from a $1.3bn (£1.07bn) accounting scandal, shocked investors last month by announcing cost overruns at a US nuclear business bought in 2015 which could now mean a charge against profit topping $4bn. About 80 creditors, including regional banks and life insurance companies, attended the meeting, said the sources, who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly. Toshiba executives briefed creditors about the background leading up to the massive write-down and the schedule of how it would work out the matter, the sources added. The laptops-to-engineering conglomerate confirmed the meeting, but did not provide any further details. Bankers said such a meeting was rather routine for a company in trouble and that, even though credit-rating downgrades after the write-down warning put Toshiba in violation of loan covenants, it was routine for them to grant waivers in such cases to avoid a funding crisis. Toshiba is expected to hold its next meeting with creditors in February, when the company is scheduled to have finalised write-down figures, the sources said. Reuters Pharmaceutical firm sells £1.6bn in assets to begin paying down debt Canadian pharmaceutical firm Valeant will sell just over $2bn (£1.64bn) in assets as it pays down debts after a year and a half of bruising backlash against some of its drug prices and government probes into the way it does business.  Shares of the Canadian pharmaceutical company, down 80 per cent in the past year, jumped 12 per cent before the opening bell.  The company said on Tuesday that it would sell three skincare brands to L’Oreal for $1.3bn. The three product lines, CeraVe, AcneFree and Ambi, generate about $168m in annual revenue.  The announced sale comes a day after Valeant said it would sell Dendreon to China’s Sanpower Group for about $820m.​ AP VW Group sales hit record despite ‘dieselgate’ Volkswagen Group sales jumped 12 per cent in December to take the annual figure to a record 10.3 million vehicles, the carmaker said on Tuesday, even as it grappled with its emissions scandal. Volkswagen Group deliveries including luxury brands Audi and Porsche increased to 933,300 vehicles last month from 834,700 a year earlier, fuelled by double-digit gains in China and the United States, with the total for the year up 3.8 per cent from 9.93 million in 2015, it said. Toyota said last month it expected to end 2016 with sales of 10.09 million vehicles, slightly below an initial forecast of 10.11 million. The Japanese rival had already slipped behind VW on six-month figures and is expected to report full-year deliveries in early February.

Get access now City traders charged with forex rigging Harry Wilson | James Dean January 11 2017, 12:01am, The Times Traders allegedly used instant messaging groups to try to move foreign exchange markets in their favourTOBY MELVILLE/REUTERS American justice officials have charged three London-based City traders with conspiring to rig foreign exchange markets. Christopher Ashton, former head of spot foreign exchange trading at Barclays, Rohan Ramchandani, a former trader at Citigroup, and Richard Usher, JP Morgan’s former chief London-based currency trader, were charged last night by the US Department of Justice. The department said that the traders had fixed benchmark rates for US dollars and euros by sharing information on future business in an electronic chatroom, in which they described themselves as “the cartel” and “the mafia”. None of the men are resident in the United States and therefore would have to be extradited first, potentially setting up a lengthy legal fight.

By Barry Ritholtz Bloomberg Views Published Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017 12:07PM EST Last updated Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017 3:16PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print So the year begins and with it a new presidency. Everyone has ideas how best to invest your money. Simple indexing is the least expensive way to manage capital; no, smart beta is superior; this year we are told (once again) will be when active stock-picking makes its triumphant return. Regardless of how you choose to allocate your assets, there is another way; a much better way; a method that cannot fail in its brilliance and simplicity. Go with the POTUS indexes. Direct your attention to the relentless tweeting of the man who soon will be president. There is valuable information in those 140 characters that can move markets and alter perceptions of corporate fundamentals. This has real alpha-generating possibilities. Whoever is managing your favorite 401(k), hedge fund or trading account should take note. To help you make sense of this, we have created two indexes based on Donald Trump’s tweet and other pre-presidential utterances. Before we get to the specific stocks, I want to offer a bit more about the underlying concept. First it goes without saying that the U.S. president is the most powerful person on the planet. Although the U.S. Constitution places all sorts of constraints on his direct power, his every word is important, whether you agree with him or not. Now consider the companies he has been tweeting or commenting about, both positively and negatively. You will recognize the two distinct groups that this creates, each with very different prospects. In one group are companies that have drawn expressions of approval from Trump. An even greater endorsement is recruiting the senior executives of those companies to be cabinet members or advisers. Let’s call this first group the Oligarch Index, or OLGY. The Oligarch Index includes Colony Capital Inc., CoreCivic Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp., Facebook Inc., Ford Motor Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., PayPal Holdings Inc., Sprint Corp., SoftBank Group Corp. and United Technologies Corp. The other group is made up of those companies that Trump has trashed. We shall call this the Drain the Swamp Index, or SWMP. This includes Amazon.Com Inc., Boeing Co., General Motors Co., Kellogg Co., Lockheed Martin Corp., Macy’s Inc., New York Times Co., PepsiCo Inc., Rexnord Corp., Tesla Motors Inc., Time Warner Inc., T-Mobile US Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Twitter Inc. and Constellation Brands Inc. On the positive, oligarchic side, these are the companies that will help to make America great again: • Colony Capital: Chairman Tom Barrack spoke at the Republican National Convention, and is chairman of Mr. Trump’s inauguration committee. • Exxon Mobil: Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, who has extensive global experience, is Mr. Trump’s nominee to be secretary of State. • Goldman Sachs: Alum Steve Mnuchin is Mr. Trump’s pick for secretary of the Treasury and Gary Cohen, Goldman’s president, is his pick to head the National Economic Council. Besides, how could we have an oligarch portfolio without Goldman? • PayPal: Co-founder Peter Thiel was one of the few techies who had the foresight to back Mr. Trump early; he is also a director of Facebook, a major venue for passing around fake news. • JPMorgan: CEO Jamie Dimon was recruited to be Treasury secretary. He convinced Mr. Trump that he could do more to help make America great again by continuing to run the nation’s largest bank. A good guy and a great banker. • United Technology: The company owns Carrier, which kept jobs in America. Thanks! Now for some of the companies Mr. Trump disparaged, directly or otherwise: • Amazon: Jeff Bezos, CEO, founder and largest shareholder of the online retailer, owns the Washington Post -- Mr. Trump’s least favourite paper. • Boeing: Costs for building the new Air Force One are out of control -- cancel order! • GM: It plans to make cars in Mexico? Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax! • Kellogg: It said that it would no longer advertise on conservative news website Breitbart. Boycott! • Lockheed Martin: F-35s are a disaster -- price out comparable F18! • Macy’s: The retailer dropped Mr. Trump’s clothing lines, and it had a disappointing holiday-sales season and plans to cut 10,000 jobs. Disloyal! • New York Times: It, of course, is failing! • Tesla: Global warming is a Chinese hoax. • Time Warner: It owns CNN, which was so embarrassed by its total support of Hillary Clinton, and yet she lost in a landslide, that they don’t know what to do. • Twitter: It refused to create a “Lying Hillary” emoji; CEO Jack Dorsey was disinvited from Mr. Trump’s Tech Summit. Sad! Rather than a stock-bond mix, think of this as a paired trade -- long OLGY, short SWMP. Can you imagine how much more significant and market-moving those tweets will be once Trump is sworn into office? This is theme investing at its finest. And as you can see from the chart below, you would have done quite well by investing on this basis: Some of you coastal liberal elites might not appreciate the wisdom of building specific portfolios from Mr. Trump’s tweets; that’s just because you don’t understand the new era of populism, viral social media and fact-free politics. You are stuck in the old way of thinking -- growth, valuations, market cap and momentum. That’s old school. Catch up.
