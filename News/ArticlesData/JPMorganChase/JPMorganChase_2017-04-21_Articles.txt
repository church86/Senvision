Telstra’s shares fell 12% in three days, a substantial decline for a stock that is widely held by money managers and retail investors. The stock has since rallied 6% from its lows. There are plenty of analysts who think the threat from TPG has been overplayed. JPMorgan JPM -1.2039742840444185% JPMorgan Chase & Co.

He reckons the barebones network won’t be good enough to attract customers who pay a premium to access Telstra’s network, which provides much wider coverage. Plus, TPG’s network is two to three years away from having an impact on the industry. Pan has a target price of AUD5 a share. Deutsche Bank’s DBK.XE -0.3021148036253776% Deutsche Bank AG U.S.: NYSE USD16.5 -0.05 -0.3021148036253776% /Date(1492808523188-0500)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 6049345 AFTER HOURS USD16.66 0.16 0.9696969696969697% Volume (Delayed 15m) : P/E Ratio N/A Market Cap 31693965950.7161 Dividend Yield 1.2266515151515152% Rev. per Employee 422792 More quote details and news » DBK.XE in Your Value Your Change Short position Craig Wong-Pan is another bull, upgrading the stock to buy in the wake of last week’s selloff. While admitting TPG will impact Telstra’s mobile business, he also notes the new competitor is likely to target more budget conscious subscribers that are customers of Telstra’s rivals. He also notes TPG lacks stores to drive subscriber growth. He has a AUD4.51 price target, adding the stock’s price-earnings multiple trades at a 39% discount to the market. Telstra’s juicy yield has attracted income seeking bargain hunters. The stock is yielding over 7% based on dividends paid over the past 12 months. That yield is even higher for Australian investors once franking credits are taken into account. But should Telstra pay higher dividends or invest more into its network? Bernstein analyst Chris Lane said management may want to consider the wisdom of higher dividends, as committing to higher dividends and not having the cashflow to cover them would be “highly embarrassing”. He reckons this may push future capital management towards buybacks. However, he says the yield at this level is “highly attractive”. JPMorgan’s Pan reckons a dividend cut in unnecessary and reckons “any premature cut in dividend would be an admission of defeat even before it gets started”. Email: robert.guy@barrons.com Comments?

Wall Street banks aren’t buying the White House line that tax reform can be OK’d this year. Even as President Trump on Friday vowed to introduce new details about a tax code overhaul on April 26, major US banks don’t see Congress passing the White House plan before 2018, according to statements by executives and reports put out by the financial institutions. Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley have all recently voiced doubt on such an aggressive tax overhaul timetable. Trump’s insistence on pushing for an Obamacare repeal and replacement is getting in the way, the banks said. “I’m not holding my breath,” Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, told The Post on Friday about the passage of tax cuts. “If you want to do health care before tax, we don’t have a plan and you’ve already lost a few months. How are we going to do this this year?” Last week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said that Washington is likely to be consumed with “sausage-making” for the next nine months. He had previously said he didn’t expect that Trump would sign any tax legislation before January. And Goldman — which has at least a half-dozen alums in the Trump administration — decried the “continued delays” that health care has imposed on the tax reform timeline, according to a note this week. The pessimism flies in the face of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, himself a former Goldman banker, who said on Thursday that he hopes passing a tax plan “won’t take til the end of the year” — even though in February he said he wanted to have it done by August. With a little more than a week before Trump crosses the 100-day mark, there are few details about the Trump tax cut plan — although Mnuchin has said it would be “sweeping.” More On: tax reforms Trump looking to close out first 100 days with a bang Democrats' ridiculous tax attack More delays could kill the Trump tax cut The landmines that could kill Trump's tax cuts One of the key holdups in the tax plan is whether to adopt a 20 percent tax on imports, a hallmark of the House Republican plan that has become increasingly unpopular. “That’s what the US is complaining that other countries do to us now,” Christopher said. “[Exporting countries] could retaliate against us in any number of ways.” Morgan Stanley, which also sees little hope for taxes this year, said that some budget hawks have softened their stances, and can live with “deficit expansion” — meaning they’d cut taxes without finding a way to pay for them. One of the most optimistic outlooks came from Deutsche Bank, which still cautioned investors not to get too excited. “We continue to see a better-than-even chance of tax reform (at least on the corporate side), though more limited in scope than originally advertised,” Joshua Feinman, chief global economist for the bank’s asset management arm, wrote in an April 17 note.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The Perils of the Trump Bump While Trump’s unexpected victory in the presidential election has caused bank stocks to soar, it has also caused valuations in the industry to diverge from the fundamentals. Motley Fool Staff Apr 21, 2017 at 4:09PM No one who owns bank stocks is complaining, as the unexpected outcome of the presidential election caused shares of the nation's leading lenders to surge by double-digit percentages. The issue now, however, is that valuations in the industry have diverged from the fundamentals. What's driving bank stocks currently is speculation about whether the Trump administration will be able to deregulate the financial services industry and thereby boost profits at large banks. In the following segment of Industry Focus: Financials, The Motley Fool's Gaby Lapera and John Maxfield discuss why this is such treacherous territory for investors in bank stocks. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on April 17, 2017. Gaby Lapera: If you've been following the banking sector for at least the last four or five months, you might have noticed that there was something that is now affectionately called the Trump bump, which was right after the election, bank stocks took off. And that's not a coincidence, because one of the things that Trump talked about on the campaign trail over and over again was deregulation and allowing more freedom for the banks. And people drove bank stocks up on the assumption that this regulation was, especially Dodd-Frank, that's really what we're talking about when we say regulation, that that was going to be repealed or changed in such a way that banks would have more freedom, and they were going to be able to drive up their profits. John Maxfield: Yeah. So, what we saw in the election is, bank stocks went up 20%-30% almost immediately. The election happened in November, earnings didn't come out until the middle or beginning of October, and then the Federal Reserve raised rates in December, and then earnings for the fourth quarter didn't come out until January. So there were no fundamental catalysts -- and when I say fundamental catalysts, I mean there was nothing company-specific. It's not like a company came out and said, "We quadrupled our earnings on a year-over-year basis," and everybody thought, "Oh, all banks are going to quadruple their earnings on a year-over-year basis." It was that you had this expectation fueled rally in bank stocks around this idea that if Donald Trump's team at the White House is able to get through easing of the regulations in the banking industry, that that is going to cause profits to go way up. It's hard to see right now how profits at these banks that are earning more money than they've ever end before. Even Bank of America -- which has dug itself out of the financial crisis but is still deep in the throes of seeing its profitability recover -- even it has shot way up. So the question is, what does that mean for investors? And what it means to me is that you have to be really careful in this zone right now, because I don't think we can expect a 25% boost in profit at these big banks that are earning so much money. And JPMorgan Chase is earning more than it's ever earned on a quarterly basis. It's just hard to understand how, even if there are significant deregulatory moves made in this area, that it's going to have such a huge impact on profits. Lapera: Yeah. So basically, the stock-price increase is a gamble by investors thinking that these banks will make way more money than they're already making. And as you pointed out, Maxfield, the banks are already making quite a bit of money. So I'm not 100% sure how they would make even more money just like that as soon as deregulation happens. The other thing to think about is, I think there's a post-election high where everyone was like, "Yeah, he's going to get in there, the first 100 days he's going to get a lot pushed through," and the reality is, in Washington D.C., nothing happens quickly. And that's for a reason; that's a protective thing that D.C. has. I know people hate to hear that, but it's good that people can't make rash decisions and changes to legislation, whether or not they're good. This way, it gives everyone a lot of time to consider what the ramifications of any given legislation will be. But that also means that legislation takes a really long time to push through. And banking regulation, as dry and complex as it is, is probably going to take even longer than other types of regulation. Maxfield: And we saw, with the challenges, trying to get that initial healthcare bill through, that just because there's unity between the branches, Republican-controlled White House, House, and Senate, there are still factions in there that are going to make the legislative agenda difficult to get through. Here is where it gets really dicey for investors. Because bank stocks are up on an expectations-infused rally, it means that investors are thinking and making decisions in the political context. One of the things we know, when a person makes decisions in the political context, is that it is extremely difficult, regardless of which side of the aisle you're on, to make objective, fact-based decisions. In fact, there's this great book, Mistakes Were Made (but Not by Me), that digs into a particular type of behavioral bias known as cognitive dissonance. One of the things that they talk about in that book is, there was a study done where people, Democrats and Republicans, were put into MRIs, and then confronted with information that was either consistent or inconsistent with their political beliefs. And what they saw was, when information that was consistent with your political belief was introduced and you started thinking about it, the area of your brain that is responsible for making deep, analytical insights started firing. But what happened was, if information that you disagreed with politically was introduced, that same area of the brain, they saw, actually shut down. So, what that means is, the way our brain works, when there is information in the political context that we agree with, we incorporate that into our analysis, but the information that we disagree with, we do not incorporate that into our analysis. And in the investing world, which is really unforgiving because you're talking about numbers and money, you need both sides of the story to have a balanced approach. Lapera: Yeah. And I think I actually see where you're going with this. There was a story out of Wisconsin. I will quote to you part of it. "When GOP voters in Wisconsin were asked last October whether the economy had gotten better or worse over the past year, they said worse, by a margin of 28 points. But when they were asked the very same question last month," in March, "they said better, by a margin of 54 points." That's a net swing of 82% between late October 2016 and mid-March 2017. That's crazy, because there's no way the economy has changed that much between October and March. So it really just comes down to people's perceptions of how the economy is doing. And even more than that, when you ask Democrats that same question, it was basically flipped. Democrats were saying, "We think the economy is way worse; we think a recession is imminent." So this is something that I don't know it's ever been seen before, but we're really letting political activity cloud how we're viewing the economy, which fundamentally can alter how you view investing decisions. Maxfield: Right, and the Michigan consumer-confidence survey, which is an even broader survey than the Wisconsin survey, it confirmed the same thing. It found a stark partisan divide between how Democrats view the economy and how Republicans view the economy. In fact, I can't remember if it was January or February when it was the largest partisan divide that survey had ever seen, but I think it narrowed a bit in a more recent month, but it's still relatively wide. To your point, what they have seen is, since Donald Trump has taken office, optimism among Republicans has shot way, way up, but among Democrats it has shot way down. So Democrats are expecting, generally, an imminent recession. The data shows they're expecting a recession. The Republicans are expecting a robust recovery. This just goes to the point. I think there's two points here. First, consumer-confidence data is more complicated than the headline number. Second, this goes to the point that when you're in the political realm, even when you're making decisions about things that are non-political, i.e., the economy or investing, politics still creeps in and short-circuits a rational, objective, fact based thought process. Lapera: Yeah. I mean, honestly, the truth is probably somewhere in between, because that's generally how it goes with these things. But I think the message we're trying to deliver to you, dear listeners, is that you should do your best to make decisions about companies based on the company's fundamentals. Ignore the outside noise. Don't let it creep in. Focus on what you think is good for a company. Don't make bets on what you think other people are going to do. That's how you evaluate a company. That's how you become a long-term thinker and a long-term investor. Gaby Lapera owns shares of JPMorgan Chase. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 5 Things JPMorgan Chase Wants You to Know Here are the most important insights from JPMorgan Chase's latest conference call with analysts. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Apr 21, 2017 at 1:23PM JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) kicked off first-quarter earnings season for the bank industry last week, reporting a substantial increase in its quarterly profit compared to the year-ago period. Just as important as the quantitative results are the insights shared by the bank's executives on its conference call with analysts. Given this, I mined through the transcript of the call and found five particularly interesting insights relevant to investors. 1. Bringing back Glass-Steagall? A few weeks ago, the president's chief economic advisor and former Goldman Sachs partner, Gary Cohn, intimated that he's in favor of reinstituting the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. This is a big deal for universal banks like JPMorgan Chase, because it would mean that they would have to once again separate their investment and commercial banking operations, as they did in the Great Depression. But JPMorgan Chase's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, doesn't think this commentary will actually lead anywhere: I would also say that the commentary feels unnecessary given where the industry stands on capital liquidity and regulatory reform broadly. And I would further say that it doesn't feel . . . consistent with a level playing field and pro-growth agenda in the U.S. So that's kind of how we feel about it. I can't give you specific reasons to not continue to monitor the situation. But it doesn't feel consistent with the rest of the objectives of the administration. 2. Mortgage regulations need reform Given that the financial crisis was driven by a mortgage-fueled housing bubble, it should come as no surprise that this was one of the first places policymakers looked to ensure that something similar wouldn't happen again. In the opinion of Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, however, they went too far and have since meaningfully impacted economic growth. Referencing his latest shareholder letter, Dimon noted that: My point was about the United States of America and what these things did to the availability of credit to a certain class of people. . . . And the shocking thing to me is the absolute size of that, which we think could be $300 billion to $500 billion a year. That one thing alone could have added -- because of a secular stagnation, could have added 0.3% or 0.4% a year to growth. So if you'd changed it five years ago, you're talking about a lot of growth, a lot of jobs, a lot of new homes, a lot of young families into homes and a very positive thing without taking a lot of extra credit risk. JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. 3. Brick-and-mortar retail isn't dead One of the principal narratives pulsing through the markets right now concerns the ongoing decline in bricks and mortar retailers. As e-commerce continues stealing market share, many of the one-time leaders of the industry such as Sears and JCPenney are now focused on shuttering existing stores as opposed to opening new ones. But while the direction of this trend is undeniable, both Lake and Dimon believe that the rate of decline isn't as steep as analysts and commentators have implied. Here's Lake (emphasis added): And I would tell you that while there obviously is a lot of discussion around retail, and with some merit, it's very case-by-case, location-by-location specific. I liken [it] to discussions we have around our bricks-and-mortar banking businesses. The way consumers engage with retail is changing, but it doesn't mean they will stop engaging with retailers. So it will be very specific with respect to location and tenants. And it doesn't necessarily mean that retail is going to be in as much potential trouble as I think people are talking about. So we remain cautiously watching it but also cautiously optimistic that it's not -- that it's a bit overblown. And here's Dimon: When you put it all together, it's a little bit like there'll be something there, but it's nothing that will be dramatic when it's happening. 4. On politics and loan growth Consumer and business confidence shot up following the presidential election as a result of Trump's pro-growth campaign platform. But this has yet to stimulate loan growth, which is a critical lever to accelerate broader economic growth. If anything, in fact, commercial lending stalled in the first quarter. This isn't promising, but Dimon doesn't think people should read too much into either: I wouldn't overreact to the short term in the loan growth because there are so many things that affect it. . . . It was slow, but it was OK. So I wouldn't overreact to that. [W]hen you have a new president and they get going, that the nine months after the 100 days is going to be a sausage-making period. There will be ups and downs, wins and losses, stuff like that, OK? But it is a pro-growth agenda, tax, infrastructure, regulatory reform. That is a good thing, all things being equal. And we think that if that took place, it would be helpful to Americans. But to expect it to be smooth sailing would just be silly. 5. The benefit of higher interest rates Last but not least, Lake updated analysts and investors about how much additional net interest income JPMorgan Chase expects to earn given the upward trend in interest rates -- the fed funds rate in particular. Following the Fed's rate hikes in December and March, and assuming that rates remain flat for the rest of the year, the bank's full-year net interest income should climb by $4 billion compared to 2016. And if rates travel further down the path implied by the Federal Reserve's dot plot, which suggests that two more rate hikes are in store this year, then JPMorgan Chase's net interest income could increase on a year-over-year basis by $4.5 billion. According to Lake: With the addition of the March rate hike, we've updated our net interest income scenarios as follows. Rates flat from here, so the full year NII would be up around $4 billion. Based on the implied, NII would be up by around $4.5 billion. And of course, the Fed dots would imply the possibility of 3 rate hikes this year, which is not fully priced in. So expect second quarter NII to be up sequentially, approximately $400 million, consistent with what we saw this quarter. In short, given the upward trend in interest rates and the pro-growth initiatives being pursued in Washington, the future looks bright for elite banks like JPMorgan Chase.

Months after state and federal regulators sued Navient Corp. for "systematically" cheating student debtors, the company wants to add more borrowers. by Shahien Nasiripour More stories by Shahien Nasiripour and Matt Scully @scullymb More stories by Matt Scully April 21, 2017, 5:00 AM EDT Betsy DeVos Photographer: Olivier Douliery/Bloomberg Student loan giant Navient Corp. shouldn’t be allowed to buy $3.7 billion of federal student loans from JPMorgan Chase & Co., current and former government officials have said, because pending government allegations of wrongdoing against the company raise concerns that new customers would similarly be mistreated. David Bergeron, a former senior U.S. Department of Education official who served under Republican and Democratic administrations, called on Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to block the planned transaction. Navient, the nation’s largest student loan company, announced on Tuesday that it had struck an agreement with JPMorgan to purchase the bank’s $6.9 billion portfolio of student loans, half of them guaranteed by the federal government under a since-discontinued lending program. Navient has been trying to boost its holdings of government-guaranteed student debt—Congress voted to eliminate the bank-based Federal Family Education Loan program in 2010—as older loans are repaid and revenue dwindles. The company would gain some 385,000 borrowers under the deal, which Navient expects to finalize by the end of June, Chief Executive Officer Jack Remondi said on Wednesday. The proposed transaction comes three months after the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, and state attorneys general in Illinois and Washington sued Navient, alleging methodical abuse of borrowers at nearly every step of the repayment process. The company collects monthly payments for 12 million borrowers and counsels them on repayment options. Authorities accused Navient of cheating student debtors for years by taking shortcuts to minimize its own costs. Navient has vigorously denied the allegations. Allowing Navient to grow larger would be a serious mistake, according to Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan. The Education Department should use its existing authority to scuttle the transaction, said Bergeron, who retired as the head of postsecondary education in 2013 after more than 30 years at the Department of Education. “It's shocking that Navient could be allowed to take on a greater number of student loans when it has already failed so many Americans struggling to repay their loans,” Madigan said. Regulators have stepped up oversight of student loans in recent years as more Americans struggle to repay debt and complaints of shoddy loan servicing practices skyrocketed. The CFPB has said the student loan market is tainted by “widespread failures.” One in six American adults has a student loan, and there are nearly as many student debtors as there are home mortgages, government data show. At least one in four of the nation’s roughly 44 million student debtors are either in default or more than 30 days late on required payments. Navient spokeswoman Nikki Lavoie said the company’s proposed purchase “is a win for borrowers. Navient has a well-established, superior track record of helping student loan borrowers succeed in repayment.” Regulators have a different view, and have likened Navient’s alleged practices to those of mortgage companies before, during, and after the 2007-09 financial crisis, when lenders made loans they suspected would fail, ignored or misled struggling borrowers asking for help, and then wrongly skirted legal requirements after debtors had fallen behind on loans. In one prominent example, the CFPB alleged, Navient added billions to borrowers’ loan balances when it “systematically” steered distressed borrowers facing long-term hardship into payment plans that temporarily postponed bills, rather than helping them enroll in broadly available plans that cap payments relative to income and offer the possibility of debt forgiveness. Navient did this, authorities say, because it was cheaper for the company: Debtors can enroll in so-called forbearance plans over the phone, while income-based plans require paperwork. The gravity of the allegations and the pending nature of the government lawsuits should be enough to convince the Education Department to use its power to sink the sale, Bergeron said. “It would be a very bad idea for Navient to acquire any more loans until they sort out their legal problems,” he said. The department could stop the sale by threatening to name Navient an ineligible owner of government-guaranteed student loans, Bergeron said. If authorities stop the sale, the move would be comparable to regulators blocking large transfers of home loans between big banks and mortgage companies such as Ocwen Financial Corp., which on Thursday was again blocked from acquiring new accounts after state and federal regulators accused the company of similarly dodgy practices that have harmed borrowers in recent years. Pamela Moran, another former senior Education Department official, agreed that the department has the authority to prevent Navient’s purchase, but she couldn’t recall the department ever having blocked such transfers. Moran, now an adviser to Massachusetts Higher Education Assistance Corp., a Boston-based nonprofit known as American Student Assistance, said it was unlikely the Education Department would do so now. Federal regulators, including the CFPB, were told about Navient’s plan to purchase JPMorgan’s loans prior to its announcement, Lavoie said. JPMorgan determined that government approval wasn’t required, spokeswoman Shannon O'Reilly said. CFPB spokesman David Mayorga declined to comment. Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email.

Sign Up Last week, DeVos canceled late Obama-era plans to overhaul how Education Department contractors collect on government-owned student loans, changing the focus of the next round of contracts from significantly improved customer service to cost-curbing. Last month, she reversed a separate Obama administration directive limiting fees that companies slapped on defaulted government-guaranteed student loans. DeVos spokesmen Jim Bradshaw and Matthew Frendewey didn’t respond to requests for comment. “The impact of this sale could be devastating to student borrowers' futures and our economy,” Madigan said. “Particularly if the Department of Education abandons its oversight of servicers.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

UnitedHealthcare partnered with Enterprise Community Investment to provide $12 million in equity for PATH Metro Villas through the use of low income housing tax credits approved by the state of California. (Photo: Jamie Rector) LOS ANGELES (Apr. 20, 2017) —  UnitedHealthcare is the largest investor in PATH Metro Villas, a new 65-unit supportive-housing community under construction that will provide permanent homes to individuals and families who have been suffering from homelessness or struggling to find affordable housing. The $12 million investment is part of UnitedHealthcare’s nationwide initiative to help people live healthier lives by connecting them to safe, affordable housing with important on-site support services to improve their well-being.   When completed in the spring of 2018, Metro Villas will feature 65 apartment units adjacent to PATH facilities that provide comprehensive services and permanent supportive housing for homeless individuals and families.  On-site services will include case management offices, community room with a teaching kitchen, on-site manager, security, picnic area and two roof terraces, among other amenities. “Metro Villas is an important investment to connect people struggling with homelessness with safe, quality housing and health services that will help them live healthier lives,” said Rob Falkenberg, CEO, UnitedHealthcare of California. “This project brings together many partners in our community to help create innovative solutions to housing and better health.” Since 2011, UnitedHealthcare has invested $350 million to build 56 new community developments throughout the United States, creating over 2,700 new homes for people with the greatest needs. A key goal for the program is to fund innovative projects like PATH Metro Villas that provide greater access to affordable housing for people in need and helping improve their quality of life by integrating on-site services such as health care, job training and child care into the new communities. UnitedHealthcare partnered with Enterprise Community Investment (Enterprise) to provide the $12 million in equity for PATH Metro Villas through the use of Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) approved by the state of California. UnitedHealthcare and Enterprise have worked together to invest $124 million in affordable-housing developments in eight states, including $28 million in California. “Enterprise is proud of our partnership with UnitedHealthcare and grateful for its critical investment in affordable homes,” said Charlie Werhane, president and CEO, Enterprise Community Investment. “By matchmaking the right partners, Enterprise supports well-designed, affordable homes connected to resources that allow residents to reach their full potential.” PATH Metro Villas is being developed by People Assisting The Homeless (PATH) in partnership with Affirmed Housing Group (AHG). Additional partners include the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services-Housing for Health, California Department of Housing & Community Development, Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Housing + Community Investment Department. “Today’s groundbreaking is the culmination of many years of hard work and planning,” said Amy Anderson, executive director, PATH Ventures. “We are extremely grateful for the support we have received from so many partners whose passion will help create this beautiful, high-quality housing community that will serve some of the most vulnerable in Los Angeles.” According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Commission on Health, the affordability of housing has clear implications for health. The shortage of affordable housing limits families’ and individuals’ choices about where they live, often relegating lower-income families to substandard housing in unsafe, overcrowded neighborhoods with higher rates of poverty and fewer resources for healthy outdoor and exercise activities (e.g., parks, bike paths, recreation centers and activities). The financial burden of unaffordable housing can prevent families from meeting other basic needs including nutrition and health care, and is particularly significant for low-income families. About Enterprise Enterprise works with partners nationwide to build opportunity. We create and advocate for affordable homes in thriving communities linked to good schools, jobs, transit and health care. We lend funds, finance development and manage and build affordable housing, while shaping new strategies, solutions and policy. Over more than 30 years, Enterprise has created nearly 380,000 homes, invested $28.9 billion and touched millions of lives. Join us at www.EnterpriseCommunity.com or www.EnterpriseCommunity.org. About PATH and PATH Ventures PATH Ventures is part of the PATH family of agencies working together to end homelessness for individuals, families, and communities. We do this by developing and maintaining quality affordable housing and services that bring personal stability and an improved quality of life for people in need. PATH’s agencies are in 22 locations from San Diego to San Luis Obispo.  PATH has been serving the community since 1984. In honor of its 30th anniversary, PATH set a goal in 2013 to house 3,000 people by 2015. To date, the PATH family has housed over 3,200 people including more than 1,000 veterans, 1,000 families and 1,000 chronically homeless individuals.  www.epath.org.

The firm is in discussions with Brookfield Property Partners LP to lease an additional 300,000 square feet on the upper levels of 5 Manhattan West near Hudson Yards, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public. The bank currently occupies about 125,000 square feet in the building. The talks are ongoing and could still fall apart, the person said. Banks are competing fiercely for technologists as the industry enters a new era of automation, fueled by cheap computing power and fears of losing customers to startups. JPMorgan has a $9.6 billion annual technology budget and has recently set up hubs across the U.S. for teams specializing in big data, robotics and cloud infrastructure to find new sources of revenue and reduce expenses and risks.

Sign Up The firm’s West Side hub, which opened in late 2015, caters to millennials by mimicking startup culture, with foosball tables, a game room, industrial decor and fridges stocked with sodas and snacks. Last year, about 700 workers who were previously scattered across Manhattan and Jersey City worked at the office. The workspace is divided into five neighborhoods, named after areas of New York, housing designers working on the user interface, coders developing new features and data analytics experts who study customer use. Manhattan West is a 7 million square foot mixed-use project just west of Penn Station and the Farley Post Office Building. Brookfield announced in 2014 a $200 million redevelopment of the 1.7 million square-foot building that became known as 5 Manhattan West, including replacing its relatively narrow windows with floor-to-ceiling glass on every floor. Andrew Brent, a Brookfield spokesman, declined to comment. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Confidence on a brighter outlook for developing nations has turned traders increasingly bullish on local-currency risk. Money managers from JPMorgan Asset Management to Schroders Plc favor local notes in emerging markets over dollar-denominated bonds as currency volatility falls, commodities prices stabilize and the shine comes off the reflation trade that sent the dollar to a 14-year high at the end of last year. Local-currency bonds have some catching up to do after 12 months in which they lost 0.4 percent, compared with 7 percent gains for developing-nation sovereign dollar securities. Research Affiliates, a sub-adviser to money managers including Pacific Investment Management Co., forecasts local notes will produce better returns over the next decade. "It makes sense to increase exposure to local markets," said Anders Faergemann, a senior fund manager in London at PineBridge Investments, which oversees about $83 billion globally. "We may be returning to a global scenario where U.S. rates remain low and there’s less support for the U.S. dollar." Slowing inflation has allowed central banks in countries such as Brazil and Colombia to begin deep interest-rate cutting cycles, adding to the appeal of local debt, according to Gabriela Santos, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. Brazil’s central bank has cut the benchmark rate by 300 basis points, or 3 percentage points, since October to 11.25 percent and is expected to slash it a further 275 basis points by year-end. Foreign investors lured by high yields poured a record 159 billion rubles ($2.8 billion) into Russia’s local-currency debt in March. Most of the inflow came in the second half of the month after the U.S. Federal Reserve laid out an unexpectedly less hawkish rate-hike outlook, Russia’s central bank said in a report on Wednesday. A better outlook for emerging-market economies comes as investors become less bullish on the dollar. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. closed its long-dollar positioning against the euro, the pound and the Chinese yuan this week, one of its top trade recommendations for 2017, citing a slowdown in the reflationary momentum in the U.S. economy. Declining prospects for a border-adjustment tax or a near-term U.S.-China trade war will further support emerging-market local debt, according to Samy Chaar, the Geneva-based chief economist at Lombard Odier. Schroder Investment Management’s Jim Barrineau said this week that he prefers emerging-market local bonds as the dollar -- already down 2.4 percent this year -- likely weakens further on soft economic data, and Capital Economics published a report last month saying local notes will probably outperform overseas ones as yields are expected to rise more in the U.S. than in developing nations. "There is a decent attempt to tackle inflation in a number of countries," said Andrew Stanners, a London-based investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. "In an environment where dollar strength is less likely and EM currencies appear to have stabilized, local market bonds will look attractive."

By JacobPassy Getting an adjustable-rate mortgage can save homeowners money — but whether they actual put those funds to good use is another question. Homeowners whose mortgage payments dropped when their adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) reset to a lower rate increased their spending, according to a report released this week from the JPMorgan Chase Institute. On average, these borrowers’ credit card spending went up 15% relative to their baseline, which equates to around $488 per month. Though mortgage rates have faltered in recent weeks, by and large they are way higher than a year ago thanks to the election of President Trump as markets priced in his supposedly favorable economic policies. As a result, some borrowers may be regretting their choice to spend what they saved thanks to lower rates rather than set it aside. But homeowners with adjustable-rate loans who saved money between 2010 and 2012 didn’t just spend more once their rates went down — they also did so in advance. The researchers found that homeowners spent 9% more ahead of the anticipated drop to their mortgage payments. Altogether, these homeowners total spending increases exceeded what they saved on their mortgage payments by 4%. It wasn’t all frivolous spending, however. Homeowners upped their spending on home improvements and health care. After the rate reset, retail expenditures also increased, said Kanav Bhagat, a director of research for the JPMorgan Chase Institute and one of the report’s co-authors. “There was definitely a larger increase in discretionary spending rather than non-discretionary spending,” Bhagat said. These findings fall in line with behavioral economists’ expectations, per George Hofheimer, chief knowledge officer at the Filene Research Institute, a credit union and consumer think-tank. Simply put, people are inclined to spend the these savings because it’s just more fun to do, he said. “They are thinking in the short-term,” Hofheimer said. “It’s very similar to the windfall during tax season. People use that windfall for things that are ‘not good’ for their financial health.” Today’s ARM borrowers, however, may treat the windfall they receive from their mortgage-related savings differently to those who saw their rates fluctuate between 2010 and 2012, said Mat Ishbia, president and chief executive of lender United Wholesale Mortgage. “I’d be surprised if that’s what happens in today’s market,” Ishbia said. “People are more conservative.” More from MarketWatch The American Dream appears to be more attainable in Mexico and China Should you pay for a home warranty?

By JacobPassy Getting an adjustable-rate mortgage can save homeowners money — but whether they actual put those funds to good use is another question. Homeowners whose mortgage payments dropped when their adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) reset to a lower rate increased their spending, according to a report released this week from the JPMorgan Chase Institute. On average, these borrowers’ credit card spending went up 15% relative to their baseline, which equates to around $488 per month. Though mortgage rates have faltered in recent weeks, by and large they are way higher than a year ago thanks to the election of President Trump as markets priced in his supposedly favorable economic policies. As a result, some borrowers may be regretting their choice to spend what they saved thanks to lower rates rather than set it aside. But homeowners with adjustable-rate loans who saved money between 2010 and 2012 didn’t just spend more once their rates went down — they also did so in advance. The researchers found that homeowners spent 9% more ahead of the anticipated drop to their mortgage payments. Altogether, these homeowners total spending increases exceeded what they saved on their mortgage payments by 4%. It wasn’t all frivolous spending, however. Homeowners upped their spending on home improvements and health care. After the rate reset, retail expenditures also increased, said Kanav Bhagat, a director of research for the JPMorgan Chase Institute and one of the report’s co-authors. “There was definitely a larger increase in discretionary spending rather than non-discretionary spending,” Bhagat said. These findings fall in line with behavioral economists’ expectations, per George Hofheimer, chief knowledge officer at the Filene Research Institute, a credit union and consumer think-tank. Simply put, people are inclined to spend the these savings because it’s just more fun to do, he said. “They are thinking in the short-term,” Hofheimer said. “It’s very similar to the windfall during tax season. People use that windfall for things that are ‘not good’ for their financial health.” Today’s ARM borrowers, however, may treat the windfall they receive from their mortgage-related savings differently to those who saw their rates fluctuate between 2010 and 2012, said Mat Ishbia, president and chief executive of lender United Wholesale Mortgage. “I’d be surprised if that’s what happens in today’s market,” Ishbia said. “People are more conservative.” More from MarketWatch The American Dream appears to be more attainable in Mexico and China Should you pay for a home warranty?

Headquartered in Luxembourg with additional offices in London and Boston, Beacon Rail's current portfolio includes 225 locomotives, more than 1,000 freight wagons, 55 passenger train units, 67 double-decker coaches and 13 sets of five-car intercity carriages on lease in the UK, Germany, Denmark, France, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands. Ted Gaffney, chief executive at Beacon Rail, will continue to lead the company, supported by the existing management team. Matt LeBlanc, CIO for OECD infrastructure at JPMAM, said: "Beacon Rail (is) a core transportation platform that provides investors with access to a diversified portfolio of rolling stock assets in the UK and Continental Europe. "The quality of the management team, relatively young fleet of assets and deep customer relationships provide an opportunity for growth and expansion." Investment of 400 million euros Pamplona acquired Beacon Rail from BTMU Capital Corporation in May 2014 for about 450 million dollars. Beacon Rail went on to acquire Ascendos Rail Leasing in June 2016 and entered into an agreement to supply rolling stock to First TransPennine Express in May 2016. The financing for the latest deal was arranged by Credit Agricole Corporate Investment Bank, which will act as facility agent, with ING Bank NV acting as security trustee. Allen & Overy LLP acted as legal counsel for the lenders, while Berwin Leighton Paisner LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP acted as legal counsel for Beacon Rail and Pamplona.

Morgan Chase are racking up advisory fees amid a shift to fee-based accounts, The Wall Street Journal reports. April 20, 2017 3:28 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto Brokerages like Merrill Lynch and J.P.

Review our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy. Bank of America Corp.’s global wealth unit, which includes the Merrill, gained a record $29.2 billion in new fee-based assets in the first quarter. At J.P. Morgan, $8 billion of new assets flowed into long-term products, including those that charge a recurring fee. “The developments are the latest sign that advice for a recurring fee is Wall Street’s go-to compensation model for the future, as firms like Merrill and J.P. Morgan use the fiduciary rule as a way to phase out commissions as a payment option in retirement accounts,” the Journal says. “The industry shift is coming even as the Trump administration seeks to eliminate or revise the rule.” A fee-based model allows brokerages to better compete with independent rivals. In addition, fees for advice and services are more lucrative over time than commissions. Fee-based accounts can yield as much as 50% more revenue than commission accounts, Morningstar has found.

Commercial Real Estate Plano Mayoral Candidates Talk Development As elections in the Collin County town grow near, three of the four candidates participated in a public forum at the Capital One Conference Center. By Lily Corral Published in Commercial Real Estate April 21, 2017 5:28 pm The Collin County Business Alliance partnered with the Plano Chamber of Commerce and the Plano Rotary Club last week to host a Plano mayoral candidate forum. With a packed room at the Capital One Conference Center, Mayor Harry LaRosiliere, Lily Bao, and Bill Lisle III fielded questions from the events moderator, newsman Scott Sams of KRLD-AM. Douglas Reeves, a fourth candidate in the race, did not attend. Plano has been a hot spot for development in recent years. The city’s 2016 executive summary report listed 22 companies that either relocated to the city or expanded within the city, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Fannie Mae, and Stream Data Centers. But now that those moves have taken place, where do the mayoral candidates think the city’s developments will go next? “What I would like to see is very careful, smart development that does not jeopardize or take away from the suburban distinctiveness of Plano,” said Bao, adding that the city only has five percent of vacant land available. “I think we can still grow, but we will be growing smart and with quality development only. We will not be growing like 20 years ago. The goal of any growth would be to benefit the people, the residents here in Plano, as well as be beneficial to the business that’s coming in.” For Lisle, continuing to attract top talent would be a priority. “Healthy things grow,” he said. “Plano staying the same is going backwards—it’s not progress.” LaRosiliere sees future growth opportunities in multifamily building. He said Plano is growing about 1 percent annually from a residential standpoint, adding about 2,500 people per year. “The businesses that come here, we can’t absorb those people, they’re basically moving north of us,” he said. “The opportunities for new residents will be in some of our mixed-use developments.… We see that, actually, as a way to facilitate, reduce traffic.” He mentioned that “anecdotal comments” from Legacy West say that probably 80 percent of those who work there also live within a mile of the location. In other words, most are not adding to congestion on the Dallas North Tollway. “The next two or three years, there’s absolutely nothing I, or anybody else, can do to change the trajectory,” LaRosiliere said. “Our job is to look 10, 15, 20 years beyond.” According to the forum, just 5.7 percent of Plano’s registered voters cast their ballots in the last city election. Early voting begins on April 24th, and election day is May 6th.

Randall Rothenberg. Credit: Courtesy IAB Most Popular The digital ad business has made another move to regain the high ground, when the Interactive Advertising Bureau ordered all of its members to register with the anti-fraud Trustworthy Accountability Group. TAG was conceived in 2015 by the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the Association of National Advertisers and the Interactive Advertising Bureau to act as a stamp of approval for ad sellers. While about 100 of the 450 publishers, ad tech firms and ad exchanges in the IAB have already registered with TAG, industry fears about ad fraud continue to plague the business. "We can't deal with this shit anymore," IAB President-CEO Randall Rothenberg told Ad Age. "This is serious." Related Stories Ad Industry Powers Consider Adopting Ad Blocking on a Wide Scale World Wide Whitelist: Will Brand Safety Strip the Web of Its Color? The IAB's new requirement comes as a litany of problems has hurt digital media in the eyes of ad buyers and consumers alike. In January, P&G Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard revealed that he was so startled by the company's digital ad fraud audit that he would stop working with companies that didn't register with TAG. "The days of giving digital a pass are over," Mr. Pritchard said then. In March, marketers "paused" YouTube spending after reporters informed them that their ads were running next to violent and offensive videos. And JPMorgan Chase cut its digital advertising to 5,000 newly preapproved sites from 400,000 automatically selected domains after learning that one of its ads ran on a site called Hillary 4 Prison, under a headline about "the Satanic liberal perverts who run Hollywood." On Thursday, however, the industry revealed an initiative to rid the internet of annoying ad formats. Now the TAG program has received a big push. Rothenberg likened the IAB's TAG registration requirement to basic government health standards. "Every hot dog cart, no matter how small, has to follow the city's health code," he said. Registering the entire IAB membership with TAG will make it easier for ad buyers, agencies and others "to look up and down the supply chain" and determine the source of problems like fraud, Rotherberg said. The registration process determines that a company is a legitimate player and not a fraudulent entity such as a malware distributor or bot net disseminator. In addition to ensuring that applicants are not the proverbial ad-bot launcher living in mom's basement somewhere in Romania, TAG requires that registrants have a trained "TAG compliance officer." The IAB gave members until June 2018 to register with TAG. The IAB is not demanding that its members be certified by TAG, a pricier and more-involved process. Ad inventory sellers who qualify for TAG's anti-fraud certification are assigned a payment ID that marks inventory, essentially creating a trail that can be tracked back if ad fraud is discovered by an ad fraud protection vendor, for example. Many sellers also use ad fraud prevention and brand safety-related services from firms such as White Ops, DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science or Moat, which was acquired this week by Oracle. TAG acts as a "good housekeeping seal" and does not compete with these providers, said TAG CEO Mike Zaneis. "The more companies that commit to fighting fraud and improving transparency in the digital media ecosystem, the better the system works for all parties," said Matt McLaughlin, chief operating officer at DoubleVerify. While the TAG requirement will help create a more encompassing list of qualified companies touching ad inventory, Rothenberg wants brands to join TAG too, because their websites are also touchpoints in the inventory supply chain and can themselves become unwitting cogs in fraud schemes. As part of the IAB's edict, the annual TAG registration fee of $10,000 will be waived for small businesses making less than $10 million per year in digital ad revenue. Larger IAB members will qualify for discounts between 12.5% and 25%.

U.S. District Judge Robert W. Sweet said in an April 14 decision (PDF) that his comments were attempts at humor, and they don’t constitute bias against the whistleblower plaintiff, former JPMorgan Chase employee Jennifer Sharkey. Above the Law has highlights from a Law360 (sub. req.) story that summarized Sweet’s opinion. Sweet made some of the comments after lawyers for Sharkey had suggested the case be reassigned to another judge because of a scheduling conflict. “I wouldn’t wish this case on my worst enemy,” Sweet said. “No, I’ve lived with it, and I suppose I can say I’ll probably die with it.” Sweet’s other comment was, “I would do anything to get rid of this case.” Sweet said the three comments, “though mistakenly made, uniformly and without reflection, do not demonstrate bias against the plaintiff but rather frustration at irresolution of the action.” The case has been ongoing for seven years. “I have been a United States district court judge for 39 years,” wrote Sweet, who is 94. “Impartiality and the appearance of impartiality are required to resolve difficult competing claims and to seek just result. This standard applies in all cases, including this one.” Previous: BigLaw practice areas with highest compensation had lowest percentages of women, study says Next: Faced with dwindling admissions, some law schools seek out overachieving 1Ls Filed under: Trials & Litigation | Judiciary | Legal Ethics You might also like: Wisconsin Supreme Court rejects petition to create recusal standards over campaign donations Suspension of Roy Moore from Alabama Supreme Court upheld, but don't count him out for other offices Supreme Court overturns $2.7M sanction for discovery misconduct State judge who blocked Arkansas executions and protested is removed from capital cases View the comments for this story We welcome your comments, but please adhere to our comment policy and the ABA Code of Conduct.

Called Ongoing Feedback360+, the initiative follows Goldman Sachs’s redesign of its annual review processes last year, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said in a note to employees on April 13 that was also signed by co-presidents David M. Solomon and Harvey Schwartz. Employees then asked for more frequent and timely interactions, Blankfein said. “Providing ongoing, high-quality feedback is at the heart of our culture of teamwork and excellence,” the three executives said in the note. Goldman Sachs is the latest bank to introduce changes to its annual performance reviews as financial-services firms continue to adapt to an age in which technology enables real-time criticism of everything from restaurant meals to package deliveries. In March, JPMorgan introduced a similar mobile tool that lets workers send or receive instant critiques of their colleagues. Read more: JPMorgan reviews are now, and now, and now The Wall Street Journal reported on the changes at Goldman Sachs earlier Friday. Goldman Sachs’s new system will offer employees and managers a dashboard that summarizes the feedback they’ve received throughout the year, Edith Cooper, the bank’s global head of human capital management, said in a note to staff on April 20. “I am confident that Ongoing Feedback360+ will have a direct and positive impact on the professional growth and experience of our people,” Cooper said.

Schleck, an online sales executive at B of A, points out that the bank "mobile-optimized" its auto loan application in 2016, an experience it plans to enhance this summer by making it possible for consumers to shop for a car on the mobile app. Once they find a vehicle they like, they can then apply for a loan and get approved on the same platform. Customers will be able to complete 85% to 90% of the process on the app, he says. Mortgages are admittedly trickier, but the opportunity is undeniable. A recent Accenture survey of more than 4,000 North American consumers found that one in five completed their mortgage purchase without using a digital channel at all. For the average consumer, no other transaction is as time-consuming, paper-intensive or nerve-wracking as the process of taking out a home loan. It typically takes weeks and requires a raft of forms. The development of mobile mortgage solutions, then, is a kind of ultimate test of banks' commitment to omnichannel strategies. This is so not only because of the difficulty involved in bringing such a complex transaction to mobile devices but also because, unlike with digital card applications, which can yield an approval decision in seconds, loan officers are still a critical component of the mortgage process. "We're going after making anything that customers want to do available in any channel that they want," Michelle Moore, Bank of America's head of digital, said about the company's efforts to develop a mobile mortgage offering for its 22 million active mobile users. It plans to launch the platform later this year. Improving upon the online experience The goal is not merely to digitize but to streamline the application process, "making the simpler things as simple as possible and the complex things as easy as possible," Schleck said. Bank of America's online mortgage fulfillment center, which it launched in June 2016, already allows clients to upload documents, receive disclosures and review their application status electronically. The mobile offering will copy some of these features, but it will do a lot more besides. "Our mortgage experience is going to be awesome," Moore said. "It will give people check lists, it will give them the ability to connect to mortgage-loan officers, it will let you e-sign materials, it will let you upload documents." "We're going after making anything that customers want to do available in any channel that they want," says Michelle Moore, Bank of America's head of digital. As banks consider how to deliver a mortgage product via mobile devices, they are seeing it as an opportunity to build a whole new experience, rather than just recreating what they already offer online. Take the forms that applicants have to fill out. There are 250 data fields on a mortgage application, according to Schleck. The idea of sitting down and filling it out from beginning to end is mind-numbing. "It's not the way that normal human beings think," Schleck said. "And, frankly, clients expect us to know more about them than that. 'Why are you asking me for my address?' So we are going to be much more conversational in the way the mobile app will work." A good loan officer will take a real interest in clients, engaging them in a conversation to learn about their priorities. The online mortgage experience, by contrast, "just feels like filling out a form," Schleck said. Bank of America wants to eliminate that feeling with its mobile offering. One way to achieve this, Schleck suggests, is to prepopulate fields with information already known about each client. Customers whose paychecks are direct deposited into a Bank of America checking account might not need to provide their income information; the bank would know it already. It would know lots of other stuff about them, too. Longtime customers could potentially breeze through much of the paperwork. Racing to develop solutions As challenging as it might be, lenders have little choice but to develop mobile mortgage offerings. The launch of Quicken Loans' Rocket Mortgage site in 2015 was a starter pistol for the mortgage industry's race to build digital experiences. If banks don’t do something, they will likely be displaced by lenders that do. Although few lenders offer a mobile mortgage application process as of now, "that's the way the whole industry is moving," said Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. "As we're getting to the point where you can share all the documentation electronically, it just seems like making this mobile is such a natural thing to do," said Holden Lewis, a mortgage analyst at Bankrate.com. "Why not over a phone?" Bank of America isn't the only major bank working on a mobile mortgage platform. In February, JPMorgan Chase announced it was partnering with the fintech firm Roostify to build a digital self-service platform for prospective homebuyers. It is expected to launch later this year. (Just as Schleck described mortgages as the next step after car loans, JPMorgan's joint venture with Roostify comes on the heels of its partnership with TrueCar last year.) "All of these banks, not just Bank of America, are really trying to position to attract millennials," Kleinhanzl said. As for whether the majority of consumers will take to mobile mortgage applications the way they have taken to mobile check deposits and online credit card applications, Kleinhanzl remains skeptical in the short term. "I would say it will take three to five years at least," he said. "You're not going to see huge volume from this." When the day comes that millennials are the largest group of homebuyers, however, such digital solutions will see frequent use, he added. Tackling pain points While U.S. banks are building, at least one large North American bank is already offering a fully mobile mortgage process. In May 2016, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce launched Hello Home, a mobile app for iOS devices that allows users to snap pictures of key documents, upload them with their phone and chat with a mortgage specialist if they need advice. The bank started working on it in the fourth quarter of 2015, originally as a six-week "sprint" focused on reimagining the mortgage experience, which took place at the bank's innovation lab in Toronto. By the end of the year, armed with a proof of concept, CIBC executives had decided to pursue a mobile offering seriously. Rather than integrate the new solution into its existing app — a complicated task — the $380 billion-asset bank chose to act like a startup, releasing a standalone app in a skeleton version that could be continuously improved upon. Over the next several months, staffers from CIBC's mortgage business worked together with the digital team, legal personnel, risk officers and other employees on an ad-hoc basis to build the app. For the initial version, they tackled new home purchases and refinances — the two most common mortgage scenarios — and three customer pain points: a lack of transparency in the process, the amount of paperwork required and the need to deliver documents in person to a branch. "The sheer amount of paper you have to provide to your mortgage broker during the process was just incredible," said Aayaz Pira, CIBC's senior vice president of digital. "And not everybody has a scanner or fax machine, so they don't actually know how to send these documents back and forth." Although Hello Home is not yet available to Android users or to non-Canadians, it serves as an early indication of what banks' mobile mortgage offerings might look like. As you complete each phase of the mortgage process through the app, that phase is grayed out, allowing you to track your progress. Push notifications alert you to significant milestones, too. The limits of self-service As much as consumers have grown to rely on self-service, homebuyers want the ability to consult a specialist throughout the mortgage process — to negotiate a rate, say, or merely to clarify an aspect of the terms and conditions. It is no surprise, then, that CIBC's in-app chat feature has proved popular. "We've learned very quickly that in a complex digital sales journey, we have to have a balance between human touch and technology," Pira said. "So they have a human on the other end they can chat back and forth with." Schleck says Bank of America, too, is committed to delivering experiences that are "high-touch" as well as high-tech. That is a nice aim, but 73% of consumers report that the experience of switching between their bank's branches, website and mobile app is less than seamless, according to a 2016 Accenture report. If mortgage clients are to migrate seamlessly back and forth between the physical and the digital realm, banks will have to get better at designing solutions that enhance, even if they can't replace, human interaction. "We've learned very quickly that in a complex digital sales journey, we have to have a balance between human touch and technology," says Aayaz Pira, CIBC's senior vice president of digital. Even for mortgage clients who prefer a digital experience — a cohort that seems likely to grow with time — "there will need to be the safety net of a loan officer available to you," said Daryl Grant, the digital solutions lead for the mortgage advisory at KPMG. Bank of America is considering giving mobile users the ability to hold video chats with its mortgage bankers. Various legal and privacy issues remain to be addressed. If realized, however, the feature would be a mobile corollary to the bank's new virtual centers, unmanned branches with teleconference rooms where customers can talk to loan officers and other specialists. There are some things you can't make faster Digitizing the mortgage process can make it less painful and more transparent. Still, buying a home remains the largest purchase that most people will make in their lifetimes. It is a fundamentally involved and lengthy process. CIBC was surprised to learn that Hello Home users take an average of three weeks to reach the approval stage, with clients switching back and forth often between the mobile app and other channels, including physical branches. "It takes a very long time for someone to go through the entire journey," Pira said. The Canadian bank's findings throw cold water on Moore's claim that soon "major life purchases will be able to be done at the touch of a thumb, whether it's buying a car or buying a house." Her words conjure up a simple, almost instantaneous experience. Schleck does have ideas about how to speed up the process. For instance, lenders are required to wait a certain amount of time after providing a client with a loan estimate before they can ask for his or her intent to proceed. If the estimate is sent through the mail, the waiting time is three days for the mail plus an additional day for the client to mull things over. "That's four days," he said. "But if I can provide it to you electronically and talk to you right away, I can gain intent to proceed right away, and I can shave three days off your loan." Some elements of the mortgage process remain intractable. Even if the application process is sped up further, the closing process would still require a face-to-face meeting — and all of the paperwork that goes with it. Certain U.S. states, for instance, including Florida, Georgia and New York, require the presence of a closing attorney. "There are a lot of state-specific requirements involved in that process," said Grant of KPMG. "I would be very skeptical of any platform that says it can get all the way through the closing process with a mobile application." For Canadians, too, a sit-down meeting is unavoidable in order to complete their purchase. CIBC wouldn't say if it has any plans to bring the closing process to mobile devices, or whether that is even possible. For now, improving the application process appears to be enough. Although Pira wouldn't share precise numbers regarding how many users have successfully completed mortgage applications using CIBC's Hello Home app, he said the bank — which expanded its digital team from 50 employees to 250 employees last year — is committed to building it out over the next 12 to 18 months so that it can serve as a robust companion to all of the other channels. "We want to have the best bank in your pocket," he said. "There hasn't been a point when we have said this [app] was a waste of money."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Data Startup Liquidaty Lands JPMorgan Chase Bank as Customer NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / April 21, 2017 / Liquidaty, a data software startup based in New York City, announced today that its customers now include JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. „We feel extremely privileged and excited to have this opportunity to serve one of the most important financial institutions of our time,” said CEO Matt Wong, a former investment banker and computer programmer. Liquidaty develops technology that automates rote tasks that can be costly to manage and difficult to scale, with a focus on data-intensive markets such as structured finance. According to Wong, „In many industries today, highly skilled employees still must devote a huge amount of time to perform mundane, but necessary and difficult-to-automate data labor that nonetheless adds virtually no value to the enterprise in the long run. It isn’t uncommon for this low-value work to take up the lion’s share of the job for armies of analysts. By targeting the least glamorous part of the process – the necessary, rote data work that can be costly to manage and dreaded by staff – we aim to flip that ratio and help our customers to allocate significantly more resources toward the activities that give them long-term competitive advantages, while providing the nimbleness to adopt new third-party technologies at the click of a button.” For further information, please contact: [email protected] or visit www.liquidaty.com.

So who will develop, safeguard and store digital IDs? FILE: Picture: EWN. World Economic Forum Internet of things Finternet Email Print Tweet Share World Economic Forum | 17 hours ago Driverless cars that make per-minute toll road payments. Lightbulbs that decide the right energy vendor at a given time and price. Investment decisions made by robo-advisors. And products created in-situ by 3D printers, with royalties paid in real time on whatever intellectual property is needed. This is the coming world of the Internet of Everything, as intelligence and connectivity become distributed more and more widely across our economy. Everything will talk to everything and end-points will make their own decisions, powered by sensor-driven data collection and computing that continually improves, known as machine learning. To make this a reality, we will need a well-functioning, secure micropayments system. We must reimagine the nature of financial assets, digital assets, rights management, intellectual property and royalties. “Sensor technologies and the collection and exchange of data by the Internet of Things will require a fundamental rethink of financial services,” says Udayan Goyal, a London-based private-equity and venture capital investor focused on financial services. If they aren’t careful, banks could be relegated in this new world to becoming mere clearing houses. Credit card and insurance companies could see business shrink. So traditional financial services companies are seeking a role for themselves at the nexus of the digital economy. Getting a pole position in the evolving IoT would allow banks to gain new revenue from a range of innovative services. “In the IoT, payments become a kind of backbeat to life. They are everywhere, but they retreat from view. Your car will be connected to your debit card and will settle your gas charges for you. And your house will settle your utility bills,” says former Deutsche Bank executive Dan Marovitz, COO of Earthport, a London-based company building an alternative to correspondent banking. “The reality is that most payments are still made through banks and most people still keep their money in banks, so the banks will necessarily be part of these future flows.” But the way forward is rife with challenges. Will banks be the brokers of digital data? Digital identity, data management and data privacy are key components of the IoT. People, devices and the software that makes up systems, applications and services will all have to be defined and given a digital identity. So who will develop, safeguard and store digital IDs? In the past, powerful Silicon Valley players tried and failed to play a key role in securing and disseminating data. Microsoft attempted a centralised digital identity service 14 years ago with its Passport and Hailstorm initiatives. Intel, Sun, Oracle and AOL tried to develop their own such service around the same time through a group called the Liberty Alliance. Today, Facebook has vast stores of personal data, though for the most part it has so far shied away from financial services. Now data is a valuable digital asset on a par with capital. Many believe that banks, not Silicon Valley companies, may be best placed to create and safeguard our digital identities and be brokers for data exchange. They could potentially offer services for identity, privacy, and security to accompany the global trading of any digital asset. If smart developers can build apps on top of data that its owners give permission to use, taking into account an individual or organisation’s preferences, it could usher in many types of new financial services. For example, access to commercial and transaction data, via the Internet of Things and point-of-sale systems, could help banks assess the creditworthiness of people and businesses. They could anticipate the need for capital, pre-empting requests for financing from small businesses and providing real-time credit, according to a Fintech 2.0 white paper prepared by Santander Innoventures, Oliver Wyman and Anthemis (the venture and advisory firm founded by London’s Udayan Goyal). New consumer services could crunch data about individuals’ purchases, payment and habits. That may make people smarter financially, much as weaving together health records with dietary and exercise tracking is likely to make us healthier. Consumers could marshal their data to signal an intent to purchase directly to retailers, potentially attracting better offers. And the IoT may literally make form-filling obsolete, reclaiming tens of billions of wasted hours annually across the globe. With such future services in mind, a dozen banks - including Citi, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and JP Morgan Chase - began in 2011 to work with The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), a cooperative that handles transactions like wire transfers for thousands of banks. They envisioned an underlying global financial infrastructure called the Digital Asset Grid (or DAG) to bring bank-grade identity, privacy and security to the global exchange of any digital asset. But the project was later abandoned. The obstacles were bigger than just getting many large institutions to cooperate. Something like the DAG would require banks to think and operate like a company like Apple, offering a platform on top of which others could create new innovative services. Banks may not be able to shed the outdated and arrogant thinking that comes from keeping a physical valuation in the basement. Also, many big banks still lack the digital infrastructure necessary to operate in the emerging IoT. Francisco Gonzalez, CEO of Spanish banking giant BBVA and a former computer programmer, says “In order to compete in the digital world you need to have platforms that perform in real time, and not run batch processes overnight. But behind the scenes, most banks still have what we call a ‘spaghetti platform’.” (Obviously, he excludes his own company, which has aggressively invested in digital banking.) Still, the World Economic Forum argues in an August 2016 report that financial institutions are well positioned to drive digital identity systems since they already have well-developed ways to verify user information for commercial and regulatory purposes. There is a strong business case for banks to move into such services, says WEF. Doing so would allow banks to offer extended financial advisory services and things like behaviour-based insurance. Banks could also offer “identity-as-a-service” to businesses that can’t or don’t wish to store their clients’ personal data. And, they could potentially offer identity management as a separate, fee-based service. One thing is sure: digital identity will be a key part of financial services going forward. The topic took centre stage this year at Sibos, a major annual financial industry conference organised by Swift that convenes more than 7,000 financial services executives. Says Carlos Menendez, Mastercard’s president of enterprise partnerships: “Money is now more than an exchange of value and payment. Further information can be embedded with each transaction in the form of a digital ID.” And digital IDs will have far more utility than merely improving security. “Identity and authentication schemes coupled with payment platforms can enable financial inclusion and poverty alleviation for billions of people,” says Kosta Peric, Deputy Director, and Financial Services for the Poor, at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, who worked on the WEF report on digital identity. “Ultimately, digital services such as data lockers will become the fundamental fabric of the digital society, and also a new, immense, opportunity to provide existing and new government and financial services,” he says. The dark side of data Once digital IDs are ubiquitous and most of the things we own are connected to the Net, more and more information will be traded about us. The challenge will be keeping all that information under control. “The question for the not-so-far future is ‘What will a data market look like? Who will shape the rules? And how will rules be enforced?’,” asks Aurelie Pols, a data governance and privacy advocate at Krux Digital, a venture-backed San Francisco company that aims to unify data about people into a single view to help businesses. Pols is also an advisor on ethics to the Data Protection Supervisor established 15 years ago by the European Union. The Internet of Things is a major step towards the long heralded - and feared - path to truly personalised marketing. It is rich with promise at the same time it is fraught with complexity and the risk of intrusion. Cars, watches, refrigerators, and garage door openers will become nodes on the network, controllable with a smartphone and trailing what Earthport’s Marovitz calls a “digital slipstream.” The endless resulting flow of purchases, preferences and decisions will define a very specific demographic - you. Companies of many types may thus acquire an invaluable resource. “The way the financial services industry thinks about risk will fundamentally change as a result of the availability of the very granular data that can be collected through IoT devices,” says investor Goyal, who in addition to being a VC is managing partner of private equity firm Apis Partners. The way insurance works could change dramatically. Continues Goyal: “The data collected from smart devices and wearable technology will be useful in redefining risk models for life insurers.” That sounds good for them, but maybe not so good for you. Similarly, connected vehicles will enable new risk models for auto insurance. Several insurers already offer policies in which a driver’s behaviour is monitored while he or she drives, with the information transmitted directly to the insurer. The company assesses the chances that driver will have an accident and charges premiums accordingly. On the one hand, those who drive well should get lower rates. But the use of highly personalised data will potentially aid the creation of what Goyal calls “tail exclusion risks.” If you are perceived as risky as your personal data becomes exposed you may become completely uninsurable, he explains. And when lots of information about your health and other personal details is shared freely by companies and government that could also have a dark side. Principles and data ethics need to be established and new technical innovations will be required so that permissions can flow with the data to make clear who can access what and when, says Krux Digital’s Pols. Many startups are pursuing ways to give control of personal information back to the individual, but it’s a dauntingly difficult task. Ethical and security issues When artificial intelligence gets added to the Internet of Things, as it inevitably will, the challenges will become even greater. The question of who will shape and enforce the rules is no clearer for AI than it is for data governance. But the combination of the IoT and AI is expected to usher in new personalised financial services like smart wallets that monitor and learn your habits and needs and alert and coach you to adjust your spending and saving behaviour. Or automated agents may assist you, over the network, to determine your insurance needs, or provide financial advice and portfolio management. As these systems, because more autonomous and reliance on them increases, we will need safeguards. Once a system becomes automated, positive feedback loops may develop and create problems like asset bubbles or market crashes. Autonomous AI can also lead to other unintended consequences, raising ethical and legal issues. In addition to the introduction of new services, the IoT will also lead to more transparency and efficiency, especially in trade, both locally and globally. The blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, could add unprecedented levels of security and authentication when it comes to things like tracking the whereabouts, ownership and condition of assets of all sorts. Says the 2015 Fintech 2.0 white paper: “We expect the IoT, combined with the distributed ledger and smart contracts, to dramatically reduce the costs of trade finance.” International trade is expected to grow by 8% per year by 2020, with associated finance revenues growing to $70 billion, according to the Fintech 2.0 report. “This represents a massive opportunity for both banks and fintech start-ups to…streamline trade finance processes,” it continues. Big financial organisations are trying to adapt by reaching out to small, more agile companies. Everledger, a London-based startup that uses blockchain technology to monitor the supply chain for diamonds and other precious stones sold at retail, has partnered with Mastercard. And BlockVerify, another London start-up that uses blockchain technology to improve anti-counterfeit measures in supply chains, is part of Startupbootcamp Fintech, supported by Rabobank and Lloyds banking group. As the IoT connects things like light bulbs in a home and integrates them into the network, the bulbs themselves may be able to negotiate the most favourable price for electricity from competitive power grids. Visa envisions lightbulbs paying for electricity only when they consume it. And rather than a single payment, the bulb pays continually and incrementally. This will require a new type of currency for ultra-tiny transactions. The digital currencies Bitcoin or Ethereum’s Ether may work for this, as well as paying for tiny chunks of bandwidth, storage, or CPU time in a computer, or energy and sensor data. Visa Europe is running a trial of such micropayment systems with Berlin-based SatoshiPay. But investor Goyal wonders “What happens if these micropayments get hacked?” The security and efficiency of such systems must be reassuringly reliable, but they aren’t yet. And financial services companies will need to do more. The companies that win in the networked economy will not just process transactions but must leverage the rich information in the electronic trail clients leave behind - the so-called digital slipstream, explains Earthport’s Marovitz. If banks become trusted brokers of our data and figure out how to leverage our digital breadcrumbs, the Web could be transformed from a place where people go to visit sites and be tracked without their knowledge, to one where we give permission to know what we are doing and that helps automate our lives. For example, say a consumer wants a car. Today she uses a bank network to send the payment. In the future, with banks as digital brokers, she could let it be known digitally that she is shopping for a car, a process known as “intent casting.” Others on the grid, like dealers or insurance companies, could pitch her in real-time, and she could filter those pitches based on their digital reputations. When she makes the purchase, the information for the paperwork to buy, insure and register the car could be released from her account, securely and with her permission, so it could go to relevant parties. She could also, if she chooses, authorise her data for third-party warranty services. In this scenario- originally envisioned by the Swift industry project - banks would take a cut for brokering these kinds of exchanges. When the IoT network is in full swing we may even be able to text our car and tell it to go sell or rent itself. When we do, a data broker - which may or may not be a bank - will make money managing millions of such transactions. This article was republished courtesy of the World Economic Forum.

The nine employees, who are residents of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, worked as home mortgage consultants for Wells Fargo and were terminated in 2015. They allege the company violated federal regulations to boost business by obtaining referrals of potential mortgage customers from a real estate title firm and in turn referring its mortgage customers to that title company for closing services. The practice went on from 2009 through 2012, when Wells Fargo was sued. Rather than end the practice, the company went on to commit the same violations with another title company, Patriot Land Title, which is headquartered in New Jersey, according to the new suit. The federal Consumer Protection Finance Bureau and the State of Maryland sued Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank in 2015, alleging the practices violated the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (known as the Dodd-Frank Act). How to safely and securely send us a tip Wells Fargo had to pay million of dollars in fines in a settlement of that case, according to this new suit. The employees now suing say they were told the switch in title companies was made in 2013 because of Wells' dissatisfaction with the service provided by Genuine, not because the company was potentially violating federal regulations. "In order to retain the profits from its unlawful consumer finance practices, Wells N.A. deliberately violated its Court-approved settlement agreement by having continued the same practice with another title insurance company, Patriot, by not disclosing that violation to the Consumer Finance Protection Board ("CFPB) as required by the Court Order," the suit states. An internal investigation resulted in the firing of the plaintiffs, even though, the suit contends, they were acting with the "approval and encouragement" of their supervisors. The fired employees were arbitrarily chosen to create the impression that the internal review had eliminated all of those responsible for the illegal activities, the suit states. The plaintiffs are Jeffrey A. Bellak, Theresa P. Cibotti, Marc S. Cramer, Thomas J. Crowe, John F. Dally, John Fuhrmeister, Philip Caruso, Jeffrey B. Nussbaum and Charles McKenna.

(Patrick Semansky, Associated Press) By Andrew J. Tobias, cleveland.com atobias@cleveland.com Quicken Loans supported Trump, but that doesn't mean Dan Gilbert always has. Kasich schedules a Cleveland stop on his upcoming book tour. And the Cleveland mayoral race gets an injection of personality. Read more in today's Ohio Politics Roundup, coming today from Andrew J. Tobias. Ohioans pony up for Trump's inaugural: Ohioans chipped in about $2 million of the whopping $106.7 million raised for President Donald Trump's inaugural, the Columbus Dispatch's Darrel Rowland reports. The total was double the previous record amount raised for President Barack Obama's festivities in 2009. Half of the Ohio money "came from two financial institutions: $500,000 each from JP Morgan Chase and longtime GOP backer American Financial Group. ..About $400,000 more came from mining interests in eastern Ohio, while Middletown Tube Works President and CEO Angela Phillips added $160,000." And from that state up north: "Quicken Loans, run by Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert, contributed $750,000, but it's based in Detroit," Rowland notes. Reminder: Gilbert had backed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the 2016 primary, and later gave $150,000 benefiting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's campaign. But Gilbert has expressed some optimism for the Trump presidency, saying in January that he's happy Trump will take on 'crazy regulation.' DeVos chooses Ohio: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a school choice champion and wealthy GOP donor, joined one of her fiercest critics, national teachers union chief Randi Weingarten, on a visit to a public school Thursday in Van Wert in Northwest Ohio. Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, invited DeVos "to see what strategies are helping students be successful," according to the Associated Press. "Lori Bittner, principal of the Van Wert Early Childhood Center, which serves 325 preschool and kindergarten students --including those with special needs -- welcomed Ms. DeVos and shook her hand," reports Vanessa McCray of the Toledo Blade. Parents and teachers held a roundtable discussion with DeVos and Weingarten, who sat next to each other, McCray reports. Before her visit, in an op-ed on cleveland.com, DeVos said she wanted to make two things clear: "I believe every student should have an equal opportunity to get a great education. And I believe many of those great educations are, and will continue to be, provided by traditional public schools." Kasich's road show: Besides a previously announced return to New Hampshire, and a CNN town hall with Anderson Cooper on Monday, Gov. John Kasich is hitting some high-profile spots during a tour promoting his new book "Two Paths: America Divided or United," which comes out Tuesday. As Rowland reports, Kasich has an appearance booked at the Nixon Library in California. He's also going to Harvard University, where he'll be interviewed by political analyst and former presidential adviser David Gergen. Other stops include Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. Oh, and there are some Ohio stops on the tour, including an April 30 gig at 1 p.m. at the Barnes & Noble in Crocker Park in Westlake. Leaning red: Ohio is likely to elect a Republican governor next year to succeed Kasich, according to Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball, a publication of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, reports Laura A. Bischoff of the Dayton Daily News. "Ohio turned sharply toward the GOP in 2016, and Republicans have a stronger field of candidates at the moment. At this early point, Leans Republican seems appropriate, though the environment will obviously matter," Bischoff quoted from Sabato's report. The report cited the GOP's strong bench of contenders - Attorney General Mike DeWine, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, Secretary of State Jon Husted and U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci of Wadsworth. But it didn't overlook possible Democratic contenders. Former U.S. Rep. Betty Sutton and Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley "are probably the two most credible candidates in that group. Looming in the background is Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray, a former state attorney general and treasurer who may only run if Trump fires him from his current job, as well as former Rep. Dennis Kucinich," the report says, according to Bischoff. Dennis! speculation continues: Speaking of Kucinich, he's scheduled to appear in Dayton Monday to hold a press conference and town hall meeting, the same day Kasich is holding his national TV town hall. As Will Garbe of the Dayton Daily News reports, Kucinich's appearance further fuels speculation about his gubernatorial ambitions. His topic is "the impact of privatization on Ohio's public schools," Garbe writes. Ryan's money: One prominent Democrat who passed up the governor's race, U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan of the Youngstown area, raised a near-record amount of cash during the first quarter of the year for his congressional re-election next year, reports David Skolnick of the Youngstown Vindicator. Ryan raised $162,825, his second-strongest fundraising quarter. But, Skolnick writes, "Ryan spent $150,552 - the most he's ever spent for a first quarter." Mom sent back to Mexico: Despite pleas from religious leaders and prominent Ohio politicians, Maribel Trujillo Diaz, a mother of four from Fairfield in Southwest Ohio, was deported back to Mexico Wednesday, WCPO reported. "Trujillo, who came to the country illegally in 2002, said she'd fled Mexico because drug cartels targeted her family," the report said. A federal appeals court last week denied her petition for a stay. Republican U.S. Rep. Warren Davidson was asked about the deportation Wednesday during an event in Oxford, reports Michael D. Pitman of the Dayton Daily News. Davidson said Trujillo had not requested help from his office, and "Frankly it was questionable whether if we could do casework for her. She was not a U.S. citizen," Pitman writes. "That response brought the mostly left-leaning crowd of about 75 people to shout the things they believed Trujillo did do: pay taxes, be a productive community member, possess a valid work permit, and take care of her four children between the ages of 3 and 14." More on the immigration front: The future of a federal immigration program that lets rich foreign families come to the United States and stay, as long as they invest $500,000 in job-creating economic development and pass background checks, could be in jeopardy, cleveland.com's Stephen Koff reports. "The visa-for-cash program is supposed to help down-on-their-heels areas where banks and U.S. citizens might be reluctant to invest, and its promoters say it paid off wildly in cities like Cleveland -- and helped about 1,500 foreigners who invested in the area, mostly living in China at the time, get two-year visas or permanent residency in the United States. But it's also helped fund upscale developments like shopping centers with Apple stores, Hyatt hotels and offices in relatively affluent places like Westlake and midtown Manhattan," Koff explains. Livening up the Cleveland's mayor's race: "The Cleveland mayoral race now has personality," cleveland.com columnist Mark Naymik observed after Cleveland City Councilman Zack Reed threw his hat in the ring. "Regardless of his many faults, Reed will inject a large voice into the race. And it's one that Jackson and the other candidates - who have largely been quiet - won't be able to ignore for long," Naymik says. Steeling for a fight: "President Donald Trump today ordered the Commerce Department to investigate whether steel imports harm the defense of the United States, moving the ongoing complaints from the steel industry and steelmakers to a new plane -- one that could lead to new sanctions and trade actions between this country and its steelmaking competitors, Koff reported Thursday. On hand in the Oval Office were representatives of the steel industry and United Steelworkers union, including top executives from Timken Steel, based in Canton; West Chester-based AK Steel, and ArcelorMittal, a global steelmaker with a large Cleveland operation.  "This executive order will give us the tools we need to lure our companies back and our people back to work," said Leo Gerard, president the Steelworkers union. Koff notes that "Congress members from Ohio applauded Trump's willingness to investigate the issue. But some said they are not yet convinced he will follow up as they say is needed. The last time such an inquiry was launched, when George W. Bush was president, no action followed." Rising to the challenge: Cleveland City Council candidate and community activist Basheer Jones fended off a challenge to his Ward 7 residency, cleveland.com's Robert Higgs reports. The Cuyahoga County Board of Elections on Wednesday dismissed a challenge filed by four residents. Jones is one of several potential candidates seeking to unseat Councilman TJ Dow. Happening today: The Ohio Republican Party central committee is meeting in Columbus. The meeting agenda is light -- a party GOP spokesman said it will focus on filling a vacancy on the committee and making internal committee assignments.

By Sujata RaoLONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Russian 10-year bond yields
fell to three-year lows on Friday on expectations of a rate cut,
although the rouble along with most other emerging assets was
flat to weaker as the dollar and U.S. yields held off recent
lows.
    The first round of French presidential elections this
weekend has fuelled market jitters, even though far-right,
anti-euro candidate Marine Le Pen is seen as unlikely to win the
second and final round in May [nL8N1HS760].
    A rally in emerging markets has also been checked by
tensions around Syria and North Korea, as well as worries over
the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has launched a
probe against China and other steel exporters [nL3N1HT1V2].
    MSCI's emerging equity index <.MSCIEF> rose 0.3 percent, but
data from JPMorgan showed slowing inflows into emerging market
funds, with equity and bond funds receiving $650 million and
$1.3 billion respectively in the past week.
    Chinese mainland shares posted their worst week of 2017 on
fears of greater regulator scrutiny. Asian steelmakers' shares,
however, shrugged off Trump's trade threats.[nL3N1HT1V2]
    Most emerging currencies were flat to weaker against the
dollar, but looked poised to end the week stronger.
    South Africa's rand was set for its second week of gains
after sharp falls in the two preceding weeks following a credit
rating downgrade to junk <ZAR=>. South African local yields
touched a three-week low after data showed slowing inflation
<ZAR186=>.
    Turkey's lira firmed more than two percent this week <TRY=>
after President Tayyip Erdogan won last weekend's referendum on
awarding him greater powers.
    The Russian rouble only strengthened a slither over the week
<RUB=> but is likely to gain support from bond market flows.
    Ten-year bond yields tumbled to 7.79 percent, the lowest
since January 2014 and down 15 basis points this week, after
central bank chief Elvira Nabiullina said a 25-50 bps rate cut
was possible next week [nL8N1HS2XF]. One-and two-year yields too
fell, touching 12-week lows, according to Reuters data.
    Falling interest rates have enticed foreign players too -
Wednesday's auction saw bids of 74 billion roubles for 20
billion roubles in 15-year bonds [nL8N1HR3QD]
    Maxim Korovin an analyst at VTB Capital said that after
easily absorbing Wednesday's auction volumes, investors had
turned to secondary markets, with many trying to re-invest the
150 billion worth of rouble debt that matured this week.
    "Initially OFZs were led by the local interest, but in the
afternoon fast international money joined the rally, pushing
(price) quotes even further north," Korovin told clients.
    Per Hammarlund, chief emerging markets analyst at SEB in
Stockholm, noted the rouble's strength despite oil's large
weekly price drop and said end-month tax payment would continue
to support it. The currency is up 4 percent this month.
    "Part of the reason why yields have come down is the central
bank, but also people bringing in money early to pay taxes, and
they have to put it somewhere," he said.
    Central European currencies saw some pressure from French
election jitters, with the Polish zloty near one-month lows
<EURPLN=> and the Czech crown standing just off the 27-per-euro
floor that was scrapped earlier this month.
    "We are seeing a bit of a soft period in central and eastern
Europe, even the Czech crown touched the previous floor. Many,
including me, believed it would drop down to the low 26s maybe

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Bonds News | Fri Apr 21, 2017 | 5:08am EDT EMERGING MARKETS-Russian debt gains on rate cut signals, other markets weaken By Sujata Rao | LONDON, April 21 LONDON, April 21 Russian 10-year bond yields fell to three-year lows on Friday on expectations of a rate cut, although the rouble along with most other emerging assets was flat to weaker as the dollar and U.S. yields held off recent lows. The first round of French presidential elections this weekend has fuelled market jitters, even though far-right, anti-euro candidate Marine Le Pen is seen as unlikely to win the second and final round in May. A rally in emerging markets has also been checked by tensions around Syria and North Korea, as well as worries over the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has launched a probe against China and other steel exporters. MSCI's emerging equity index rose 0.3 percent, but data from JPMorgan showed slowing inflows into emerging market funds, with equity and bond funds receiving $650 million and $1.3 billion respectively in the past week. Chinese mainland shares posted their worst week of 2017 on fears of greater regulator scrutiny. Asian steelmakers' shares, however, shrugged off Trump's trade threats. Most emerging currencies were flat to weaker against the dollar, but looked poised to end the week stronger. South Africa's rand was set for its second week of gains after sharp falls in the two preceding weeks following a credit rating downgrade to junk. South African local yields touched a three-week low after data showed slowing inflation . Turkey's lira firmed more than two percent this week after President Tayyip Erdogan won last weekend's referendum on awarding him greater powers. The Russian rouble only strengthened a slither over the week but is likely to gain support from bond market flows. Ten-year bond yields tumbled to 7.79 percent, the lowest since January 2014 and down 15 basis points this week, after central bank chief Elvira Nabiullina said a 25-50 bps rate cut was possible next week. One-and two-year yields too fell, touching 12-week lows, according to Reuters data. Falling interest rates have enticed foreign players too - Wednesday's auction saw bids of 74 billion roubles for 20 billion roubles in 15-year bonds Maxim Korovin an analyst at VTB Capital said that after easily absorbing Wednesday's auction volumes, investors had turned to secondary markets, with many trying to re-invest the 150 billion worth of rouble debt that matured this week. "Initially OFZs were led by the local interest, but in the afternoon fast international money joined the rally, pushing (price) quotes even further north," Korovin told clients. Per Hammarlund, chief emerging markets analyst at SEB in Stockholm, noted the rouble's strength despite oil's large weekly price drop and said end-month tax payment would continue to support it. The currency is up 4 percent this month. "Part of the reason why yields have come down is the central bank, but also people bringing in money early to pay taxes, and they have to put it somewhere," he said. Central European currencies saw some pressure from French election jitters, with the Polish zloty near one-month lows and the Czech crown standing just off the 27-per-euro floor that was scrapped earlier this month. "We are seeing a bit of a soft period in central and eastern Europe, even the Czech crown touched the previous floor. Many, including me, believed it would drop down to the low 26s maybe high 25s (against the euro) - it is partly related to the French elections," Hammarlund said.

The first round of French presidential elections this weekend has fuelled market jitters, even though far-right, anti-euro candidate Marine Le Pen is seen as unlikely to win the second and final round in May. A rally in emerging markets has also been checked by tensions around Syria and North Korea, as well as worries over the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has launched a probe against China and other steel exporters. MSCI's emerging equity index rose 0.3 percent, but data from JPMorgan showed slowing inflows into emerging market funds, with equity and bond funds receiving $650 million and $1.3 billion respectively in the past week. Chinese mainland shares posted their worst week of 2017 on fears of greater regulator scrutiny. Asian steelmakers' shares, however, shrugged off Trump's trade threats. Most emerging currencies were flat to weaker against the dollar, but looked poised to end the week stronger. South Africa's rand was set for its second week of gains after sharp falls in the two preceding weeks following a credit rating downgrade to junk. South African local yields touched a three-week low after data showed slowing inflation . Turkey's lira firmed more than two percent this week after President Tayyip Erdogan won last weekend's referendum on awarding him greater powers. The Russian rouble only strengthened a slither over the week but is likely to gain support from bond market flows. Ten-year bond yields tumbled to 7.79 percent, the lowest since January 2014 and down 15 basis points this week, after central bank chief Elvira Nabiullina said a 25-50 bps rate cut was possible next week. One-and two-year yields too fell, touching 12-week lows, according to Reuters data. Falling interest rates have enticed foreign players too - Wednesday's auction saw bids of 74 billion roubles for 20 billion roubles in 15-year bonds Maxim Korovin an analyst at VTB Capital said that after easily absorbing Wednesday's auction volumes, investors had turned to secondary markets, with many trying to re-invest the 150 billion worth of rouble debt that matured this week. "Initially OFZs were led by the local interest, but in the afternoon fast international money joined the rally, pushing (price) quotes even further north," Korovin told clients. Per Hammarlund, chief emerging markets analyst at SEB in Stockholm, noted the rouble's strength despite oil's large weekly price drop and said end-month tax payment would continue to support it. The currency is up 4 percent this month. "Part of the reason why yields have come down is the central bank, but also people bringing in money early to pay taxes, and they have to put it somewhere," he said. Central European currencies saw some pressure from French election jitters, with the Polish zloty near one-month lows and the Czech crown standing just off the 27-per-euro floor that was scrapped earlier this month. "We are seeing a bit of a soft period in central and eastern Europe, even the Czech crown touched the previous floor. Many, including me, believed it would drop down to the low 26s maybe high 25s (against the euro) - it is partly related to the French elections," Hammarlund said.

The event, which will be held at the university's waterfront School of Business, will focus on the theme of "Womenomics: Making the case for Women in the Workforce." Participants will learn from business leaders how financial access, health care, education, leadership and entrepreneurship are shaping the future roles of women in the global economy. One World is an outgrowth of the international network built by Henderson and Daryl Rand, chairman of Friends of India: USA, Inc., through a decade of trade missions to India to foster the cultural exchange of ideas and best practices. "The One World conference presents an opportunity for a timely discussion on global equality," Henderson said in a statement. "As the first female president at New Jersey City University, I know firsthand the importance of sharing experiences, insights, resources and opportunities that will help to inform how we progress in our professional and personal lives," she added. Major highlights of the three-day program will include a strong focus on technology with Skype and live feed sessions with women leaders in India, China, Ecuador and Italy.

Ahead of vote, which is being described as the most uncertain election ever in French politics, here's a look at the key details. Why is this election important? France is the second-largest economy in the euro zone and one of the seven biggest across the world. Its president holds enough powers to influence the country's economic and political path. Furthermore, this election takes place at a time when the French people are increasingly concerned on security matters, after several terrorist attacks across the country, and disenchanted with high levels of unemployment and poor economic performance since the 2008 crisis. The candidates' proposals show that whatever the outcome this election will not only shape the future of France, but also of the European Union. "As two candidates to the French presidential election expressed their desire to work on a 'Frexit' once elected, these elections have of course implications beyond French borders," Vincent Juvyns, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC via email. Anne-Christine Poujoulat | AFP | Getty Images "Though the legislative hurdles to get to a 'Frexit' are high, one can at this stage not say that it is impossible. In such a situation, the European project would definitely be at risk, the volatility would increase on financial markets and we could get in a situation at least similar to the European debt crisis of 2012," he added. For the first time in 15 years, the far right has realistic chances of getting into power. This is also the first time in modern France when the incumbent president hasn't run for a second term. How many candidates are running? There are 11 candidates running, of which four make up the list of frontrunners. A poll released by Elabe on Friday morning showed the centrist and independent candidate Emmanuel Macron winning the first round with 24 percent of the votes, closely followed by the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen with 21.5 percent of the support. The conservative candidate Francois Fillon placed third with 20 percent and the member of the far left Jean-Luc Melenchon came fourth with 19.5 percent. All polls have shown that this election is too close to call. Why are there two rounds of voting? France use the two-round voting system. A leader can be elected this Sunday if they win an outright majority but the polls suggest that this is unlikely. As a result, a run-off between the two leading candidates is expected and is scheduled for May 7. Chesnot | Getty Images In this photo illustration, a French voter registration card is seen in front of official campaign posters for all eleven candidates for the 2017 French presidential elections posted outside a polling station on April 20, 2017 in Paris, France. When will we know the results? Polling stations are due to close between 7 p.m. Paris time (8 p.m. for the big cities) on Sunday. Preliminary results are expected around 9 p.m. Paris time, slightly later than usual as the close race is expected to complicate and delay the results. In recent history, France has never had a race that was too close to call, with the two leading candidates usually being pretty clear. "This is a four way race with the potential for the numbers to be quite close to one another. In the previous elections exit polls have over/under estimated the candidates by up to +-2 percent either way. They correct themselves as the night progresses and typically by 9:30 pm (London time) they are more confident as to the results," Nomura noted in a research note on Thursday. What happens after the runoff? With the run-off schedule for May 7, it is expected that a new president will be formally confirmed by May 11. "The official investiture of the new president will take place on the Sunday 14 May at the latest," Juvyns from JPMorgan said. He added that the formation of the next government will depend on who's elected. "In the case of Francois Fillon or Emmanuel Macron, they should in theory be able to form a rather stable government as they have a wide - direct or indirect - support in both houses. For Marine Le Pen and Jean-Luc Melenchon, it could be more challenging given there is low support in the lower and upper house and also because the legislative elections in June could oblige them to work with other political parties in their governments which would be less likely for Fillon or Macron." show chapters French voters unlikely to be deterred by suspected terror attack    Friday, 21 Apr 2017 | 1:26 AM ET | 03:07 How will markets react on Sunday? "We think it will probably need both Le Pen and Melenchon to get through to the second round to do the euro any significant harm," United Overseas Bank said in a note on Friday morning. The worst case for markets would be if the far right and the far left made it to the second round and UOB believes there's only about a 25 percent chance for such a scenario. However, the analysts said it would mean a much lower EUR/USD, with risk of breaking below the year to-date-low of 1.0340. If polls prove to be right and Macron and Le Pen make it to the run-off, "EUR/USD could retest the 1.09-figure, though we don't see the pair trading significantly higher," the bank said.

The Human and Environmental Development Agenda, HEDA Resource Centre, has petitioned Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, requesting the representation of Nigeria as an aggrieved party in the hearing of the Milan Court's prosecution of Shell and ENI with respect to the scandalous Malabu deal. In a petition addressed to Mr. Osinbajo, who also doubles as the Chairman Asset Recovery Committee, HEDA in the petition signed by its chairman, Olanrewaju Suraju, urged the federal government to request that the Italian court judge should recognize Nigeria as a civil party to the criminal proceeding in order to request adequate compensation for the damages received by the corruption scheme. "The media was awash about six years ago with information on how one of Nigeria's richest oil field, OPL 245 was sold in shady circumstances and more than half of the $1.1 Billion paid to Malabu Oil and Gas for the procurement was used to bribe Nigerian politicians and intermediaries who helped to secure the controversial deal for both Shell and ENI. "Media reports on the issue indicted former President Goodluck Jonathan, some public officials in his administration, some Italian nationals, including the Nigerian Agip Exploration, Shell and Eni.

"Shell has now admitted that it knew that former oil minister Dan Etete, a convicted money-launderer, was involved in Malabu and that the proceeds of the 2011 deal went to Malabu. It is a matter of record that Etete awarded OPL 245 to Malabu when he was himself the oil minister." Stating further issues, HEDA said the reports of the Public Prosecution Office at the Ordinary Court of Milan, in its notification of completion of preliminary investigations, highlighted the role of Eni's former Chief Executive Officer, Paola Scaroni and his successor Claudio Descalzi and indicted them for alleged international corruption over the scandal. The NGO said its petition in respect of the stated prosecution is buoyed by facts at its disposal. "Evidence abound via leaked emails that senior executives of the companies were aware that payments made in 2011 for oil block OPL 245, one of Africa's most valuable oil blocks would go to convicted money launderer and ex-Nigerian oil minister, Dan Etete, and certain government officials rather than to the suffering people of Nigeria but still selfishly and corruptly went through with the deal that deprived the Nigerian people of billions of dollars. "This goes to prove that the companies who are purportedly most powerful and profitable oil companies have only masqueraded as leaders of responsible businesses, while robbing countries of their natural resources. As noted, Shell has officially admitted that it had knowledge of Dan Etete's potential benefit from the deal. "Currently two countries have opened investigations into the deal and there is a strong chance that Shell and ENI would lose the oil block following the trial on international corruption charges. "Shell and Eni's corrupt deal had huge consequences for ordinary Nigerians as right now, according to Global Witness, about five million people across Nigeria face starvation and one in ten children do not live to see their fifth birthday, while the money paid for the block equates to one and a half times what the United Nations says is needed to respond to the country's current famine crisis. Also, the payment for the deal is worth more than Nigeria's entire health budget for 2016."

In a petition addressed to Mr. Osinbajo, who also doubles as the Chairman Asset Recovery Committee, HEDA  urged the federal government to request that the Italian court judge should recognize Nigeria as a civil party to the criminal proceeding in order to request adequate compensation for the damages received by the corruption scheme. “The media was awash about six years ago with information on how one of Nigeria’s richest oil field, OPL 245 was sold in shady circumstances and more than half of the $1.1 Billion paid to Malabu Oil and Gas for the procurement was used to bribe Nigerian politicians and intermediaries who helped to secure the controversial deal for both Shell and ENI. “Despite overwhelming evidences showing that Shell and Eni are aware that a specified chunk of the money would be paid to a character with a shady background, officials of the companies have denied any wrong doing in the affair, even when it was revealed that on the 29th of April, 2011 Eni transferred $1.092 Billion dollars into an escrow account of the Nigerian government at the bank, JP Morgan Chase in London which is not the usual account of the state but a parallel one. “Shell has now admitted that it knew that former oil minister Dan Etete, a convicted money-launderer, was involved in Malabu and that the proceeds of the 2011 deal went to Malabu. It is a matter of record that Etete awarded OPL 245 to Malabu when he was himself the oil minister.” Stating further issues, HEDA said the reports of the Public Prosecution Office at the Ordinary Court of Milan, in its notification of completion of preliminary investigations, highlighted the role of Eni’s former Chief Executive Officer, Paola Scaroni and his successor Claudio Descalzi and indicted them for alleged international corruption over the scandal. The NGO said its petition in respect of the stated prosecution is buoyed by facts at its disposal. “Evidence abound via leaked emails that senior executives of the companies were aware that payments made in 2011 for oil block OPL 245, one of Africa’s most valuable oil blocks would go to convicted money launderer and ex-Nigerian oil minister, Dan Etete, and certain government officials rather than to the suffering people of Nigeria but still selfishly and corruptly went through with the deal that deprived the Nigerian people of billions of dollars. “This goes to prove that the companies who are purportedly most powerful and profitable oil companies have only masqueraded as leaders of responsible businesses, while robbing countries of their natural resources. As noted, Shell has officially admitted that it had knowledge of Dan Etete’s potential benefit from the deal. “Currently two countries have opened investigations into the deal and there is a strong chance that Shell and ENI would lose the oil block following the trial on international corruption charges. “Shell and Eni’s corrupt deal had huge consequences for ordinary Nigerians as right now, according to Global Witness, about five million people across Nigeria face starvation and one in ten children do not live to see their fifth birthday, while the money paid for the block equates to one and a half times what the United Nations says is needed to respond to the country’s current famine crisis. Also, the payment for the deal is worth more than Nigeria’s entire health budget for 2016.” SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleWe’ve Not Increased Cooking Gas Price – NLNG Next articleObuah Laments Absence Of FG’s Projects In Rivers admin RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR News ‘Consolidate Gains Of Osinbajo N’ Delta Tour’ News Rivers Set To Launch 50-Year Dev Plan News We’ll Abandon Party For Sheriff If… – Ihedioha News Buhari Must Govern Personally, Not Through Proxies – Fayose News No Propaganda Can Stop Wike’s Dev Strides – SA News Banigo Harps On Regular Medical Checks Stay connected 63,341FollowersFollow 2,791SubscribersSubscribe - Advertisement -Tweets by @TheTideNewspape Archives Archives Select Month April 2017  (670) March 2017  (961) February 2017  (825) January 2017  (897) December 2016  (427) November 2016  (496) October 2016  (870) September 2016  (674) August 2016  (583) July 2016  (962) June 2016  (696) May 2016  (648) April 2016  (813) March 2016  (580) February 2016  (594) January 2016  (726) December 2015  (508) November 2015  (144) October 2015  (356) September 2015  (334) August 2015  (948) July 2015  (831) June 2015  (737) May 2015  (436) April 2015  (690) March 2015  (783) February 2015  (879) January 2015  (808) December 2014  (675) November 2014  (771) October 2014  (903) September 2014  (619) August 2014  (783) July 2014  (752) June 2014  (796) May 2014  (801) April 2014  (889) March 2014  (863) February 2014  (678) January 2014  (995) December 2013  (804) November 2013  (614) October 2013  (789) September 2013  (591) August 2013  (570) July 2013  (750) June 2013  (656) May 2013  (433) April 2013  (801) March 2013  (895) February 2013  (747) January 2013  (687) December 2012  (735) November 2012  (714) October 2012  (720) September 2012  (797) August 2012  (927) July 2012  (856) June 2012  (792) May 2012  (765) April 2012  (751) March 2012  (933) February 2012  (681) January 2012  (660) December 2011  (536) November 2011  (663) October 2011  (649) September 2011  (677) August 2011  (651) July 2011  (858) June 2011  (404) May 2011  (370) April 2011  (113) March 2011  (215) February 2011  (497) January 2011  (617) December 2010  (445) November 2010  (393) October 2010  (505) August 2010  (234) July 2010  (680) June 2010  (1000) May 2010  (644) April 2010  (526) March 2010  (521) February 2010  (175) January 2010  (604) December 2009  (660) November 2009  (846) October 2009  (617) September 2009  (131) August 2009  (244) July 2009  (546) June 2009  (106) February 2009  (22) The Tide Newspaper is the most respected source of news and information for readers in Nigeria , with the latest stories on politics and current affairs, business and technology, sports, culture and the arts, as well as the popular citylife supplement, with nightlife news, restaurant reviews and top events.

Dakota Access Pipeline Mogul Cut $250,000 Check for Trump's Inauguration Thursday, April 20, 2017 By Sam Sacks, The District Sentinel | Report font size decrease font size increase font size Print Tweet Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, DC, January 24, 2017. (Photo: Doug Mills / The New York Times) Financial disclosures filed on Tuesday reveal that corporate chiefs, including those with pending business before then-incoming President Trump, provided much of the financing for the festivities around his inauguration. Complying with federal law, the Trump Inaugural Committee disclosed its donors to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on Tuesday, showing total contributions of more than $106 million -- a new record. Included in the roster of funders is pipeline builder Kelcy Warren, who contributed a quarter-million dollars to the event. Warren's company, Energy Transfer, is behind construction of the controversial Dakota Access pipeline. In an interview with The Dallas News in January, Warren described 2016 as the "toughest year of my life," referring to protests that rocked the company over the construction of DAPL. He said that Trump's election gave him hope. Protests over DAPL forced the Obama administration to put the project on hold. Indigenous and environmental activists claim the pipeline threatens lands and water that are crucial to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North Dakota. Trump, however, ignored those pleas and green-lighted construction of DAPL in February. Several other companies that later benefited from executive actions taken by President Trump also donated to the inauguration. Coal mining giant Murray Energy and petrol companies Chevron and Citgo gave over a million dollars combined. Last month, Trump took actions that put former President Obama's signature climate change regulation, the Clean Power Plan, in jeopardy. Health insurance companies MetLife and Anthem also chucked over $100,000 apiece at the Trump inaugural committee, just as the incoming administration was plotting to repeal Affordable Care Act regulations. Other inaugural donors included top Wall Street firms like JP Morgan Chase and American Financial Group. Both companies each forked over $500,000 to Trump's celebratory organization. In his first few months in office, Trump has also taken aim at financial rules put in place by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform law. Well-known GOP funder and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson was the top contributor to the inaugural committee, donating a whopping $5 million. Notable investor Charles Schwab and GoDaddy.com founder Bob Parson also were large donors, each one contributing a million dollars. That donation tier provided access to a "leadership luncheon" described as "an exclusive event with select Cabinet appointees and House and Senate leadership," according to documents obtained by the Center for Public Integrity. The $106.7 million raised in total is a biggest haul of any inaugural committee. Former President Obama's 2013 Inaugural Committee collected $44.6 million, and also solicited corporate donors. Independent media is crucial for keeping a close watch on the Trump administration and Truthout takes that responsibility seriously.

The new Administration continues irregular progress with its campaign promises, faltering with reworking broad medical coverage. This led to reduced expectations that the tax cuts so eagerly awaited by the business community will become law anytime soon. When combined with developing uncertainties from Britain’s divorce from the EU, increased tensions with Russia, the French elections and threats from the grotesque government of North Korea, the news presents stock investors with several worries. Still, the stock market is up five percent in 2017. Geopolitical crises are unsettling to all of us but their effect on stock prices is surprisingly mild. The attack on Pearl Harbor dropped 3% on the following Monday and made up these losses in a month. They were up 50% when that war ended and also gained during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. More recent conflicts ranging from the Gulf Wars, Kosovo and Afghanistan also ended in market gains. One theory is that national cohesiveness develops during military creases, soothing market volatility. Stock markets usually tumble in the midst of optimistic complacency. The dot.com euphoria from 1995 to 2000 took the technology-heavy NASDAQ average from 1,000 to 5,000 and the Price-earnings ratio over 200. The NASDAQ fell 78% in 30 months, a Darwinian purge whose survivors are the leaders of the technology sector today. Greed also led to the global real estate bubble of 2007-2008. Euphoria prevailed and borrowing was absurdly easy on little or no collateral for almost any purpose. Even Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said in 2005 that there was “a little froth” in the U.S. housing market. There certainly was and the inevitable crash took over 11 million homes in the U.S. into negative equity. “Irrational exuberance” [greed] is always hard to perceive in the middle of clouds of optimism. There are rational underpinnings for market growth, many reflected in the developing reporting season for quarterly corporate earnings reports. Initial reports are mildly encouraging. Three-quarters of the company announcements so far report higher earnings per share than prior estimates. Over half are reporting higher sales than expected. In the strong financial sector, Goldman Sachs dropped on earnings shortfall attributed to trading losses. Morgan Stanley (MS-$42) beat estimates and remains my favorite among investment banks. JP Morgan Chase (JPM-reported $1.65 quarterly earnings per share (“eps”) against estimates of $1.52. Bank of America (BAC-$23) earned $.41, beating estimates of $.35. BlackRock (BLK-$382) reported eps of $5.25, handily beating estimates of $4.94. Amazon (AMZN-$903) reports next week and Apple (AAPL-$142) in two weeks. Amazon estimates are all over the place, ranging from $1.10 eps to $2.35. Its revenue reports are more critical to this online giant and should be around $35 billion for the quarter, up from $29 billion. Apple should report $2.00-$2.02 for the quarter, up from $1.90. Its full year estimates should be close to $9.00, yielding a very reasonable valuation of 16 with a 1.6% dividend yield. Before 2020, one of these companies will undoubtedly reach a market cap (share price times number of shares outstanding) of a trillion dollars. Large, forward-looking technology companies like these two should form the core of stock portfolios. These replace the traditional conventional recommendations of big oil companies, big steel, gold miners and faded wonders like Polaroid and Eastman Kodak. Big biotech companies should take their place. Big pharma and biotech slipped when Johnson & Johnson missed earnings estimates, creating a buying spot for Amgen ($162), and Celgene (CELG-$123), before they both report earnings in another week. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ-$154) is resuming growth after winning a patent suit and may return to our portfolios. The headlines are troubling but these often accompany investment opportunities for investors who keep their cool. Paradoxes will always prevail as Dickens wrote, “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness . . .” Tony Crowell manages stock portfolios for individuals and their trust and retirement accounts with CROWELL•ROBERTS Investment Counsel, a registered investment advisor in Laguna Beach since 1995.

Vanity Fair hive Sign In/Up business technology politics the players hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology The Players Sign In/Up Levin Report Trump Says “Massive” Tax Plan Is Coming Wednesday . . . “or Thereafte… Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Levin Report Trump Says “Massive” Tax Plan Is Coming Wednesday . . . “or Thereafter” The smart money is on “thereafter.” by Bess LevinApril 21, 2017 6:16 pm Email Facebook Twitter Get ready for...something! Sometime! By Mark Wilson/Getty Images. On February 9, Donald Trump announced that he would be revealing a “big league,” “phenomenal” tax plan within two to three weeks. If you were wondering if you missed it, worry not: the plan never actually materialized, and, naturally, no one in the White House said anything about blowing the self-imposed deadline. On Friday, after announcing earlier in the week that Team Trump would “surprise” Americans with how quickly the same group of people who couldn’t repeal or replace Obamacare would pass comprehensive tax reform—literally the day after his Treasury secretary conceded they’d been overly ambitious with their timeline—Trump told the Associated Press that a plan that includes a “massive tax cut” for businesses and individuals will be released next “Wednesday or shortly thereafter.” The promise of comprehensive tax reform is, of course, the one thing keeping people on Wall Street and in the business community from throwing themselves off a figurative cliff, and lately, they seem to be reconsidering their faith in the president. The S&P500 and the Dow Jones have both been trending downward since the beginning of March as the Great Trump Rally fades. Assuming the plan does materialize next week—and that’s a big assumption!—there’s still plenty of uncertainty, even among Team Trump, as to whether they can get the job done.

Man allegedly had very bad plan to make money Back in February, Florida resident Mark Charles Barnett was charged with plotting to blow up a string of Target stores on the East Coast, theorizing, according to prosecutors, “that the company’s stock value would plunge after the explosions, allowing him to cheaply acquire shares of Target stock before an eventual rebound in prices.” Most people who heard about that story presumably thought it was a really terrible idea, while others . . . A Russian-German man allegedly bombed one of Germany’s most prominent soccer teams in order to make more than $1 million off a drop in the team’s stock price, officials said Friday. The 28-year-old suspect, identified as Sergej M., took out a loan on April 3 worth tens of thousands of dollars in order to finance a bet on a fall in soccer team Borussia Dortmund’s stock price, officials said. The bet included the purchase of 15,000 “put options” in the team’s shares, purchased the same day as the April 11 attack, that would have allowed the suspect to turn a profit on a falling stock price. That day, as Borussia Dortmund prepared to take on AS Monaco in a UEFA Champions League quarterfinal, the suspect stayed at the same hotel as the team, the prosecutor said. He planted three bombs along the street taken by the team bus, the prosecutor alleged. The bombs were covered with three-inch long metal pins and were set off by remote control as the bus departed from the hotel. According to North Rhine-Westphalia interior minister Ralf Jäger, Sergej M., who was arrested Friday, invested €79,000 ($85,000) in the stock options, which could have resulted in gains of €1 million or more if the team’s share price had plunged. On the first day of trading after the attack, the team’s stock initially fell but ended the session up 1.7 percent. Is France about to elect its own Trump? On Sunday, voters in France will head to the polls to cast their ballots for the first round of the country’s presidential election. One of the candidates is the far-right-leaning Marine Le Pen, who shares much of Donald Trump’s antipathy toward immigration and Muslims. Le Pen also wants to leave the European Union, and while that’s easier said than done, given that France’s membership in the E.U. is codified in its constitution, the prospect of her winning the eventual final round of the election is deeply scary for those who woke up on June 23, 2016, and November 9, 2016, and were horrified to learn the U.K. had voted to leave the E.U. and Donald Trump had been elected the 45th president of the United States, respectively. (Trump recently offered Le Pen an endorsement of sorts on Twitter, when he used Thursday’s terror attack in Paris to stump for the right-wing candidate.) Also worried, according to Reuters, are Paris’s bankers and brokers, who plan to start their work week on Sunday: Their workload will depend on the outcome of the tight race that could potentially see two extremes—the far right Marine Le Pen and the communist-backed leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon—make it to the second round. But the preparations underway already reflect the bankers' experience in facing market volatility following Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union and U.S. presidential elections last year. Societe Generale said it would be holding a conference call on the evening of Sunday, April 23 with some of its economists and strategists to discuss the first round results. Traders and financial analysts in some of the world's biggest investment firms in London will also be on standby for advising clients on Sunday evening and also primed for pre-dawn starts on Monday. Some investment banks and asset managers have already reduced and hedged their exposure to assets that could bear the brunt of volatility, depending on the outcome of the elections. “As for fixed income investors, they have also already sold out, because there was a buyer—the (European Central Bank) , which bought hundreds of billions of euros (of debt). There is no big reason to have a long position on France,” said Jean-Francois Legoux, a strategist at UBS Global Asset Management, based in Paris. GaveKal Research founder Charles Gave, who predicted Trump’s win, told Bloomberg he sees Le Pen emerging victorious. Great work, Deutsche Bank Make room in the trophy case! The German bank will be the recipient of a new lucite plaque in commemoration of being the first bank fined $19.7 million by the Federal Reserve “for not having in place an adequate compliance program for the Volcker rule, which prohibits banks from proprietary trading.” Overachievers that those Germans are, the bank has also been ordered to pay $136.9 million “for letting currency desks chat online with competitors, allegedly revealing positions.” Accepting the award/fine on Deutsche Bank’s behalf was spokesperson Renee Calabro, who said, ”We are pleased to resolve these civil enforcement matters with the Federal Reserve.” Bloomberg notes that since the beginning of 2008, Deutsche Bank has paid out $14.8 billion in fines and legal settlements, “the most of any European bank, and highlight the weakness of its controls after growing aggressively to compete with U.S. investment banks.” Goldman Sachs unveils “real time-employee performance reviews” Do you want to be constantly evaluated on your work? Do you want to open a document and get only “Today we—” on the page before a SWAT team of co-workers descends on your desk to offer suggestions for room for improvement? Consider applying for a job at Goldman Sachs today. Per The Wall Street Journal: The Wall Street firm is rolling out a new review system where employees can get ongoing feedback from their managers and peers. . . . The firm will continue to conduct annual reviews. Those remain a high-stakes affair that influences employees’ chances for promotion and the size of their all-important bonus checks. . . . A memo to employees explained the change this way: “Our employees want to know where they stand at all times.” If this all sounds great to you but Goldman Sachs isn’t your bag, JPMorgan introduced a similar program last month, “rolling out a tool that employees can use to request and receive feedback from anyone, anytime.” On its 92nd day, the Trump administration does one good thing Earlier this week, we learned that ExxonMobil had asked the government for a waiver to drill in Russia, contra the sanctions put in place by the Obama administration in 2014 in retaliation for Moscow’s annexation of Crimea. The request, in essence, would have forced the administration to drop any pretense of not having a soft spot for the Kremlin or ExxonMobil, which was until quite recently run by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Rejecting the waiver, on the other hand, would be a quick and easy way for the administration to score some good press and an ounce of credibility, if only it could overcome what we assume was every bone it its collective body telling it to do otherwise. But a stopped clock is right twice a day and even the most inept government in history, run by a Putin-loving billionaire with an ex-oilman as chief diplomat, occasionally does the right thing. Per CNBC: The Trump administration will not grant special permission to U.S. companies, including Exxon Mobil, to carry out oil and gas drilling in Russia while sanctions remain intact, according to a statement from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Friday. . . . Exxon said in a filing after the sanctions were put in place that its “maximum before-tax exposure to loss from these joint ventures” totaled $1 billion through the end of 2015. Exxon is concerned that European competitors still operating in Russia will gain an advantage in the Black Sea, a source briefed on its waiver application told the Wall Street Journal this week. The company also faces a contractual deadline to make an oil discovery there by the end of the year, the paper reported. What’s next? Hosting heads of state at the White House instead of Mar-a-Lago?

That’s not going over well at one of the biggest quant shops on Wall Street. Speaking at a closed-door Goldman Sachs Asset Management conference earlier this month, the billionaire hedge fund investor said that a portfolio strategy known as risk parity will eventually act as “the hammer on the downside” when turmoil returns to equity markets.  For AQR Capital Management LLC, a giant in the risk parity field, the concerns are overblown, with any selling forced by the strategy having an “utterly trivial” impact on the $23 trillion U.S. equity market. “There are scenarios in which risk parity funds sell equities, but the possible magnitude of that is very small,” said Michael Mendelson, a risk-parity portfolio manager at AQR.“Some reports have grossly exaggerated the potential impact.” Jones, who oversees $10 billion in his Greenwich, Connecticut-based Tudor Investment hedge fund, is the latest active asset manager to whip up fears surrounding the automated strategies that were a favorite target of bank researchers during the selloffs in August 2015 and early 2016. The strategy has less than $150 billion invested in it, according to data provider eVestment, most of at AQR and Bridgewater Associates’ All Weather Fund.  That’s significantly lower than the roughly $500 billion that some have estimated. And of that total, only around a third is investing in equities, Mendelson said. That compares to the nearly $2 trillion in market value that evaporated from U.S. equities during the last stock market correction. “Even on a sharp move in the stock market, the positioning changes would be utterly trivial and would have about zero impact,” Mendelson said. A spokesman for Paul Tudor Jones did not immediately respond to an email request seeking comment. Cash Fleeing Risk parity bases its allocations to different asset classes on risk rather than capital, as in the typical 60-40 stock-bond fund. So, for example, U.S. Treasures and international government bonds often play a larger role in risk parity funds than in other asset pools, while stocks usually take up a smaller slice. In addition, money has fled risk parity funds in seven of the past nine quarters, for net outflows of more than $16 billion among funds tracked by eVestment. But even in the scenario that Jones lays out, the funds wouldn’t dump their stock holdings for a variety of reasons, according to Edward Qian, who’s credited with coining the term risk parity. Because of the safer asset concentration, the strategy performs relatively better when stocks tumble and wouldn’t need to sell as much as a traditional 60-40 portfolio, Qian said. “They’re always focused on the equity portion of risk parity, saying that equities might have a terrible time and other scary fear mongering things,” Qian said. “Even if someone has a stop loss or equity reduction program, it can’t be a significant player in those time periods.” Pointing Fingers Take August 2015, when JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Marko Kolanovic shot to fame after attributing the correction in the S&P 500 Index to automated selling from quant funds such as risk parity. However, while the main equity gauge tumbled 11 percent in just five days, a risk parity strategy fell just half as much, as tracked by the Salient Risk Parity index. Not only did managers just sell a portion of their exposure, they didn’t all sell at once, AQR said at the time. Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up It’s true that under the risk parity framework most programs gobble up equities when volatility subsides. However, Qian says that stock holdings in his fund and others likely are hovering near their average levels, since they use multi-year measurements to calculate riskiness. Mendelson believes the funds may be reducing their equity exposure to keep up with their diversification models. And because their time horizon is long, it’ll take more than a few days of volatility to prompt selling, Qian said. Still, the quants don’t expect the finger pointing to stop. “First you had Leon Cooperman and now it’s a hedge fund guy,” said Qian. “Any time performance isn’t doing well, they just blame risk parity.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Photo courtesy of Bay Ridge Federal Credit Union Brooklyn Daily Eagle Anthony Grigos, who has been appointed president and CEO of the Bay Ridge Federal Credit Union, said he is looking forward to his new role at the firm where he served as second in command for four years. “It is an honor that comes with great responsibility to become president/CEO of Bay Ridge Federal Credit Union. And I am confident of the years that lie ahead for our credit union,” Grigos said in a statement issued April 20, the day the credit union officially announced his promotion. Grigos thanked outgoing president and CEO Gene Brody and the credit union’s board for their unwavering support and confidence in him. Brody, who will continue to serve the credit union as board treasurer and chief strategy officer, has worked there for 53 years, including 30 years as the president and CEO. On the promotion of Grigos, Brody said, “It was time to pass the reins.” It was Brody who recommended that Grigos succeed him in the top post, according to a press release issued by the firm on Thursday. Grigos had been the credit union’s executive vice president since 2013. Prior to joining Bay Ridge Federal Credit Union, Grigos had 15 years of experience in the real estate and mortgage industry. Earlier in his career, he rose to vice president at JP Morgan Chase in its Information Technology Division. His experience has helped grow Bay Ridge Federal Credit Union’s real estate lending programs while refining overall products and member service across all business line, according to company officials, who said his extensive technology background has been instrumental in the development of the credit union’s technology infrastructure to meet today’s demands for member service, operational efficiency and computer security. Grigos earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Brooklyn College and holds a Master’s Degree in Business Administration from Fordham University. Bay Ridge Federal Credit Union, established in 1934, was located for many years in Bay Ridge. The company moved to 1750 86th St. a few years ago. The credit union also has a second location in Brooklyn at 1609 Avenue Z. For more information, call 718-680-212 or 718-934-6809.

Morgan Stable Value Fund Litigation The plaintiffs seek to represent participants in more than 300 retirement plans which were invested in 78 stable value funds, according to the court’s order. By Rebecca Moore editors@plansponsor.com | April 21, 2017 A federal district court judge has certified a class and several subclasses in a lawsuit claiming retirement plans that included J.P. Morgan stable value investments suffered losses due to the firm’s imprudent management of the investments. The plaintiffs are investors who participated in various 401(k) retirement plans and allocated a portion of their retirement savings through those plans to certain stable value funds sold and/or managed by J.P. Morgan defendants. The named plaintiffs, of which there are twelve, invested in five of JPMC’s stable value funds through nine 401(k) retirement plans, each overseen by a different employer plan sponsor. They seek to represent participants in more than 300 retirement plans which were invested in 78 stable value funds, according to the court’s order. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants managed the plaintiffs’ investments imprudently in violation of its fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by causing its stable value funds to invest heavily in the Intermediate Bond Fund (IBF) and the Intermediate Public Bond Fund (IPBF). The defendants managed the IBF and IPBF in the same way and invested them both in risky, highly leveraged assets, including, among other things, mortgage-related assets. At the filing of the first lawsuit, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced it would shed mortgage debt from its stable value fund. The plaintiffs moved to certify a class and two subclasses of participants, which U.S. District Judge Vernon S. Broderick of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted. The defendants argued that those who participated in Caterpillar Inc.'s retirement plan were barred by a settlement agreement from bringing these claims. So, Broderick certified the Caterpillar Subclass, defined as: “All participants of the Caterpillar Plan, as well as beneficiaries of those plans, who were invested directly or indirectly in JPM’s Caterpillar Stable Principal Fund or any other JPM Stable Value Fund that invested in the JPM Intermediate Bond Fund and/or the Intermediate Public Bond Fund between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2010, and whose stable value fund investment performance underperformed the Hueler index or similar objective benchmark.” Tagged: Litigation, Litigation, Stable-Value-Funds, related articles related research most e-mailed Cover On Guard From plansponsor.com Judge Moves Forward J.P.

According to Zacks, “Cheesecake Factory’s shares have outpaced the Zacks classified Retail–Restaurants industry in the past 1 year. The company has posted positive comps in 28 consecutive quarters. Notably, its differentiated menu, operational distinction and unique ambiance appeal to customers. Going ahead, various initiatives to boost sales and traffic like menu innovation, roll-out of an improved server training program, launch of mobile payment app and increased focus on delivery service should aid in maintaining positive comps. The company’s aggressive expansion initiatives also bode well and should drive growth. Yet, while the company has a positive record earnings surprises in the last 4 quarters, estimates have been going down ahead of its Q1 earnings release. Higher labor and pre-openings costs along with expenses related to sales initiatives could hurt margins. A soft industry backdrop and underperformance by Grand Lux Cafe raise concern too.” A number of other brokerages have also commented on CAKE.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States FRB | Fri Apr 21, 2017 | 10:29am EDT Fintech challenge for regulators: Evolution or revolution? An illustration picture shows a projection of binary code around the shadow of a man holding a laptop computer in an office in Warsaw June 24, 2013. By Bora Yagiz Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence - Banks are vulnerable to challenges posed by a new breed of competitors in the form of technology-driven nonbank companies that have grown rapidly as regulators in the United States and around the world begin to deliberate between revolutionary and evolutionary approaches to fintech regulation. A recent global risk management survey conducted by Deloitte (here) cites the disruptive emergence of "fintech" firms as one of the key risk-management challenges facing the industry. FINTECH EMERGING AS STRONG COMPETITION TO BANKS "Fintech companies pose a strategic threat by potentially disrupting the financial sectors and services, in particular in the areas such as lending, payments, wealth management, and property and casualty products," Edward Hida, a partner at Deloitte Advisory told Regulatory Intelligence. Indeed, partly due to a regulatory void in which they have operated until recently, and the lackluster innovative adaptability by traditional banks, fintech companies have quickly moved on from their initially modest offerings in back office operations into areas such as trading, investment, retail banking, thus emerging as direct competitors in the industry. Large financial institutions across the world could lose 24 percent of their revenues to financial technology companies over the next three to five years, according to a new study by PricewaterhouseCoopers. In banking specifically, consumer services such as personal loans, were seen as most at risk. Fintech firms accounted for almost a third of shadow bank loan origination in 2015, partially benefiting from their online origination technology, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research (www.nber.org/papers/w23288). Typically, the origination process takes place nearly entirely online, providing greater convenience for borrowers. Most notably, some fintech firms have blended big data and technology to to meet the modern challenges faced small investors by providing crowd-funding investment capabilities for small enterprises. Investment in fintech has grown from $1.8 billion in 2010 to $19 billion in 2015, and in 2015, its estimated market worth was about $4.7 trillion, according to Goldman Sachs research cited by Deloitte. REGULATORY INITIATIVE: AN EVOLUTION OR A REVOLUTION? Regulators have mulled how to tackle the "fintech revolution" for the last few years. It seems there are two schools of thought: one evolutionary, and the other revolutionary. While the banking industry put pressure on regulators to hold fintech companies to the same standards of banking regulations, Patrick McHenry, vice chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, urged rule-making bodies to follow the UK's example (here) of adopting a regulatory approach that could be considered revolutionary in its emphasis on spurring innovation. The Financial Services Innovation Act proposed by McHenry would create a government-wide fintech oversight regime, within which regulators would adopt a mandate to encourage innovation in the financial industry through the creation of Financial Services Innovation Offices (“FSIOs”). These offices would better coordinate the regulation of companies seeking to bring new and innovative financial technologies to market. Accordingly, fintech companies providing banking services would not be forced into the same mold as traditional banks, which may stifle innovative capacity of small businesses. Instead, the Act would allow "regulatory beta testing," for a period time, during which new types of regulation, new openings for innovation, and the measurement tools --backed up with facts and data, would be test-driven, and customized before being adopted. While the bill awaits consideration in Congress, however, regulators have chosen a more evolutionary path, considering fintech companies on par with, and requiring of them the same regulatory standards as traditional banks. THE OCC AT THE FOREFRONT The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has spearheaded efforts to bring fintech to the financial regulatory fold in a number of steps (here). It has endorsed what it calls "responsible innovation", an approach that aims to meet customer needs consistent with sound risk management and aligned with company's overall business strategy. The agency's examination of fintech issues and discussions with fintech firms have yielded a set of principles (here) for the responsible innovation concept and the establishment last year of an Office of Innovation. More recently, the OCC has announced (here) that fintech companies applying for special purpose national bank charters are to be held to the same high standards of safety and soundness, fair access, and fair treatment of customers that all federally chartered institutions must meet. This in effect means that fintech companies offering bank-like products and services must comply with laws that apply to national banks as well as consumer protection regulations overseen by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission. The OCC expects that the application of a uniform supervision and regulatory framework will promote consistency, and enhance the safety and soundness of the financial system. TURNING CHALLENGE INTO OPPORTUNITY While banks eye fintech companies warily, it is ultimately up to them to turn this challenge into an opportunity where both groups could benefit from a possible synergy. Indeed, there already exists some level of cooperation. In 2015, JPMorgan Chase announced that it would make small business loans through OnDeck Capital, a fintech lending platform. Other financial institutions are seeking to adopt the entrepreneurial ways of the fintech firms within their own organizations, by creating online wealth management applications to compete with the new fintech players. This type of competition could lead to some fintech companies merging with the banking industry, the Deloitte report said. The Deloitte survey noted an evolution in risk management practices that could assist in this transformation. It noted that firms have almost uniformly established a chief risk officer position and shown more active participation by the board and various risk committees in enterprise risk management. However, it noted, adoption was less widespread when it came to risk management involvement in new products and strategic decisions. Even while firms watch for the regulatory path to clarify, integrating risk management in their approach to fintech could help potential synergies take hold.

April 21, 2017 RTGE Staff Subscribe International Recycling News Nonferrous Personnel Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) and the London Metal Exchange (LME), a wholly-owned subsidiary of HKEX, have announced the appointment of Matthew Chamberlain as chief executive of the LME effective immediately, subject to the approval of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the United Kingdom.   Chamberlain will remain on the LME board of directors and will continue as a member of HKEX’s Management Committee. He has been the interim chief executive since January 2017 and was previously the chief operating officer and head of strategy of the LME, and co-head of business development across the LME and LME Clear.   During his time at the LME, Chamberlain has led its warehousing reform process and the new London platinum and palladium pricing administered by the LME, and the LMEprecious initiative.   Before joining the LME in November 2012, Chamberlain advised HKEX on the acquisition of the LME while heading European financial technology coverage at UBS. Previously, he was a founding member of the financial institutions coverage team at Perella Weinberg. He started his career at Citibank and holds a master’s degree from Cambridge University.   In his chief executive role, Chamberlain will work closely with Adrian Farnham, LME Clear chief executive. James Proudlock will take on the role of managing director and head of market development for the LME and LME Clear, reporting to Chamberlain and Farnham. Proudlock joined the LME in early 2017 from JP Morgan Securities PLC.   The LME says it new leadership structure “will allow the LME to continue to strengthen and secure its role as the centre for global metals trading.”   “Matthew’s experience and knowledge of the LME means that he is uniquely suited to lead the business in the next stage of its evolution,” says Charles Li, HKEX chief executive. “We are confident that Matthew, together with Adrian and James, are the right leadership team to bring further success for the group as we continue to grow our business and extend our geographical reach.”   Sir Brian Bender, chairman of the LME, remarks, “Matthew has proven himself to be a huge asset to the LME since he joined in 2012 and is the right appointment. I look forward to continuing to work with him.”   Says Chamberlain, “This is an exciting time to take on the role of chief executive, and I look forward to working closely with our members, clients and the broader metals community.” Aluminum Copper Lead Nickel Tin Zinc Related LME nears final step on warehousing reform LME will begin LMEshield service in China LME chief executive retires Most Shared Tons of plastic scrap could be auctioned in Hong Kong Lefort America expands team ZenRobotics installs robotic sorting system in Sweden Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Big changes in second quarter so far, but not all of them negative on economy. Nick Wells | Mark Fahey 18 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Executives not as moved by the Trump factor    16 Hours Ago | 00:54 Three months into the Trump administration, executives at public companies are wondering if the change in leadership will make much of a difference at all. In first-quarter earnings calls, S&P 500 executives expressed both enthusiasm for the pro-business attitude of the Trump administration and concern about the sweeping changes he might make to public policy. But in the second quarter so far, the mood has grown more muted, according to a CNBC analysis. The number of mentions of the president has decreased, and sentiment toward the new administration has shifted from optimism to doubt that promised changes will happen. "There's still uncertainty," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told analysts and investors on Wednesday." There are significant issues related to tax reform, infrastructure spending, and so we need to see how this all evolves." Less than half the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far in April mentioned the new president in their earnings calls with investors, according to a CNBC analysis. That's down from nearly 80 percent during the same period in January. "The Trump factor has diminished somewhat." -Robert Sands, president and CEO, Constellation Brands Many of the lofty goals Trump campaigned on have crashed to earth as they meet resistance in Congress and in the courts. After the well-publicized failure of the House GOP to coalesce around a repeal and replace plan for the Affordable Care Act, speculation has risen that Trump's tax plan may be in jeopardy as well. Some analysts already think the market is pricing in the death of tax reform, MarketWatch said Wednesday. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin promised Thursday that a tax reform plan was "very well finalized" the day after press secretary Sean Spicer said it would be released "in the next couple weeks." CNBC looked at transcripts of earnings calls for all S&P 500 companies that reported earnings as of Thursday morning, pulling out references to "Trump," "new administration," "executive branch" and "presidential election." Of the 35 companies that have spoken with analysts so far, 17 mention the new government. That's compared with 26 out of 33 companies during the same period in January. Major changes appear less likely  The Trump administration has eased away from some policies that could have had a dramatic effect on some companies. For example, about 40 percent of Constellation Brands' sales come from Hispanic consumers, the company said, and consumer confidence in the group was hit hard by Trump's election. Since assuming office, though, some of the more controversial policies among Hispanics — like building a wall along the nation's southern border — have been revised, sparking renewed confidence. "I would say that the Trump factor has diminished somewhat, and therefore consumer confidence among Hispanics has probably increased a bit with all of the latest rhetoric," said Constellation's president and CEO, Robert Sands. "That's brought a lot of uncertainty around what they are going to be able to do relative to tax reform." show chapters Mnuchin gives tax hint & Trump to take executive actions    20 Hours Ago | 01:59 Most major financial firms have reported for the quarter already, and executives seem unconcerned about the administration's potential to shake up their businesses. During the election, candidate Trump voiced support for a "21st-Century" Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era legislation separating commercial and investment banking. Various suggestions have been made to make the industry safer, but the likelihood of fresh banking legislation is far from clear. "I think there is and should be zero appetite for reinstituting Glass-Steagall itself," said Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman. "I'm pretty sure we can deal with that here at Morgan Stanley, but I don't want to predict whether we get there or not." Other executives said that new Glass-Steagall legislation seems at odds with the administration's broader objectives, or that they didn't know what a modern revival of the law would involve. "Anytime I hear this term '21st-Century Glass-Steagall,' I ask what it is," Citigroup CEO Mike Corbat told analysts during a call last week. "And I have yet to have anybody really tell me what's there." Still optimistic about long-term growth policies  While the GOP's proposed health-care changes have been blocked and tax reform remains to be seen, companies are still paying attention to how any changes may affect their bottom lines. Those two areas came up more in earnings call than any other Trump-related topic, according to a similar analysis performed by FactSet last week. Americans' confidence in the economy leaped after the election in November, but has faltered somewhat in the months since. But executives still appeared widely optimistic about the administration's apparent interest in pro-growth policies. Responding to a Jefferies analyst's question about a lag in loan growth and future confidence, JPMorgan Chase executives said the second half of the year could be a lot better. "I wouldn't overreact to the short-term thing about loan growth, because there's so many things that affect it," CEO Jamie Dimon said, "When you have a new president and they get going, the nine months after the 100 days is going to be a sausage-making period ... to expect it to be smooth sailing, that would just be silly." "We've seen very clearly that the president and the administration is very pro-growth, pro-jobs." -Mike Corbat, CEO, Citigroup Corbat said that he and others in the financial industry have been engaged with the administration and regulators, and that conversations have been "constructive." "Just the tone from the top is an important message and signal," said Corbat. "And I think we've seen very clearly that the president and the administration is very pro-growth, pro-jobs." Darren King, CFO of M&T Bank, said it's still unclear at this point what direction the administration will go in key policy areas and whether Trump will be able to follow through on specific promises. Uncertainty in fiscal and tax policies is weighing on customers' minds, he said. "It's all the things that tend to be in the news, and the issue isn't that optimism has waned," he said. "Maybe a little bit, but it's more wait-and-see is the feel that we get from our customers."

Chamberlain, 35, had been acting CEO since January, when a combination of falling trading volumes and a perceived lack of strategy at the 140-year-old exchange led to the resignation of Garry Jones. The architect of sweeping reforms to the LME's warehousing system, Chamberlain must decide whether to change the LME's complex trading structure to open it up to more fund investors in a move that would alienate many traditional members. The LME dominates the trading of metals such as aluminium, copper and zinc, but incursions into its territory from rivals such as the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) and CME Group have seen its share of overall copper trading fall to nearly 60 percent from 80 percent in 2008. Sources say the exchange will offer a move toward monthly futures contracts in a discussion paper to be published by early next month, cutting costs for speculative investors but eroding fees for traditional brokers. "Matthew's experience and knowledge of the LME means that he is uniquely suited to lead the business in the next stage of its evolution," Charles Li, the head of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEx), which bought the LME in 2012, said in a statement. Chamberlain was previously the LME's chief operating officer and head of business development. Before joining the exchange he worked at UBS, where he advised HKEx on buying the LME. He won over those who questioned his lack of experience by devising a fix to the LME's warehousing queues that had for years plagued the exchange and provoked a series of lawsuits. TICKS THE BOXES "It was an excellent choice," said Michael Overlander, chief executive of broker Sucden Financial, one of the top tier LME members allowed to trade in the exchange's open outcry ring. "He knows the exchange very well, he knows the players very well and he ticks all the boxes." Malcolm Freeman, head of metals trader Kingdom Futures Limited, said: "He's picked up on the industry very quickly and has built bridges with not only the members, but clients." A hike in trading fees two years ago drove many LME users to the over-the-counter markets, precipitating a 7.7 percent fall in trading volumes last year and 4.3 percent the year before and forcing the exchange to consider its future. Dwindling volumes have undermined profits at HKEx, which is trying to recoup the $2.2 billion it paid for the LME in 2012. "Matt will have to work on relationships with members and the physical market; without them there would be no LME," said the head of a metals brokerage in London. HKEx also said it had appointed James Proudlock managing director and head of market development at the LME and its clearing house, LME Clear. Proudlock had been deputy chief executive of LME Clear since December, joining the LME from JPMorgan. Chamberlain's appointment was effective immediately, but is subject to approval by the Financial Conduct Authority.

According to Zacks, “TransUnion is poised for impressive growth in several of its end markets, especially the burgeoning Big Data and analytics market, with an attractive business model, significant operating leverage, low capital requirements and strong and stable cash flows. Increased risk of identity theft due to data breaches and higher consumer awareness about the usage of credit information are propelling the demand for its consumer solutions. TransUnion outperformed the industry in the last three months. As emerging market economies continue to develop and mature, the company is well-positioned to gain from the associated favorable socio-economic trends. However, TransUnion remains vulnerable to the overall macroeconomic conditions, seasonality issues, and adverse foreign currency translation effects, which limit its profitability to some extent.

He previously worked at Reuters and Forbes. Follow @LionelRALaurent Facebook Twitter Email Print Share April 21, 2017 4:30 AM EDT Europe's banks are exposed to a lot of political cross-fire this earnings season. This weekend starts a wave of elections across France, Britain and Germany that might reshape the European economy. U.S. President Donald Trump has financial regulation in his sights. These are unpredictable times. CEOs won't have all the answers for investors. Too much is out of their hands. But one thing they can do is follow Wall Street's lead by sharpening up their moneymaking skills -- or improve "operating leverage," as the jargon has it. Banking on It Source: Bloomberg In theory, it's a simple concept. The more you fix your costs, the more any extra revenue growth from an improving economy will go straight to the profit line. That's operating leverage. Bank of America Corp.'s Brian Moynihan mentioned it several times this week as he reported higher revenue, while BoA's expenses stayed flat and headcount and investment risk fell. Investors like that kind of thing. In practice, operating leverage is hard to juice. Europe's banks have been squeezed on the profit side by higher regulatory costs and complex bonus structures and on the revenue side by negative interest rates. They've been slow to restructure. Top lenders' net revenue has fallen 5 percent since 2012, faster than costs, according to Bloomberg Intelligence's Jonathan Tyce. Pre-provision operating profit -- stripping out the benign effect of lower loan losses -- has fallen about 15 percent. Double Dip Both revenue and operating profit before taking into account loan defaults have fallen in recent years for European banks Source: Bloomberg Intelligence index of top Europe banks Bank bosses are trying to fix this as markets get more confident about rising interest rates in the U.S. and better economic prospects in the euro area. Some want to shrink more. Tidjane Thiam of Credit Suisse Group AG is trying to cut another 1 billion Swiss francs ($1 billion) in expenses while lifting revenue. Others want to reduce the drag from bonuses. Jes Staley of Barclays Plc said this year that his bank took an upfront charge of 395 million pounds on deferred-bonus accounting to improve operating leverage. Another option has been locking in cheap funding at fixed rates, meaning any interest rate rises translate straight into profit. That's where central bankers have helped, not hindered. Euro-area lenders gorged on free four-year loans from the European Central Bank last month, taking 233.5 billion euros' worth. Italian banks UniCredit SpA and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA borrowed about 36 billion euros. If rates go up, that directly fattens the margins banks make from lending on those funds. Obviously, much depends on rates rising in Europe. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts don't expect an ECB hike until late 2018 but note that short-term market lending rates, as priced by 12-month Euribor, are seen turning positive at the end of 2017. Optimism about rates explains why European bank stocks have risen 16 percent in six months. There could be disappointment but -- for now at least -- banks are under pressure to grab more revenue rather than just pare back. Wall Street has lessons here for Europe. U.S. financial markets are in fine fettle, with trading revenues rebounding and interest rates rising. But not all banks benefited equally. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. underperformed while Morgan Stanley's more radical restructuring paid off. Simply waiting for rates to rise is no panacea. Bank of America has shown the way with a clear strategy: cut headcount, merge real-estate assets and put more staff in front of clients. Europe's politics may be scary. But a firm grip on operational leverage would offer comfort. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

The bank is searching for experienced traders and salespeople, as well as quantitative and product management specialists, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. Barclays currently employs about 450 people in equities in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to a person with knowledge of the industry, and the business is run by Rich Evans.

The future of the securities unit was uncertain under Staley’s predecessor, Antony Jenkins, who publicly expressed concerns about its ability to generate sufficient returns.

Riding on a wave of optimism over the economic and earnings outlook, an index of the region’s banks rallied to a 15-month high in March -- before posting the second-biggest decline among industry groups this month. At the same time, bets for swings in lenders’ stocks have jumped, and options reached their highest prices since February 2016 relative to those for euro-area blue chips. There’s little doubt the environment for European banks has brightened, with profits forecast to grow at the fastest pace in three years in 2017 as quicker inflation fuels expectations for monetary tightening. Yet higher valuations are now unnerving investors, especially ahead of an uncertain French election in which far-right candidate Marine Le Pen is campaigning on leaving the euro. “The stocks were too cheap, but the money’s been made from the stocks revaluing to more normal levels,” said James Sym, a London-based fund manager at Schroders Plc, which has trimmed its allocation to the sector while keeping an overweight position. “Everyone has come around to the idea of reflation. I just feel some of these banks have run ahead of themselves.” The Stoxx 600 Banks Index climbed as much as 19 percent since the election of Donald Trump boosted optimism for greater economic expansion and sent bond yields surging. That pushed the valuation of European lenders to the highest since October 2015 relative to the broader Stoxx Europe 600 Index, up from a record discount. The Stoxx 600 Banks Index rose 0.5 percent at 8:39 a.m. in London, while the broader gauge was little changed. Expectations are high as firms including Banco Santander SA and Deutsche Bank AG start reporting first-quarter results next week, and they’ll need to be justified by revenue guidance and improvement in interest income, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report led by analyst Jonathan Tyce. Lenders in the Stoxx 600 are projected to post 16 percent growth in profits this year, more than the broader market and more than S&P 500 Index banks, estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. A Le Pen presidential win would weigh on the sector as fears of France leaving the euro would escalate, causing the single currency to collapse and forcing lenders to re-denominate their assets. Citigroup Inc. analysts said on Wednesday that even though they remain overweight on European banks, certain risks should be hedged as their share prices could slump with an adverse political outcome that would drive down revenue for French operations and increase the cost of equity. On the policy front, European Central Bank officials have been sending mixed signals as inflation and economic growth quicken. The current plan is to run quantitative easing until the end of the year and hold negative rates well beyond that. After jumping to a one-year high in March, helping lenders’ shares, the 10-year German bond yield slumped this month. Too Optimistic “The rate at which the environment improves in terms of the yield curve in Europe may have been too optimistic,” said Neil Smith, an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe KG in Dusseldorf, Germany. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Strong fixed-income trading revenue in the first quarter at U.S. lenders from Bank of America Corp. to JPMorgan Chase & Co. probably means European investment firms such as Deutsche Bank and Barclays Plc may do better, Smith added. Despite the recent share weakness, fund flows into the industry have held up in recent weeks, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch reports citing EPFR Global data. Schroders’s strategy is to buy high-quality banking shares in more consolidated markets where margins can expand, Sym said. This means favoring firms from Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands, rather than the U.K., Spain and Italy. “What tends to happen when you get these big turning points is you have a rising tide that lifts all boats, and then you start to get more discrimination as the companies report profitability,” he said. “By buying the lower-quality banks today, you’re picking up the pennies in front of the steam roller.”  Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.
