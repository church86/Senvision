The nation’s biggest bank is beating the pack when it comes to growth in book value per share. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jun 9, 2017 at 10:11AM Even though JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is the nation's biggest bank by assets, which should weigh on its growth rate relative to smaller banks, its book value per share has nevertheless increased at a faster pace than many of its peers. This is important for investors because a bank's book value per share heavily influences its stock price. JPMorgan Chase's book value per share has risen by 64% since January 2010. The average among its peers is only 47%. JPM Book Value (Per Share) data by YCharts. There are a lot of complicated metrics and concepts involved in analyzing banks, but book value per share isn't one of them. You calculate this by taking JPMorgan Chase's total shareholders' equity, which is on its balance sheet, and then dividing that by the New York-based bank's outstanding share count. In JPMorgan Chase's case, that comes out to $64.68, according to YCharts.com. How fast should this be growing? There's no set rule, as it depends on where the economy is in the business and interest rate cycles. If things are going great and interest rates are high, enabling a bank to earn a richer yield from its loan portfolio, then its book value per share will grow fast. During a recession, however, the pace will slow and a bank may even see its book value per share contract. Right now, given the low interest rate environment, it's reasonable to expect a bank's book value per share to increase by 5% a year, with many banks exceeding this. JPMorgan Chase is obviously one of them given that its has increased by 64% in less than eight years. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. Another point to keep in mind is that the pace at which a particular bank's book value per share grows is in part a function of how much net income it distributes via dividends and buybacks. More specifically, there tends to be a negative relationship between a bank's total payout ratio (dividends plus share buybacks divided by net income) and the growth rate of its book value per share -- the higher the payout ratio, the lower the growth rate, and vice versa. This relationship isn't as noticeable in JPMorgan Chase's case because it isn't an outlier on either count. It's ranked 6th out of 23 banks on the KBW Bank Index in terms of book value per share growth since the beginning of 2010, and 10th in terms of its total payout ratio over the trailing twelve months. In short, this is an important metric for investors to follow, which is good news for shareholders of JPMorgan Chase so long as it stays on its current course.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe By Allison Arieff Phoenix — It’s Friday and food trucks line the downtown streets serving crowds of weekend-ready customers. Chef Michael Brown is serving his locally renowned “Jamburritos” – jambalaya wrapped up like a burrito – from his festively decorated food truck. The cultural fusion of Brown’s creation is hardly a coincidence. It resides against the backdrop of Maricopa County, one of the nation’s most culturally diverse, and certainly its fastest growing, populations, adding 222 people per day in 2016. JPMorgan Chase Chef Michael Brown is serving his locally renowned “Jamburritos” – jambalaya wrapped up like a burrito – from his festively decorated food truck. Home to four million people and America’s sixth most populous city, Phoenix, 30 percent of Maricopa County’s population is Hispanic or Latino and 20 percent are immigrants. Yet, despite the size and population, the area grapples with a poverty rate above national average. The challenges here are as diverse as the communities, and not unlike those of other culturally rich cities such as San Diego and Miami. That’s why the decision by a number of local development groups to band together and revitalize neighborhoods made so much sense. That partnership, called Adelante Phoenix!, launched in 2014 after Raza Development Fund (RDF), a development arm of La Raza and the partnership’s leader, approached JPMorgan Chase for help. They were awarded a $6 million grant through a pilot community development program, which is now part of the company’s Partnerships for Raising Opportunities (PRO) Neighborhoods, a five-year, $125 million philanthropic initiative. PRO Neighborhoods was announced in April, 2016, after the investment firm tested different local revitalization models to help restore struggling economies where they operate, a core part of their approach to corporate responsibility. The goal in cities like Phoenix – where JPMorgan Chase employs 5,800 people – is to leverage capital and data to build local capacity and create inclusive economic growth. The company is applying this model to communities around the world, including London and San Diego, while testing and iterating based on results. The approach is exemplified by the Adelante Phoenix! partnership, which tailored its community programs in south Phoenix, Tempe and Mesa, to meet the local cultural and economic needs. They are addressing real community needs that effect economic mobility, especially within immigrant populations, including low-income housing, education, health care, cultural community development and even financial services. And they are already seeing results. According to RDF, investments range from 222 new units of transit-oriented affordable housing along the Tempe-Mesa light rail, including low-income housing for Benedictine University student, to personal and small business loans, including DACA and DREAMER student loans, and even expanded charter school opportunities. Future plans now include a new cultural epicenter along the extension of the Phoenix light rail into the culturally diverse, yet often overlooked south Phoenix community. The collaborative group is led by RDF, a national organization that provides real estate development funds, and includes local development and credit union partners, such as MariSol Federal Credit Union, to build trust within the community. Since 2014 they have leveraged the initial investment, bringing Adelante Phoenix! projects a total of $139 million in additional funding — an extraordinary leverage ratio of 24.7, according the Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies. Helping local partners seed additional investment is part of the JPMorgan Chase PRO Neighborhoods strategy. Welcome to Maricopa County JPMorgan Chase "Jamburrito" Chef Michael Brown of looks out of the window in his food truck awaiting Phoenix Food Truck Friday customers. Learn more about Jamburrito. “We have half a dozen community partners that stretch from Promise AZ, a public advocate for immigrants, to Arizona State University,” says RDF COO Mark Van Brunt. “This doesn't work with outsiders coming in. We have trusted partners and some amazing results in terms of helping families at risk move forward.” A New “alma” for South Phoenix South Phoenix, where over 20 percent of the population is foreign born, sits just across the river from downtown Phoenix. Backed by a $2.5 million commitment from JPMorgan Chase and an additional $1.2 million from RDF, this historically underrepresented community is rallying around the dream project of RDF’s CEO, Tommy Espinoza: Plaza De Las Culturas. The “Plaza,” which is still in the early planning stages, is part of a broader effort to revitalize south Phoenix and its vision is bold: it aims to be the “new Alma” (soul) of Phoenix, a place imbued with a respect for family, spirituality and human dignity. Community outreach has been a major focus of the early stages of the development and the resulting plan reflects that. Planned for the 85-acre center is an educational and cultural complex enveloped by small business, mixed-use housing and high performing schools, including a branch campus of Arizona State University, Robotic Technical College and a charter high school. The development plans give hope to the local community and dovetail with the City of Phoenix’s own plans. The new center will live along the early southward extension of the Phoenix light rail, which will now open in 2023, serving as an attraction for people and businesses coming into the community. “There is a strong feeling of community in south Phoenix with generations of families living and working there,” said Curtis Reed, Middle Market Region Manager, Chase. “Through our investment, we want to help inject economic growth into this area that will create opportunities and benefit the residents.” While they continue planning the “Plaza” and raising investment funds, RDF and its partners are actively supporting smaller local initiatives in south Phoenix and other neighborhoods. For example, $50,000 from JPMorgan Chase’s investment helped expand one of the top charter high schools in south Phoenix, Espiritu Schools’ Aim Higher College Prep Academy. The investment was used to purchase a vacant YMCA building as the new site of the school, which is now fully utilized and serves over 400 moderate- and low-income south Phoenix students. The group is also increasing access to credit for community residents and small businesses. Making Even A Micro Of Difference The MariSol Federal Credit Union, located in the heart of downtown Phoenix, has been providing micro loans to small businesses and introducing new personal loan programs through Adelante Phoenix! investments. Their small business loans may be minimal in dollar amount, but not in impact. Since the program started, they have paid out over $280,000 in microbusiness loans, averaging about $10,000 per loan. Were it not for their first loan, many of the recipients would not have been able to grow their business and create new jobs. One such loan financed a new wrap for Chef Brown’s food truck. Another MariSol loan allowed a woman to purchase a van so she could expand her cleaning business; still another supported Jason Wasser of XO Confections, who creates distinctive chocolates using unusual ingredients like balsamic vinegar, bourbon and pistachios. These programs build on JPMorgan Chase’s Small Business Forwardstrategy of increasing minority-owned business’ access to capital, helping to lay the foundation for more widespread prosperity. All totaled, Adelante Phoenix! has issued $816,000 in small business loans and $8.2 million in personal loans, including first time homebuyer, signature immigration and used vehicle loans, as well as payday alternatives and student financing. “We make loans to people of modest means,” says Marisol CEO Robin Romano. “We try not to define anyone by their credit score.” RDF partnered with MariSol, and other local financial partners, because Tom Espinoza and his team knew providing small business loans and financial assistance for families would be crucial in revitalizing Maricopa County’s poorer communities. “It’s been wonderful working with Robin,” says Mark van Brunt, COO of RDF. “We meet quarterly to see what we can do to meet the needs of the community, from getting mortgages within a state where that had been largely impossible, as you need two forms of citizenship verification, to scholarships and loans to Dreamer students through the credit union. We’ve been able to go across the spectrum of economic development activity and have really reached the populations we want to serve.” Communities are complex organisms and it’s hard to put a finger on what precisely determines their success. Capital matters, of course, but capital alone does not a community make. Investments like these bring hope to communities, explains Espinoza, “Had we not had the capital and insight from JPMorgan Chase, some of these deals might not have occurred. It activated more investment and it really inspired people in poor communities to believe there was hope.” Espinoza might be a few years from opening the “Plaza,” but in the meantime, Chef Michael Brown will be downtown every Friday serving his bites of Cajun-Tex-Mex fusion.

Cohan Jun 09, 2017 Lloyd Blankfein has always been a big worrier. At Harvard, the future CEO of Goldman Sachs (gs) worried that he wouldn’t be able to match wits with the prep-school students who seemed light-years more savvy than a little kid from an outer borough of New York City. “I was as provincial as you could be,” he once told me, “albeit from Brooklyn, the province of Brooklyn.” He worried at Harvard Law School. He worried at Donovan Leisure, the law firm where he worked as a tax lawyer. And he worried at J. Aron & Company, the commodities dealer Goldman Sachs had bought in 1981, the year before he joined it to trade gold—a task for which he had very few qualifications. Blankfein, 62, has been the chairman and chief executive of Goldman since June 2006, when Hank Paulson left to become Treasury secretary, and he’s still worrying. He is hopeful that tax and regulatory reform—if it can be achieved amid the immense turmoil in Washington—will help propel Goldman back to its customary place as Wall Street’s most ruthlessly efficient profitmaker. But as usual he doesn’t know for sure what will happen, and so he worries. “Gee, I hope I don’t look back five years from now and say, ‘The last 10 years were the Golden Age,’ ” he says. “That would be bad. But who knows? When they had the 40-day flood, on the third day, they said, ‘Boy, that’s a lot of rain! It can’t last much longer.’ So who knows?” It has certainly been a tumultuous decade or so, both for Goldman and for Blankfein himself. There was the financial crisis of 2008, of course, and the regulatory reckoning that came after—including the Dodd-Frank reform bill and the Volcker Rule, which greatly inhibited the highly profitable proprietary trading that Goldman had always seemed to do better than anyone else. The investment bank was memorably derided by Rolling Stone as a “great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity.” And Blankfein himself was relentlessly pilloried for a quip that Goldman and its peers were doing “God’s work.” More recently, Blankfein has faced a serious health scare: He was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2015 and spent months undergoing successful treatment. His doctors say the disease is in remission. Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein, photographed in Davos, Switzerland, in January, is healthy after undergoing treatment for lymphoma. Photograph by Simon Dawson—Bloomberg/Getty Images  The professional and personal crises may have receded. But Blankfein now has a whole new set of reasons for anxiety. To begin with, his longtime No. 2, Gary Cohn, recently left the firm to go to Washington as President Trump’s national economic adviser, necessitating the most significant management reorganization at Goldman in a decade. Goldman’s bigger and better capitalized banking competitors, such as JPMorgan Chase (jpm), Bank of America (bac), and Wells Fargo (wfc), are churning out record or near-record profits, while Goldman Sachs is still trying to find its footing in a regulatory environment that has favored less risk taking than Blankfein’s company is designed to accommodate. More than a few people on Wall Street, however, expect that Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, another Goldman alum, will find a way to ease back on the regulations. Activists rallied against loosening Wall Street regulations outside Goldman’s headquarters in New York in February. Drew Angerer—Getty Images  Meanwhile, Goldman’s longtime rival, Morgan Stanley (ms), is winning the plaudits of industry analysts who view its acquisition of Smith Barney as a savvy move into the less volatile fee-based money-management business. This even as Goldman is still betting that investment banking and trading will once again return to prominence on Wall Street. “Unlike Goldman, whose strategy has been a little bit, ‘Let’s just wait it out and the world will come to where we want it to be over time,’ Morgan Stanley’s strategy has been, ‘Let’s take the bull by the horns,’ ” explains Guy Moszkowski, who has been a Wall Street research analyst for decades and now is the managing partner and director of research at Autonomous Research. Then there’s the rising threat from the so-called fintech industry, the growing number of Silicon Valley–based financial businesses that are using the Internet to disintermediate the work that Wall Street has done spectacularly well for centuries: putting people who have money and want to lend it or invest it in direct contact with the people who need to borrow it or want to use it to start or grow businesses. The threat remains a marginal one for now, as the startups are primarily picking off low-hanging fruit in credit card and student-loan markets. But the days of fintech companies underwriting stocks and bonds and making corporate loans—the bread and butter of Wall Street—may not be too far away. These concerns were magnified in April by current events, when Goldman announced disappointing results for its first quarter of 2017. In bond trading—an area where it expects to rule—it reported shockingly anemic revenue growth (1%) compared with strong double-digit gains by its major banking rivals. That got Wall Street worrying too: How had mighty Goldman managed to fumble so badly, investors and analysts wondered, when all of the other banks were raking in profits thanks to the long-running Trump rally? What happened? After reaching an all-time high of nearly $253 a share in March, Goldman’s stock fell to around $212 at the beginning of June. It’s beyond premature to begin writing off Goldman Sachs. With $37.7 billion in revenues for 2016, Blankfein’s company ranks No. 78 on this year’s Fortune 500. The bank earned $7.4 billion in profits on those sales, a 22% gain over the year before. Goldman remains a formidable force in global markets. And with Cohn and Mnuchin in positions of considerable power in the Trump administration—as well as Dina Powell, another Goldmanite who is serving as Trump’s deputy national security adviser for strategy—it appears to many on the outside that “Government Sachs” still effectively rules the world. But it is certainly fair to wonder if Goldman is well positioned for the realities of today’s Wall Street—flanked as it is on one side by much larger traditional banks and on the other by nimbler startups. Does the bank known for always being first to see the next big trade still have what it takes? At least one savvy investor, who owns some $2.5 billion worth of Goldman stock, urges calm amid the roiling seas. “I’m not much for prognostications,” emails Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett from Omaha, “but one thing I’m close to 100% sure about—whatever the twists and turns there may be in regulation, technology, and markets, Goldman will successfully adapt. I’ve watched them do it for decades.” The news reverberated around Wall Street. When, in September 2015, Blankfein announced he had a “highly curable” form of lymphoma, there was understandable concern—not just for the CEO himself but also for the future of the bank. Would Goldman soon have a new leader? Would Cohn be his successor, as everyone assumed? Or would the Goldman board of directors reach deeper down to find a younger leader, as it did when the board selected Blankfein to succeed CEO Paulson instead of Paulson’s seemingly designated successors John Thain and John Thornton? For much of 2016, it was Wall Street’s favorite parlor game . In a recent interview in his 41st-floor office, overlooking New York Harbor, Blankfein tells me that for a “long time” during 2015 he wasn’t feeling well and that “in hindsight” he had symptoms he could “explain away.” Then he jokes, “And anything I can explain away, I do.” For instance, he was losing weight. “But I’m always trying to lose weight,” he says. “I just thought I was unusually successful.” In fact, he says, he thought he had hit upon a new diet. He began proselytizing. “I started giving people advice on how to lose weight, because I was so successful at it.” Then he developed a cough. “It was in the summer,” he says. “I thought I had allergies.” Then came the aches and pains. “I was exercising,” he says, and he thought he was just sore. “I just had these things, and then they started accumulating.” He remembers how he’d been walking with some people and told them to slow down. “And they said, ‘No, Lloyd, you’re walking slow, and you’ve been walking slow for a long time,’ ” he says. “Literally, that’s what happened.” He went to the doctor, who told him that in two more weeks he wouldn’t have been able to walk anymore. He had 75 tumors, and they were growing. He scheduled a biopsy for Sept. 16. Usually such surgeries are done first thing in the morning. But Blankfein had already committed to speak at a Wall Street Journal event at the Pierre Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. In his interview that day with Gerard Baker, the editor of the Journal, Blankfein looked wan and a bit peaked but was otherwise lucid. He was asked, among other things, about the growing popularity of Donald Trump. Blankfein, a Democrat and a longtime supporter of Hillary Clinton, said that some of Trump’s statements were “wacky” and the thought of Trump “with his finger on the button blows my mind.” Before nearly anyone else, Blankfein drew a parallel between Trump and Andrew Jackson, a comparison that Trump now makes himself. (Trump has put Jackson’s portrait in the Oval Office.) Blankfein was in the hospital when his doctor got the biopsy results. “You’re going right up to chemo,” he told Blankfein. While the PICC line was in, Blankfein informed the Goldman board of directors of his diagnosis. And then he arranged for a call with his management team. While those calls were being made, the doctors were performing a painful bone-marrow biopsy. “But I was so involved [with the calls],” he says, “I didn’t even notice it.” Goldman released a statement about Blankfein’s illness. It said he would undergo months of chemotherapy but still be able to lead the firm, albeit on a reduced schedule. During chemotherapy, he didn’t feel that sick. “I had one bad week,” he remembers. If somebody said to me that it's time to leave, I would understand that. Nobody's fired me yet. —Blankfein He was more concerned about getting an infection that might kill him. In the days after the chemo, his white blood cell count fell to nearly zero. He walked around the office carrying a thermometer, because taking his temperature repeatedly was the best way to figure out quickly if he’d become infected. “If your temperature goes over 100.4, you’ve got to go to the hospital,” he says. Already mostly bald, Blankfein lost his eyebrows. “I can show you pictures,” he says. “It looks weird. I looked like Lex Luthor at the end of winter.” People told him after he was diagnosed that he hadn’t looked so great for a while. “Well, why didn’t you tell me?” he asked them. Related Fortune 500Silicon Valley Isn’t The Only Out-Of-Touch Tech Bubble Fortune 500 Silicon Valley Isn’t The Only Out-Of-Touch Tech Bubble The chemotherapy worked. Blankfein says his cancer is now in remission. “I think I’m okay,” he jokes. “The problem is, by the time I’m sure I’m okay, I’ll be so much older that I’ll have that as a problem. So it’s like, there’s not going to be any peace in this, for me.” His eyebrows have grown back. And so has a little bit of his paunch. (As we spoke, he finished off a bottle of Stewart’s sweet orange soda, not the easiest thing to find in Manhattan.) His sense of humor is as wry and acute as ever. “You should really be sympathetic, by the way,” he tells me after we get done talking about his illness. It is clear now that Blankfein is not going anywhere soon, just as Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, seems more entrenched than ever following his successful bout with throat cancer two years ago. Indeed, Blankfein is now the longest-serving CEO on Wall Street. (And the second-longest-serving leader in Goldman’s illustrious history, behind only the legendary Sidney Weinberg, who died in office in 1969 after 35 years at the top.) Healthy and focused, Blankfein seems determined to steer Goldman through what is shaping up to be an important inflection point in the industry: The economy is growing stronger, unemployment is low, and interest rates remain low. Assuming that Washington pulls back on regulation, Wall Street should be poised for boom times. Blankfein’s vision for the future of Goldman, not surprisingly, does not stray far from what has made the firm the envy of nearly every financial institution on the planet. He still wants Goldman to be the financial intermediary of choice, especially when the problems are complex. And he expects that it will still be Wall Street’s leading investment bank. “We’re an adviser,” he explains. “I don’t think advice has gone out of style. We’re a strategic adviser. We manage risky assets for our clients in private equity and in our asset-management business. And we’re a financier, and usually a financier of choice. The more complex and difficult a financing situation becomes, the more likely we’ll get the call to work on it.” He believes that not only will there continue to be demand for these complicated financing solutions domestically, but that there’s also a growing need for Goldman’s services in developing economies such as those of China and India. “And we’ve always had a very good foot in the door in those places, so I feel good about that.” Nicolas Rapp  Despite increasing pressure on fees as investors move away from actively managed accounts to passive investing, Blankfein also seems pleased with the progress being made at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, where assets under “supervision,” as Goldman calls it, have increased to $1.375 trillion, from $1.275 trillion a year ago. Goldman’s problem in recent years, Blankfein says, is that its businesses “still correlate with growth,” and the world—China aside—has been in an extended slowdown at the same time that Wall Street has endured the “relatively heavy-handed” way that new regulations have been implemented. There has been a lot less risk taking in recent years, says Blankfein, because people are afraid of losing money. Or they’re worried they’ll be accused of violating the Volcker Rule or otherwise using capital in a prohibited way. “Somebody will say, ‘This was a risk that you shouldn’t have been taking,’ ” he says. “There are layers and layers of stuff that made people very, very cautious and very, very risk averse.” He says Goldman’s challenge is how to make money with the tools in its control. “Where is growth?” he wonders. “What are you going to do to get higher growth?” Ironically, at the moment, one answer for Goldman seems to be in lending money to consumers and small businesses—an activity that harks back to the days when Marcus Goldman bought receivables at a discount from the vendors around Wall Street in the 1860s. “We’re a bank, we should act like one,” Goldman told the Wall Street Journal in February. Nicolas Rapp  So after shunning the public for most of the past 148 years, Goldman is embracing the loan business—in its own way. “We have the opportunity to build a higher-margin lending business because we’re not competing in the league tables where people already have $2 trillion worth of loans on their books,” he says. “If we got an incremental $100 billion of the best kind of lending business out there, it would be accretive to what we’re doing. We don’t need to do it, because nobody thinks that’s our core business.” Related Fortune 500ABC Scores Huge NBA Finals Ratings with Possible Sweep Looming Fortune 500 ABC Scores Huge NBA Finals Ratings with Possible Sweep Looming To make it happen, Goldman is even getting a little fintech-y. In 2016 the firm created Marcus, a part of its new online retail banking service, which makes no-fee loans of up to $30,000 to individuals seeking to refinance their high-priced credit card debt with a small, lower-cost loan from Goldman. So far Marcus—named after the firm’s founder—has made loans totaling about $1 billion in its first six months. Blankfein says that because Goldman doesn’t have a legacy consumer business or bank branches, its technological expertise allows it to tailor its products to individual needs. Since the loans aren’t being securitized and sold off to investors, he said, “We can make it almost bespoke.” That means borrowers can pick the term of the loan, the monthly payment amount, and when they start making payments. Furthermore, Goldman’s diminutive Salt Lake City–based commercial bank, known as Goldman Sachs Bank USA, is now suddenly eager to get your money, also through the Internet. To do so, the bank is offering depositors an interest rate of 1.05%, some four times or more what rivals JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are offering. Goldman’s commercial bank now has deposits of around $125 billion—a mere fraction of Chase’s $1.4 trillion, but up considerably from Goldman’s $28 billion in 2008. If Goldman’s “toe dip” into the waters of consumer lending works out well, Blankfein expects the firm will do more of it. “Reaching a consumer digitally” through technological expertise plays to Goldman’s strengths, he says. “If I assume that consumer experience is a weakness of ours, I’d say a strength of ours has been technology—digital platforms, algorithmic trading, and risk management,” he says. Whereas once upon a time Goldman was the largest full-service investment bank on Wall Street, in the wake of the financial crisis—which immolated Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers—it has now become the smallest. It has assets on its balance sheet (as opposed to under management) of around $950 billion. Bank of America, which owns Merrill Lynch; JPMorgan Chase, which bought the lifeless Bear Stearns and ultimately folded it; and Wells Fargo, which bought Wachovia, each have nearly three times as much in assets as Goldman does. Its principal rival, Morgan Stanley, has around 100,000 employees, thanks to its acquisition of Smith Barney from Citigroup and its aggressive push into the brokerage business. Goldman has no brokerage business to speak of and has only around 35,000 employees. Blankfein does not see Goldman making a further move into traditional commercial- and consumer-banking businesses. “We don’t have a kind of regular vanilla banking business like a lot of firms do,” he says. “We don’t do that. And it would change the firm if we did, because then we’d be 225,000 people. We’d have branches. We would have cash management. It would be a different firm. Now, maybe it’d be a better firm, but that’s not the firm that we historically have been or have aspired to. In a crisis, is it better to be bigger and have those activities and those diversified strains? Yes. But it’s a different firm to manage. It’s a different culture, too.” Blankfein is human, so on some level he is, of course, covetous of JPMorgan Chase’s ability to produce $25 billion in annual net income year after year. But he is more focused on the return on equity that can be achieved from Goldman’s mix of businesses, and less on the absolute dollar amount of Goldman’s profitability. In a low-growth environment, such as we’ve seen the past few years, Blankfein says that having a huge loan portfolio such as Chase’s can be stabilizing: “But there have been huge swaths of time—in fact, the predominant amount of time—where our returns were always much higher. And had we had that business, it would’ve pulled down our returns. So it depends on what part of the cycle you’re in.” At the moment, he laments, Goldman’s return on equity is 10%—below where he’d like it to be, certainly, and more in keeping with what the bigger commercial banks should be delivering to investors. One way to goose Goldman’s ROE, Blankfein points out, would be to reduce the capital that big banks are required to have. And—spoiler alert!—he thinks capital requirements are too high. “If we ran the same business with 25% less capital, we’d have a third higher ROE,” he says. The departure in April of Daniel Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor who was Wall Street’s de facto regulator-in-chief for the past six years, gives Blankfein some hope that those rules might be changing. Tarullo was the leading advocate of stricter capital rules on banks in the wake of the financial crisis. The consensus on the Street is that whoever President Trump appoints to succeed Tarullo will be much more understanding of the banks’ point of view. That’s the bet that Steve Eisman is making. The veteran investor, a character in Michael Lewis’s The Big Short who was memorably portrayed by Steve Carell in the movie version, is bullish on financials, including Goldman. Under Trump, he believes that the regulators will grade the banks’ safety net “on a different curve,” and the Volcker Rule will be relaxed. Banks will be able to buy back more stock and ease back into risk. “They’ll have more leverage so the ROE will go up a lot,” he says. “Goldman will benefit enormously from that.” A lot of Blankfein’s focus today is on establishing his new leadership team. Cohn’s departure necessitated a major restructuring. David Solomon and Harvey Schwartz, the new copresidents and co–chief operating officers, were selected to replace Cohn. Gregg Lemkau and Marc Nachmann have been named the new coheads of investment banking, moving up to replace Solomon. And R. Martin Chavez, an openly gay Latino man with Japanese tattoos on his arm, replaced Schwartz as chief financial officer. Chavez’s appointment is as much a sign as any that Goldman is evolving with the times. Gary Cohn (pointing) left his job as No. 2 at Goldman to serve as President Trump’s top economic adviser, alongside Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin (in glasses), another Goldman alum. Jabin Botsford—The Washington Post/Getty Images  Blankfein says he doesn’t think Trump chose Cohn, Mnuchin, and Powell just because they once worked at Goldman Sachs, although he takes it as a compliment. “I find it validating,” he says. “It makes me feel good that he sees in those people the same thing I see in those people.” In a claim that will draw eye-rolling from some of his fellow Democrats, Blankfein says there’s actually a downside for Goldman to having its alumni in Washington. “It was a lot easier for me to call Jack Lew [the former Treasury secretary] than it is to call Steve Mnuchin,” he says. “It’s in my head to be careful about it and to limit it.” It was one thing during the financial crisis to be able to pick up the phone and talk to Paulson, which he did often, but now, “I’m much more sensitized that people are keeping score.” From a management standpoint, losing Cohn and Powell “makes some things harder and some things easier,” he says. “Because every day we had people under Gary that wanted a shot. I wasn’t dying to have [him leave], and I’m close to Gary and a lot of life here was organized around Gary’s strengths and what he was good at and what he liked to do and his long-term relationships. All that has to be reoriented and replaced.” U.S. deputy national security adviser Dina Powell (smiling, in foreground) at the White House in April with Cohn, Jared Kushner, and Ivanka Trump. Andrew Harnik—AP photo  But his chief responsibility is to think about the firm’s future leadership, and Blankfein says that became marginally easier with Cohn’s departure. “You can keep somebody an extra two years,” he says, “but you might lose somebody who was otherwise going to give you 10 more years. It’s an ex post facto rationalization.” What about Blankfein’s own future at Goldman? Couldn’t it be argued that he is hanging on for a couple extra years, at the expense of the next person who will lead Goldman for another 10? (For what it’s worth, the betting on the Street seems to be that after a few more years of seasoning, Harvey Schwartz, the little-known former chief financial officer, will be Goldman’s next CEO.) “Don’t be shocked,” Blankfein tells me. “I’m probably not going to stay forever. People have been handicapping my succession since my first day. But it’s not anybody’s job to leave their job prematurely, even though it might be my job to manage that succession, and it might be the board’s job to manage me out, if it suits them. So I’ll wait until it suits them. If somebody said to me that it’s time to leave, I would understand that.” For now he might as well keep at it, though, because “nobody’s fired me yet.” Indeed, all things considered, Blankfein is feeling pretty sanguine these days. He says that where once upon a time he spent 98% of his time worrying about things with a 2% probability, he’s more optimistic now. “I’m feeling much better about things, so now it’s 99% and 1%.” A version of this article appears in the June 15, 2017 issue of Fortune with the headline "Is Goldman Sachs Still No. 1 on Wall Street?".

Thirty-two percent of 119 Japanese pension funds aim to increase investment in assets such as hedge funds in the year ending March 2012, according to a survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Tokyo-based asset management unit. They also plan to keep investing in emerging-market stocks and bonds, it showed. Japanese pensions, which have traditionally invested mainly in bonds, are seeking other assets to maintain steady returns and fund retiree benefits in a country where more than one in five people are over 65. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield is hovering around 1.2%, while the Nikkei 225 Stock Average is about a quarter of its 1989 peak.

"The trend to lower domestic bond holdings is rather new." About 14% of respondents said they intend to trim investment in domestic bonds, while 21% said they expect to reduce allocations to local equities, the survey showed. A total of 12% of the funds said they plan to increase allocations to emerging-market bonds and stocks. Almost 89% of 79 respondents said the March 11 record earthquake and ensuing tsunami that led to a nuclear disaster does not have a "major" impact that will force them to change their investment plans, the survey showed. Still, about 11% said there are concerns that investments may not be carried out as planned or may change depending on the situation, it showed. JPMorgan surveyed 119 Japanese pension funds with combined assets of about 10 trillion yen ($122bn) in its preliminary report. It plans to release a full report in May.

The Conservatives remain the largest party and likely will retain control in some fashion, but PM Theresa May's fate is unclear while Brexit negotiations, set to start later this month, could face delay or more. The pound was sharply lower. XAutoplay: On | OffKeep an eye on financial stocks. Citigroup (C) broke out Thursday as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) test key levels. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN)-Dish Network (DISH) rumors swirled again. Stock futures initially fell Thursday evening after initial exit polls predicted that Conservatives would fall short. But futures gradually firmed somewhat. Futures for the Dow industrials rose 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed nearly 0.2% while Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.1% above fair value. Conservatives ended up with roughly 318 seats, down modestly from 330 before the election and less than the 326 seats needed for an outright majority. Labour should get 261 seats, a big rise, as most third parties lost ground. That would create a hung Parliament. However, Northern Ireland unionists, with 10 seats under the DUP, are set to provide enough support to give Conservatives control via a minority government. When May called the early election this spring, the Conservatives started with a huge lead, with most analysts betting that the ruling party would amass a sweeping majority and a freer hand in Brexit negotiations with the European Union. Now political uncertainty is heightened just before Brexit negotiations are supposed to get underway. Even though Conservatives likely will retain control of Parliament, May not be able to hang on as PM for long. But she apparently will fight to stay on for now. It's also unclear what direction Brexit will take if a handful of anti-EU hardliners or those who favor a "soft"  Brexit hold the process hostage. The DUP itself supports a "comprehensive free trade and customs agreement" with the EU, suggesting it wants a deal that retains as much access to the single market as possible. Northern Ireland does not want a hard border with Ireland. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 0.65% in Friday intraday trading. The internationally focused FTSE 100 benefits from a weaker pound. Germany's Dax advanced 0.5% and France's CAC-40 climbed 0.5%. On Thursday, the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.4%, hitting a record high, while the Dow and S&P 500 eked out tiny gains. Financials Citigroup and Bank of America rose fractionally in premarket action on the stock market today. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs were not yet active. If global financial markets swing, Wall Street banks could be bellwethers. Citigroup, perhaps the most internationally exposed of the big U.S. banks, rose 2.15% to 63.21 in Thursday's regular session, hitting an 8-year high and clearing a 62.63 buy point. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase rose more than 1%, all finding resistance at their 50-day moving averages. (Goldman and JPMorgan are Dow industrial components. Treasury yields, which were little changed early Friday, have risen modestly off recent lows in the past few sessions. Ex-FBI Director James Comey's testimony Thursday, though it didn't paint President Trump in a good light, didn't offer new bombshells. Also, the House OK'd legislation to roll back much of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations, though the real hurdle is the Senate. Amazon-Dish? Meanwhile, Dish Network rose 3% late on a Benzinga report that it's in talks with Amazon for an expanded alliance, possibly even a takeover. Amazon-Dish rumors have been swirling for weeks or even months, with Amazon eyeing Dish's unused spectrum for video streaming. Amazon edged higher early Friday.

Hunter is watching for recovery in U.S. economic data surprises. Without better data, "a bearish trend reversal" in Treasurys could lead to a drop in stocks, Hunter said. Evelyn Cheng | @chengevelyn 14 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters JPMorgan sees a 'summer top' and market correction into the fall    11 Hours Ago | 00:45 JPMorgan's top technical analyst sees a stock market drop ahead in the charts. "The market keeps a bullish trajectory for now, but we see a growing probability for a summer top and correction into [the] fall," Jason Hunter, the firm's head of global fixed income and U.S. equity technical strategy said in a Wednesday note. "If U.S. economic surprise indices do not rebound and lead to a bearish trend reversal in Treasuries this summer, we ultimately think the current trend deceleration now present in equity indices will turn into bearish reversal patterns, which in turn could lead to a tradable correction into the fall," Hunter said in the note. The S&P 500 hit an all-time high Friday of 2,446.20, towards the higher end of the 2,392 to 2,489 range Hunter identified for a possible medium-term top. He sees support for the S&P 500 index at 2,381 to 2,383. show chapters Big tech turns lower as markets rally    13 Hours Ago | 03:18 A correction is defined as a 10 percent drop from a recent high, something the S&P 500 has not seen since February 2016. The surprise UK vote to leave the EU last June only sent the index 5.3 percent lower, before it quickly recovered to surge into record territory. That climb has moderated in the last several months — the S&P 500 has only closed higher or lower by more than 1 percent on four trading days in 2017. On Friday, the CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) fell to 9.37, its lowest in more than 23 years. The extremely low volatility has many on Wall Street worried, including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. Last month, he said the market calm is "not a normal resting state." Meanwhile, DoubleLine CEO Jeffrey Gundlach expects a summer stock market correction as Treasury yields rise. In the last few months, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has fallen but remains well above multi-year lows hit in the summer of 2016. "If a top pattern [in stocks] does unfold in the weeks ahead, we think it would make sense to exit long risk and even tactically position for a correction into the fall. In our view, it would take a material reversal of the Treasury bull trend to repair the health of the equity rally and avoid a setback into the fall," Hunter said in the note.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe By Amanda Reaume Chase created a snapshot of the business environment with the 2017 Business Leaders Outlook by surveying 950 sole/primary business decision-makers at enterprises with revenue of $100,000 to $20 million. JPMorgan Chase "I love the high I get from meeting my goals, and then setting new ones," says the owner of Dr. Gena Chiropractic. "I have to think on my feet a lot, but it's fun because there are always new challenges." Dr. Gena Bofshever, a chiropractor in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is a small business owner who loves a challenge. "I love the high I get from meeting my goals, and then setting new ones," says the owner of Dr. Gena Chiropractic. "I have to think on my feet a lot, but it's fun because there are always new challenges." Her confidence proved typical of Chase's female small business clients who responded to its 2017 Business Leaders Outlook survey. The 950 male and female business owners surveyed said they feel optimistic about their company's and industry's performance over the next 12 months. But male owners were more likely to feel confident about the national economy. The survey of businesses with revenue of $100,000 to $20 million found several areas in which women business owners' views differ greatly from those of male owners. Here are some themes that stood out as being particularly important to women business owners: Small business challenges Running your own business means dealing with a myriad of challenges on a daily basis. For both groups, top concerns are growing sales/revenue, uncertain economic conditions and taxes. However, compared to male counterparts, female business owners were more likely to list cyber security and a limited supply of candidates with the right skill set as top concerns. Male business owners, meanwhile, were more likely to choose health care costs and regulatory requirements as challenges. When it comes to areas were they could use help, both groups say marketing; yet female business owners are more likely than male owners to mention assistance with financial management. JPMorgan Chase Running your own business means dealing with a myriad of challenges on a daily basis. For both groups, top concerns are growing sales/revenue, uncertain economic conditions and taxes. An optimistic outlook Women business owners said they were generally optimistic about their businesses; the majority expect company revenue to grow over the next 12 months. That's also consistent with Dr. Gena's expectation for her chiropractic practice. "I'm extremely optimistic," she says. "We're continuing to expand our team this year to meet our customers' growing interest in more natural forms of healthcare." Employee management strategy The survey suggests that female owners employ slightly different strategies when attracting and retaining talent. Female business owners were more likely than male owners to say they motivate employees with holiday perks, vacation time and stock options. Separately, when asked about projections for employee compensation in the next 12 months, male owners were more likely to say they are planning to increase compensation. "I've been an employee and I know what it feels like to not be appreciated," Dr. Gena says about why she offers such great benefits to her staff. "I never want any of my staff to feel that way. I want excited and motivated people because that's how our business will continue to be a success." Social media savvy Female business owners show strong enthusiasm for using social media to benefit their business. For example, female owners were more likely than male owners to say their company currently uses a Facebook page. Dr. Gena says she gets a number of new clients from sites like Yelp and Facebook and loves using social media. "At least once a day, we're posting pictures or testimonials with our patients," she says. 2016 presidential election and regulations The majority of male and female business owners feel the new US president and his administration's policies will have a positive impact on their business. While both groups want the government to focus on lower tax rates and reduced credits and deductions, female owners were more likely than males to want the government to focus on creating and fostering a skilled workforce - a desire that fits with their interest in hiring skilled job candidates. Plan for continued growth While there are challenges to being a small business owner, many of the women surveyed believe, like Dr. Gena does, that the sacrifices they make for their businesses are worthwhile. For Dr. Gena, that includes bringing on new clinicians and possibly expanding to another location in the future. "Over the next year, we want to essentially double our practice," she says.

The U.K. will have to clear the current political uncertainty and define its next government before it can negotiate with the European Union. At the same time, the country is under pressure given that the two-year time limit to conclude Brexit talks continues to tick. President Donald Tusk of the European Council said on Twitter: "We don't know when Brexit talks start. We know then they must end. Do your best to avoid a 'no deal' as result of 'no negotiations'." The EU's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, also said on Twitter that the negotiations will start when the U.K. is ready. "Timetable and EU positions are clear. Let's put our minds together on striking a deal," he said. Tweet 2 Theresa May called the election to garner stronger support and more power when discussing Brexit with the EU. However, this seems to have totally backfired raising questions as to who will negotiate Brexit and what sort of Brexit the country will look for. show chapters Theresa May is ‘toast’ says Nigel Farage    Friday, 9 Jun 2017 | 1:11 AM ET | 01:42 No hard Brexit David Davis, who has been the U.K.'s secretary of state for Exiting the EU, told Sky News at around 2 a.m. London time Friday that the U.K. government may had lost its mandate to leave the EU and the single market – a tariff-free trading bloc for EU members. show chapters In near term, second Scottish referendum seems off the table: Pro    Friday, 9 Jun 2017 | 1:11 AM ET | 01:44 He described Brexit as a process that "seeks to give the best deal in terms of economic and commercial opportunity with Europe but also open up opportunity with the rest of the world." No Brexit at all? The future of the U.K. in Europe has reached a new peak of uncertainty. With a hung parliament, it is unclear who will lead be negotiating with the EU, although a political editor at the BBC has suggested that Theresa May will look to continue as prime minister and will not resign. Nigel Farage, one of the main Brexit supporters, said Friday that he might return to frontline politics to ensure that Brexit does happen. He resigned from the leadership of the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP) in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum last June. show chapters In electoral terms, almost every UK party lost: Pro    Friday, 9 Jun 2017 | 1:16 AM ET | 01:49 "I still think the odds are on we will have some sort of Brexit," David Stubbs, global market strategist at JPMorgan told CNBC on Friday over the phone. However he added "that a lot has changed in our negotiating position." The hung parliament vote has not given Theresa May the political support she wanted to take the U.K. out of the single market. Kallum Pickering, senior U.K. economist at Berenberg, said in an email: "Will the U.K. change its mind on Brexit? Maybe but not very likely." The Labour Party also aims to deliver Brexit but one in which it retains the benefits of the single market. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Friday June 9, 2017. Photo: Rick Findler/PA Wire Greg Wright, Deputy Business Editor 07:09 Friday 09 June 2017 0 Have your say Britain may have to delay Brexit talks in the absence of a majority for Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party, JPMorgan said. With no clear winner emerging from the election, Mrs May signalled she would fight on, despite being on course to lose her majority in the House of Commons. “Perhaps the most obvious conclusion is that the likelihood of the UK needing to request a delay in the Brexit process has risen substantially, given the chance that political developments in the UK disturb what is already a time-compressed process,” said Malcolm Barr, economist at JPMorgan, in a research note. Patrick Connolly, a certified financial planner at Chase de Vere, said: “Last night we saw another surprising election result, following in the footsteps of last year’s EU Referendum and the election of Donald Trump in the US “This result, with a hung parliament, causes uncertainty and could have an impact on stock markets, bond markets and currency markets as all generally hate uncertainty “However, the impact of election results on stock markets tends to be short lived, as very quickly the uncertainty passes and stock market movements are again driven by global factors and general investor sentiment “It should be remembered that the UK stock market has risen significantly since the EU Referendum result and the US market has risen since the election of Donald Trump “The message for investors is very simple. While they may be feeling uncertain about what happens next, they need to remain calm and rational and understand that any short-term noise from the election result is likely to be just that, short-term.” Back to the top of the page Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

Keith Noreika, who represented lenders as a private lawyer, plans to recuse himself from matters related to JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc., firms the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulates.  Democratic lawmakers had already questioned whether Noreika’s close ties to the industry would prevent him from being an impartial watchdog. The ethics disclosure, released by the OCC Friday, lays out the scope of his potential conflicts for the first time.   “How can he possibly do his job when he can’t regulate these entities?” Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said in a Friday statement. “Not to mention the fact that he stands to profit from all of these relationships the moment he finishes his work at the OCC.” Trump Nominee Noreika became comptroller of the currency on a temporary basis last month, leaving his law practice to run the agency until a permanent leader is confirmed by the Senate. This week, President Donald Trump nominated Joseph Otting, a former lieutenant of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s at OneWest Bank, for the OCC post. Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up Noreika will follow all applicable federal ethics rules when he leaves government, said Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman. That includes a permanent ban on representing banks before any agency if he dealt with an issue pertaining to the firm while at the OCC. Noreika will also be barred for two years from representing clients on matters that were “pending under his official responsibility during the last year of his federal service,” Hubbard said. In private practice, Noreika earned almost $3.3 million working at two law firms over the past 16 months or so, according to his financial disclosure form, which was also released Friday. His nearly 80 legal clients ranged from Wall Street banks to private equity firms to financial trade associations. The Trump administration’s decision to use an unusual personnel maneuver to name Noreika to the OCC post also has drawn scrutiny from Democrats, who are concerned that he isn’t following the same ethics rules as full-time officials. Noreika was appointed as a “special government employee,” a status meant for workers who are expected to serve for 130 days over the course of a year. Ethics Pledge Under the designation, which hasn’t traditionally been used to hire top regulators, Noreika doesn’t have to sign the ethics pledge that President Donald Trump requires of his appointees. The pledge includes a five-year lobbying ban for former officials. At the OCC, Noreika’s ethics agreement calls for him to stay away from specific matters, such as enforcement cases, and does not preclude him from participating in broader policy decisions that would impact his former clients. It requires Noreika to recuse himself for one year from the date he last worked for the client. That means some of his recusals have already ended. For example, Noreika was precluded from issues involving Wells Fargo & Co. until May 18. His restriction on Bank of America will end July 26, and Citigroup lapses on Sept. 30, according to the form. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. were more recent clients and Noreika will be recused from matters involving them until the next spring, if he is still at the agency.

Photo: Reuters/Jonathan Ernst United StatesFinanceOpinion Dear President Trump: Breaking up (banks) isn’t so hard to do In 66 years as law, the Glass-Steagall Act effectively prevented systemic banking and economic collapse and it's revival is well overdue By Nomi Prins June 10, 2017 8:53 AM (UTC+8) Share Tweet Linkedin Print Email Share 0 Comment 0 Donald, listen, whatever you’ve done so far, whatever you’ve messed up, there’s one thing you could do that would make up for a lot.  It would be huge!  Terrific!  It could change our world for the better in a big-league way!  It could save us all from economic disaster!  And it isn’t even hard to grasp or complicated to do.  It’s simple, in fact.  Reinstitute the Glass-Steagall Act. Let me explain. In the world of romance, if you break up with someone, it’s pretty simple (emotional complications aside).  You’re just not together anymore. In the world of financial regulation, it used to be as simple as that, too. It was like installing a traffic light at a dangerous intersection to avoid deaths. In 1933, when the Glass-Steagall Act was passed, it helped break up the biggest banks of the day and for good reason: they had had a major hand in triggering the most disastrous economic depression our country ever experienced. Certain divisions of those banks were no longer allowed to coexist with others. The law split the parts of banks that placed bets by creating and trading certain risky securities and those that took deposits and provided loans.  In other words, it ensured that the investment bank and the commercial bank would no longer cohabit. Put another way, it separated bankers with a heinous gambling habit from those who only wanted a secure nest egg. It was simplicity itself. Photo: Kurtis Garbutt via Flickr After 1933, the gamblers and savers went their separate ways, which proved a boon for the economy and the financial system for nearly seven decades. Then legislators, lobbyists, bankers, and regulators started to chisel away at the wall separating those two kinds of banks. By November 1999, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that repealed the Glass-Steagall Act totally. The abusive marriages of gamblers and savers could once again be consummated. And who doesn’t remember the result: the financial crisis of 2007-2008 that led to taxpayer-funded bailouts, subsidies, loans, and sweetheart fraud-settlement deals. Just as the Crash of 1929 had been catalyzed by the manufacturing of shady “trusts” stuffed with shady securities, this crisis was enabled by the big banks that engineered complex assets stuffed with subprime mortgages and other loans that were sold around the world.  Former US President Barack Obama delivers his keynote speech to the Montreal Chamber of Commerce at the Palais de Congres in Quebec. Photo: Reuters/Dario Ayala Under President Obama, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Act sought to limit the ability of big banks to trade the riskiest types of securities. Through inclusion of something called the “Volcker Rule,” Dodd-Frank prohibited the trading of securities (even if with many loopholes). What it didn’t do was actually break up the big banks again.  That meant another 1933 still awaited its moment.  Then along came the bizarre 2016 presidential election campaign during which, strangely enough, Democrats and Republicans found one issue on which they had some common ground: the banking system.  Key figures in both parties agreed that it was time to stop the investment bank and the commercial bank from commingling. Bernie Sanders ran on a campaign to break up the banks – and so did Donald Trump. At at an October campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, Trump even stated, “It’s time for a twenty-first-century Glass-Steagall.” The Democratic National Committee platform offered a similar message. “Banks,” it said, “should not be able to gamble with taxpayers’ deposits or pose an undue risk to Main Street. Democrats support a variety of ways to stop this from happening, including an updated and modernized version of Glass-Steagall as well as breaking up too-big-to-fail financial institutions that pose a systemic risk to the stability of our economy.” The Republican National Committee wasted even fewer words making the point in their platform: “We support reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which prohibits commercial banks from engaging in high-risk investment.” And it didn’t even suggest that the act should be “modernized” or mention a “21st century” version that didn’t do what the 20th century one had done. For the first time since its repeal, in other words, a return to the Glass-Steagall Act had bipartisan support. It couldn’t have been simpler, right? Two parties, one idea: split banks into two pieces. But then, as if you hadn’t already guessed, it got complicated.   Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner, waivers on supporting the return of the Glass-Steagall Act. Photo: Reuters/Joshua Roberts Breaking up, Republican style In the new administration, two key figures are now offering quite different and conflicting views of what a resurrection of the Glass-Steagall Act might mean.  At his Senate confirmation hearings, Steven Mnuchin, former Goldman Sachs partner and Trump’s nominee to be secretary of the Treasury, faced Democrat Senator Maria Cantwell (Washington) as she bluntly asked “Do you support returning to Glass-Steagall?” He replied, “I don’t support going back to Glass-Steagall as is. What we’ve talked about with the president-elect is perhaps we need a 21st century Glass-Steagall. But, no, I don’t support… taking a very old law and say we should adhere to it as is.” Cantwell then pressed him further: “And so, is that the position of what the Republican platform was? Because I thought it was Glass-Steagall?” To this, Mnuchin responded, “Again, the Republican platform did pass at the convention Glass-Steagall and… [when] we talked about policy with the president-elect, our view is we need a 21st century Glass-Steagall.” The skepticism in the room was thick enough to cut with a knife. Here, after all, was a man who had made windfall profits on the fallout from the 2007-2008 “too big to fail” financial crisis by organizing a cadre of hedge-fund billionaires to buy the collapsed IndyMac Bank at a discount. He then proceeded to foreclose on some of its mortgages and resell it for a US$2.5 billion profit. Why should such a man want to restrict banking activity, Glass-Steagall-style, when his loan practices had allowed him to make a fortune off the taxpayer bailouts that were the result of not doing so? What would the point be when a crisis, as history had just shown, forced the federal government to subsidize risk and failure? The only problem he faced: the Republican platform said he should.   Last month, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee and under questioning from Senator Elizabeth Warren, he backtracked even further: “The president said we do support a ’21st-century Glass-Steagall,’ that means there are aspects of it that we think may make sense. But we never said before we support a full separation of banks and investment banking.” Warren responded incredulously, “Tell me what 21st-century Glass-Steagall means if it doesn’t mean breaking up those two parts. It’s an easy question.” Mnuchin replied, “It’s actually a complicated question… We never said we were in favor of Glass-Steagall. We said we were in favor of a 21st-century Glass-Steagall. It couldn’t be clearer.”  Which, of course, couldn’t have been murkier. Director of the White House National Economic Council Gary Cohn (left) generally favors a return to when banks were split between those which placed bets to those which took deposits. Photo: Reuters/Joshua Roberts And then there’s that other former Goldman Sachs man, Gary Cohn, Trump’s director of the National Economic Council.  He had quite a different Glass-Steagall tale to tell Senator Warren. According to Bloomberg News, he insisted that he “generally favors banking going back to how it was when firms like Goldman focused on trading and underwriting securities, and companies such as Citigroup primarily issued loans.” That sounds a lot like breaking up the banks. This division and the as-yet unresolved nature of the Trump administration response to the Glass-Steagall question could, in the face of another financial crisis, come back to haunt us all, if it translates into more bailouts and systemic failures. The Democrats’ Dilemma As with the proverbial difficulty of chewing gum and walking at the same time, certain Democrats seem to find the very idea of supporting both Dodd-Frank and a new Glass-Steagall Act perplexing. Many of them have promoted the idea that no big bank actually failed in the Great Recession moment (which was true only because those banks got huge infusions of federal aid to remain solvent).  As a result, they avoided all responsibility for the way the repeal of Glass-Steagall allowed too-big-to-fail banks to come into existence in the first place.  In the process, they also conveniently ignored the way the big banks lent money to, or funded, the investment banks that did fail like both of my former employers, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Without those loans or that funding, those outfits couldn’t have purchased the overload of toxic assets that, in the end, imploded the whole system. President Obama summed up this position when he told Rolling Stone in 2012, “I’ve looked at some of Rolling Stone’s articles that say, ‘This didn’t go far enough, we didn’t institute Glass-Steagall’ and so forth, and I pushed my economic team very hard on some of those questions. “But there is not evidence that having Glass-Steagall in place would somehow change the dynamic. Lehman Brothers wasn’t a commercial bank; it was an investment bank. AIG wasn’t an FDIC-insured bank; it was an insurance institution. So the problem in today’s financial sector can’t be solved simply by re-imposing models that were created in the 1930s.”  He needed a more astute team. Hillary Clinton took a similar tack in her campaign and it may have contributed to her devastating election loss.  The continued promotion of such fallacies does not bode well for the future of the party if it continues to adopt that view. A return to a safer system on the other hand, would be more populist – and far more popular. Glass-Steagall’s bipartisan past Fortunately, current legislation is circulating in Congress that would promote the long-term stability of the financial system by restoring Glass-Steagall for real. H.R. 790 (“Return to the Prudent Banking Act of 2017”) is one of two reinstatement bills in the House of Representatives. It has 50 co-sponsors from both parties and its passage is being spearheaded by Democrat Marcy Kaptur (Ohio) and Republican Walter Jones (North Carolina).   The second bill, H.R. 2585, sponsored by Democrat Mike Capuano (Massachussetts), bears a close relationship to Senate bill S.881 (the “Twenty-First-Century Glass-Steagall Act of 2017”), sponsored by Democrat Elizabeth Warren (Massachussetts) and nine cosponsors including Republican John McCain (Arizona), and independents Maria Cantwell (Washington) and Angus King (Maine). Either of the bills, if enacted, would do the same thing: break up the banks. To understand just why passage is so crucial, a little history is in order.  Glass-Steagall, or the Banking Act of 1933, was signed into law by President Franklin D Roosevelt. It represented a bipartisan effort and was even – perhaps not surprisingly given the devastating nature of the collapse of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed – actively promoted by some of Wall Street’s most powerful bankers. In its 66 years as law, it effectively prevented systemic banking and economic collapse. Outgoing president Herbert Hoover (left) with Franklin D Roosevelt on his inauguration day in 1933. Photo: Wikimedia Commons Even before Roosevelt began his first term, congressional Republicans had initiated an investigation into bankers’ practices.  In early 1933, as Roosevelt was preparing to take office with an incoming Democratic Senate, outgoing Senate Banking and Currency Committee chairman Peter Norbeck, a Republican from South Dakota, hired former New York Deputy District Attorney Ferdinand Pecora to lead the Senate Banking Committee in a new investigation. Later known as the Pecora hearings, they would shed light on the kinds of financial manipulations by unscrupulous bankers that had led to the crash of 1929. They would also provide the new president with the necessary populist political capital to enact America’s most sweeping financial reforms. No less crucial was the way banking leaders aligned themselves with Roosevelt’s new program. Duty to country over balance sheets seemed then to be the order of the day, even on Wall Street.  (It’s not an attitude that lasted into the 21st century.) Two days after his inauguration, for instance, Roosevelt invited incoming National City Bank Chairman James Perkins to the White House for a secret meeting. The next day, under Perkins’ direction, his bank board passed a resolution splitting apart its trading and deposit-taking divisions. Chase National Bank chairman Winthrop Aldrich, a major financial power player, lent a hand as well. Both Perkins and Aldrich would back the new Glass-Steagall bill. (Lest you think that all was sweetness and light, they were also convinced that it would diminish the strength of their main competitor, the Morgan Bank.) Three days after Roosevelt called Perkins to the White House, Aldrich’s views on breaking up the banks hit the front page of the New York Times when he announced that Chase National Bank and Chase Securities Corporation would become separate entities, effectively enforcing the bill before it even became law. It wasn’t simple – the Chase Securities Corporation was the biggest of its kind in the world – but it happened. Aldrich then took part in a series of private meetings with the president at the White House about the pending legislation. Without the support of Aldrich and Perkins, it’s possible that the bill wouldn’t have passed. After all, a far weaker version proposed during the previous administration of Herbert Hoover hadn’t. The Glass-Steagall Act also created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to insure citizens’ bank deposits. This left commercial banks with a choice to make. If they took deposits and made loans, they could not speculate with depositors’ money. If they wanted to create and speculate, they were on their own. There’s much to be said for protecting hard-working Americans in this fashion. US President Ronald Reagan. Photo: Wikimedia Commons How the walls came tumbling down In the 1980s, the walls between investment and commercial banking first began to crumble.  The deregulation of the financial sector that followed would prove to be as bipartisan as the passage of Glass-Steagall had been.  In 1982, as the Republican presidency of Ronald Reagan began, Congress passed the Garn-St Germain Act, deregulating the kinds of investments that savings and loan banks could make to include riskier real estate loans. This had the effect of exacerbating the savings and loan debacle, which hit its pinnacle in the late 1980s. By 1989, more than 1,000 S&L banks in the US would crash and burn. In total, the crisis wound up costing about US$160 billion, US$132 billion of which was footed by taxpayers. And the suppliers of risky S&L securities tended to be the big banks. In 1987, still in the age of Reagan, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, a past board member of JPMorgan, said that non-bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies could sell or hold “bank ineligible securities” – that is, securities prohibited by Glass-Steagall, including mortgage securities, asset-backed securities, junk bonds, and other derivative products.   The move exacerbated the S&L crisis, but it also offered an avenue for commercial banks to stock up on some of the securities at the heart of that crisis. And so commercial banks began investing in hedge funds, whose very purpose in life is to gamble on securities, stocks, and commodities.  In 1998, in an early warning of what the future might hold, one of them, Long Term Capital Management, crashed and nearly brought down the whole financial system with it. Some 55 commercial banks had invested in it using depositors’ money to back their bets.  Only an emergency meeting of the presidents of the major banks at the Federal Reserve averted a larger economic meltdown, but because Glass-Steagall was still in place, they had to figure out how to save themselves.  No government bailouts were forthcoming. Wall Street plunged deeper into financial deregulation in 1999. Photo: iStock Having narrowly avoided disaster, Wall Street only plunged deeper into financial deregulation. In 1999, Glass-Steagall itself was repealed. On December 21, 2000, Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act deregulating derivatives trading.  The big commercial banks then merged with investment banks, insurance companies, and brokerage firms.  By 2007, the assets of those big banks had tripled. The four largest – Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo – by then controlled (and still control) more than half the assets of the banking system. In the autumn of 2007, that system finally started buckling because of the problems of Citigroup, not because of the investment banks, which would not have been covered by Glass-Steagall. The catastrophe that hit Citigroup makes it clear just how crucial the repeal of that act was to the financial meltdown to come. Citigroup would “require” a taxpayer-financed bailout of US$45 billion, US$340 billion in asset guarantees, and US$2 trillion in near-0% Federal Reserve loans between the autumn of 2007 and 2010. That in itself was staggering and Citigroup wasn’t alone. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke would later testify that, by 2008, 11 out of the 12 biggest commercial banks were “insolvent” and had to be bailed out.  The entire banking system was rotten to the core and the massive buildup of bad paper, high leverage, and speculative bets (derivatives) that made disaster inevitable can be traced directly back to the repeal of Glass-Steagall.  Today, a fresh bubble is inflating. This time, it’s not US subprime mortgages at the heart of a budding banking crisis, but US$51 trillion in corporate debt in the form of bonds, loans, and related derivatives. The credit ratings agency S&P Global Ratings has predicted that such debt could rise to US$75 trillion by 2020 and the defaults on it are starting to increase in pace. Banks have profited by the short-term creation and trading of this corporate debt, propagating even greater risk. Should that bubble burst, it could make the subprime mortgage bubble of 2007 look like a relatively small-scale event.   Source: Wikimedia Commons What Will the President Do? On the positive side, there’s a growing bipartisan alliance in Congress and outside it on restoring Glass-Steagall. This increasingly wide-ranging consensus reaches from the AFL-CIO to the libertarian Mises Institute, in the Senate from John McCain to Elizabeth Warren and Maria Cantwell, and in the House of Representatives from Republicans Walter Jones and Mike Coffman to Democrats Marcy Kaptur, Bernie Sanders, and Tulsi Gabbard.  In fact, just this week, Kaptur and Jones announced an amendment to the pending Financial Choice Act in the House of Representatives, that would represent the first genuine attempt to bring to a vote the possibility of resurrecting the Glass-Steagall Act since its repeal. So, Donald, here’s the question: Where do you – the man who, in the course of a few weeks, embraced Middle Eastern autocrats, turned relations with key Nato allies upside down, and to the astonishment of much of the world, withdrew the US from the Paris climate agreement – stand? In just a few months in office, you’ve turned the White House into an outpost for your family business, but when it comes to the financial well-being of the rest of us, what will you do? Will you, in fact, protect us from another future meltdown of the financial system? It wouldn’t be that hard and you were clear enough on this issue in your election campaign, but does that even matter to you today? I noticed that recently, in an Oval Office interview with Bloomberg News, when asked about breaking up the banks, you said, “I’m looking at that right now. There’s some people that want to go back to the old system, right?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why Citizens Financial Is Primed for Growth The Rhode Island-based lender is on track to becoming a top-performing regional bank. Motley Fool Staff , John Maxfield, and Gaby Lapera (the_motley_fool) Jun 9, 2017 at 7:31PM Since Citizens Financial Group (NYSE:CFG) went public in 2014, investors have seen a meaningful improvement in its performance. In the first quarter of this year, for instance, both its profitability and efficiency metrics made substantial year-over-year gains. Listen in on this segment of Industry Focus: Financials to learn what's behind this impressive performance, as The Motley Fool's Gaby Lapera and contributor John Maxfield dig into the backstory behind Citizens Financial's 2014 initial public offering. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on May 26, 2017. Gaby Lapera: Citizens Financial was actually spun off from the Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS). The Royal Bank of Scotland is not the most guilt-free financial institution, I guess you could say it that way, going into the financial crisis. Mistakes were made. So, Citizens Financial got spun off. John Maxfield: That's right. Citizens Financial was a relatively small bank when a few decades ago the Royal Bank of Scotland purchased it. They invested in it, boosted it up, it grew and grew. It's now one of the largest banks in New England. That's its stronghold. It's based in Providence, Rhode Island, it has $150 billion in assets now. But Royal Bank of Scotland's, like so many other banks during the financial crisis, got into a whole bunch of trouble, making bad loans, making bad decisions strategically. So they had to, in the immediate wake of the crisis, at the direction of regulators, they basically had to shut down growth and just focus on retreating and retrenching, which is not uncommon for banks in the financial crisis. But the position that put Citizens in is that it put it at a really competitive disadvantage against the company like, well, Wells Fargo is in kind of a different place now than it was back then, because they have the whole fake account scandal last year, but Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, these guys were able to continue growing and growing and growing. But Citizens, when it was still a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, it was watching everybody grow, but because of the restrictions on the Royal Bank of Scotland in terms of having to de-risk its balance sheet and shrink as opposed to grow, Citizens Financial was directly impacted by that. Then in 2014, it spun off in an initial public offering, so, it went public, and it was the biggest IPO of a bank in United States history. I can't remember exactly, don't quote me on this exactly, but I think it had something like $120 [billion]-$130 billion in assets when it went public. So, it was already a large bank when it went on to the market. Lapera: Yeah. Being a large bank has advantages and disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is that you're subject to a lot of regulatory stuff. So, they're getting spun out from their parent company and dumped into the world in not a great time for them, because 2014 was when things were starting to turn around and look good for banks. I think a lot of banks were doing OK by then, but Citizens came out in a really tough spot for a bank. Maxfield: Yeah, it absolutely did. I think you can look at that as a glass-half-full, glass-half-empty perspective. When I was talking to Bruce Van Saun, I got the impression that he looks at it as a glass half full, coming from that perspective, and here's why. In the immediate wake of the financial crisis, one of the main things that really hit the banks, you had the subprime mortgage crisis, that hurt banks. But the banks who that really hurt were the ones who securitized those mortgages, and then sold them in securities to other institutional investors, and then in the process of securitizing those and selling those, there were incorrect things said in those documents, or misrepresentations. And that's what caused the losses at these big banks, like Bank of America and Citigroup. But if you look at a lot of the other banks across the country, the thing that really hit them was commercial real estate loans. These are like development loans, so it's just a piece of land that's priced up when the market is doing really well, and then the bank will loan on that, and if the market falls out, there's nothing on that property to act as effective collateral. So, one of the things that the Royal Bank of Scotland forced throughout this entire organization was, I'm not sure they completely stopped making commercial real estate loans, or if they just throttled it significantly, but when Citizens spun out of the Royal Bank of Scotland, it was way behind in commercial real estate loans, way behind in mortgage loans, way behind in all of these other things, which meant that, to a certain extent, there was only one direction to go, and that was up. And we're starting to see that come through right now in Citizens' performance. Gaby Lapera owns shares of JPMorgan Chase. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

Financial terms were not disclosed, but they said J.P. Morgan and Credit Suisse have provided fully committed financing for the transaction. Credit Suisse served as financial advisor to Bowlmor and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC served as financial advisor to Atairos. RELATED: Angelakis to Head New Comcast-Backed Growth Company Tied to the deal, Bowlmor CEO Thomas Shannon will maintain his significant investment in the bowling and entertainment franchise, which has grown from six centers in 2013 to more than 300 (295 in the U.S., seven in Mexico and three locations in  Canada) under brands that include The Bowlmor, Bowlero, and Brunswick Zone XL, among others.   Atairos launched in 2016 with more than $4 billion in committed capital. The investment company, led by former Comcast CFO Michael Angelakis, has also invested in Groupon Inc., Learfield (integrated marketing solutions for college sports), Orogen Group (a private company that focuses on the financial services industry), TriNet (human resources for small/mid-sized businesses), and Virtusa Corp. (IT consulting and outsourcing). RELATED: Comcast-Backed Atairos Invests $250M in Groupon   “We acquired and revitalized the AMF Bowling and Brunswick Bowling chains through extensive operational improvements and by introducing Bowlmor’s innovative sporting and entertainment experience to a national audience.” Shannon said in a statement. “Atairos is the ideal partner for Bowlmor as we embark on the next phase of our growth and development.” "This is an exciting opportunity for Atairos to invest in the growing out-of-home entertainment market by partnering with a proven entrepreneur in Tom Shannon who has built the leading bowling franchise in North America, with terrific brands and unmatched scale,” Angelakis added. “At a time when consumers are seeking unique and authentic experiences, Bowlmor’s highly differentiated and compelling offering has been enormously successful. With a proven, scalable platform and a highly talented management team, we believe there’s great potential for continuing growth through execution of the business plan as well as related acquisitions.” Want to read more stories like this?

Still, all three major indexes are on track to end the week higher, with focus turning to the Federal Reserve's meeting next week, when the central bank is near certain to raise interest rates. The Dow got a boost from Goldman Sachs' 1.8 percent gain, while a more than 2 percent rise in JPMorgan and Bank of America helped lift the S&P 500. The financial index's 1.7 percent rise topped the gainers among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, followed by a 1.6 percent gain in energy on the back of higher oil prices. The technology sector was off 1.5 percent, led by declines in Microsoft and Apple. The index is on track to fall for the first time in three days. At 12:49 p.m. ET (1649 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 81.28 points, or 0.38 percent, at 21,263.81, the S&P 500 was up 4.45 points, or 0.18 percent, at 2,438.24 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 44.28 points, or 0.7 percent, at 6,277.48. U.S. stocks started the session strong after former FBI Director James Comey's testimony on Thursday was not seen as damaging enough to Donald Trump's presidency. Comey said Trump fired him to undermine an investigation into Russian meddling into last November's U.S. election and while he had no doubt that Russia interfered with the election, he was confident that no votes had been altered. "The market was concerned about the information that Comey will bring and the President has, to a degree, come away clean enough that he will not end up in any sort of impeachment issue," said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenberg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. The market's was concerned that the testimony could derail the Trump administration's push to fulfill its agenda of lower taxes and looser regulations - promises that were partly behind a post-election rally that drove U.S. stocks to record highs. Investors also looked past the UK election, where British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority. Chipmaker Nvidia hit a new record high, before reversing course to trade down 4.5 percent at $152.80 after Citron Research said the stock could trade back to $130. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,918 to 898. On the Nasdaq, 1,716 issues rose and 1,089 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.

All three major indexes are on track to end the week higher, with focus turning to the Federal Reserve's meeting next week, where it is widely expected to raise interest rates. Traders are pricing in a 99.6 percent chance of a rate hike, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The Dow got a boost from Goldman Sachs' 1.9 percent gain, while a more than 2 percent rise in shares of both JPMorgan and Bank of America helped lift the S&P 500 index. The financial index's 1.46 percent rise topped the gainers among the major S&P 500 sectors. Investors also looked beyond the UK election, where British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority. May, however, said she would form a new government with assistance from Northern Irish party to provide political certainty. "While Britain is a bit of a hung parliament at this time, it's not so severe that the Conservatives lose all their power so the Brexit conversation could still be a slow, methodical process," said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenberg Thalmann Asset Management in New York.

"The market was concerned about the information that Comey will bring and the President has, to a degree, come away clean enough that he will not end up in any sort of impeachment issue," said Blancato. The market's concern is whether the Trump administration can put the investigation behind it and revive momentum for its agenda of lower taxes and looser regulations. Bets on that agenda are partly behind a rally, which has driven stock indexes to record highs. Chipmaker Nvidia rose 2.6 percent after brokerages reiterated their bullish view on the stock. The stock was the biggest boost on the Nasdaq. DuPont Fabros Technology jumped 13 percent to $62.55 after Digital Realty Trust said it would buy the fellow data center operator for an enterprise value of about $7.6 billion. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,671 to 1,003. On the Nasdaq, 1,644 issues rose and 965 fell.

The options market is implying some big moves for the stock as a key event nears. Recent analysts' downgrades, a nearing lock-up expiration date and a rising short interest have created a cloud of negative sentiment around the social media company. "This week we had some underwriters, JPMorgan lowered some numbers, and a few other investment banks are kind of talking down the story a little bit," Dan Nathan of RiskReversal.com said Thursday on CNBC's "Fast Money." On Thursday, Citigroup cited heightened competition as well as concerns over monetization as reasons for the recent downgrade to neutral from buy and a $20 price target. Furthermore, short-sellers are piling in to the stock ahead of its lock-up expiration. "There are a lot of people who have been very pessimistic about this story right out of the gate, having a 30 billion or so market cap, wanting to short it," Nathan said. As Snap's July 30 lock-up expiration and second quarter earnings approach, "the options market is implying about a 25 percent move in either direction," Nathan said. "That's not so crazy when you think about the fact that the stock closed down 21.5 percent after that first quarter they reported last month." However, Nathan noted that "it's really expensive to short the stock, and it's really difficult to buy puts to this because the put premiums are so elevated here, so for the time being unless it gets really overdone on the downside, it seems like a no touch to me." Snap shares closed at $18.85 on Thursday — only about 9 percent higher from its IPO price of $17. The stock was trading near $18 during midafternoon trading Friday.

Liquidation Progress By Published: June 9, 2017 1:06 p.m. ET Share BOSTON, Jun 09, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- JPMorgan China Region Fund, Inc. (‘JFC’ or the ‘Fund’) can now confirm that its entire investment portfolio has now been liquidated and the Fund’s assets are now fully in cash. The Fund has also sought to transfer these assets into USD where possible. The breakdown of the Fund’s cash assets, as at June 8, 2017 were as follows:         Amount         USD Equivalent CNY 88,493,719 13,026,042 EUR 3,995 4,483 GBP 2,424 3,139 HKD 1,552,271 199,083 USD 117,331,494 117,331,494 130,564,240 Any material changes to the JFC’s cash position will be announced as soon as practicable. As described in the proxy statement, JFC assets held through the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (‘QFII’) program may only be repatriated once approved by Chinese regulators, the timing of which is not known. These assets will be held in Renminbi until such time that approval is granted. As a result, stockholders will not receive the net asset value, less liquidation costs, for these assets in the liquidating distribution, and instead will receive an interest in a liquidating trust that is anticipated to make additional distributions to stockholders upon repatriation of amounts under the QFII program. It is intended that proceeds paid in the liquidating distribution by the Fund will be treated as liquidation proceeds for non-US holders. This release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of Fund securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws of such state or jurisdiction. The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company whose shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The Fund trades under the symbol “JFC.” The Fund seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation through investments primarily in equity securities of companies with substantial assets in, or revenues derived from, the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau--collectively, the China Region. JPMorgan Fund Services, in Boston, MA is the Fund’s accounting and administrative agent.

Still, all three major indexes are on track to end the week higher, with focus turning to the Federal Reserve's meeting next week, when the central bank is near certain to raise interest rates. The Dow got a boost from Goldman Sachs' 1.8 percent gain, while a more than 2 percent rise in JPMorgan and Bank of America helped lift the S&P 500. The financial index's 1.7 percent rise topped the gainers among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, followed by a 1.6 percent gain in energy on the back of higher oil prices. The technology sector was off 1.5 percent, led by declines in Microsoft and Apple. The index is on track to fall for the first time in three days. At 12:49 p.m. ET (1649 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 81.28 points, or 0.38 percent, at 21,263.81, the S&P 500 was up 4.45 points, or 0.18 percent, at 2,438.24 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 44.28 points, or 0.7 percent, at 6,277.48. U.S. stocks started the session strong after former FBI Director James Comey's testimony on Thursday was not seen as damaging enough to Donald Trump's presidency. Comey said Trump fired him to undermine an investigation into Russian meddling into last November's U.S. election and while he had no doubt that Russia interfered with the election, he was confident that no votes had been altered. "The market was concerned about the information that Comey will bring and the President has, to a degree, come away clean enough that he will not end up in any sort of impeachment issue," said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenberg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. The market's was concerned that the testimony could derail the Trump administration's push to fulfill its agenda of lower taxes and looser regulations – promises that were partly behind a post-election rally that drove U.S. stocks to record highs. Investors also looked past the UK election, where British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority. Chipmaker Nvidia hit a new record high, before reversing course to trade down 4.5 percent at $152.80 after Citron Research said the stock could trade back to $130. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,918 to 898. On the Nasdaq, 1,716 issues rose and 1,089 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.

Here's how to trade C stock. By Tyler Craig, Tales of a Technician  |  Jun 9, 2017, 8:05 am EDT     Popular Posts: Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Breaking Out. Climb Aboard!

(AMD) Stock Sizzles 3 Breakout Trades in a Nosebleed Market Recent Posts: Citigroup Inc (C) Stock Is an Underappreciated Breakout Buy 3 Chinese Stocks Riding Higher on Alibaba’s Coattails Get Paid While Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Sizzles View All Posts Bank stocks are back, baby. And can I just say, it’s about dang time. The Financial Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) has been dead money for months on end. Yesterday’s 1.15% gain for XLF bested every other sector and helped drive Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) to a new 52-week high. C stock is breaking through major resistance, and opportunity is knocking. Money is finally flocking to financials, and while the focus tends to be on the likes of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), I’d like to focus on the Big Four bank that tends not to get as much headline love: Citigroup. Thursday’s optimism was driven in large part by the House’s passing of legislation designed to roll back many of the banking regulations instituted in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis. While the bill has yet to pass the Senate, there’s no doubt shining a spotlight on the banking sector put trader’s in a buying mood. The pop in XLF appears to have ended its months of indecision. As shown below, the fund was able to launch above the descending trendline that has defined its behavior for the past four months. It also closed above the 50-day moving average for the first time since March. Click to Enlarge Source: OptionsAnalytix   It’s worth noting that the S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSEARCA:KRE) also scored big gains on the day and should deliver further upside. But as interesting as XLF and KRE are, it’s Citigroup that offers the best trade of the bunch. The reason, in short, is relative strength. We can illustrate Citigroup’s muscle flexing a few different ways. First, consider where XLF and C lie in relation to their 52-week highs. Despite Thursday’s rally, the financial SPDR remains 6% below its late-February peak. Citigroup stock, on the other hand, just surged to a new high. Click to Enlarge Source: OptionsAnalytix   Now, if that doesn’t paint the picture, you can always turn to the Comparative Relative Strength (CRS) indicator. As shown in the daily chart of C, its relative strength has been trending higher virtually the entire year and just tagged a new high alongside the stock. Bottom line: If you want to go with the best of breed in financials, Citigroup demands your attention. On the price pattern front, C stock just completed an ascending triangle. The $62.50 ceiling is resistance no longer. The high volume accompanying yesterday’s breakout adds legitimacy to the move increasing the likelihood of the follow-through. C Stock Options The low-volatility fog settling into the marketplace has seeped into bank stocks like Citigroup as well. At 11%, the implied volatility rank for C remains depressed. And that means long premium plays are worth a shot. If you think the stock can climb above $65 over the coming weeks, consider buying the Jul $60/$65 bull call spread for $3. Trade of the Day: Don’t Chase Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Here The max risk is limited to the $3 debit and will be forfeited if the stock sits below $60 at expiration. To minimize the damage, you could exit the position if Citigroup stock breaks back below the $59 support zone. On the reward front, you stand to capture $2 if the stock can rise above $65. By risking $3 to make $2 this spread offers a potential 66.7% return on your money if C stock rises a mere 3% over the next month. As of this writing, Tyler Craig owned bullish positions in XLF and C.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., June 2, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 09 Jun 2017 10:40PM (Updated: 10 Jun 2017 07:03AM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail NEW YORK: Technology stocks sold off sharply on Friday, taking a toll on the Nasdaq and dragging on other major Wall Street indexes, which touched record highs earlier in the day. The technology sector , which soared this year and led the market's rally, finished down 2.7 percent, after paring declines. But financials and energy , which have lagged the broader rally this year, were strong. Energy gained 2.5 percent and financials rose 1.9 percent. "It is a rotation today and it is out of tech into some of the other sectors," said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 113.85 points, or 1.8 percent, to end at 6,207.92.

Apple Inc shares fell 3.9 percent in their biggest daily percentage decline since April 2016 and were the biggest weight on the three major indexes, after a report that iPhones to be launched later this year will use modem chips with slower download speeds than some rival smartphones. Facebook Inc fell 3.3 percent, its biggest decline since November 2016, and Alphabet ended down 3.4 percent, its worst day since June 2016. Microsoft Corp fell 2.3 percent. chipmaker Nvidia closed down 6.5 percent at US$149.60 after Citron Research said the stock could trade back to US$130. Kepner said the combination of the comments on Nvidia and a cautious Goldman Sachs report about tech stocks was leading to a "little air coming out of the balloon." Shares of software company Cloudera also tumbled, shedding 15.6 percent after its quarterly results. sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget "Tech has been on a tear for a very, very long ... time," said John Praveen, managing director for Prudential International Investments Advisers in Newark, New Jersey, adding that investors may be using the Cloudera quarterly results as "an excuse to take some profits." Investors were also digesting major political and economic events this week in the United States and Europe. U.S. stocks had started Friday's session strong after the results of the UK election, in which British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority. Investors also viewed former FBI Director James Comey's testimony on Thursday as not disruptive to the stock market. Market watchers had been concerned that the result of the Congressional hearing could derail President Donald Trump's plans for lower taxes, fiscal spending and looser regulations, which have helped drive the S&P 500 up 13.7 percent since his election. Focus was turning to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, when the U.S. central bank is overwhelmingly expected to raise interest rates. "Markets are probably expecting that the Fed will raise rates, but they will be very gradual in removing monetary accommodation," Praveen said. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 8.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well above the 6.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

 The banks propel Wall Street to record highs Tanya Agrawal, Reuters Jun. 9, 2017, 11:20 AM 547 facebook linkedin twitter email print Traders in the S&P 500 stock index futures pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are showered in confetti December 31, 2004 in Chicago, Illinois. Traders and clerks traditionally toss the confetti at the closing bell to signify the end of the trading year Scott Olson/Getty (Reuters) - U.S. stocks touched record highs in late morning trading on Friday as bank stocks rose, while investors shrugged off the surprise result of the British general election. All three major indexes are on track to end the week higher, with focus turning to the Federal Reserve's meeting next week, where it is widely expected to raise interest rates. Traders are pricing in a 99.6 percent chance of a rate hike, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The Dow got a boost from Goldman Sachs' 1.9 percent gain, while a more than 2 percent rise in shares of both JPMorgan and Bank of America helped lift the S&P 500 index. The financial index's 1.46 percent rise topped the gainers among the major S&P 500 sectors. Investors also looked beyond the UK election, where British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority. May, however, said she would form a new government with assistance from Northern Irish party to provide political certainty. "While Britain is a bit of a hung parliament at this time, it's not so severe that the Conservatives lose all their power so the Brexit conversation could still be a slow, methodical process," said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenberg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. At 10:35 a.m. ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 99.36 points, or 0.47 percent, at 21,281.89 and the S&P 500 was up 11.14 points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,444.93. The Nasdaq Composite was up 19.04 points, or 0.3 percent, at 6,340.81. Investor sentiment also got a boost after former FBI Director James Comey's testimony on Thursday was not seen as damaging enough to Donald Trump's presidency. Comey said Trump fired him to undermine an investigation into Russian meddling into last November's U.S. election and while he had no doubt that Russia interfered with the election, he was confident that no votes had been altered. "The market was concerned about the information that Comey will bring and the President has, to a degree, come away clean enough that he will not end up in any sort of impeachment issue," said Blancato. The market's concern is whether the Trump administration can put the investigation behind it and revive momentum for its agenda of lower taxes and looser regulations. Bets on that agenda are partly behind a rally, which has driven stock indexes to record highs. Chipmaker Nvidia rose 2.6 percent after brokerages reiterated their bullish view on the stock. The stock was the biggest boost on the Nasdaq. DuPont Fabros Technology jumped 13 percent to $62.55 after Digital Realty Trust said it would buy the fellow data center operator for an enterprise value of about $7.6 billion. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,671 to 1,003. On the Nasdaq, 1,644 issues rose and 965 fell.

"Following" : "Follow"}} June 09, 2017 10:42am   Comments Share: Imagine a crowded subway station. It’s rush hour and everyone’s got somewhere to be. There’s a huge clamor to get on the next train. When it does eventually arrive, it’s a free-for-all. Elbows are flying. People need this train. But not everyone can get on. Some get left behind, and can only watch as the lucky souls who managed to get aboard depart the station. This is essentially what happens every time a stock IPOs. When a stock is listed for the first time, investors will often enthusiastically flock to buy shares. But not everyone gets their orders filled at the price they want. In fact, many retail investors have to pay a steep premium if they want in. When Snapchat IPO’d in early March, investor demand drove the stock’s opening price to $24. But, going to back to our analogy for a second, what about the people already on the train? These people were assured that they’d get to their destination, and got to sit back and watch as everyone else desperately tried to get on. That happens with IPOs too. These passengers get the inside track on shares, and get access at the IPO price. In Snapchat’s case, that was $17, or a full 41 percent cheaper than the rest of Wall Street. How Retail Investors Can Get Their Chance But this process is starting to change. Today, startups like SeedInvest and OurCrowd offer equity crowdfunding, allowing investors to potentially get in on a company long before it goes public. There’s also companies like Motif Investing, which has partnered with several banks, including JP Morgan Chase & Co (NYSE: JPM) and Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS) to offer retail investors early access to select IPOs. The IPOs are underwritten by the bank, and then Motif—a brokerage that allows retail investors to invest thematically or with fractional shares—offers the shares on its platform. Partnerships like this have helped to level the playing field for retail investors against Wall Street’s biggest institutions that have traditionally held an edge, according to Motif Investing CFO Paul Schmidt. “[Investors] have not typically had a chance to get a look at these companies at the same time that the large institutional investors do,” said Schmidt. “It democratizes the process. They may not be placing a million dollar order, but they can still come in and invest at the beginning of a company’s public life.” One of the biggest arguments for restricting IPO shares to insiders is stability. Institutions can be subjected to lockup periods, in which they can’t sell their shares for a certain amount of time. This prevents the stock from extraordinary volatility in early trading. But Schmidt said retention on Motif IPOs has been high, and is typically at 80-90 percent depending on the issue. “The typical investor in this is buying it because they want to hold it, and they want to get in on the ground floor,” he said. “I think what that means is that customers actually are looking to actively hold.” Motif has closed five IPOs since the end of 2015, including Arlington Asset Investment Corp (NYSE: AI), Trivago NV - ADR (NASDAQ: TRVG), and G1 Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: GTHX). It currently has six active IPOs on the platform, including bluesphere, a clean power producer, Mota, who sells consumer electronics like drones and wearables, and biotech company Athenex. Schmidt said that the partnership has been so successful for Motif, and investor interest so robust, that they’ve reached out to other underwriters to expand their offerings. “Everyone has interest in big consumer names that they recognize. Those are easy to sell,” he said. “But for our customers, because of the breadth of what they’re doing, there’s deep interest across any sector and any topic.”   Image credit: Wikimedia Commons Posted-In: Motif InvestingFintech IPOs Startups Best of Benzinga © 2017 Benzinga.com.

All three major indexes are on track to end the week higher, with focus turning to the Federal Reserve's meeting next week, where it is widely expected to raise interest rates. Traders are pricing in a 99.6 percent chance of a rate hike, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The Dow got a boost from Goldman Sachs' 1.9 percent gain, while a more than 2 percent rise in shares of both JPMorgan and Bank of America helped lift the S&P 500 index. The financial index's 1.46 percent rise topped the gainers among the major S&P 500 sectors. Investors also looked beyond the UK election, where British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority. May, however, said she would form a new government with assistance from Northern Irish party to provide political certainty. "While Britain is a bit of a hung parliament at this time, it's not so severe that the Conservatives lose all their power so the Brexit conversation could still be a slow, methodical process," said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenberg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. At 10:35 a.m. ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 99.36 points, or 0.47 percent, at 21,281.89 and the S&P 500 was up 11.14 points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,444.93. The Nasdaq Composite was up 19.04 points, or 0.3 percent, at 6,340.81. Investor sentiment also got a boost after former FBI Director James Comey's testimony on Thursday was not seen as damaging enough to Donald Trump's presidency. Comey said Trump fired him to undermine an investigation into Russian meddling into last November's U.S. election and while he had no doubt that Russia interfered with the election, he was confident that no votes had been altered. "The market was concerned about the information that Comey will bring and the President has, to a degree, come away clean enough that he will not end up in any sort of impeachment issue," said Blancato. The market's concern is whether the Trump administration can put the investigation behind it and revive momentum for its agenda of lower taxes and looser regulations. Bets on that agenda are partly behind a rally, which has driven stock indexes to record highs. Chipmaker Nvidia rose 2.6 percent after brokerages reiterated their bullish view on the stock. The stock was the biggest boost on the Nasdaq. DuPont Fabros Technology jumped 13 percent to $62.55 after Digital Realty Trust said it would buy the fellow data center operator for an enterprise value of about $7.6 billion. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,671 to 1,003. On the Nasdaq, 1,644 issues rose and 965 fell.

Since then, it's orchestrated an impressive turnaround. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jun 9, 2017 at 6:28AM Citizens Financial Bank (NYSE:CFG) was spun off from the Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS) in 2014, and the bank is rapidly spreading up and down the East Coast. In this week's episode of Industry Focus: Financials, Motley Fool analyst Gaby Lapera and senior banking specialist John Maxfield dive into what investors need to know about the company. Find out some of the most exciting prospects the bank has going for it, three of most important risk factors that investors should keep an eye on, how Citizens Financial is responding to the digital revolution with things like mobile apps and robo advisors, and more. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on May 26, 2017. Gaby Lapera: Hello, everyone! Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. You're listening to the Financials edition, taped today on Friday, May 26, 2017. My name is Gaby Lapera, and joining me on Skype is John Maxfield, Motley Fool contributor and banking expert. Hey John! How's it going? John Maxfield: It's going great. How are you doing, Gaby? Lapera: Really good. Thanks for joining me on a Friday. This is kind of a little bit last minute. Apparently, there's some studio work being done on June 5th, so the studio will be closed. So our excellent producer, Austin Morgan, managed to squeeze me in on this Friday afternoon. I really appreciate you, too, John, because I asked you about this literally yesterday. Listeners, this is my third show of the week, so I am trying to hold it together. [laughs] Maxfield: You're trying your hardest. Lapera: I'm trying so hard, guys! But, no, I am excited about this show. I think, potentially, I saved the best for last, in terms of my awesome ideas for the podcast this week. And when I say my awesome ideas, I mean your awesome ideas, John. John really wanted to talk about Citizens Financial Group today, and I was like, sure, whatever, I haven't really heard of them. And then I did a bunch of research and I was like, "Wow, this is so interesting." So, I'm very pleased that we will be taking this opportunity to talk about them. Maxfield: Yeah, it really is a good story. To give the listeners some context behind it, I had a chance recently to have a conversation with a few different executives at Citizens Financial on a few different occasions. One of them, and the most substantive and overarching conversation that I had was with Bruce Van Saun, who is their CEO. We talked through what it's been going through over the past few years, what its objectives are going forward, and a whole bunch of stuff that I think investors will find interesting, not only investors in Citizens Financial Group in particular, because there's a lot of interesting dynamics with the story, but even more importantly, it further helps to tease out how to think about banks, well-run banks, banks that are going through transitions and things like that, to give more contexts to people who buy bank stocks. Lapera: Definitely. Let's get straight into the story. Citizens Financial was actually spun off from the Royal Bank of Scotland. The Royal Bank of Scotland is not the most guilt-free financial institution, I guess you could say it that way, going into the financial crisis. Mistakes were made. So, Citizens Financial got spun off. Maxfield: That's right. Citizens Financial was a relatively small bank when a few decades ago the Royal Bank of Scotland purchased it. They invested in it, boosted it up, it grew and grew. It's now one of the largest banks in New England. That's its stronghold. It's based in Providence, Rhode Island, it has $150 billion in assets now. But Royal Bank of Scotland's, like so many other banks during the financial crisis, got into a whole bunch of trouble, making bad loans, making bad decisions strategically. So they had to, in the immediate wake of the crisis, at the direction of regulators, they basically had to shut down growth and just focus on retreating and retrenching, which is not uncommon for banks in the financial crisis. But the position that put Citizens in is that it put it at a really competitive disadvantage against the company like, well, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is in kind of a different place now than it was back then, because they have the whole fake account scandal last year, but Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, these guys were able to continue growing and growing and growing. But Citizens, when it was still a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, it was watching everybody grow, but because of the restrictions on the Royal Bank of Scotland in terms of having to de-risk its balance sheet and shrink as opposed to grow, Citizens Financial was directly impacted by that. Then in 2014, it spun off in an initial public offering, so, it went public, and it was the biggest IPO of a bank in United States history. I can't remember exactly, don't quote me on this exactly, but I think it had something like $120 [billion]-$130 billion in assets when it went public. So, it was already a large bank when it went on to the market. Lapera: Yeah. Being a large bank has advantages and disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is that you're subject to a lot of regulatory stuff. So, they're getting spun out from their parent company and dumped into the world in not a great time for them, because 2014 was when things were starting to turn around and look good for banks. I think a lot of banks were doing OK by then, but Citizens came out in a really tough spot for a bank. Maxfield: Yeah, it absolutely did. I think you can look at that as a glass-half-full, glass-half-empty perspective. When I was talking to Bruce Van Saun, I got the impression that he looks at it as a glass half full, coming from that perspective, and here's why. In the immediate wake of the financial crisis, one of the main things that really hit the banks, you had the subprime mortgage crisis, that hurt banks. But the banks who that really hurt were the ones who securitized those mortgages, and then sold them in securities to other institutional investors, and then in the process of securitizing those and selling those, there were incorrect things said in those documents, or misrepresentations. And that's what caused the losses at these big banks, like Bank of America and Citigroup. But if you look at a lot of the other banks across the country, the thing that really hit them was commercial real estate loans. These are like development loans, so it's just a piece of land that's priced up when the market is doing really well, and then the bank will loan on that, and if the market falls out, there's nothing on that property to act as effective collateral. So, one of the things that the Royal Bank of Scotland forced throughout this entire organization was, I'm not sure they completely stopped making commercial real estate loans, or if they just throttled it significantly, but when Citizens spun out of the Royal Bank of Scotland, it was way behind in commercial real estate loans, way behind in mortgage loans, way behind in all of these other things, which meant that, to a certain extent, there was only one direction to go, and that was up. And we're starting to see that come through right now in Citizens' performance. Lapera: Yeah. The other thing that you mentioned earlier was Van Saun, the CEO. He's kind of been an angel for Citizens Financial. He's really the person who seems to be driving this new culture and new ideas that are helping the bank in their turnaround story. Maxfield: Bruce Van Saun has been an executive at a lot of different major institutions. I talked to Richard Bove, one of the most respected banks analysts in the country. He's a veteran bank analyst, he's been around, he's on CNBC all the time talking about banks, he writes notes to his clients every day and I consider them to be pretty good commentary. When I talked to Richard about this -- he goes by Dick -- when I talked to Dick about this, I asked him what do you think about Bruce Van Saun, and he told me literally that Bruce Van Saun is an excellent banker. Mind you, Dick Bove is someone who doesn't mince words when he doesn't like a bank CEO. So, I consider that to be pretty high praise, and it really did corroborate my thinking, and help to crystallize my thinking on Citizens, and back up what the numbers were saying to me in terms of Citizens' performance. Lapera: Yeah. So, why don't you talk a little bit about some of the stuff that Van Saun has done to improve Citizens' position? Like their recruitment efforts or their tech investments, or stuff like that. Maxfield: OK. So, let me paint a picture with some numbers for you. Last year, Citizens grew its loan book by 7.7%, about 8%. Its peer group average, these are other banks that are a few hundred billion in assets, grew their loans last year by 5.4%. So, it outperformed on loan growth. So, that's an important thing to keep in mind. Another is that the revenue, it makes sense that the revenue would grow fast, because the main product that a bank sells is loans, and if you're selling more loans, your revenue is going to go up. Their revenue last year rose by 8.9% versus 5.4% for the average competitor. Then, the efficiency ratio, which we talk about all the time in the context of banking on this show, which tells you the percent of revenue that a bank spends on operating expenses, it fell by 376 basis points, so by 3.76%. I think it's now starting to close in on that 60% threshold that banks strive for. So, if you look at those three metrics, which are probably the most important metrics when you're analyzing a bank's performance, it had a really, really good year. So, the question is, as a general rule, and I think this is a good way to think about things as an investor, and to think about things in general, to think about general rules and exceptions -- this is actually how lawyers are taught to think. The general rule in the case of loan growth is you want loan growth to be robust. But, any time that loan growth outperforms the peer group average, you have to look at that askance. Because the general rule is that loan growth that is too fast is concerning, because it means that you're going out and making loans maybe to people who shouldn't be getting them. Lapera: And, for listeners who are a little bit newer to banking, every time a bank makes a loan, you have underwriters who check to see, how risky is this person, are they likely to pay back their debt? During the financial crisis of 2008, banks were not very strict at underwriting, and you saw what happened. So, that's the concern when you see super rapid loan growth. Do you think that's what's happening here with Citizens? Maxfield: To your question, Gaby, your original question was, talk about the things they're doing and investments they've made. I think its rapid loan growth is more a function of not necessarily reducing the underwriting standards, which is what you're referring to, and I was referring to in that general rule. It's more about the fact that it was so under-concentrated in these loan groups relative to other banks that it had a ton of upward momentum that was just waiting for it to take advantage of. Lapera: Real quick, the loan groups that you're talking about are the commercial real estate and regular home loans, right? Maxfield: Right. Commercial real estate is one of the main ones, home loans is another one. Basically, what Citizens did is, once it spun off from the Royal Bank of Scotland, and it had more operational flexibility to make investments in the business, and to grow as opposed to contract, what they did is went out and almost doubled their staff of mortgage officers. If you're going to double your staff, the number of people who are your loan officers, then you should expect to grow a lot faster. And, they're going out and recruiting loan officers that deal with larger companies from other banks. And those loan officers from these other banks that have these large accounts are bringing those accounts over. So, when you start to put all those pieces together, you start to say, "Oh, OK, it makes sense now, that its loan book is growing faster than its other book." And it makes sense for reasons other than the fact that whether a bank is or is not manipulating the underwriting standards. Lapera: Let's talk a little bit about some of the tech investments that they've made. Maxfield: We talked about tech investments a few shows back, I feel like it was about a month ago. Just to add some context around this, right now the bank industry is going through a very significant shift toward digital banking. So, the banks that are going to survive into the future, 10-50 years down the road, have got to navigate this digital transformation effectively in order to make it. So, keep in mind that that's a really important context. There are a number of different ways and technologies that a bank needs to pursue in order to navigate the digital divide, one of which is just having an effective digital app, a presence online, an effective digital app that provides really good customer experience, that's something that Citizens has invested in. Another thing is cloud computing. Cloud computing reduces the costs of storing customer data and accessing that data and using it for analytical purposes to grow your business in the future. There's also another thing that Citizens Financial has gotten into more recently, in fact, I was just talking to the head of their wealth management recently about this, they are pushing into the robo advisory space, which is basically an algorithmic program that manages your investments, and these things are just blowing up. You have Wealthfront, Betterment, Schwab has gone into the space, Vanguard has gone into the space, Bank of America is coming into the space, everyone is moving into the space because it's such an inexpensive way to serve these customers. It's also getting into big data analytics, that's something that Bruce Van Saun noted in his most recent letter. Big data analytics, what that allows you to do is look across your customer base, determine which customers have the right products and which don't, and then make a tailored pitch to those customers who don't have the right products but maybe need an additional one, and tease out why that would help them financially. It's a multifront war that banks are fighting, and Citizens is on the vanguard of that. Lapera: Question for you, because, you're right, banks are trying to deal with all these things and update their services to match this digital world. Do you think that Citizens is trying to get into too much at once? Or do you think this really makes sense for them? Maxfield: I think, as they would say in contract law, time is of the essence. With the millennial generation that has grown up with technology in their pocket, and they expect that experience, to be able to do whatever they want on their phone, and when you add on top of that the high switching costs that have traditionally been in the banking space, now, switching costs could change going forward, but assuming that they don't, if they don't change, if these banks are not providing these top-notch digital products to these millennials, they will just go elsewhere and they'll just stay at those banks forever. So, these investments have to be made right now. It's a non-optional thing for banks. To a certain extent, it would be nice if a bank like Citizens didn't have to throw so much money at these things simultaneously. But I don't think that's an option for them. Lapera: OK, totally fair. That brings me to my next point, which is, they're investing all this money, they're growing, their story is, in theory, a turnaround story, they're on the upswing. But if someone is thinking about investing in this bank, there are some things they probably want to watch out for. For me, we were talking earlier about the rapid loan growth. That's something that I would want to keep an eye on to make sure that doesn't change from "We have a lot of room to grow in this area" to "Our underwriting processes are slowly getting worse and worse and worse." Maxfield: Right. And just because I think Citizens Financial is on the right track, and it looks to me like everything is going well, and it looks to me like given the fact that their stock is trading below book value and their trajectory of their earnings and growth, that it looks like a compelling opportunity to me -- I will tell you that the one thing that I learned last year when that Wells Fargo scandal came out is that you're never sure. That really shocked me, that Wells Fargo scandal. I had an immense amount of respect for John Stumpf, and the way they ran that bank, and the way they'd run that bank for 160 years. You can never know for sure with these institutions. So, that should always stay in the back of people's minds, whether it's JPMorgan Chase, even with a guy as incredible as Jamie Dimon, or whether that's Wells Fargo or Citigroup. You should always be suspicious, and innately have that in the back of your head.  Lapera: Yeah. We should rename this show The Paranoid Investor. [laughs]  Maxfield: [laughs] Exactly. Only the paranoid investors survive. I think that's what Andy Grove, the former Intel CEO, that was his philosophy. Lapera: What were you going to say, though, the other thing? Maxfield: The other thing, Gaby, you and I talked about this earlier, Citizens Financial has had some bumps in the road. The most recent bump in the road concerns its so-called Citizens checkup program. The Citizens checkup program is pretty basic. What Citizens wants its employees to do is reach out to their customers. Citizens is now investing in this data analytics program. Now they want to reach out to these customers whose portfolio of financial products may not be ideal for these individuals. We all accumulate a new account here and a new account there, and then you get to 40 and you're like, "Why do I have all these random accounts? $15 here, $10 here, I thought this was a good idea but I could really use this or that." Basically, what Citizens Financial wants its employees to do is reach out to these customers, set up appointments to either call them on the phone or come into a branch, and have a "financial checkup," kind of like a doctor checkup. The problem that Citizens Financial employees ran into, allegedly, according to an article in The Wall Street Journal from earlier this year, is that they couldn't either get ahold -- because we all know what sales calls are like, because that's basically how someone would interpret these -- Lapera: Yeah, I would definitely hang up on that. Maxfield: Exactly. Or you wouldn't pick up the phone, right? Lapera: No, not at all. Maxfield: So, the problem they ran into was everybody was doing that. So, they're being told, "Make all these appointments," but they were having problems. Again, these are all allegations from The Wall Street Journal, so keep that in mind, these are just allegations. So, what these employees allege, and I think there are roughly a dozen employees that were used as sources for this story, what they alleged is that they would then, to make sure they kept their jobs, they would make up these fake appointments and say someone came in, or hadn't come in, or had cancelled, or whatever it was. So, they were inflating the number of appointments that they actually had. That's not a good thing. So, No. 1, I think we need to be clear, that is not a good thing. But, let me say this. If you compare those allegations at Citizens to what happened at Wells Fargo, which is the natural analogy that anyone is going to draw right now, there's two points to make. No. 1, in the wake of the Wells Fargo scandal, it was a deluge of information in the media from other Wells Fargo employees who came out and said, "Not only were we doing this, and all these other people were doing it and all these other people were doing it," and leak and leak and leak came out about it, but also, Wells Fargo was mistreating its employees at the same time, by firing them, or demoting them, or in some way impacting their employment in a negative way because they tried to bring the scandal to light. That just hasn't been the case at Citizens. After that initial Wall Street Journal article, you haven't seen anything in the media about this. Which leads me to believe that this was not even close to as widespread as the Wells Fargo scandal. Lapera: Yeah. And honestly, making up that I made a meeting with someone is very different from opening a fake account in their name and having people be potentially charged fees because they don't know this account exists. But, there is something to think about there, and something to keep an eye on. Just keep an eye on the story, A, and B, when stuff like this happens, regulatory bodies tend to start taking more interest in your bank, which can lead to increased cost. The CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, may have a couple tentacles out there looking at Citizens Financial, and that's something that you want to watch in the future. So, the rapid loan growth, the potential for this checkup story to blow up a little bit more, and the regulatory issues that might surround that. And I think that the third thing that you wanted to bring up was the change in the control of executive payment. This is basically a golden parachute. We talked a lot about this during -- I didn't personally, but people talked a lot about this during the financial crisis, which is this idea that CEOs could bail and take a huge package of money with them, even though the company is failing. Maxfield: Right. That is factually accurate, what you're saying. But it's not so much about if the company is failing so much in itself. I mean, a company could be doing really well, and it could be acquired, and there's going to be a lot more concentration in the banking industry going forward, so there's going to be a lot of acquisitions. And a bank like Citizens is either going to be an acquirer or an acquiree. Lapera: Those are the two options. [laughs]  Maxfield: [laughs] Exactly. But, if you're an acquiree, in a case where you have change of control that trigger payments to executives -- let's say Citizens were to be purchased by another bank, that could trigger a large payment for some of its executives. There are reasons that companies put these change of control payments in, and the explanation they provide is that they do so in order to disincentivize hostile takeovers, because it makes a hostile takeover much more expensive to complete. But the fact of the matter is, again, thinking in general rules in the context of general rules and exceptions, as a general rule, change of control payments like this, at least in my opinion, and this is how I've always interpreted it, and I feel like this is consistent with our philosophy at The Motley Fool, it's that those, as a general rule, are not investor-friendly mechanisms through which to protect against a hostile takeover. Lapera: No. This is exactly why your average citizen thinks of a banker as a fat cat smoking a cigar, and not just a person. And this is something that Citizens has done recently. I believe they addressed it a little bit in a call transcript somewhere. But, it's just something to keep an eye out for, because when stuff like that starts happening, you want to see if anything might come of it. So, I think those are the big three things: the rapid loan growth, the checkup stories, and this golden parachute thing that they have constructed. Maxfield: That's right. Let me say one thing. You can find this information about any company in their proxy filing, which you can get on the SEC's EDGAR website. Lapera: If you don't know how to do that, shoot me an email at industryfocus@fool.com and I will tell you how to do that. Maxfield: Yeah. Also shoot Gaby an email if you guys are interested in, I wrote a really comprehensive piece on the Citizens' turnaround that walks through all the things that Bruce and I talked about. Send Gaby an email if you're interested in that. And let me close, because I know we're running out of time, with one final thought. Even though we just covered those concerns, and those should be on investors' minds, this comes across as a bank that has a ton of positive potential in the future. And most of the things that I have seen lead me to believe that it's an executive team that has the experience and the integrity to deliver that to shareholders. Now, that doesn't mean it's 100% a winner. But at least in my mind, this looks like a very compelling opportunity. Lapera: And after having said that, I think it's the perfect time to say, as usual, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Especially for today's episode. Try and think critically. If you want to keep talking about Citizens, feel free to shoot us an email, like I said, industryfocus@fool.com, or by tweeting us @MFIndustryFocus. Austin, thank you so much for putting up with me three times this week! Austin Morgan: I got you. Maxfield: [laughs] It's been a long week for Austin.  Lapera: [laughs] Austin is a star. I want everyone to know that. I'm going to make him a cake one day. All right, that's it for everyone. I hope everyone has a really great week! I'm out. Gaby Lapera owns shares of JPMorgan Chase. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

Traders are watching a trend that could become part of a bigger market rotation. Financials and small caps were the outperformers Thursday. Patti Domm | @pattidomm 19 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Why is Fed getting so 'aggressive' now?    Tuesday, 6 Jun 2017 | 6:07 AM ET | 02:12 The next potential turning point for markets is the upcoming Fed meeting, and it could become the catalyst for a market that's been going nowhere. Julian Emanuel, UBS equity and derivatives strategist, said there were early signs both Thursday and Wednesday of a possible turn coming in the market, and that could continue to get more clear, depending on the Fed, when it releases its statement next Wednesday. "The Fed is coming and for us the Fed holds the potential to catalyze a reversion trade that we started to see in the last couple of days, with the financials trading as strong as they have been," said Emanuel. The S&P financial sector was up 1.1 percent Thursday, and 1.6 percent on the week. Goldman Sachs was up 1.4 percent Thursday, and JPMorgan Chase was up 1.2 percent. "It could well be if the Fed is perceived to be less dovish — or more hawkish — than the market thinks then you could get what we think was, in the last two days, the start of a rotation back into the financials and that could move out into other cyclical areas," he said, noting beaten down energy could be one of groups benefiting. He pointed to small caps, up sharply Thursday as another group participating in a possible rotation. But the broader indices may not be big movers as the rotation gets underway. For example, the S&P 500 was up less than a point at 2,433 Thursday, but the small cap Russell 2000 rose 1.3 percent to 1,415. S&P futures were slightly higher Friday. The loser would be utilities, now down 1.2 percent for the week but up 3 percent in the last month, as bond yields fell and investors looked for yield. A key to the rotation would be the Fed confirming that the economy is picking up after a sluggish first quarter and a string of weaker-than-expected data points in the second quarter. In that environment, the FANG and other tech stocks could continue to do well but financials could move up to a leadership role. Friday's markets promise to be quiet, after an event-filled Thursday which included testimony from former FBI Director James Comey. There was also a meeting of the European Central Bank and more dovish talk from ECB President Mario Draghi. The U.K. also held a national election, where Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its majority. The pound was slammed but U.K. and other European stock markets were steady. "The Comey testimony has come and gone and the market is yawning, as it's yawning with everything else. … The market's reaction tells you that investors dismissed it completely," said Emanuel. Comey's testimony, released Wednesday ahead of the hearing, was viewed favorably since traders didn't see that it implicated the president for obstructing the Russia investigation and he was not a target of the investigation. But it also left unanswered questions and the investigation continues, leaving a cloud of doubt over the market. Markets have been concerned Congress and the White House will be too preoccupied with the investigation to push tax reform and other stimulus programs. "We will have to see how the next several weeks unfold before we can figure that out. What we want to see is a renewed discussion on elements of tax reform," said Emanuel. In the bond market, yields stayed in a tight range before and after Comey testified Thursday. The 10-year was at 2.19 percent in late trading. "It seems to me this is not going away, and as long as you don't have a focus on legislative priorities, it's difficult to make a case that this resolves anything," said Aaron Kohli, director of fixed income strategy at BMO. Kohli said the market is still anticipating a very dovish Fed. While fed funds futures point to a rate hike next week, there is just about a 20 percent chance of a September interest-rate hike. The Fed has forecast two rate hikes, but the markets have dismissed the potential for a second one this year after disappointing jobs data and weak inflation. CPI consumer inflation data is reported next Wednesday morning, as the Fed meets. Friday's calendar is quiet with just wholesale trade, reported at 10 a.m. ET.

To make matters worse, most of those people tried it once and then went back to cards and cash. “There are three factors right now limiting mobile payment adoption: Value proposition, lack of ubiquity, and fear,” Daniel Csoka, managing director of Mobile Money Matters, told Digital Trends. “What is the value proposition for me to make a mobile payment? My credit card works just fine.” “It needs to work everywhere, every time.” Respondents to the PYMNTS survey agree. They consistently gave satisfaction with their current payment methods as the main reason for not using mobile wallets, followed by uncertainty over how it works, and security concerns. If you’ve tried mobile payments yourself, then you’ll understand the issue. It’s often faster to slip a card from your wallet and insert or swipe than it is to pull your phone out, unlock it, and complete your purchase. You also have to consider whether the technology is supported at the checkout. The last thing you want to do is get to the register and discover that the terminal won’t accept your payment method. “It needs to work everywhere, every time,” Csoka said. “That’s why my card works so well, because it always works everywhere. We still don’t have ubiquity on mobile payments — some are NFC, some are QR codes, Apple Pay can’t talk to Android Pay, and with all these different payments sources, the merchant has to decide what to support.” Outside of major cities, you’ll find it difficult to get by on mobile payments alone, and even in cities you’re generally limited to larger businesses. Only 36 percent of the merchants surveyed by J.P. Morgan Chase recently accept digital wallets today, but a surprising 69 percent of merchants expect to be accepting most of their payments using a digital wallet within five years. Interestingly, only 41 percent of consumers think they’ll be making most of their payments via mobile in five years. “This is no different from when debit cards were introduced,” Ben Colvin, senior vice president of North America Security Solutions and Processing at Mastercard, told Digital Trends. “Consumers want to feel the means with which they’re paying is safe, but more, that they’re confident it will work.” That confidence will surely build through experience, though progress looks to be much slower than many predicted. Even if the technology works and it’s available in most places, folks still need a compelling reason to change their habits. “People are asking: Is it better than what I’m doing today?” Colvin said. “That usually becomes, ‘is it easier or quicker, or do I feel safer using it?’” The security issue for mobile payments is an interesting one. There’s a general fear that mobile payments may be insecure, but it’s tied to personal information. A Mastercard survey found that 77 percent of Americans are anxious about their financial information and social security numbers being stolen or compromised, and 55 percent said they would rather have naked pictures of themselves leaked online than have their financial data stolen. Concerns about identity theft and loss of funds are understandable, but they may be misplaced when it comes to mobile. “A mobile payment transaction is safer than a card transaction.” “A mobile payment transaction is safer than a card transaction,” Csoka said. “It’s like the early days of online payments, no one wanted to put their credit card online because they were worried hackers were going to steal it. We’re seeing that same trepidation with mobile payments.” Since Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Android Pay are all pass-through technologies, that allow you to add and use cards, if you wanted to dispute a transaction, then you would take it up with the card issuer. Your smartphone potentially adds extra layers of security because you must be in possession of the device and it has built-in location tracking, there’s also biometric authentication via fingerprint or iris scanning, and there’s scope for behavioral analysis. “With behavioral biometrics, you can get that additional level of authentication without the consumer realizing it – creating a truly frictionless experience,” Colvin explains. Mastercard recently acquired NuData, a security firm that draws on session and biometric information to analyze online, mobile app, and smartphone interactions, so it can distinguish authentic users from fraudsters and flag high-risk transactions. In security terms, this kind of technology could make life for criminals very difficult indeed. It also has implications for convenience. One day soon, we may be able to walk into stores, pick up what we want and leave without swiping or tapping anything. Csoka envisions a near future where our smartphones add value for merchants and consumers, and the shopping experience is “Uberized”. Picture this, if you will: You drive to the mall and use your mobile app to get access to special VIP parking, because you’re a valued shopper. The mall now knows that you’ve arrived and Brooks Brothers sends you a notification that the blue blazer you were looking at online is in stock. You use indoor maps on your mobile to locate the store and, as you approach, a beacon informs the sales staff that you’ve arrived. There’s no register, but the assistant has an iPad and your photo and profile automatically pops up with details on what you want. They have the blazer ready, but also point out a buy-one-get-one-free deal on matching shirts. You try the blazer on, decide to take it along with the shirts, and simply walk out. The receipt is emailed to you. This is personalized shopping, done in the cloud, and authenticated by your phone and store profile. “Effective loyalty and offers combined with customer engagement, all surrounded by the fact that this is more secure than a credit card — that’s the winning combination,” says Csoka. You’d be forgiven for having privacy concerns. The kind of system Csoka is talking about would require you to opt-in and agree to be tracked, though you might be surprised at the level of smartphone tracking that already goes on. Using a combination of apps and beacons, some companies already map your journey around a store, and they can tell if you spent ten minutes in front of that new LG OLED TV. The companies that are vying for a slice of mobile payments have some good reasons for doing so. It’s not just about the bottom line. Walmart may be able to save on interchange fees with its own payment system – interchange fees are charged by card issuers and average 2 percent of transaction value in U.S. – but the data might be even more valuable to them. “If I use my card they only know how much I spent, but they want to know what I bought,” says Csoka. We know that tech giants like Google are drawing enormous value from big data, and so the battle for our mobile payments will rage on. But, while the value for merchants and payment providers isn’t that hard to see, the value for us is still not so clear. The idea of ditching the physical wallet and having all our cards, including loyalty cards, on our phones is undeniably attractive for many of us, but it’s not enough. Even when mobile payment systems are ubiquitous, we’re confident that they work, and we’re convinced of their safety, providers are still going to have to persuade us to choose them over plastic, and the biggest stumbling block right now is convenience.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it June 8 at 8:07 PM TELECOMMUNICATIONS Yahoo shareholders approve Verizon sale Yahoo shareholders approved the $4.48 billion sale of the company’s main Web properties to Verizon Communications on Thursday, clearing the last major hurdle for a deal announced almost a year ago. Yahoo said in a statement that it expects to hand over its Web assets to Verizon on Tuesday, June 13. The transaction has been delayed by revelations of massive privacy breaches and a reduction in the price from $4.8 billion. Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer agreed to the sale last year after a four-year turnaround effort failed to stem a slide in advertising revenue. Verizon plans to use Yahoo’s Web audience to push deeper into content and expand beyond its central business of connecting people to the Internet, cable channels and their smartphones. Yahoo will become part of a new Verizon unit called Oath. The division will also incorporate businesses Verizon added when it bought AOL in 2015. Yahoo, to be renamed Altaba, will keep its most valuable assets: stakes in China’s Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan worth more than $40 billion. — Bloomberg News INSURANCE INDUSTRY Berkshire units settle over workers’ comp Two insurance units of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway have each agreed to lower rates and provide more disclosures to settle claims that they overcharged California small-business owners for workers’ compensation coverage. The settlement announced Thursday by the state’s Department of Insurance resolves charges that Applied Underwriters and California Insurance steered prospective customers to unapproved or costly policies using “illegal side agreements” that exposed policyholders to greater risks. California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones halted the Berkshire units’ sale of unapproved “EquityComp” policies last June after finding that one policy subjected Shasta Linen Supply, a Sacramento employer of 63 people, to hundreds of thousands of dollars of extra costs. Vermont and Wisconsin regulators enacted bans of similar products in those states. Thursday’s settlement allows the resumption of EquityComp sales in California, provided that companies can absorb their risks, Jones said in a statement. — Bloomberg News Also in Business Buoyed by higher stock prices, Americans’ household net worth rose 1.4 percent to $94.8 trillion in the first three months of this year, a trend that could support future spending. The Federal Reserve said Thursday that U.S. stock and mutual fund portfolios jumped $1.3 trillion in value in the January-to-March quarter. Home values rose by $499 billion. Total household wealth includes checking and savings accounts, and subtracts mortgages and other debt. JPMorgan Chase’s chief operating officer, Matt Zames, once viewed as a potential successor to chief executive Jamie Dimon, has decided to leave after 13 years at the bank. “Matt has worked tirelessly across many disciplines to help make us a better company,” Dimon, 61, said in a memo to staffers. Zames was named co-chief operating officer in July 2012 in the wake of JPMorgan’s London Whale trading debacle. Dimon didn’t say why Zames, 46, is leaving or if he will be replaced. His duties are being split among other top executives, the memo said. A new coal mine that President Trump mentioned in announcing plans to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord has officially opened in southwest Pennsylvania. The Acosta Mine will supply coal used in making steel and is expected to generate up to 100 full-time jobs. Corsa Coal said it decided in August to open the mine after a steel industry boom drove up prices for metallurgical coal. Pennsylvania awarded a $3 million grant for the project. Honda plans to have highly automated personal cars on the road by 2025, the automaker said.

Quotes in the article Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA ▼ 139.44 -2.90 -2.04% Bank of America Corporation BAC ▲ 23.67 +0.70 +3.05% While BAC stock rallied 33% between the election of President Donald Trump and early March, it has pulled back 12% in the meantime as every aspect of Trump’s agenda has hit a headwind. Reports from a week ago that Q2 trading revenue was down on a year-over-year basis — as was the case with JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and others — certainly didn’t help the bullish case either. All of those are sideshow, though. The main event is (still) going to play out over the course of this year, and it bodes bullishly for Bank of America. Interest Rates Make a World of Difference All the other facets have been interesting, but they all pale in comparison to the proverbial big Kahuna that owners of BAC stock should have their eye on. That’s interest rates, which should ratchet higher to the tune of 25 basis points when the Federal Reserve gets a chance to put such a change in place on the 14th. As of the most recent look, traders are betting — with actual money — there’s a 98% chance we will indeed see such a rate increase. 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $10 Investors who’ve been keeping close tabs on the bond market may well know, however, that interest rates have been falling of late. Since late December, 30-year Treasury yields have peeled back from 3.18% to 2.85%, while 10-year government bond yields have slipped from a March peak of 2.61% to 2.2% now. In both cases, the interest rates are still in a broad downtrend. That’s not how it’s supposed to be. Load Error Not only did the FOMC impose a quarter-point rate hike in March, traders are (literally) betting on at least another rate hike in June, and they’re leaning on at least one more bump-up in interest rates later in 2017. The general consensus outside of the Fed-funds futures market is two more increases in interest rates this year. Nevertheless, market-driven interest rates are tumbling when they shouldn’t be, and it’s the prevailing interest rates that make banking more or less profitable. In general, the higher interest rates are, the greater the spread, or difference, between a bank’s borrowing costs and its lending revenue. Indeed, BofA threw out some detailed numbers that end last year suggesting 100 basis points worth of higher interest rates could add $6 billion worth of income to Bank of America’s annual bottom line. For perspective, the bank earned $16.2 billion last year; the potential for earnings growth is significant. It wasn’t empty rhetoric either. When market rates soared late last year in anticipation of this year’s rate hikes, it led to a 43% year-over-year increase in the company’s Q4 income. A huge chunk of that growth was attributable to higher interest rates. Not Panning Out? Not So Fast. In that light, the fact that interest rates have fallen in the meantime is understandably concerning to BAC stock holders. So what gives? The disconnect is what can and does happen when traders are left to their own devices. When the Fed Funds ticked higher by 25 basis points in December (with at least a couple more penciled in for 2017), the market took that ball and ran a little too far with it. The pullback in yields since then is merely a correction of an overzealous move. Not even March’s subsequent rate-hike from the Fed was enough to halt the corrective move in its tracks. That may not be the case with the next increase in interest rates though, the first of which could materialize in the middle of this month. For better or worse, traders have the habit of preemptively and excessively reacting to change. It became clear late last year that a series of rate hikes this year was not only likely, but necessary. The plans were for a slow-and-steady imposition of rate increases though, and not the sudden, all-in-one-shot increases the bond market tried to put in place in November and December. More often than not, traders learn their lesson. While we can never rule anything out, from here, the market’s interest rates should more or less mirror the direction of the Fed’s foundational interest rates. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is the REAL E-Commerce Giant In other words, look for roughly 50 basis points worth of higher market rates as this year progresses. That’ll be huge for BofA. Bottom Line for BAC Stock It’s admittedly tough to get excited about Bank of America from here. Even if interest rates reverse they’re downtrend — and there’s no absolute guarantee they will — there’s still the dark cloud of diminished trading revenue hanging over investors’ heads. Where’s the growth? Patience. The growth is brewing. The Fed’s plans to crank up interest rates this year are in response to an economy that’s finally reaching escape velocity. Though it may not feel like it at times, as a whole, the picture is looking brighter — the Fed’s chiefs know what they see. That economic growth should not only rekindle interest in investing, but also prod the borrowing that banks thrive. BAC stock is still a healthy play for those who can look beyond one day’s headlines. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Picked in May as the interim regulator of federally-chartered banks, Noreika has had to recuse himself from overseeing 80 banks, law firms, private equity firms, and consulting firms, according to a letter released by the OCC late Friday. Noreika, who used to represent banks at two large law firms, will have to recuse himself form overseeing banks until as late as next May. Among the companies he can’t oversee are Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, KKR, law firm Paul Weiss, and student lender Sallie Mae. Noreika makes $165,300 a year as acting director.

British Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to hold a snap election backfired as the Conservative Party lost its majority in the U.K. parliament. While it remains the largest party, the Conservatives will now have to rely on other parties to pass motions through parliament. The British pound fell sharply with the news of the result, dropping 2 percent against the dollar on Friday morning and down 1.7 percent against the euro. London’s FTSE 100, however, opened with a 0.9 percent rise, the BBC reported. Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week Nigel Green, the chief executive of financial services firm deVere Group, said the election had put May’s job on the line and produced “yet another enormous storm cloud of uncertainty.” “We’re entering into a perfect storm of chaos and the uncertainty is set to unleash mayhem across global financial markets, at least in the short term, as they react to the growing question marks hanging over the British parliamentary landscape,” said Green in an emailed statement. Read more: Everything you need to know about the U.K.'s shock election result The result of the election —which May called in April with the goal of increasing her parliamentary majority—comes less than two weeks before Britain enters crucial talks with European Union leaders regarding the U.K.’s exit from the political and economic union. Protester wearing a Theresa May mask poses outside Downing Street after Britain's election in London, Britain on June 9. The election result could have wide-ranging ramifications on the U.K. leaving the EU. Neil Hall/Reuters Some business chiefs and investors are suggesting that the result could derail the negotiation process, while others predict that it will result in a softer Brexit, perhaps with the U.K. remaining in the customs union. The most obvious conclusion of the election is “the likelihood of the U.K. needing to request a delay in the Brexit process has risen substantially, given the chance that political developments in the U.K. disturb what is already a time-compressed process,” said Malcolm Barr, economist at JPMorgan, in a research note reported by Reuters. The British Prime Minister triggered Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union on March 29, starting a two-year process by the end of which the U.K. is supposed to have extricated itself from the EU. Liberal Democrat former business secretary Vince Cable, who was elected to his southwest London constituency of Twickenham, said young people “who felt cheated out of their future because of the Brexit vote” had made a point in the election. “This means we will have to look at this again as Brexit is approached and the extreme-UKIP type of Brexit this government has put on the cards,” said Cable. UKIP is a right-wing British party that campaigned to leave the EU. Adam Marshall, the director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said a functioning government must be the “immediate priority,” but suggested that Brexit talks would likely suffer a delay. “No business would walk into a negotiation without clear objectives, an agreed starting position, and a strong negotiating team. It is hard to see how Brexit negotiations could begin without answers on these important questions,” said Marshall.

David Santiago Miami Herald Founder and CEO Della Heiman talks about her version behind the Miami culinary incubator, The Wynwood Yard. David Santiago Miami Herald Business June 09, 2017 6:49 AM Pass the chili paste, try a schnitzel: Food startups serve new concepts at pitch event By Jennifer Lu jlu@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Argentinian-Israeli schnitzel and falafel, Korean rice bowls topped with beef in red chili paste, rotisserie chicken served in an Amsterdam ambiance, a black tea blend dubbed KickAssam — these are some of the flavors that four aspiring local food startups hope to bring to the Miami food scene. The entrepreneurs presented their business plans and brands to potential investors and business mentors in a “Shark Tank” setting on Wednesday evening at the Miami culinary incubator, The Wynwood Yard. The event was the brainchild of restauranteur and Wynwood Yard founder Della Heiman, who wanted to create networking opportunities in the culinary business world akin to those she saw in Miami’s booming tech sector. “Food and beverage startups don’t necessarily get a lot of love,” said Adrienne Etkin Nascimento, who pitched her company, Admari Tea, at the event. “The fact that Della has taken this initiative is brilliant.” “We wanted to promote hyper-local ventures that are based from our communities and reflect the fabric of our culture that is Miami today,” said Heiman, who opened her restaurant, della test kitchen, at the Yard in November 2015 and leases space in the lot to new local food trucks. Although no one was designated the winner, she said, “the magic happens as people start to connect and network.” Nascimento, who has 10 years of tea retail experience and mixes her own blends, said she was looking for mentoring and advice in addition to the financial backing to open a tea boutique and to produce her ready-to-drink line of “liquid meditation” in a bottle. [READ MORE: How millennial tastes shape a new generation of food startups] Entrepreneurship can be a lonely path, Nascimento said. “Sometimes, it’s hard to get your head out of your passion and into the business sense of things.” Miami is home to 560 new entrepreneurs for every 100,000 adults in any given month, according to the 2017 Kauffman Index of Startup Activity, beating out Austin, Los Angeles, San Diego and Las Vegas for the top position on the startup index. There were just shy of 40,000 restaurants in Florida in 2015, according to the National Restauraunt Association, providing over one million food service jobs in 2017. Food is one of the easiest ways for property developers to stimulate a sense of place and community, said Joe Furst of Goldman Properties, who provided feedback to entrepreneurs at the event. Furst was joined on the advisory panel by representatives from Terra Group, EDENS, The Comras Company and The Knight Foundation. Miami made and J.P. Morgan Chase sponsored the event. “When you put together a mix of creative food and beverage professionals,” Furst said, “you create exciting communities that people want to be a part of.” However, for aspiring food and beverage startups, access to initial capital and the right location can be huge obstacles to entering the restaurant business. Coco Coig pitched in search of a seventh investor to round out support for his startup, Le Chick Rotisserie. Five weeks from opening in the Wynwood area, Coig and his business partner have secured a landlord and permission to replicate the ambiance and menu he enjoyed at a popular Amsterdam bar and restaurant chain. Brothers Alan and Bernie Klinger came to promote Shnitz n’ Fritz. For the past six months, they have been selling Argentinian-Israeli style schnitzel, falafel and fries from a food truck at The Wynwood Yard. They want to expand to a brick and mortar store with more kitchen space so they can add healthier items to their menu, as well as display and sell their bottled sauces and spreads. “To do any hot food concept, the entry fee is high,” Alan Klinger said. “Maybe some of these property owners have restaurant ready spaces we could go into and make minor modifications.” Chain restaurants tend to get first dibs on the hottest properties because they have more access to funding, he said. As a result, “there’s a lot of local concepts here that remain untapped.” Jennifer Kaminski and Sarah Raw, of 2 Korean Girls, founded their company to fill a void in South Florida they have griped about and bonded over: the lack of satisfying local Korean food. Their business plan, which would take their concept to the trial-by-food-truck phase, sells bibimbap, a Korean meat and vegetable dish that literally means “mixed rice.” They emphasized two important aspects of their brand: health and authenticity. “Korean food was healthy before being healthy was cool,” Raw said. And they have Kaminski’s mother, Sunny, who owns a Korean restaurant in Indiana and has a line of sauces and mixes at Whole Foods, to ensure authenticity. Pitching their concept at the Yard was the first time they’d shared 2 Korean Girls with anyone outside of family and friends, Kaminski said. “Now it feel like it’s become more real.” A view of the bar at The Wynwood Yard on Wednesday, June 7, 2017 in Miami.

(Michael Brochstein/Sipa USA/TNS) Renae Merle, the Washington Post Jun 9, 2017 at 8:31 pm | Print View Goldman Sachs faced a looming deadline in July. Under new federal rules, the storied Wall Street bank was required to rid itself of about $6 billion in risky investments, such as stakes in hedge funds, that regulators fear could hamper it during an economic downturn. But by late last year, Goldman had yet to find a buyer and appealed to the Federal Reserve for a reprieve. The agency gave Goldman and several other banks five more years to comply with the rules put in place in response to the 2008 financial crisis. Now, it appears, Goldman may be able to keep those investments after all. Republican lawmakers passed legislation in the House this week that would do away with the requirement all together. It is part of a sweeping plan to ease banking industry rules they argue have been hampering the economy and made it more difficult to get a loan. The effort, backed by the Trump administration, aims to dismantle major portions of the Obama administration’s 2010 financial reform law, known as the Dodd Frank Act, landmark legislation that forced banks to maintain a larger financial cushion and take on less debt. “Congratulations to Jeb Hensarling & Republicans on successful House vote to repeal major parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law. GROWTH!,” President Donald Trump said in a tweet Friday morning. (Rep. Hensarling, a Republican from Texas, shepherded the legislation.) Supporters touted the rules as a chance to help community and regional banks, many of which struggle to comply with a regulatory regime aimed mostly at the biggest banks. But the big banks would also gain relief, and one of the key ways is the proposed elimination of a provision known as the “Volcker rule.” The rule, named after its chief champion, former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, has two prongs. The first limits banks’ ability to buy and sell exotic financial instruments, and the second limits the ability of banks to operate and invest in hedge funds and private-equity funds. Banks that make loans and collect consumer deposits, such as checking and savings accounts, shouldn’t be using that money to take on the same type of risks that hedge funds do, supporters of the rule say. But House Republicans argued that the Volcker has sapped liquidity from the markets - in other words, reduced the number of institutional buyers and sellers - and said in a summary of the legislation that repealing the rule would “promote more resilient capital markets and a more stable financial system.” To comply, big Wall Street banks have shut down their “proprietary trading” desks to eliminate speculative trades and began selling off their investments in hedge and private equity funds. The shift was particularly significant for Goldman, which once claimed that such proprietary trading accounted for 10 percent of its revenue. In an CNBC interview earlier this year, Goldman chief executive Lloyd Blankfein said restrictions on bank trading could prevent companies from being involved in the kinds of transactions that are “beneficial to the financial markets. There should be more flexibility.” Many in the industry complain that the regulations governing the Volcker rule are so complex it made it difficult to distinguish between the financial transactions a bank may do on its own behalf, purely for profit, or on behalf of a client. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, once warned that “for every trader, we are going to have to have a lawyer, compliance officer, doctor to see what their testosterone levels are, and a shrink - what is your intent?” Some regulators have acknowledged the complexity of the rules, though critics say banks are exaggerating. “Proprietary trading had banks with conflicts of interest against their customers,” Volcker said in an interview. “The idea that the restraint on proprietary trading is hurting customer service is baloney.” In the meantime, big banks have received two extensions to comply with aspects of the rule, the first in 2015. The latest covers “illiquid funds,” typically investments banks made in hedge and private funds that may now be difficult to sell. “I have doubts over the need for an extension. How much of it is just a hope that the rule would go away?,” Volcker said. The extension gave Goldman more time to rid itself of about $6 billion in investments. Morgan Stanley has applied for more time to deal with about $1.9 billion of such assets. Citigroup only has about $400 million left and has also been granted an extension. The bank’s chief executive, Michael Corbat, said at a banking conference earlier this month that it was time to make changes to Volcker. “We don’t want to be in the proprietary trading business. We don’t want to be using consumer deposits to speculate,” he said. But the law is too complex, Corbat said, noting that the rules had been written by five different agencies. Those agencies “have taken the same law, the same rule and applied it five different ways. And what we’ve said is we don’t care which one, just pick one of them. Pick one of them and enforce it that way, and we’d be great with that.” The House legislation that would repeal the rule all together is unlikely to pass the Senate intact and regulators, who already spent years wiring the rules, may shy away from making significant, time-consuming changes. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who has been directed by Trump to make recommendations on improving the banking system, appears to be leaning toward a compromise. “I support the Volcker Rule, but there needs to be proper definition around the Volcker Rule so banks can understand what they can do and what they can’t do,” Mnuchin told the Senate Banking Committee in January. The effort to repeal or even weaken the rule has outraged some. “The Volcker firewall was among the most critical pieces of Wall Street reform,” said Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon), one of the original sponsors of the provision. “This casino allowed banks to make big bets with taxpayer-insured funds, destabilizing the financial system and the U.S. economy.” But a repeal of the rule could pay off for big banks. Wall Street banks stand to recoup about $2 billion in profits next year if the trading restrictions were lifted, according to research by Nomura, a global investment bank. That includes a boost of about $446 million for Goldman. Like what you're reading?

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., May 22, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 10 Jun 2017 08:30AM (Updated: 10 Jun 2017 12:55PM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail NEW YORK: A rough few months for most U.S. bank stocks has been particularly unkind to regional banks, and that’s not likely to change soon as hopes dim for higher long-term interest rates and timely policy relief from Washington. While some investors see bargains in lower valuations of regional banks' shares, few can point with any confidence to near-term catalysts for a turnaround in their fortunes. After outperforming larger banks in the wake of the Nov. 8 U.S. Presidential election, the S&P 600 index of small cap banks are down 8.1 percent so far this year, data through Thursday showed, while the S&P 500 index of the biggest U.S. banks is unchanged. The full S&P 500 , meanwhile, is up 8.7 percent. Last year, investors bet heavily that smaller, entirely U.S.-focused banks would benefit most from Donald Trump's promises of tax cuts, deregulation and economic stimulus. But those hopes dwindled dramatically as it became clear that President Trump would have difficulty gaining enough support to deliver on any of his pro-growth proposals. Advertisement Advertisement "I  would expect (smaller banks) to continue to underperform as long as we don't get some of these policy decisions to move through," said Stephen Scouten, banking analyst for Sandler O’Neill in Atlanta. Fading hopes for an economic boost from Trump's agenda has compressed the gap between short- and long-term interest rates, putting pressure on bank loan profit margins. This is a bigger issue for regionals which have a greater dependence on lending for their profits than bigger, more diversified banks. Also, commercial and industrial loan growth has slowed this year after climbing steadily since late 2010. The Federal Reserve's latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, released May 8, showed domestic banks reporting weaker commercial and industrial loan demand from firms of all sizes in the first quarter. WAITING FOR CLARITY Part of the problem is that companies are waiting for clarity on economic growth prospects and tax rates before making borrowing decisions, according to investors and analysts. sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget "Eventually, for the smaller banks to outperform, concerns about the overall economy need to dissipate. Better economic growth usually leads to better lending growth and in that environment the yield curve steepens as well," said Brian Kleinhanzl, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. Short selling has decreased in most regional and diversified banking sectors so far this year. But short interest in both the SPDR S&P Bank Exchange Traded Fund and SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF increased as short sellers may be replacing exposure to individual banks with short bets on the sector. Short interest in the S&P bank ETF is up 36 percent for the year while it is up 23 percent in the regional banking ETF. While tax cuts are viewed as one of the biggest boosts for regional banks of all Trump's policy proposals, investors are skeptical it will come any time soon. JPMorgan analysts on Thursday scaled back their forecast on the size of possible U.S. tax cuts and pushed out the timing to the second quarter of 2018 from the third quarter of 2017. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn has said he expects U.S. Congress to get tax reform done this year. But investors say 2018 would likely be the earliest this could happen. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected this month to unveil plans for regulating the U.S. banking sector including a relaxation of regulations for community banks, which have struggled with rules imposed after the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. While investors expect the administration to have trouble winning congressional support for legislative changes to regulations such as Dodd-Frank, some are hoping Trump will be able to appoint people to key regulatory positions. If Trump can replace the Federal Reserve's head of banking supervision, this might at least help slow the pace of regulation, said investment managers. Trump is expected to nominate Carnegie Mellon University professor Marvin Goodfriend and former Treasury Department staffer Randal Quarles to fill two of three open seats at the Fed, according to a New York Times report. "If they do get traction and get some of these (policy changes) done, even if they're more watered-down versions of what they had proposed, that's probably very good for sentiment and good for the fundamentals," said Miles Lewis, portfolio manager for American Century Investments' Small Cap Value fund.

That includes a boost of about $446 million for Goldman. business economy false after3th true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

The Houston-based company is under contract to acquire the site from Alliance Residential in late September, according to Zach Wolf, director of leasing for Braun Enterprises. It will purchase the property, which sits on 2.1 acres at the northeast corner of 19th and Nicholson, from the Phoenix-based apartment developer. Alliance Residential is buying two catty-corner lots along Nicholson at West 20th streets from the city of Houston, and will in turn sell the lot with the waterworks buildings to Braun Enterprises. "This is our 25th project in the Heights area," Braun Enterprises president Dan Braun said in an email. "Our intent is to embrace the walkability and help continue to connect Yale to Shepherd along 19th Street," he said, adding that 19th "has always been the bull's-eye in the Heights for retail and by adding four freestanding restaurants, we hope to make this an area for the community to gather in the Heights." The waterworks include a 1928 concrete and brick reservoir building recorded in the National Register of Historic Places; an Art Deco pumping station from 1939; and a pump building constructed in 1949. A proposed building along 19th Street would add 5,000 square feet to the project, which is being designed by Jerry Tipps and Jared Tipps of Tipps Architecture.

One of the buildings could be expanded by nearly 1,300 square feet. "We are incorporating a considerable amount of greenery and outdoor space to make it very pedestrian friendly," Wolf said. "The Heights Hike and Bike Trail runs adjacent to the western side of our property, and we expect to generate considerable pedestrian traffic off of the trail." Braun Enterprises' area developments have attracted tenants such as Harold's Restaurant, Bar & Terrace and Torchy's Tacos at nearby Harold's in the Heights, Mellow Mushroom at 1919 N. Shepherd and Bernie's Burger Bus at 2200 Yale. The site is directly across from another potential redevelopment site. Earlier this year, JPMorgan Chase Bank put its two-story bank building and land on the market. It is reserving a portion as the site for a new modern building. Just north of that, Alliance Residential plans to develop a Broadstone apartment midrise. Braun Enterprises would begin work as soon as the property purchase is final, with completion targeted in the second quarter, according to Wolf, who anticipates plenty of interest from both national and local restaurants. The street, Wolf said, is "where everyone wants to be. There just hasn't been any space available."

Moody’s cut the nation’s foreign and local-currency ratings to Baa3, and kept the outlook at negative, meaning the next move could be to speculative grade. The company cited weakening institutions, reduced growth prospects and the resultant risks to the country’s finances as reasons for the change in a statement on Friday. “The risks to growth and fiscal strength arising from the political outlook are tilted to the downside,” Moody’s said. “It is unlikely that a political consensus will emerge, which supports investment in the economy and reinvigorates the reform effort sufficiently quickly to reverse the expected negative impact on growth and on the government’s balance sheet.” S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings Ltd. cut their foreign-currency assessments of South Africa to junk in April after President Jacob Zuma on changed his cabinet and fired Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The decision sent the rand and bonds plunging, and sparked street demonstrations pushing for Zuma’s ouster and opposition parties to call for a no-confidence vote in parliament. Several top leaders in the ruling African National Congress have said the party risks losing power in 2019 elections if he’s allowed to complete his second five-year term. It will hold a policy conference at the end of this month and will elect a new leader in December, when Zuma’s second five-term term as ANC president ends. “Moody’s views the underlying political dynamics which led to the March cabinet reshuffle as posing a threat to near- and medium-term real gross domestic product growth,” the company said. “The institutional framework has become less transparent, effective and predictable, and policymakers’ commitment to previously articulated reform objectives is less certain.” Junk Status South Africa’s economy unexpectedly fell into a recession for the first time since 2009 in the three month through March as all but two industries shrank, the statistics office said June 6. “The outcomes of the conferences of the ANC in June and December 2017 are not expected to translate to policy changes,” the National Treasury said in an emailed statement. Policy transparency and continuity are top priorities for the government and the ruling party, it said. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Moody’s is the only major credit-rating company to assess both South Africa’s foreign-currency and rand-denominated debt at investment grade. S&P cut the nation’s foreign-currency debt to junk on April 3 and left the local rating one step above. Fitch reduced both assessments to junk four days later, triggering a selloff by some investors tracking investment-grade debt indexes. JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in April it would remove the nation’s dollar-denominated debt from gauges tracked by $59 billion of funds. The bulk of investments in global index-tracking funds remains safe because about 90 percent of the country’s debt portfolio is rand-denominated. S&P affirmed South Africa’s foreign-currency debt at the highest junk assessment, and rand-denominated bonds at the lowest investment grade on June 2. Fitch maintained both its ratings at the highest non-investment grade on June 1. Moody’s said it could cut the South Africa’s rating further if there are indications that the strength and independence of the country’s institutions have diminished more or if policy becomes more unpredictable. “Unless government is able to meaningfully encourage private-sector investment, which leads to higher economic growth and an improvement in government finances, Moody’s will be forced to downgrade South Africa to below investment grade,” Kevin Lings, the chief economist at Stanlib Asset Management Ltd. in Johannesburg, said in an emailed note. “Such a move would have very significant implications for South Africa’s ability to attract sufficient foreign investment cost-effectively and on a sustained basis.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

You then market your fund based on those returns, and raise a lot more money. Now you have a big hedge fund, and you invest it in your best ideas, but also your second- and third-best ideas, because there is no room in the best ideas for all the money. Then you have mediocre returns. This is fine for you, because you are getting paid management fees on all the money in your hedge fund, and getting paid 2 percent on billions of dollars is a perfectly fine way to make a living. It is less good for your investors, though: They wanted the good returns you used to get on the small amount of money, not the mediocre returns you now get on their big pile of money. But of course you are also an investor. So there is a trade-off here: As a hedge-fund manager, you want to grow as much as possible, even by sacrificing performance, because that's how you get fees. As an investor in your own fund, though, you don't want to grow beyond your best ideas, the ones that actually make money. One might imagine a sort of inflection point, where managers who are mostly managers want to focus on growth, and managers who are also large investors in their own funds want to focus on returns. Here is a delightful paper by Arpit Gupta of NYU Stern and Kunal Sachdeva of Columbia Business School confirming that intuition: We find that funds with greater investment by insiders outperform funds with less "skin in the game" on a factor-adjusted basis; exhibit greater return persistence; and feature lower fund flow-performance sensitivities. These results suggest that managers earn outsize rents by operating trading strategies further from their capacity constraints when managing their own money. The mechanism is exactly what you'd expect: We find that funds with little inside capital operate according to standard Berk and Green (2004) logic: good returns are followed by large fund inflows, so there is little predictability in excess returns. However, we find that funds with greater inside investment do not follow this pattern. For this subset of funds, high returns do not lead to excess inflows; instead excess returns are persistent. The joint behavior between fund flows, performance, and inside investment suggests that capacity constraints are an important driver of hedge fund performance; and that managers of hedge funds choose to deploy less capital (and so gain greater alpha) when their own personal capital is involved. They use a cutoff of 20 percent insider ownership, which seems to be about the average. Funds with less than 20 percent insider ownership tend to grow after having high excess returns, and then have worse returns; funds with more than 20 percent insider ownership tend to stay the same size, and continue to outperform. "Our findings have implications for optimal portfolio allocations of institutional investors," they say, but do they? The most important lesson is probably that you should invest with a hedge-fund manager who doesn't want your money, but that is hard to do. Dividend arbitrage. I just can't get that worked up about dividend arbitrage, which seems like a straightforward and not particularly exciting tax trade. You take shares with taxable dividends, park them with a non-taxable holder on the dividend day, avoid the tax and split the profits. Meh. It's just a bit crude; as an aesthetic matter I like my tax trades to be subtler and more complicated. And as a policy matter most people seem to dislike dividend arbitrage: Any tax trade that crude probably has no economic substance and should be shut down. So now it has been shut down in a lot of places, but for a long time it could be done legally in Germany, and banks did a lot of dividend-arbitrage trades there and saved billions of euros in taxes. But lots of other people always seem to be getting worked up about German dividend arbitrage, and in that vein I give you "The Great Tax Robbery," a deep dive from Die Zeit about "how bankers, consultants, and lawyers have been plundering the German state for decades" using dividend arbitrage trades. (There is also a series of data visualizations.) It is full of the sort of color you expect to see in big stories about financial scandals, though even this color feels somehow a bit wan. Apparently a lot of dividend arbitrage trades -- called "cum-ex" trades, because someone has the shares cum dividends and someone else has them ex-dividends -- were concocted at the Cinnamon Club, a fancy Indian restaurant in London:  The British trade register contains the address of a man who was "director" of the Cinnamon Club until 2015 and has attracted the attention of German state prosecutors: Paul Mora, a banker who is 1.90 meters tall and weighs 120 kilograms. He was charged with putting into practice what Mr. Berger conceived, introducing young traders to the cum-ex loge and carrying out the stock transactions. Traders called him the "man in short pants" because he likes to walk through London in Bermuda shorts and Hawaiian shirts. Other cum-ex traders also had nicknames. There’s the "gentleman," the "crazy guy" and the "autistic," who really is autistic and has named his yacht "Cum-Ex." They’re all part of a tiny circle of traders who moved billions. Those nicknames ... they are fine? "What should we call the guy who wears shorts?" "The Man in Short Pants." "Great. What about the crazy guy?" "Let's call him the Crazy Guy." "Great, glad we've figured this all out, I'm off for a cruise on my yacht, Large Boat Purchased With The Proceeds of Tax Arbitrage." With an imagination like that, you too could structure dividend arbitrage trades. Andrew Left.  Here is a fun profile of Andrew Left, the activist short seller behind Citron Research, that sometimes seems to confuse "the world of finance" with "Twitter": At 10 a.m., having placed his bet against the stock the night before, Left put out his first tweet, which he misspelled and deleted four times. Such is his mystique in the world of finance, however, that one of his followers assumed that the misspellings and deletions were part of a premeditated scheme to exploit Twitter’s visibility algorithms. But that's fine, an important theme of modern life is the convergence of reality and Twitter. Left, for instance, uses his skill at Twitter to make real money; he shorts stocks, then tweets mean things about them, then they go down, even if his tweets have some errors: In 15 minutes, $6 billion of market capitalization vanished. (Five months later, the stock price is still down 13 percent.) Left considered the circus around him. “See,” he said, “some guys know this stuff better than me. But I know how to put it in [expletive] tweets.” I mean, that can get you elected president these days.  The thesis of the profile is that Left is sort of operating as a journalist, though, as he says, "The difference between this and journalism is you can make millions of dollars." In the olden days, short sellers just shorted stock and stayed quiet. Then they started shorting stock and working with journalists to expose frauds at their targets. Now, "short-sellers of Left’s generation are following this example but cutting out the middleman," shorting stock and taking to Twitter to expose frauds in their own names. But "cutting out the middleman" isn't quite right either; Left is also taking over that role: The man on the other end of the line was a hedge-fund manager, this one a very close associate of Left’s, at the center of his circle of sources. His relationship with Left was completely informal. His role was to trade ideas back and forth, sometimes shorting the companies they discussed. In exchange for sharing his insight and institutional muscle, Left’s source avoided the legal liability that came from going public with a position. Why call a reporter to pitch a story that is helpful to your short thesis, when you can call Andrew Left? He has a lot more to gain from that pitch. Aramco and indexing. When I am trying to be contrarian, I sometimes like to say that it's weird that Uber Technologies Inc. isn't in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. Obviously this is absurd: The S&P is only open to companies that are listed on U.S. public stock exchanges, and Uber is not public. (Also the S&P requires GAAP profitability, but that is a minor quibble compared to the public listing thing.) But it is a very large-cap U.S. company, and many of its shares are owned by large U.S. mutual funds, and they trade in the secondary market. If you are an institutional asset manager and your mandate is to invest in large U.S. companies, then Uber could quite plausibly be on your list of potential investments. And if you are an institutional asset manager with a passive mandate to invest in all the large U.S. companies, then it might seem a little arbitrary to exclude Uber. It is a large U.S. company that you can invest in; why exclude it just because it's not in the S&P, or listed on an exchange, or whatever? I mean there are plenty of reasons not to invest in Uber, but by hypothesis you are not looking for reasons. You are just investing in "the market." But even so, you need to give some thought to exactly what "the market" is. I am mostly just kidding about all of that, but meanwhile in London: Saudi Aramco will not join the FTSE 100 stock index if it lists its shares in the UK, averting confrontation with City institutions and strengthening London’s status as frontrunner for a slice of the Saudi state oil group’s initial public offering. "Concern has grown that a UK listing would mean the state oil company becoming a member of the FTSE 100 index, making an arm of the Saudi state an automatic holding for millions of pension funds," but that concern seems to have been averted. But imagine if Saudi Arabian Oil Co. does go public in the U.K. at some of the numbers that have been batted around, like a $2 trillion valuation and a 5 percent ($100 billion) free float. The combined market capitalization of the FTSE 100 is about 2 trillion pounds. If you are an investor who wants passive exposure to large-cap U.K.-listed companies -- if you just want to own "the market" -- it has to feel a little weird to exclude a U.K.-listed company that is as big as the rest of the market combined.  Oh of course there are good reasons to keep Aramco out of the FTSE! (Such as the FTSE requirement that index companies have at least 25 percent free float.) But those reasons are choices; they are distinct from the classic passive-investor desire to avoid complexity and underperformance by just owning the whole market. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. The kids these days, they go to the business schools, and they say "blockchain!", and the business schools say "blockchain?", and the kids say "blockchain!", and the business schools say "block ... chain?", and this happens: But the burgeoning industry is so diverse that academics said it is difficult to construct a syllabus for financial technology 101. There are no textbooks and few professors have fintech expertise. "For fintech, some people mean bitcoin and cryptocurrencies; some people mean the technology JPMorgan uses for trading," said Angela Lee, Columbia Business School's chief innovation officer. "Everyone thinks it's sexy, and a lot of people use it colloquially without knowing what it is." "Fintech" doesn't really seem like a coherent body of knowledge any more than, like, "Cool Finance Stuff" would be, but I guess you have to follow the trends. I think if I were a business school professor I would teach a course called Fintech 101, and people would show up on the first day and I'd be like "it's called Microsoft Excel, ever hear of it?" Actually no I am kidding, if I were a business school professor I would teach a course called "Cool Finance Stuff." There'd probably still be a blockchain unit, I'm sorry. People are worried that people aren't worried enough. Here are some people worrying about why volatility is so low and what will happen to it. The consensus in conversations like this always seems to be that low volatility now means that there will be high volatility later. "Whenever something is the new norm, I know it is about to change," says Chris Concannon of CBOE Holdings Inc. That is generally a safe thing to think about markets: This time is never different; human folly recurs endlessly. But it is often more interesting to think about why today's low volatility really might be a new normal, an evolution in financial markets rather than just a low point in a cycle. Here is Nicholas Colas of Convergex: “Think of the self-driving car market,” he suggested. “A person can drive a car pretty well with fairly low error rates and a human-dominated market can do the same. As you infuse artificial intelligence and information into a bigger algorithm to drive market and asset prices, volatility should collapse over the next two, three, four, 10, or 20 years in the same way self-driving cars have fewer crashes than those driven by humans.” Maybe that is wrong and naive, but in some sense shouldn't it be right? We tend to expect progress in most technological and scientific domains: Over time, people are supposed to learn stuff and improve their performance. Cars really do get safer over time. Shouldn't markets get more efficient? People are worried about unicorns. The main unicorn worry these days always seems to be about Uber Technologies Inc. Today it's about how Uber, a giant mature multinational company, still seems to operate on the rather casual standards of the rest of the Enchanted Forest: Key unfilled positions include chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief marketing officer and general counsel — an astonishing list for a company that has more than $7bn in annual revenues and which was valued at $68bn by investors last year. When Snap Inc. issued nonvoting stock in its initial public offering so that its charismatic founders could retain control even while raising money from the public, I assumed that would set a precedent for other big unicorns to limit shareholder control, a precedent that would only be reversed when something went wrong: Eventually some unicorn with a charismatic founder will go public with terrible shareholder rights, and get in trouble, and the shareholders will have no recourse, and they will learn a lesson and refuse to let future unicorns get away with nonvoting stock. But I guess there are other things that might cause investors to push back. If Uber went public tomorrow, would you buy nonvoting stock that would let Travis Kalanick keep unilateral control forever? People are worried about bond market liquidity. My Bloomberg Gadfly colleague Lisa Abramowicz, who has been worrying about bond market liquidity for years, wonders what took the Trump administration so long: It's almost antiquated that newly minted regulators are ramping up their bond-market liquidity worries now. Traders already spent years fretting about a logjam in debt markets, back in 2013, 2014 and 2015. But many people have tired of thinking about it, especially because trading volumes have generally been increasing and Wall Street firms are profiting. "When a man is tired of thinking about bond market liquidity, he is tired of life," Johnson almost said, but this seems right: Regardless of how substantial bond-market liquidity threats are to financial stability, this study is years too late. At this point, banks and investors have generally adapted to the current environment. To the extent traders are still concerned, they hold more cash, use derivatives, turn to electronic-trading systems or plan to hold assets for longer. To the extent banks lament the fat profits of yore, they've jettisoned traders accustomed to multimillion-dollar bonuses and changed the way they do business to match buyers and sellers. The Volcker Rule, for instance, is probably not a switch that can be turned on and off at will: Once you fire all your proprietary risk-takers, it's not so easy to start taking proprietary risk again just because the regulators let you. And the old-fashioned model in which banks step in to take on a lot of risk whenever the rest of the market panics, which was not all that true to begin with, will be hard to revive no matter how favorable the regulatory environment is. Equity markets moved pretty far away from that model long before the Volcker Rule. Elsewhere, here is Darrell Duffie of Stanford University arguing "that one particular regulation, the leverage-ratio rule, has inefficiently distorted dealer incentives for market making and that its financial-stability benefits could be achieved more effectively with risk-weighted capital requirements." And Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is launching an exchange-traded fund for investment-grade bonds. Things happen. A daily take on Wall Street, finance, companies and stuff.

Bush was president, according to online fuel-price information provider GasBuddy. Gasoline costs an average of $2.35 a gallon in the United States and is the least expensive since 2005, when the national average was $2.11 per gallon. There are 21 states with lower averages than a year ago. Among the more significant discounted prices to last year are: Ohio (26 cents lower), Illinois (25 cents), Indiana (20 cents), Kentucky (16 cents) and Michigan (13 cents). “At the beginning of the year, I would have bet against you if you’d have said gas prices this summer could be lower than last year,”  said Patrick DeHaan, GasBuddy senior petroleum analyst. “With OPEC’s production cut in November, such a prediction seemed next to impossible, but the resiliency of U.S. shale production has indeed surprised.” GasBuddy said refinery issues have caused prices to temporarily surge, lifting gas prices over year-ago levels. Hawaii leads the list at 54 cents higher, followed by Nevada (34 cents), Alaska (32 cents), California (31 cents) and Arizona (21 cents). “There is, however, some good news for everyone. With oil prices plummeting some 5% so far this week, there will likely be lower gasoline prices coming for much of the country.’’ said DeHaan. The price of gasoline is likely to continue to fall. On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration reported that domestic crude supplies unexpectedly climbed by 3.3 million barrels for the week ended June 2, ending eight straight weeks of declines. Major banks such as Goldman Sachs have started slashing their oil price forecasts for this year and next, doubting an OPEC deal to cut production can rebalance markets. JPMorgan cut its 2018 forecast for West Texas Intermediate crude by $11 to $42, according to Oilprice.com. JPMorgan said U.S. crude output is expected to keep growing for several quarters because of lower breakeven costs and higher investment. The price of oil Friday rose slightly by 22 cents to $45.86 in morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

(Photo: AP/Richard Drew) 10 Jun 2017 04:55AM (Updated: 10 Jun 2017 05:00AM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail NEW YORK: Big tech shares including Apple, Amazon and Facebook fell sharply on Friday (Jun 9) as the Nasdaq retreated from a record, while the Dow in contrast finished at a new high. The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 113.85 points (1.80 per cent) to end the session at 6,207.92, pulling back from Thursday's record. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 89.44 points (0.42 per cent) to end at 21,271.97, a new all-time high, while the broad-based S&P 500 dipped 2.02 points (0.08 per cent) to 2,431.77. Analysts called the midday shift a sector rotation in which investors were taking profits from highly-valued sectors and putting the funds in areas that have underperformed, such as financials, energy and retailers. Apple dropped 3.9 per cent, Amazon fell 3.2 per cent, Google parent Alphabet 3.4 per cent and Netflix 4.7 per cent.

Big gainers in the Dow included oil giant Chevron, up 2.3 per cent, and banks JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which climbed 2.4 per cent and 1.7 per cent, respectively. Energy and financials have been laggards thus far in 2017. Retailers, another beaten-down sector, also did well in the session, with Macy's gaining 4.3 per cent, Gap 2.4 per cent and Target 4.2 per cent. "It is definitely a rotation," said Nate Thooft, senior managing director, Manulife Asset Management. "When it started to crack a little bit this morning ... people jumped on the bandwagon and started taking some of their wins off the table." Thooft said the gains in the Dow reflected relief that the British election and the congressional testimony of former FBI chief James Comey were over and no longer loomed over the market. sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget Source: AFP/ec Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail More stories for you More information about Channel News Asia jump to top of page Sections Asia Pacific Singapore World CNA Insider Business Sport Lifestyle Technology Health Commentary About Us About Channel NewsAsia Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Advertise with us Contact Sales Online Advertising TV Advertising Get the news that matters in your inbox every morning!

A client spokesperson provided the following statement to Adweek: “Mcgarrybowen will be working with us on developing a new global brand platform that will bring together all of our brand and product-related work under one umbrella. The new platform will capture the innovative work that is underway throughout our company and reflect the diversity of our business here in the U.S. and internationally.” More specifically, Mcgarrybowen will handle the global creative brand campaigns as well as U.S. executions while Ogilvy will continue working on international executions and keep “some of their current [unspecified] U.S. work.” The size of these respective assignments in terms of revenue is not clear, but American Express spent more than $500 million on paid media in the U.S. last year, according to Kantar Media. Both Ogilvy and Mcgarrybowen deferred to the client, which didn’t elaborate on the reasons for the shift or the work to come. But American Express made some big changes to its marketing team last year as longtime CMO John Hayes departed after helping to launch its new global marketing operations group. The company does not currently list a CMO, but VP of marketing operations Mike McCormack currently leads the aforementioned group with Elizabeth Rutledge serving as EVP, global advertising and media and reporting directly to CEO Kenneth I. Chenault. According to one party who worked with Mcgarrybowen in the past, agency leadership has been known for developing relationships with C-level client leaders before effectively “swooping in” and winning accounts away from competitors—in many cases without a review. Gordon Bowen, who co-founded the agency and currently serves as chairman, also worked with American Express while he was a creative leader at Ogilvy. The agency’s site credits him with developing both the “Membership has its privileges” campaign and “Chase Freedom,” which it describes as “the most successful credit card launch in history.” Despite the fact that Ogilvy remains on the AmEx roster, this shift marks a significant loss for the agency, which has been working with the credit card company since 1962. This isn’t the first time the client has moved work away from Ogilvy: back in 1991, TBWA won what The New York Times described as “the most prestigious part of that account” promoting the green charge card. That Stuart Elliott article provides a couple of serious blasts from the past. First, TBWA was then called “Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc.” And then there are these two paragraphs: Ogilvy New York’s top executives had labored mightily to keep their hold on the green card account, for which they created stylish print advertisements featuring striking photographs of celebrities like Ella Fitzgerald, Tom Seaver, Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy. Ogilvy New York was so concerned that even after Gordon Bowen, its executive creative director, decided to depart for McCann-Erickson New York, he remained through the summer to complete work on the account. We hear this week’s news came as a surprise to everyone but American Express—and, of course, Mcgarrybowen. The agency has already begun production on its first brand work, which will debut early next year.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States Jun 10, 2:28 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology Barclays' Techstars Is Quietly Building A FinTech Empire By Leigh Cuen On 06/09/17 AT 4:53 PM Close Since the dawn of fintech, London’s historic financial hub has been the beating heart of the scene’s niche ecosystem. But in a post-Brexit economy, the United Kingdom could be poised to lose its fintech crown. Tel Aviv, Israel;  São Paulo and Singapore are just a few of the rising stars leading the future of high-tech financial services. So one of London’s oldest banks, Barclays, is quietly diversifying and building a global fintech network. In May, the British banking giant announced it will establish Europe’s largest fintech co-working space near its home base in London. Many of the tower’s occupants will come from Barclays Accelerator Powered By Techstars, a partnership that runs four fintech accelerators around the world including programs in Tel Aviv and Cape Town, South Africa. Bank-funded accelerators are increasingly common. Yet, this one’s international focus makes it especially unique. Read: Why Financial Tech Is Booming In Brazil The Canary Wharf headquarters of Barclays Bank in London. Photo: Oli Scarff/Getty Barclays funds these programs while the American accelerator network Techstars runs operations on the ground. Techstars director of public relations Joanie Kindblade told International Business Times 102 companies have graduated from these programs since they started in 2014. Chris Adelsbach, who heads the program in London, said all the fintech startups combined are collectively worth $64 billion. “I don’t think there’s anything else like that,” Adelsbach told IBT. His optimism, however, overlooks crucial pieces of context. Some experts say there is a global movement of old-school financial institutions funding startup programs. Efi Pylarinou, the Crypto Valley co-founder of Daily Fintech and Fintech Genome, said bank-funded fintech accelerators are actually a growing trend. “It’s really the banks and the insurance companies that are funding these ventures,” she told IBT. “We’re seeing a blurring of the lines.” The establishment is financing the so-called disrupters. For example, Singapore’s FinLab is sponsored in part by United Overseas Bank Ltd., and OCBC FinTech Accelerator is funded by the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. Even Wells Fargo and Germany’s Deutsche Bank now have startup accelerators in the United States. So far, these programs have produced few rock star successes. “Accelerators can also be a bottleneck,” Pylarinou said. “They are not the solution to the old ways of doing business. They are just opening a door.” She mentioned 500 Startups, which isn’t funded by any bank or insurance company, as one of the most diverse and unique fintech accelerator programs in the industry. However, she still hesitated to say whether they are doing better than competitors like Barclays Techstars. “I haven’t seen anybody do a good job ranking the accelerators based on any [universal] metric line,” she said. Determining success is still a contentious issue in the industry. Should prestige be measured in widespread user adoption, founder exits or venture capital? Regardless of how you look at it, the fintech program at 500 Startups is doing something right. “Although our program is San Francisco-based, we take in companies from all over the world, Latin America, Europe, Africa, pretty much everywhere,” Sheel Mohnot, the 500 Startups partner in charge of its fintech accelerator, told IBT. While Barclays gains a foothold in South Africa and Israel, 500 Startups is investing in Latin America. 500 Startups graduates includes the Argentine mobile app iBillionaire, now based in New York, which TheNextWeb described as one of Latin America’s leading household names from the fintech world. Meanwhile, in Brazil’s burgeoning ecosystem, Geektime named 500 Startups graduate ContaAzul as one of Brazil’s most important startups. Fast Company also named this Brazilian startup as one of the most innovative tech companies in all of Latin America. Mohnot co-director Jacob Gibson worked at JP Morgan Chase and co-founded NerdWallet before joining the accelerator program. Like Techstars, this program offers each company a six-figure investment and mentors with experience navigating the tricky fintech landscape, a minefield of regulations and security issues other startups don’t need to tackle so early on. “It’s really centered around getting a deal with Barclays,” Mohnot said of Barclays Techstars during a phone interview with IBT. “Why would you want to do an accelerator with a bank? The bank wants to do what’s best for the bank, not the [fintech] company. ... It tends to be just a lot of PR for the banks.” Adelsbach argued several Techstars graduates have moved beyond pilots and actually formed long-term deals with Barclays, including the small software startup Cutover. Cutover CEO Ky Nichol said Barclays started using Cutover's human orchestration software tools about a year ago, coordinating employee responsibilities across the bank's vast corporate network. Nichol estimated more than 500 employees now use it and further integration will add as many as 6,000 users by 2018. “We debated this quite a lot at the board level,” Nichol told IBT. “We knew if we went to banks with prototype software, no one would listen... We thought it would be better to focus our resources on an enterprise client like Barclays.” Read: Here's Why Israeli Fintech Startups Are Conquering The Market Since graduating from the Techstars accelerator program, the audit and tax consulting mammoth Deloitte also became one of Cutover’s investors and clients. Nichol said a Techstars networking event helped his startup connect with a South African bank he never would have known otherwise. And therein lies the power of Barclays' fintech empire. Barclays Techstars may not have the biggest rock stars, not yet at least, but its arm continues to grow. Instead of just flying a select few entrepreneurs to established hubs like Silicon Valley or London, Barclays is investing in developing ecosystems. Now its network reaches far beyond the mainstream industry’s periphery. Africa is widely considered one of the world’s largest untapped markets for financial services. Kenyan entrepreneur Waweru Kuria is CEO of iNuka Pap, a mobile app providing credit and savings services to community cooperatives. His company participated in Techstars’ inaugural Cape Town program in 2016. Although enterprise clients like Barclays are not his target customer, learning from each other is mutually beneficial. “When I joined Techstars, we had 200 customers from one cooperative,” Kuria told IBT. “We now have six cooperatives with over 40,000 members. ... You are looking at a $4 billion market in Kenya alone.” Kuria said several 2016 graduates went on to complete a pilot with Barclays. “We have a global ecosystem, where we can draw from research they don’t even know,” Adelsbach said, describing the benefits Barclays gets from diversifying investment. “None of them [competitors] have the global reach. The startup programs we run put us at the heart of not only big cities but also smaller cities.” There are 2 billion unbanked people in the world. As developing nations turn to mobile services instead of traditional institutions, Barclays is already there with its proverbial finger on the pulse of diverse fintech perspectives. For their part, the early stage startups gain access to the infamously conservative, sectarian world of corporate finance. Barclays-funded startup hubs are among the few places where fintech innovators from all over the Middle East, Europe and Africa routinely sit at the same table to swap ideas and resources. “They [Barclays] realize they’re not going to innovate fast enough internally. The only way to be fast enough and grow is through partnership,” Adelsbach said. “We think Barclays is serious about innovation and that’s half the battle, having interest from a senior level.” Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

An attempt to administer tough medicine — by letting Lehman Brothers file for bankruptcy — backfired. Financial panic rapidly accelerated, forcing the government to change tack and stand behind the rest of the financial system.  In the years that followed the crisis, President Obama and Congress put into place safeguards to prevent Washington from again being forced into such a choice by institutions that were “too big to fail.” Today, large financial institutions are subject to much more stringent regulation, and if they get into trouble, the government has important new tools to wind them down without taking down the rest of the financial system. As a result, firms cannot take outsize risks on the assumption that if their bets go wrong, the government will sweep in and prop them up. Quotes in the article American International Group Inc AIG ▲ 64.18 +0.52 +0.82% Dominion Energy Inc D ▼ 79.28 -0.39 -0.49% AdChoices Yesterday, the House passed a bill that aims to eviscerate the very reforms that make a repeat of the 2008 scenario less likely. The so-called Financial CHOICE Act — approved by a party-line vote — eliminates two of the key reforms specifically designed to prevent another bailout. Although the bill is supported by the Trump administration, it would directly undercut an executive order President Trump issued on February 3. One of the “Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial System” laid out in that order was: “prevent taxpayer-funded bailouts.” The CHOICE act, however, would invite future bailouts. Republicans have forgotten the lessons of the 2008 crisis To understand how we’ve gotten here, we need a little history. In the fall of 2008, financial regulators were faced with a series of impossible choices: take extraordinary action to prevent the failure of large, complex financial institutions, or let them fail — and let the country face economic cataclysm. In the case of Lehman Brothers, the government let it file for bankruptcy, with devastating consequences that are all too clear in hindsight. At the time, Lehman Brothers was the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States. With more than $600 billion in assets, it was also the largest company ever to file for bankruptcy. Lehman’s failure exposed thousands of creditors to hundreds of billions of dollars in losses, and inspired speculation about who might be next. The stock market immediately crashed more than 500 points, the most since 9/11. Market participants of all stripes raced to pull their money out of other firms perceived to be at risk. This was a classic It’s a Wonderful Life–style bank run, but across the vast capital markets that underpinned a majority of US economic activity. A day after Lehman’s filing, the Federal Reserve paid $85 billion for 80 percent ownership of American Insurance Group (AIG), which had gotten itself into trouble by gambling massively in esoteric derivatives markets. In essence, AIG had written insurance on billions of dollars of securities backed by subprime mortgages, doing so through an unregulated unit operating out of London. As those mortgages went sour, AIG’s losses mounted, and the purchasers of its “insurance” demanded to be paid. Unable to raise cash in time to make the payments, AIG sought help from the government. Load Error Virtually every major Wall Street player had “insurance” of some sort from AIG, so its failure threatened to set off a chain reaction. Treasury and the Fed eventually provided more than $180 billion of assistance to AIG. Even that was not enough to end the system-wide crisis, and Congress eventually dedicated $700 billion to prop up banks across the country. Both Lehman and AIG should have been put out of their misery. But while there was clear authority and a well-tested system in place for resolving failing banks — indeed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) had done so hundreds of times — there was no similar authority for investment banks like Lehman Brothers, or for the unregulated AIG Financial Products unit. Reforms made failure — and system-wide chaos — less likely The Obama administration and Congress sought to fix those problems in two primary ways: First, the law known as Dodd-Frank created a legal mechanism for financial regulators to dismantle large, complex financial institutions outside of bankruptcy court. This authority is known as orderly liquidation authority (OLA). As Lehman showed, ordinary bankruptcy is ill-suited to complex financial institutions. Judges lack the detailed knowledge regulators have of firms’ balance sheets and operations, and of the broader financial system, that is necessary to execute an orderly resolution in a timely way. Regulators also prepare in advance for how they would respond to a failure, including by coordinating with overseas regulators unlikely to be available to a judge. Judges are also slow. Congress’s second reform was to mandate that certain nonbank financial companies (like Lehman and AIG) whose failure might pose a risk to the system should be subject to heightened supervision: more capital, greater liquidity, regular stress tests. A council of regulators called the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, would have the power to designate firms for enhanced oversight. Together, these reforms would make the failure of large, complex firms less likely and would provide a credible alternative to a bailout: an orderly “unwind.” “Orderly liquidation” is not a bailout. It’s the opposite of a bailout. In a recent letter to shareholders, JPMorgan Chase chair and CEO Jamie Dimon argued that Lehman Brothers could not take down the financial system today. His confidence, he wrote, rests partly on the fact that America now has “a system to wind firms down in an orderly fashion” — namely OLA. Former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, who knows firsthand the perils of facing a crisis with a limited toolkit, has called OLA “the best way to reduce the odds” of future bailouts. The always-colorful Barney Frank called the process “death panels” for banks. The surest way to convince the market that the government will indeed let an institution fail — thereby imposing market discipline on that firm — is to have a credible plan for handling that failure. OLA is untested to date. But the FDIC and other regulators, domestically and abroad, have taken major steps to prepare — including by conducting simulated failures. There is no question that regulators are better prepared to handle the failure of a major institution than they were in 2008. Nonetheless, the CHOICE Act eliminates OLA, and the White House’s budget proposed to do the same, in the name of preventing bailouts. How can congressional Republicans and the White House claim that eliminating OLA would prevent bailouts, when expert consensus is that doing so would increase their likelihood? The answer lies in the misleading budget semantics used by supporters of the CHOICE act. OLA authorizes the government to provide limited and temporary liquidity to firms being wound down, to keep viable businesses running during the resolution process. In a typical bankruptcy, this kind of financing is provided by private lenders, but in the midst of a crisis the private sector may be unwilling to provide that bridge financing. © Provided by Vox.com House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-TX) has championed the CHOICE Act. The full amount of any liquidity support provided by the government is required by law to be recouped — first from the firm itself, and then from the industry. So the taxpayer is not on the hook. Nevertheless, Congress uses a ten-year window to estimate the cost of legislation, and a resolution occurring in year eight or nine may not be fully repaid within that window. Thus, the Congressional Budget Office “scores” OLA as having a budgetary cost. This allowed Republican opponents of Dodd-Frank to paint OLA as a bailout, when in fact it was the most direct way to ensure there would be no bailouts. By proposing in its budget to “prevent taxpayer bailouts” by eliminating OLA, the administration has now elevated a misleading political talking point to official policy. One key financial regulation can be repealed with a simple majority in the Senate The CHOICE Act faces long odds of passing the Senate, but OLA itself can arguably be repealed with only 51 votes. For the complicated reasons described above, repealing OLA scores as “saving” money, so Congress may be able to use so-called budget reconciliation procedures to bypass the filibuster and repeal OLA with a simple majority. The CHOICE Act also completely eliminates the authority of FSOC to designate institutions deserving of special scrutiny. This administration may well take a different view than the Obama administration regarding the risks posed by firms that have thus far been so designated by FSOC: Prudential, AIG, and MetLife. But such a difference of opinion in itself is no reason to scrap this policy wholesale. All designations are subject to annual reevaluation. Eliminating this authority altogether would leave some of the largest and most highly leveraged and interconnected institutions free from comprehensive oversight. In his shareholder letter, Dimon also argues that if a situation comparable to Lehman’s arose today, the bank would be required to have twice as much capital as it did prior to the crisis, buffers of highly liquid assets, and more stable funding. It would have a cushion that would make collapse less likely. But that would only be true if the 2017 version of Lehman had been designated as worthy of special scrutiny by FSOC. It would be a grave mistake to willfully eliminate the one tool available to fill a regulatory gap that played such a central role in the last crisis. Taken together, these two elements of the CHOICE Act would prevent FSOC from bringing firms like Lehman Brothers or AIG — or the US investment banking operations of giant Chinese lenders — under comprehensive oversight. It would eliminate the only tool available to unwind any such firms safely in a crisis. If enacted, the CHOICE Act and the policies advocated by the administration make it more likely that when the next crisis comes, Congress will again be forced to choose between the AIG and Lehman paths, between bailout and catastrophe. During the campaign, President Trump appealed to many voters’ nostalgia for a greater past. I doubt even his supporters yearn for a return to the days of September 2008, when the whole country picked up the tab for Wall Street’s bad bets.

Bush was president, according to online fuel-price information provider GasBuddy. Quotes in the article JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▲ 86.96 +2.01 +2.37% Goldman Sachs Group Inc GSPRA ▼ 23.65 -0.15 -0.63% AdChoices Gasoline costs an average of $2.35 a gallon in the United States and is the least expensive since 2005, when the national average was $2.11 per gallon. There are 21 states with lower averages than a year ago. Among the more significant discounted prices to last year are: Ohio (26 cents lower), Illinois (25 cents), Indiana (20 cents), Kentucky (16 cents) and Michigan (13 cents). “At the beginning of the year, I would have bet against you if you'd have said gas prices this summer could be lower than last year,”  said Patrick DeHaan, GasBuddy senior petroleum analyst. “With OPEC's production cut in November, such a prediction seemed next to impossible, but the resiliency of U.S. shale production has indeed surprised.” GasBuddy said refinery issues have caused prices to temporarily surge, lifting gas prices over year-ago levels. Hawaii leads the list at 54 cents higher, followed by Nevada (34 cents), Alaska (32 cents), California (31 cents) and Arizona (21 cents). "There is, however, some good news for everyone. With oil prices plummeting some 5% so far this week, there will likely be lower gasoline prices coming for much of the country.’’ said DeHaan. The price of gasoline is likely to continue to fall. On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration reported that domestic crude supplies unexpectedly climbed by 3.3 million barrels for the week ended June 2, ending eight straight weeks of declines. Major banks such as Goldman Sachs have started slashing their oil price forecasts for this year and next, doubting an OPEC deal to cut production can rebalance markets. JPMorgan cut its 2018 forecast for West Texas Intermediate crude by $11 to $42, according to Oilprice.com. JPMorgan said U.S. crude output is expected to keep growing for several quarters because of lower breakeven costs and higher investment. The price of oil Friday rose slightly by 22 cents to $45.86 in morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

The Nasdaq’s retreat comes on the heels of an early record and marked the biggest one-day decline for the Nasdaq since May 17, when it tumbled more than 2.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.42% rose 89.44 points, or 0.4%, to end at 21,271.97, for a weekly gain of 0.3%. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.08% edged down 2.02 points to finish at 2,431.77, falling 0.3% on the week. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.80%  sank 113.85 points, or 1.8%, to close at 6,207.92. The sudden tech retreat pushed the Nasdaq into negative territory for the week with the tech-heavy index closing down 1.6%. Apple Inc. AAPL, -3.88%  sank 3.9% in its biggest one-day drop since January 2016. The overall technology sector XLK, -2.47% fell 2.5%. Other major tech stocks were also sharply lower. Facebook Inc. FB, -3.30%  skidded 3.3%, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -3.40% the parent of Google, lost 3.4%, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -2.27%  dropped 2.3% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -3.16%  shed 3.2%. “All these stocks have hit new highs recently, so now people are taking a pause and we’re seeing the money flow out,” said Doug DePietro, managing director for trading at Evercore ISI. “There’s nothing in the news that’s saying, ‘sell the big tech stocks’; this is just simple profit-taking, a rotation to other names.” The tech sector’s tumble also follows a warning from Goldman Sachs that highfliers such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet—which had significantly contributed to the market’s multimonth rally—may be overextended. “This outperformance, driven by secular growth and the death of the reflation narrative, has created positioning extremes, factor crowding and difficult-to-decipher risk narratives,” said Robert Boroujerdi, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, in a note. The tech selloff also triggered a return in market turbulence with the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +5.31% spiking more than 5% to 10.70. Wall Street’s so-called fear index had earlier sank to 9.37, the lowest since December 1993. Deeper losses in equities were limited by the energy and financial industries, both of which advanced on the day. Energy shares gained 2.5% while financials were up 1.9%. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. GS, +1.68% rose 2.4% and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +1.68% climbed more than 1.7%. Exxon Mobil XOM, +1.87%  added 1.9% while Chevron Corp. CVX, +2.31%  was up 2.3%. Next up, Fed meeting: Traders see a 95.8% probability of a U.S. interest rate increase at the conclusion of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting next week on June 14, CME Group’s FedWatch showed. The only top-tier economic data scheduled for release Friday is an update on wholesale inventories for April, due at 10 a.m. Eastern Time. Stocks on the move: Shares of Endo International PLC ENDP, -16.62%  slumped 17% after the Food and Drug Administration late Thursday said it asked the company to stop selling its opioid pain medication, reformulated Opana ER, citing concerns about abuse. DuPont Fabros Technology Inc. DFT, +9.83%  soared 9.8% after the developer and operator of multitenant data centers announced a deal to be purchased by Digital Realty Trust Inc. DLR, -2.94%  Digital Realty was down 3.4%. Other markets: The British pound GBPUSD, -1.6671%  sank to a seven-week low against the dollar, dropping to $1.2739 from $1.2957 in late trading on Thursday after Britain’s snap election left Prime Minister Theresa May clinging to power after her Conservative party failed to secure a parliamentary majority.

Analysts called the midday shift a sector rotation in which investors were taking profits from highly-valued sectors and putting the funds in areas that have underperformed, such as financials and energy. In afternoon trading, Apple and Microsoft were each down 3.4 percent, Amazon fell 2.7 percent, Facebook dropped 3.1 percent and Google parent Alphabet 2.8 percent. "It is definitely a rotation," said Nate Thooft, senior managing director, Manulife Asset Management. "When it started to crack a little bit this morning ...people jumped on the bandwagon and started taking some of their wins off the table." Near 1820 GMT, the Nasdaq Composite Index had tumbled 1.6 percent to 6,220.17. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 percent to 21,251.63, about 45 points above its all-time high, while the broad-based S&P 500 dipped 0.1 percent to 2,431.19. Big gainers in the Dow included oil giant Chevron, up 2.2 percent, and banks JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which climbed 2.0 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. Thooft said the gains in those sectors reflected relief that the British election and the congressional testimony of former FBI chief James Comey were over and no longer loomed over the market.

Analyst Saul Martinez raised his rating on Citi to neutral, after assuming coverage of the bank with a sell rating on Jan. 10. He boosted his stock price to $64, which is 0.7% below current levels, from $58. The stock C, +1.96%  rallied $1.24, or 2.0%, to $64.45, the highest close since Jan. 9, 2009. Volume of 31.1 million shares was more than double the full-day average of 15.3 million shares, and enough to make the stock the fifth-most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Martinez said his bearish case was based on Citi having less exposure than its peers to the potential positives of lower taxes, faster economic growth and higher interest rates, all of which were expected from Trump’s promises to cut corporate taxes and increase military and infrastructure spending. In addition, Martinez said Citi had greater exposure than its money-center rivals to potential downside from protectionist policies, also something Trump espoused, and other geopolitical risks.

FactSet, MarketWatch Over the last 12 months, FactSet estimates that only 43.1% of Citi’s total revenue came from the U.S., while 3.9% came the Middle East and Africa. In comparison, the U.S. provided 86.5% of Bank of America Corp.’s BAC, +3.05%  revenue and 77.1% of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.’s JPM, +2.37%  revenue, according to FactSet, while the Middle East and Africa accounted for 1.9% of BofA’s revenue and 3.4% of J.P. Morgan’s revenue. Separately, 2.6% of Citi’s revenue came from Mexico, FactSet estimates, compared with less than 1% for both BofA and J.P. Morgan. Also read: Bets on regulatory relief for Wall Street aren’t going to pay off: analysts “Important underpinnings of our prior sell rating no longer hold,” Martinez wrote in a note to clients. “Global growth looks resilient, starkly protectionist policies have not emerged, and importantly, the path forward for structural reforms in the U.S. is not as clear.” Citi’s stock ran up 12.8% in the first three months after the election, but BofA’s stock had shot up 33.4%, J.P. Morgan shares had hiked up 22.7% and the SPDR S&P Bank exchange-traded KBE, +2.86%  surged 23.8%. FactSet, MarketWatch Meanwhile, Citi shares have rallied 4.7% over the past three months and the bank ETF has dropped 2.7%. UBS’s upgrade comes a day after James Comey, the former FBI director fired by President Trump, testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee regarding his conversations with Trump over the agency’s Russia investigation. Martinez said that while economic growth in emerging markets has increased as risk premiums have decreased, optimism about the path for regulatory reforms and improved structural growth in the U.S. have “dissipated” somewhat, as evidenced by the 0.382-percentage-point drop in the 10-year Treasury note’s yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.48%  over the past three months.

Analyst Saul Martinez raised his rating on Citi to neutral, after assuming coverage of the bank with a sell rating on Jan. 10. He boosted his stock price to $64, which is 0.7% below current levels, from $58. The stock C, +1.96%  rallied $1.24, or 2.0%, to $64.45, the highest close since Jan. 9, 2009. Volume of 31.1 million shares was more than double the full-day average of 15.3 million shares, and enough to make the stock the fifth-most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Martinez said his bearish case was based on Citi having less exposure than its peers to the potential positives of lower taxes, faster economic growth and higher interest rates, all of which were expected from Trump’s promises to cut corporate taxes and increase military and infrastructure spending. In addition, Martinez said Citi had greater exposure than its money-center rivals to potential downside from protectionist policies, also something Trump espoused, and other geopolitical risks. Read more about what Trump’s policies meant for each sector. Don’t miss: Opinion: The data show the ‘Trump bump’ is dead. FactSet, MarketWatch Over the last 12 months, FactSet estimates that only 43.1% of Citi’s total revenue came from the U.S., while 3.9% came the Middle East and Africa. In comparison, the U.S. provided 86.5% of Bank of America Corp.’s BAC, +3.05%  revenue and 77.1% of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.’s JPM, +2.37%  revenue, according to FactSet, while the Middle East and Africa accounted for 1.9% of BofA’s revenue and 3.4% of J.P. Morgan’s revenue. Separately, 2.6% of Citi’s revenue came from Mexico, FactSet estimates, compared with less than 1% for both BofA and J.P. Morgan. Also read: Bets on regulatory relief for Wall Street aren’t going to pay off: analysts “Important underpinnings of our prior sell rating no longer hold,” Martinez wrote in a note to clients. “Global growth looks resilient, starkly protectionist policies have not emerged, and importantly, the path forward for structural reforms in the U.S. is not as clear.” Citi’s stock ran up 12.8% in the first three months after the election, but BofA’s stock had shot up 33.4%, J.P. Morgan shares had hiked up 22.7% and the SPDR S&P Bank exchange-traded KBE, +2.86%  surged 23.8%. FactSet, MarketWatch Meanwhile, Citi shares have rallied 4.7% over the past three months and the bank ETF has dropped 2.7%. UBS’s upgrade comes a day after James Comey, the former FBI director fired by President Trump, testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee regarding his conversations with Trump over the agency’s Russia investigation. Martinez said that while economic growth in emerging markets has increased as risk premiums have decreased, optimism about the path for regulatory reforms and improved structural growth in the U.S. have “dissipated” somewhat, as evidenced by the 0.382-percentage-point drop in the 10-year Treasury note’s yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.48%  over the past three months.

While the record-breaking rally in bitcoin has captivated markets, demand for other digital coins is surging.  (Chris Ratcliffe / Bloomberg file photo)   By Camila RussoBloomberg Fri., June 9, 2017 MADRID—Forget U.S. stocks and emerging-market assets, even ignore bitcoin. Those brave enough to invest in the Wild West of tech are the ones making a killing. While the record-breaking rally in bitcoin has captivated markets, demand for other digital coins is surging as companies raise millions in minutes, or even seconds, from investors wanting in on the next big tech startup. Last week, it took 30 seconds for Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich to issue about $35 million (U.S.) of basic attention token, the unit of exchange in a blockchain-based advertising platform built on top of the company’s Brave browser. Digital tokens tied to the blockchain platform issued this year have more than doubled in price on average since trading started, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tech startups are increasingly selling coins that can be used on their projects instead of resorting to traditional financing methods such as venture capital.

Don't bank on it: Olive Article Continued Below How Bitcoin technology could change banking in Canada The sector isn’t for the faint-hearted. The apps and websites behind most of these tokens are still only in development stage. Most are sold for pennies on the dollar and volatility can be extreme. TaaS, a closed-end fund dedicated to blockchain markets, had the coins it sold this year double in price in five weeks and then fall 35 per cent in two days. But if you can stomach the risk, the rewards have been substantial. Coins from the 15 ICOs this year for which data is available have risen by an average of over 100 per cent, while shares sold in initial public offerings in the U.S. this year have gained 13 per cent on average since they started trading. “There’s been overwhelming demand for coins,” said Ron Quaranta, chairperson of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance. “Sure, a lot of it is based on speculation and traders looking to make a quick gain, but there’s also a fundamental driver, which is the anticipation that the digital-currency market is maturing.” Forty-four coins have been issued this year, according to blockchain research website Smith & Crown. Not all trade immediately after the auctions since some have vesting periods. The tokens with the biggest gain, a 500-per-cent jump since it started trading on March 30, was issued by Edgeless, which is building a decentralized gambling platform. That sale wasn’t open to U.S.-based investors since the company isn’t licensed to operate in the U.S. Prediction market platform Gnosis sold the highest-valued tokens this year. The GNO token started trading at $52 on May 1 and has more than quadrupled. Even with growing acceptance of blockchain from companies ranging from Toyota Motor Corp. to JPMorgan Chase & Co., some advocates of the technology say they’re cautious of the digital tokens because of the exuberance sweeping through the cryptocurrency world. “It seems like a fad, and as a professional investor, it’s not what we do,” said David Dunn, president of Kingsbridge Wealth Management, who first bought bitcoin in 2014 and has invested in blockchain-related companies. “I’d rather invest in the companies using the technology themselves. The speculators might end up being right, and this becomes a solid investment because of the power of the technology, but we’re not at that stage.” Token sales such as the one for Gnosis, which catapulted the company’s market capitalization to over $300 million without it even having a product, or Eich’s BAT coin, which was over in seconds, have raised some eyebrows. Still, the token market will probably continue to grow at least in the near future, said Nick Tomaino, principal at San Francisco-based venture-capital firm Runa Capital, who also runs the Control blog, which tracks digital currencies. More than $100 million of coins has been raised this year, surpassing total sales last year, while total issuance is expected to jump to about $600 million, according to Tomaino. “There’s a lot of hype and a lot of money being raised because it’s so easy for anyone to create these coins without having to deal with any third parties, and it’s so easy for people to buy them,” Tomaino said. “It can’t be stopped.” Read more about: Bitcoin Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

C, +1.96% shot up 2.1% in morning trade Friday to an 8 1/2-year high, after the moneycenter bank was upgraded at UBS on the belief that the previous bearish case had become less likely. Analyst Saul Martinez raised his rating to neutral from sell, and lifted his stock price target to $64--1% below current levels--from $58. Martinez said his bearish case was based on Citi having less leverage than its peers to the potential positives of lower corporate taxes, faster economic growth and higher interest rates, and greater exposure to potential downside from protectionist policies and other geopolitical risks. Only 43.1% of Citi's revenue over the last 12 months came from the U.S., according to the a FactSet analysis, compared with 77.1% for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +2.37% and 86.5% for Bank of America Corp. BAC, +3.05% "This argument is harder to make today," Martinez wrote in a note to clients. "Global growth looks resilient, starkly protectionist policies have not emerged, and importantly, the path forward for structural reforms in the U.S. is not as clear." The stock, which was on course for the highest close since Jan. 9, 2009, has gained 8.6% year to date, while the SPDR S&P Bank ETF KBE, +2.86% has tacked on 0.9% the S&P 500 SPX, -0.08% has gained 9.2%.

C, +1.96% shot up 2.1% in morning trade Friday to an 8 1/2-year high, after the moneycenter bank was upgraded at UBS on the belief that the previous bearish case had become less likely. Analyst Saul Martinez raised his rating to neutral from sell, and lifted his stock price target to $64--1% below current levels--from $58. Martinez said his bearish case was based on Citi having less leverage than its peers to the potential positives of lower corporate taxes, faster economic growth and higher interest rates, and greater exposure to potential downside from protectionist policies and other geopolitical risks. Only 43.1% of Citi's revenue over the last 12 months came from the U.S., according to the a FactSet analysis, compared with 77.1% for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +2.37% and 86.5% for Bank of America Corp. BAC, +3.05% "This argument is harder to make today," Martinez wrote in a note to clients. "Global growth looks resilient, starkly protectionist policies have not emerged, and importantly, the path forward for structural reforms in the U.S. is not as clear." The stock, which was on course for the highest close since Jan. 9, 2009, has gained 8.6% year to date, while the SPDR S&P Bank ETF KBE, +2.86% has tacked on 0.9% the S&P 500 SPX, -0.08% has gained 9.2%.

Popular funds that track the financial sector, including the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF, +1.89% the SPDR S&P Bank ETF KBE, +2.86% and the regionally focused SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF KRE, +3.05% are all on pace to post their best weekly percentage gains since Nov. 11, according to FactSet data. Weekly gains for the XLF were more than 3%, while the other ETFs were on pace to show a gain of more than 5% over the past five trading sessions. Banks had been among the best performers in the wake of Trump's victory, which Wall Street welcomed with his pledge of deregulated markets, tax cuts and a plan to spend some $1 trillion on improving roadways, tunnels and bridges. However, financials had pulled back as Trump's pro-Wall Street agenda looked stalled by White House drama centered on Russia's ties with members of Trump's administration and his firing of ex-FBI Director James Comey, who was investigating those relationships. This week, however, banks have gotten a bid partially on the back of expectations that the Federal Reserve will lift interest rates at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on June 14. A slight reflation of benchmark Treasury yields [BX:TMUBMUSD10Y], which are still at very low levels, also has helped to stoke some hope that financials may see improved profitability, with higher rates viewed as supportive to their business models. Also on Thursday, the House of Representatives passed a bill to roll back so-called Dodd-Frank rules, intended to rein in bank activities after the 2008-'09 financial crisis. In Friday trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was being led higher by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +1.68% boasting its best week since the week ended Nov. 11, and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +2.37% which were contributing near 40 points to the price-weighted blue-chip gauge. Banks were the best performer in the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.08% up 1.4%. Helping both indexes trade in record territory. Dick Bove, prominent bank analyst at Rafferty Capital, said investors should approach the bank rally with caution because he sees few signs that economic activity is picking up sufficiently to justify buying banks. "People believe there's going to be a surge in economic activity and that is going to increase bank earnings, but I don't see that happening yet," he said.

While some investors see bargains in lower valuations of regional banks' shares, few can point with any confidence to near-term catalysts for a turnaround in their fortunes. After outperforming larger banks in the wake of the Nov. 8 US Presidential election, the S&P 600 index of small cap banks are down 8.1 percent so far this year, data through Thursday showed, while the S&P 500 index of the biggest US banks is unchanged. The full S&P 500, meanwhile, is up 8.7 percent. Last year, investors bet heavily that smaller, entirely US-focused banks would benefit most from Donald Trump's promises of tax cuts, deregulation and economic stimulus. But those hopes dwindled dramatically as it became clear that President Trump would have difficulty gaining enough support to deliver on any of his pro-growth proposals. "I would expect (smaller banks) to continue to underperform as long as we don't get some of these policy decisions to move through," said Stephen Scouten, banking analyst for Sandler O'Neill in Atlanta. Fading hopes for an economic boost from Trump's agenda has compressed the gap between short- and long-term interest rates, putting pressure on bank loan profit margins. This is a bigger issue for regionals which have a greater dependence on lending for their profits than bigger, more diversified banks. Also, commercial and industrial loan growth has slowed this year after climbing steadily since late 2010. The Federal Reserve's latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, released May 8, showed domestic banks reporting weaker commercial and industrial loan demand from firms of all sizes in the first quarter. WAITING FOR CLARITY Part of the problem is that companies are waiting for clarity on economic growth prospects and tax rates before making borrowing decisions, according to investors and analysts.   "Eventually, for the smaller banks to outperform, concerns about the overall economy need to dissipate. Better economic growth usually leads to better lending growth and in that environment the yield curve steepens as well," said Brian Kleinhanzl, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. Short selling has decreased in most regional and diversified banking sectors so far this year. But short interest in both the SPDR S&P Bank Exchange Traded Fund and SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF increased as short sellers may be replacing exposure to individual banks with short bets on the sector. Short interest in the S&P bank ETF is up 36 percent for the year while it is up 23 percent in the regional banking ETF. While tax cuts are viewed as one of the biggest boosts for regional banks of all Trump's policy proposals, investors are skeptical it will come any time soon. JPMorgan analysts on Thursday scaled back their forecast on the size of possible US tax cuts and pushed out the timing to the second quarter of 2018 from the third quarter of 2017. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn has said he expects US Congress to get tax reform done this year. But investors say 2018 would likely be the earliest this could happen. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected this month to unveil plans for regulating the US banking sector including a relaxation of regulations for community banks, which have struggled with rules imposed after the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. While investors expect the administration to have trouble winning congressional support for legislative changes to regulations such as Dodd-Frank, some are hoping Trump will be able to appoint people to key regulatory positions. If Trump can replace the Federal Reserve's head of banking supervision, this might at least help slow the pace of regulation, said investment managers. Trump is expected to nominate Carnegie Mellon University professor Marvin Goodfriend and former Treasury Department staffer Randal Quarles to fill two of three open seats at the Fed, according to a New York Times report. "If they do get traction and get some of these (policy changes) done, even if they're more watered-down versions of what they had proposed, that's probably very good for sentiment and good for the fundamentals," said Miles Lewis, portfolio manager for American Century Investments' Small Cap Value fund.   Copyright Reuters, 2017  Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Mail Print the author Shoaib Ur Rehman Siddiqui Previous Mexico sugar deal hard to swallow for last US candy cane maker Next Ivory Coast forecasts 2017/18 cotton output steady at 350,000 T Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The return of a deep contango -- when oil prices for immediate delivery are lower than forward contracts -- comes days after several Wall Street banks warned investors of a deteriorating outlook for 2018 because of strong U.S. shale production growth and the rising output in Nigeria and Libya. The weakness is particularly visible in the widening price difference between Brent crude for delivery in December 2017 and December 2018 -- a popular trade known in the industry as Dec-Red-Dec. The spread fell as low as minus $1.49 a barrel early on Friday, down from plus $1 a barrel two weeks ago. “Brent spreads are getting clobbered,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil market analyst at consultants Energy Aspects Ltd. in London. “The Atlantic Basin is awash in light crudes from Nigeria and Libya.” Royal Dutch Shell Plc. this week lifted its force majeure on Forcados crude from Nigeria after a disruption that lasted 472 days. The return of Forcados will add another 200,000-250,000 barrels a day of high quality, light and sweet crude into the Atlantic just as regional refiners are already awash with similar grades from the U.S., North Sea and Africa. Spread Plunge The Dec-Red-Dec spread is now trading at its weakest since Nov. 30., when OPEC agreed to cut output in an effort to bring oil inventories down to their five-year average. The spread traded at plus $1.56 a barrel in late February amid hopes the cartel, which controls 40 percent of the world’s output, would successfully bring stockpiles down. But the spread came under pressure as those inventories continued to build through March, before falling in line with seasonal patterns. As investors worried about the re-balancing process, trading volumes in the Dec. 2017-Dec. 2018 spread surged to a record high on Thursday, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg. The Brent spread saw the equivalent of 65 million barrels traded, and the WTI equivalent traded 41 million barrels -- far exceeding their average trading volumes over the prior two weeks. “The sentiment is bearish,” said Tamas Varga, an analyst at brokerage PVM Oil Associates Ltd. in London. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies agreed to extend the production cuts for another nine months, investment banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, HSBC Holdings Plc., UBS AG and Barclays Plc have warned about a deteriorating outlook for next year. The banks have almost unanimously blamed rising U.S. shale production and fears about OPEC’s exit strategy from its cuts. U.S. crude production will average more than 10 million barrels a day for the first time in 2018, breaking a record almost five decades old, according to the Energy Information Administration. “The outlook for 2018 is starting to look troublesome,” Martijn Rats, oil strategist at Morgan Stanley in London told investors in a note after the OPEC meeting.

ELLIOTT 6/09/2017 Reprints Stocks moved higher Friday as the Nasdaq punched out a new high as U.S. stocks joined global markets in shaking off surprise U.K. election results. The Dow Jones industrial and the S&P 500 popped 0.2% at the open. The Nasdaq edged up 0.1% to stake out a new high above 6330. Global markets were positive after Thursday's vote in the U.K. unexpectedly weakened Prime Minister Theresa May's conservative control. May had called the snap election with expectations that it would strengthen her support, but the result left Britain's opposing Labour party on much stronger footing as the country prepares to negotiate its exit conditions from the European Union.  Britain's negotiations now face deep uncertainties, though May reportedly reached a deal Friday with a Northern Ireland party to form a majority and potentially defend her role as prime minister. In Asia, where exports lean heavily on EU demand, markets reacted generally positively. China's Shanghai Composite climbed 0.3%, although Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index whittled a 0.1% loss. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 popped 0.5%, not enough to lift it to positive ground for the week, but leaving it back above the 20,000 level. Europe's markets added to their early gains in afternoon trade, with London's FTSE 100 rallying 0.7%, Frankfurt's DAX up 0.5% and the CAC-40 in Paris ahead 0.5%. Financials Lead Dow, Nvidia Climbs, SoftBank Buys Alphabet Unit In U.S. stocks, JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) surged 1% and 1.5%, respectively, seizing the early lead among Dow industrials. NikeNKE chalked off the index's low end, dropping 0.6%. IBD 50 stock Nvidia (NVDA) sprung 5% higher, taking a new high in heavy trade.. The diversifying graphics chip maker bolted 7% higher in heavy trade, to new highs Thursday after a beaming price target hike from Citigroup. The stock is extended after clearing a three-month-long base early in May. SoftBank (SFTBY) shares jumped 2% after the company announced it would buy Boston Dynamics, the innovative robotics unit of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Terms of the deal, which also includes the award winning Japanese robotics lab Schaft, weren't disclosed. Softbank shares are extended after clearing a 39.13 cup-with-handle buy point in May. Alphabet shares traded down 0.2%. Dupont Fabros Technology (DFT) soared 12% in premarket trade after tech property REIT Digital Realty Trust (DLR) said it would acquire the Washington D.C.-based entity in a $4.95 billion cash-and-stock deal. the gain put Dupont shares are up 21% since clearing a 51.50 buy point in April. Digital shares have pulled back for the past four sessions, after logging an intraday high on June 5. Digital shares slipped 1% at the open. Verifone (PAY) shed 7% ahead of the open, after reporting narrower-than-forecast declines in fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue. Palladium futures, which had gained 14% from May 22 through Thursday, surged almost 6%. The ETFS Physical Palladium Fund (PALL) gained 4% in early trade. Oil Quiet Ahead Of Rig Count; Gold Slips, Dollar Rises Oil was quiet, with West Texas Intermediate up 0.1% and well below $46 a barrel, ahead of Baker Hughes' (BHI) weekly rig count report, due out at 1 p.m. Gold slipped 0.6% to below $1,272 an ounce.

The latest gains came as the stock market continued to trade mostly in a narrow range in the absence of major new economic data and ahead of next week’s meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers. Speculation that the Fed will raise interest rates helped boost financial stocks for the second day in a row. Higher interest rates allow banks and credit card issuers to charge more for loans, which boosts profits. Utilities and consumer goods companies were among the biggest decliners. Energy stocks also fell as crude oil prices declined. “(Today) is a continuation of fairly muted market action,” Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “We’ve been in a very low volatility period of time. We’re also a bit between material economic events.” The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 0.65 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,433.79. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.84 points, or 0.04 percent, to 21,182.53. Both indexes remain slightly below their record highs set last Friday. The Nasdaq added 24.38 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,321.76. Small-company stocks fared better than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index climbed 18.94 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,415.61. Bond prices fell. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.19 percent from 2.18 percent late Wednesday. Stocks wavered between small gains and losses through much of the day as investors tuned in to watch former FBI Director James Comey testify before Congress as part of the investigation into Russian meddling into the U.S. presidential election. In his testimony, Comey’s first public statements since his May 9 dismissal, he told Congress that President Donald Trump’s administration spread “lies” about him and the FBI after his abrupt firing in May. Comey also asserted that Trump fired him to interfere with his investigation of Russia’s role in the 2016 election and its ties to the Trump campaign. Stock indexes barely budged throughout the hearing, the public portion of which wrapped around midday. “Today did not turn into a market event, nor did it accelerate the path toward further progress on the legislative and administrative agenda,” Northey said. Investors have been looking for more progress out of the White House on its agenda to cut taxes, increase infrastructure spending and implement other business-friendly policies. The Republican-led House took steps Thursday to advance Trump’s pledge to ease regulations on businesses by taking a vote on legislation that would undo the stricter banking rules that took effect after the devastating 2008 financial crisis. That helped lift bank stocks. Goldman Sachs Group picked up $2.98, or 1.4 percent, to $218.76. JPMorgan Chase added $1.04, or 1.2 percent, to $84.95. Regions Financial gained 44 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $14.03. Traders also welcomed news that members of the Nordstrom family are considering taking the company private. Like Macy’s and other big department store chains, Nordstrom has struggled to cope with competition from online retailers. The company, which has 354 stores in the U.S. and Canada, has seen its stock tumble by half since early 2015. On Thursday, the stock soared $4.15, or 10.3 percent, to $44.63. Several companies that reported improved earnings or outlooks also traded higher. Verint Systems rose 3.2 percent after the maker of software for analyzing intercepted communications had a strong first quarter. The stock added $1.35 to $43.45. Investors cheered Alibaba Group Holding’s latest revenue forecast. Shares in the Chinese e-commerce company gained $16.70, or 13.3 percent, to $142.34. Some companies failed to impress traders. Urban Outfitters slid 10.3 percent after the retailer said sales at older stores are running lower than expected this month. That followed weak sales in May. The stock shed $1.88 to $16.35. Benchmark U.S. crude wavered for much of the day before sliding 8 cents to settle at $45.64 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 20 cents to close at $47.86 per barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline held steady at $1.49 per gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.42 per gallon. Natural gas added 1 cent to $3.03 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar rose to 109.94 yen from Wednesday’s 109.83 yen. The euro weakened to $1.1222 from $1.1252. In metals trading, gold fell $13.70, or 1.1 percent, to $1,279.50 per ounce. Silver lost 21 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $17.41 per ounce. Copper gained 6 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.61 per pound. European stock markets were mixed after the European Central Bank kept its stimulus program unchanged. ECB President Mario Draghi said Thursday that risks to the European economic recovery have diminished. Germany’s DAX rose 0.3 percent, while France’s CAC 40 slipped 0.2 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.4 percent as Britain went to the polls in a general election. In Asia, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3 percent, while South Korea’s Kospi edged up 0.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.3 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent.     Tags: percent, stock, cents, after, stocks, added, Other stories from today: Modest gains, led by banks, push indexes higher Verizon’s first move with Yahoo is to ditch 2,100 jobs GOP-run House votes to roll back post-2008 financial rules     Print this Page  |  << Back            Daily Journal Quick Poll   What is your favorite part of the San Mateo County Fair?

The legislation, which faces major hurdles in the Senate because of united Democratic opposition, would continue the Republicans’ deregulatory push under President Donald Trump by dismantling key parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. That law, passed with almost no Republican support, was the biggest overhaul of financial regulations since the Great Depression and one of President Barack Obama’s signature accomplishments. Dodd-Frank is strongly supported by consumer advocates, but opposed by banks and other financial firms. Its key reforms included a prohibition on federally insured banks from engaging in risky trading, a new liquidation authority to safely shut down teetering financial giants to avoid future bailouts and the creation of the independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to oversee credit cards, mortgages and other financial products. The House legislation, called the Financial Choice Act, would undo or scale back much of Dodd-Frank. The bill was approved 233-186. All but one Republican — Walter Jones of North Carolina — voted for the bill. No Democrats supported it. Its major changes include repealing the trading restrictions, known as the Volcker Rule, and scrapping the liquidation authority in favor of enhanced bankruptcy provisions designed to eliminate any chance taxpayers would be on the hook if a major financial firm collapsed. The bill also would repeal a new Labor Department regulation, largely still pending, that requires investment brokers who handle retirement funds to put their clients’ interests ahead of their own compensation, company profits or other factors. And in a move vociferously protested by Democrats, the measure would gut the powerful consumer bureau. The agency — the centerpiece of Dodd-Frank — has provided consumers about $12 million in refunds, mortgage principal reductions and other relief since opening in 2011. It played a key role in penalizing Wells Fargo & Co. for its creation of about 2.1 million unauthorized accounts. The Financial Choice Act would strip the agency of its ability to closely monitor financial firms for compliance with consumer protection laws and specifically prohibits the bureau from writing any regulations on payday and car-title loans. The bureau’s director would be subject to removal by the president for any reason and the agency’s independent funding stream would be eliminated, making it subject to congressional appropriations where Republicans could reduce its budget. “We will replace bailout with bankruptcy. We will replace economic stagnation with a growing healthy economy,” said Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, the legislation’s author. “We’ll replace Washington micromanagement with market discipline.” Trump said during the campaign that he wanted to dismantle Dodd-Frank. In February, he directed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to consult with regulators about changes to the law and to report back by this month. House Republican leaders decided not to wait. They pushed forward with a revised version of legislation introduced last year by Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. Democrats labeled the legislation “The Wrong Choice Act” and said it risked creating another financial crisis by removing important regulations and consumer protections. “Donald Trump and Republicans want to open the door to another economic catastrophe like the Great Recession and return us to a financial system where reckless and predatory practices harm our communities and families,” said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who has led opposition to the bill. Unlike changes to Obama’s health care law, making most changes to Dodd-Frank would require 60 votes in the Senate. Republicans in the Senate are working on their own financial regulatory bill that could gain the needed Democratic support. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said last month that he was not optimistic about making changes to Dodd-Frank. The White House this week said it supported House passage of the legislation “as a necessary and important step in moving financial reform legislation through the Congress.” A key feature of the Financial Choice Act is the ability for any bank to avoid strict federal regulatory oversight if it holds capital of at least 10 percent of assets. The current requirement is 3 percent for most banks and 6 percent for institutions considered systemically important. Big banks aren’t thrilled with such a high hurdle to avoid regulations and have not embraced the legislation. An analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the eight largest banks — including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. — would be unlikely to choose the option because they would have to raise large amounts of capital given their size. House Republicans pointed to Wall Street’s concerns about the capital levels, as well as the Financial Choice Act’s tougher federal penalties for financial fraud, to counter charges that they were doing Wall Street’s bidding. They said the legislation was needed because Dodd-Frank rules had made mortgages tougher to obtain, forced banks to scale back fees that had helped allow them to offer free checking accounts, and placed a heavy burden on community banks. “This law may have had good intentions, but its consequences have been dire for Main Street,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. But Democrats said Republicans were making the country vulnerable to another financial crisis. “This legislation unleashes every bloodthirsty, greedy Wall Street super-predator on the American people,” said Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis. Democrats said that bank profits are up and lending has increased since Dodd-Frank was enacted. Bank profits hit a record $171 billion in 2016, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. And in the first quarter of this year, profits were up 13 percent from a year earlier, the FDIC said.

As Americans hop online to book flights for this summer’s weddings and weekend getaways, many will have their first encounter with “basic economy,” a new breed of airfare being offered by the three largest U.S. airlines. Typically $15 to $30 lower than traditional economy, these tickets are designed to allow American, Delta, and United to better compete with ultra-low-cost carriers such as Frontier Airlines Holdings Inc and Spirit Airlines Inc. They target travelers for whom price is more important than convenience, since they carry a pile of additional restrictions—no advance seat assignments, last to board, no changes or upgrades. (And, on United Continental Holdings Inc., no access to overhead bin space.) Quotes in the article Spirit Airlines Inc SAVE ▼ 54.78 -1.07 -1.92% United Continental Holdings Inc UAL ▼ 78.83 -1.69 -2.10% American Airlines Group Inc AAL ▼ 50.27 -1.16 -2.26% JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU = 22.77 0.00 0.00% Predictably, basic economy has been condemned as yet another step in the industry’s relentless drive to strip all comfort and grace from steerage class. But there’s a shell game going on here—this consternation overlooks a far more insidious change: While adding these new bargain-basement fares, carriers also raised prices on traditional economy seats. The strategy? If a consumer sees that there’s an even lower class, they’ll pay a little more for the next level up. In other words, this is where basic retailing goes airborne. As restaurant wine lists have demonstrated for decades, most people shy away from price extremes. The cheapest bottles are automatically suspect—Is this swill? What will my dining companions think?—while the most expensive vintages are often obscenely unaffordable, obvious cases of extreme markup. The same thing is now happening with airfares. American Airlines Group Inc. has said that roughly half of buyers in its initial test markets trade up from the lowest basic fare to the more expensive economy counterpart, while United said 60 percent to 70 percent of its buyers choose standard economy over basic. (It’s worth noting that United’s basic fare has more onerous restrictions than those at American and Delta.) This pricing shift represents a structural change for an industry that’s struggled to make fare increases stick. Network carrier efforts to boost airfares are often undone by a variety of factors: JetBlue Airways Corp. or Southwest Airlines Co. may decline to join in the hike, a growth airline might offer even lower fares, and a market swoon or terrorist attack might dent demand. Airlines, naturally, are touting the new basic fares as a victory for consumer choice. But it’s more complicated than that. Load Error As they become more savvy merchants, the Big Three carriers consider basic economy fares and increased sales of “premium economy” sections—with more legroom and amenities—to be worth at least $1 billion in additional revenue. “Customer segmentation, to me, is one of the hallmarks of what’s different about the industry this time,” Paul Jacobson, chief financial officer at Delta Air Lines Inc., said Wednesday at a Deutsche Bank AG investor conference. Delta began studying basic economy fares five years ago, and launched its current version of the fare in 2014. American began its first basic economy markets in February, with only a modest expansion thus far. Its basic economy fares aren’t yet offered in several major markets, including Chicago, New York, Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Over time, however, airlines expect to expand basic economy to their entire networks. Basic economy fares are often unavailable on corporate-travel booking systems because business travelers require more flexibility. As a result, the new class is “a corporate fare increase by another name” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Jamie Baker said in a December client note. (He’s a fan of the strategy, though.) United has been particularly aggressive in its embrace of basic economy since launching the fares in February from Minneapolis to its seven U.S. hubs. Late last month, the airline expanded the fare on all flights in the continental U.S. and Alaska and has “been positively inclined with the level of upsell and the customer response to it,” President Scott Kirby said at the investor conference. United also sells a basic and an economy fare for every seat on a flight, he said, unlike current practice at American and Delta, which appear to have fewer of the rock-bottom fares available. The basic economy baggage stricture does carry a bonus for everyone on board, though: It increases the ability to turn airplanes around faster and depart on-time. “We are really quite excited about basic economy,” Kirby said, noting that the airline has forecast $1 billion in new revenue from its new cabin merchandising efforts. “I’m not going to change the forecast. In fact, we feel really confident that we’re going to make $1 billion in segmentation.” His confidence may be well placed. When United expanded basic economy to 49 states last month, JPMorgan’s Baker—because of the new fare structure in traditional economy classes—classified the move as a $15 to $25 fare increase.

An attempt to administer tough medicine — by letting Lehman Brothers file for bankruptcy — backfired. Financial panic rapidly accelerated, forcing the government to change tack and stand behind the rest of the financial system.  In the years that followed the crisis, President Obama and Congress put into place safeguards to prevent Washington from again being forced into such a choice by institutions that were “too big to fail.” Today, large financial institutions are subject to much more stringent regulation, and if they get into trouble, the government has important new tools to wind them down without taking down the rest of the financial system. As a result, firms cannot take outsize risks on the assumption that if their bets go wrong, the government will sweep in and prop them up. Quotes in the article American International Group Inc AIG ▲ 64.18 +0.52 +0.82% Dominion Energy Inc D ▼ 79.28 -0.39 -0.49% AdChoices Yesterday, the House passed a bill that aims to eviscerate the very reforms that make a repeat of the 2008 scenario less likely. The so-called Financial CHOICE Act — approved by a party-line vote — eliminates two of the key reforms specifically designed to prevent another bailout. Although the bill is supported by the Trump administration, it would directly undercut an executive order President Trump issued on February 3. One of the “Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial System” laid out in that order was: “prevent taxpayer-funded bailouts.” The CHOICE act, however, would invite future bailouts. Republicans have forgotten the lessons of the 2008 crisis To understand how we’ve gotten here, we need a little history. In the fall of 2008, financial regulators were faced with a series of impossible choices: take extraordinary action to prevent the failure of large, complex financial institutions, or let them fail — and let the country face economic cataclysm. In the case of Lehman Brothers, the government let it file for bankruptcy, with devastating consequences that are all too clear in hindsight. At the time, Lehman Brothers was the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States. With more than $600 billion in assets, it was also the largest company ever to file for bankruptcy. Lehman’s failure exposed thousands of creditors to hundreds of billions of dollars in losses, and inspired speculation about who might be next. The stock market immediately crashed more than 500 points, the most since 9/11. Market participants of all stripes raced to pull their money out of other firms perceived to be at risk. This was a classic It’s a Wonderful Life–style bank run, but across the vast capital markets that underpinned a majority of US economic activity. A day after Lehman’s filing, the Federal Reserve paid $85 billion for 80 percent ownership of American Insurance Group (AIG), which had gotten itself into trouble by gambling massively in esoteric derivatives markets. In essence, AIG had written insurance on billions of dollars of securities backed by subprime mortgages, doing so through an unregulated unit operating out of London. As those mortgages went sour, AIG’s losses mounted, and the purchasers of its “insurance” demanded to be paid. Unable to raise cash in time to make the payments, AIG sought help from the government. Virtually every major Wall Street player had “insurance” of some sort from AIG, so its failure threatened to set off a chain reaction. Treasury and the Fed eventually provided more than $180 billion of assistance to AIG. Even that was not enough to end the system-wide crisis, and Congress eventually dedicated $700 billion to prop up banks across the country. Both Lehman and AIG should have been put out of their misery. But while there was clear authority and a well-tested system in place for resolving failing banks — indeed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) had done so hundreds of times — there was no similar authority for investment banks like Lehman Brothers, or for the unregulated AIG Financial Products unit. Reforms made failure — and system-wide chaos — less likely The Obama administration and Congress sought to fix those problems in two primary ways: First, the law known as Dodd-Frank created a legal mechanism for financial regulators to dismantle large, complex financial institutions outside of bankruptcy court. This authority is known as orderly liquidation authority (OLA). As Lehman showed, ordinary bankruptcy is ill-suited to complex financial institutions. Judges lack the detailed knowledge regulators have of firms’ balance sheets and operations, and of the broader financial system, that is necessary to execute an orderly resolution in a timely way. Regulators also prepare in advance for how they would respond to a failure, including by coordinating with overseas regulators unlikely to be available to a judge. Judges are also slow. Congress’s second reform was to mandate that certain nonbank financial companies (like Lehman and AIG) whose failure might pose a risk to the system should be subject to heightened supervision: more capital, greater liquidity, regular stress tests. A council of regulators called the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, would have the power to designate firms for enhanced oversight. Together, these reforms would make the failure of large, complex firms less likely and would provide a credible alternative to a bailout: an orderly “unwind.” “Orderly liquidation” is not a bailout. It’s the opposite of a bailout. In a recent letter to shareholders, JPMorgan Chase chair and CEO Jamie Dimon argued that Lehman Brothers could not take down the financial system today. His confidence, he wrote, rests partly on the fact that America now has “a system to wind firms down in an orderly fashion” — namely OLA. Former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, who knows firsthand the perils of facing a crisis with a limited toolkit, has called OLA “the best way to reduce the odds” of future bailouts. The always-colorful Barney Frank called the process “death panels” for banks. The surest way to convince the market that the government will indeed let an institution fail — thereby imposing market discipline on that firm — is to have a credible plan for handling that failure. OLA is untested to date. But the FDIC and other regulators, domestically and abroad, have taken major steps to prepare — including by conducting simulated failures. There is no question that regulators are better prepared to handle the failure of a major institution than they were in 2008. Nonetheless, the CHOICE Act eliminates OLA, and the White House’s budget proposed to do the same, in the name of preventing bailouts. How can congressional Republicans and the White House claim that eliminating OLA would prevent bailouts, when expert consensus is that doing so would increase their likelihood? The answer lies in the misleading budget semantics used by supporters of the CHOICE act. OLA authorizes the government to provide limited and temporary liquidity to firms being wound down, to keep viable businesses running during the resolution process. In a typical bankruptcy, this kind of financing is provided by private lenders, but in the midst of a crisis the private sector may be unwilling to provide that bridge financing. © Provided by Vox.com House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-TX) has championed the CHOICE Act. The full amount of any liquidity support provided by the government is required by law to be recouped — first from the firm itself, and then from the industry. So the taxpayer is not on the hook. Nevertheless, Congress uses a ten-year window to estimate the cost of legislation, and a resolution occurring in year eight or nine may not be fully repaid within that window. Thus, the Congressional Budget Office “scores” OLA as having a budgetary cost. This allowed Republican opponents of Dodd-Frank to paint OLA as a bailout, when in fact it was the most direct way to ensure there would be no bailouts. By proposing in its budget to “prevent taxpayer bailouts” by eliminating OLA, the administration has now elevated a misleading political talking point to official policy. One key financial regulation can be repealed with a simple majority in the Senate The CHOICE Act faces long odds of passing the Senate, but OLA itself can arguably be repealed with only 51 votes. For the complicated reasons described above, repealing OLA scores as “saving” money, so Congress may be able to use so-called budget reconciliation procedures to bypass the filibuster and repeal OLA with a simple majority. The CHOICE Act also completely eliminates the authority of FSOC to designate institutions deserving of special scrutiny. This administration may well take a different view than the Obama administration regarding the risks posed by firms that have thus far been so designated by FSOC: Prudential, AIG, and MetLife. But such a difference of opinion in itself is no reason to scrap this policy wholesale. All designations are subject to annual reevaluation. Eliminating this authority altogether would leave some of the largest and most highly leveraged and interconnected institutions free from comprehensive oversight. In his shareholder letter, Dimon also argues that if a situation comparable to Lehman’s arose today, the bank would be required to have twice as much capital as it did prior to the crisis, buffers of highly liquid assets, and more stable funding. It would have a cushion that would make collapse less likely. But that would only be true if the 2017 version of Lehman had been designated as worthy of special scrutiny by FSOC. It would be a grave mistake to willfully eliminate the one tool available to fill a regulatory gap that played such a central role in the last crisis. Taken together, these two elements of the CHOICE Act would prevent FSOC from bringing firms like Lehman Brothers or AIG — or the US investment banking operations of giant Chinese lenders — under comprehensive oversight. It would eliminate the only tool available to unwind any such firms safely in a crisis. If enacted, the CHOICE Act and the policies advocated by the administration make it more likely that when the next crisis comes, Congress will again be forced to choose between the AIG and Lehman paths, between bailout and catastrophe. During the campaign, President Trump appealed to many voters’ nostalgia for a greater past. I doubt even his supporters yearn for a return to the days of September 2008, when the whole country picked up the tab for Wall Street’s bad bets.

S. Presidential election, the S&P 600 index of small cap banks are down 8.1 percent so far this year, data through Thursday showed, while the S&P 500 index of the biggest U. S. banks is unchanged. A rough few months for most U.S. bank stocks has been particularly unkind to regional banks, and that's not likely to change soon as hopes dim for higher long-term interest rates and timely policy relief from Washington. While some investors see bargains in lower valuations of regional banks' shares, few can point with any confidence to near-term catalysts for a turnaround in their fortunes. After outperforming larger banks in the wake of the Nov. 8 U.S. Presidential election, the S&P 600 index of small cap banks are down 8.1 percent so far this year, data through Thursday showed, while the S&P 500 index of the biggest U.S. banks is unchanged. The full S&P 500, meanwhile, is up 8.7 percent. Last year, investors bet heavily that smaller, entirely U.S.-focused banks would benefit most from Donald Trump's promises of tax cuts, deregulation and economic stimulus. But those hopes dwindled dramatically as it became clear that President Trump would have difficulty gaining enough support to deliver on any of his pro-growth proposals. "I would expect (smaller banks) to continue to underperform as long as we don't get some of these policy decisions to move through," said Stephen Scouten, banking analyst for Sandler O'Neill in Atlanta. Fading hopes for an economic boost from Trump's agenda has compressed the gap between short- and long-term interest rates, putting pressure on bank loan profit margins. This is a bigger issue for regionals which have a greater dependence on lending for their profits than bigger, more diversified banks. Also, commercial and industrial loan growth has slowed this year after climbing steadily since late 2010. The Federal Reserve's latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, released May 8, showed domestic banks reporting weaker commercial and industrial loan demand from firms of all sizes in the first quarter. WAITING FOR CLARITY Part of the problem is that companies are waiting for clarity on economic growth prospects and tax rates before making borrowing decisions, according to investors and analysts. "Eventually, for the smaller banks to outperform, concerns about the overall economy need to dissipate. Better economic growth usually leads to better lending growth and in that environment the yield curve steepens as well," said Brian Kleinhanzl, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. Short selling has decreased in most regional and diversified banking sectors so far this year. But short interest in both the SPDR S&P Bank Exchange Traded Fund and SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF increased as short sellers may be replacing exposure to individual banks with short bets on the sector. Short interest in the S&P bank ETF is up 36 percent for the year while it is up 23 percent in the regional banking ETF. While tax cuts are viewed as one of the biggest boosts for regional banks of all Trump's policy proposals, investors are skeptical it will come any time soon. JPMorgan analysts on Thursday scaled back their forecast on the size of possible U.S. tax cuts and pushed out the timing to the second quarter of 2018 from the third quarter of 2017. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn has said he expects U.S. Congress to get tax reform done this year. But investors say 2018 would likely be the earliest this could happen. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected this month to unveil plans for regulating the U.S. banking sector including a relaxation of regulations for community banks, which have struggled with rules imposed after the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. While investors expect the administration to have trouble winning congressional support for legislative changes to regulations such as Dodd-Frank, some are hoping Trump will be able to appoint people to key regulatory positions. If Trump can replace the Federal Reserve's head of banking supervision, this might at least help slow the pace of regulation, said investment managers. Trump is expected to nominate Carnegie Mellon University professor Marvin Goodfriend and former Treasury Department staffer Randal Quarles to fill two of three open seats at the Fed, according to a New York Times report. "If they do get traction and get some of these (policy changes) done, even if they're more watered-down versions of what they had proposed, that's probably very good for sentiment and good for the fundamentals," said Miles Lewis, portfolio manager for American Century Investments' Small Cap Value fund.
