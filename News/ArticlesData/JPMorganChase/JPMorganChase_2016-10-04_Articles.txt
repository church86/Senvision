 JPMorgan is developing a new blockchain project BI Intelligence Oct. 5, 2016, 11:33 AM 1,497 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Deloitte and its UK partners have tested a blockchain-based payments system Here's why blockchain will be widely used by 2021 The UK and China have reached a new fintech agreement This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Fintech Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. JPMorgan Chase is working with Ethereum startup EthLab on a new blockchain project called Quorum, the Wall Street Journal and CoinDesk report. The two parties will develop a private, permissioned blockchain built off of the public Ethereum network's code. This is the latest project to come out of JPMorgan Chase's working group, the Blockchain Center of Excellence. Unlike other banks, JPMorgan is not building an entirely new blockchain system from scratch — it is using the concept of a permissioned blockchain. The bank is utilizing a publically accessible code to develop its solution. But unlike public blockchains such as the one used by Bitcoin, JPMorgan's will be private and permissioned, meaning the bank will be able to limit access to transactions to selected parties, such as parties in a trade or a regulator. This will make it private and secure enough for traders to use for transactions, and accessible enough for regulators to provide oversight. Such functionality is considered a vital element needed before banks will adopt blockchain technology widely. This approach stands to give JPMorgan significant advantages over its rivals. Using existing code to build a blockchain solution is significantly cheaper than developing its own network. Moreover, by using a publically accessible network, JPMorgan can build a blockchain that could theoretically be plugged into other systems built on the same network. For context, institutions building their own networks may find their end solutions to be incompatible with each other. This ease-of-use could potentially give JPMorgan an edge over other banks experimenting with blockchain, as its solution may be more likely to be widely adopted.  However, JPMorgan has not addressed concern over Ethereum's security flaws. The network has suffered significant security breaches recently — in its most severe hack, the equivalent of $80 million worth of cryptocurrency was stolen, and the most recent attack occurred just last month. The bank will need to address these concerns before it moves into any live testing phase that involves customers' money.  Blockchain technology, which is best known for powering Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is gaining steam among finance firms because of its potential to streamline processes and increase efficiency. The technology could cut costs by up to $20 billion annually by 2022, according to Santander. That's because blockchain, which operates as a distributed ledger, has the ability to allow multiple parties to transfer and store sensitive information in a space that’s secure, permanent, anonymous, and easily accessible. That could simplify paper-heavy, expensive, or logistically complicated financial systems, like remittances and cross-border transfer, shareholder management and ownership exchange, and securities trading, to name a few. And outside of finance, governments and the music industry are investigating the technology’s potential to simplify record-keeping. As a result, venture capital firms and financial institutions alike are pouring investment into finding, developing, and testing blockchain use cases. Over 50 major financial institutions are involved with collaborative blockchain startups, have begun researching the technology in-house, or have helped fund startups with products rooted in blockchain.  Jaime Toplin, research associate for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on blockchain technology that explains how blockchain works, why it has the potential to provide a watershed moment for the financial industry, and the different ways it could be put into practice in the coming years. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Spending on capital markets applications of blockchain is expected to grow at a 52% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2019, according to Aite Group, to reach $400 million that year. Banks and major financial institutions are working both collaboratively and independently to develop blockchain tech. Over 50 major financial institutions are involved with collaborative blockchain startups, like R3 CEV or Chain. And many are investing in the technology on their own as well. Putting blockchain to use for real-world transactions is likely not that far off. If working groups' tests are successful, firms could be using it to transact real value as early as the end of this year and we could see widespread industry application within the next few years.  In full, the report: Examines the funding increases that are pouring into blockchain Assesses why blockchain is becoming so popular and what factors are driving up increased research and development Explains in full how blockchain technology work and what assets make it valuable and vulnerable Identifies pain points in the financial industry and profiles how various firms are using blockchain to solve them Demonstrates the challenges to mainstream adoption and their potential solutions To get your copy of this invaluable guide, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT The choice is yours.

Life Buy/Sell Business Close ALAN SOLOMON The Illinois State Capitol in Springfield was completed in 1888.  Illinois renegotiates derivative deals as rating approaches junk Bloomberg Oct 5, 2016 (…) The Illinois State Capitol in Springfield was completed in 1888.  ALAN SOLOMON Illinois renegotiated interest-rate derivative contracts with banks to avoid having to pay about $150 million of fees if its credit rating gets cut closer to junk. The step comes after S&P Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service lowered Illinois to the second-lowest investment grade, below any other state. Without the agreement, another downgrade could have allowed Barclays Bank, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank to demand multi-million fees to break the $600 million worth of contracts, which the state entered into more than a decade ago to protect against rising interest bills on variable-rate bonds. The changes, which were finalized on Sept. 28 after months of negotiation, will allow Illinois to avoid the fees as long as it's not dropped below investment grade, according to bond documents. Chicago, the state's biggest city, was forced to refinance derivative-laden debt deals after its rating was downgraded to junk by Moody's last year. "It's a good thing that they were able to do that without getting hit with a termination event, which can put strain on liquidity and cash," said Adam Buchanan, senior vice president of sales and trading at Ziegler, a broker-dealer in Chicago. "It's a positive thing." Illinois is straining under a more than $100 billion shortfall in its pension system that has diminished its standing on Wall Street. The state has been operating without a full-year budget since July 1, 2015 because of political discord between Rauner and the Democrat-controlled legislature, and the current spending plan is set to last for only about half the fiscal year. As a result, the government is on track to spend about $7.8 billion more than it brings in, according to the Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability. S&P lowered its rating on Illinois to BBB on Sept. 30 and has a negative outlook, signaling further downgrades are possible. Moody's rates Illinois an equivalent Baa2. Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis Who's hired? Check our People in Business Under the new terms, a termination event — which would force the state to pay the penalties if banks decide to break off the deals — would occur for swaps with Barclays, Bank of America and JPMorgan if Moody's or S&P drop the state to junk. Illinois would have to pay Deutsche Bank if ratings drop three steps to below Ba1 for Moody's or below BB+ for S&P. Deutsche Bank's swap is the largest, accounting for about $99 million of the potential fees. Until the 2008 financial crisis, state and local governments frequently purchased interest-rate swaps when they sold variable-rate bonds. The tactic was intended to prevent governments from being hit with rising expenses if interest rates increased, though the contracts also exposed them to risks that proved costly when credit markets seized up. "Governor Rauner inherited these swaps and letters of credit, which have been hanging over the heads of Illinois taxpayers for years," Catherine Kelly, a spokeswoman for Governor Bruce Rauner, said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. She didn't disclose the terms of the deal, which the statement described as "more favorable." Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Here is a section: “It’s not just the FTSE 100 -- this is a buy U.K. phenomenon,” said Alan Higgins, chief investment officer at Coutts & Co. in London. His firm oversees 14.6 billion pounds ($19 billion). “We have a really nice combination of sterling weakness, reasonably robust economy and generally not a bad environment for risk assets.” The FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250 climbed 1.8 percent at 3:06 p.m. in London, while the FTSE Small Cap excluding investment trusts index advanced 1.7 percent. The falling pound is helping the three gauges because their members get a big chunk of their revenues from overseas -- almost three-quarters for FTSE 100 companies, and about half for those on the FTSE 250, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS Group AG. JPMorgan Asset Management has estimated the measure of smaller shares also gets about half of its sales from abroad. The pound fell to its lowest level since 1985 on Tuesday, surpassing the bottom reached following the June 23 vote, after three senior figures in Prime Minister Theresa May’s administration said financial-services companies will get no special favors in secession talks. That increased concern that the nation is heading for an exit that would restrict access to the EU’s single market. May said on Sunday she will trigger the process of leaving the bloc by the end of March, which will mark the formal start of a two-year negotiation process. Recent data have reinforced optimism that the domestic economy is weathering the aftermath of the vote. The construction industry unexpectedly grew in September, while a manufacturing gauge jumped to its highest level in more than two years. A Citigroup Inc. index tracking economic surprises in Britain is near a three-year high, and the International Monetary Fund upgraded its outlook for the nation, predicting growth of 1.8 percent this year from the 1.7 percent projected in July. Eoin Treacy's view With the weekend announcement that the UK government is planning to begin negotiating to leave the EU in Q1 2017, and to a large extent signalling it is willing to risk the passporting rights of the City’s financial services companies, a high stakes period of brinksmanship is unfolding. That is putting pressure on the Pound and it extended its downtrend today by breaking to a new low. While a short-term oversold condition is evident a clear upward dynamic would be required to check the slide and signal of low of near-term significance. Australia Stands Pat on Rates as Commodity Rebound Gathers Pace This article by Michael Heath for Bloomberg may be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section: Lowe’s key challenge -- like many of his developed world counterparts -- is generating inflation; part of that involves trying to tame a currency that’s up more than 10 percent in around nine months. The Aussie’s revival, even if partly justified by a jump in iron ore and coal prices and a better outlook for key trading partner China, puts pressure on services industries that are key growth drivers for the post-mining boom economy. The new governor offered insights to his strategy in the RBA’s renewed agreement with the government, stressing financial stability concerns as part of monetary policy. The risk of further stoking Sydney’s housing boom should discourage him from further cuts, especially as the economy grew an annual 3.3 percent last quarter and unemployment has fallen to 5.6 percent amid rising terms of trade, or export prices compared to import prices. Coking coal prices have surged more than 150 percent this year as output from China, the world’s biggest miner, tumbles under government pressure to cut overcapacity. Iron ore, Australia’s biggest export, has rebounded 30 percent, though analysts are skeptical about the rally’s durability. Still, the jump in prices for Australia’s biggest exports is a boon for the economy and a government struggling to rein in its budget deficit. Eoin Treacy's view The recovery in commodity prices from depressed levels at the end of last year has been a benefit to just about all commodity exporters. Australia’s dependence of some of the major resources China’s economy requires not least  iron-ore, coal and natural gas means that the rebound in all three has been a major influence on the advance in the stock market this year. Eoin's personal portfolio commodity longs increased Email of the day on the possible nationalisation of Deutsche Bank Hello I have a question, I think they will nationalize Deutsche Bank but doesn't that mean that the stock is suspended and the equity holders get wiped out? That would create a panic on the market anyway wouldn't it? Eoin Treacy's view Thank you for this question which may be of interest to other subscribers. Yes, if Deutsche Bank is nationalised the equity shareholders would be wiped out and since this would not be the first Eurozone bank to have the same fate we cannot rule out the possibility.   Fuller Treacy Money Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version The information provided on this website (www.FTMoney.com) is for the purposes of information only.  This website and its content is not and should not be considered or deemed to be an offer of or invitation to engage in any investment activity.  Nothing FT Money does and nothing on this website is intended to operate or be construed as the giving of advice or the making of a recommendation by FT Money to any investor or prospective investor.

The state has been operating without a full-year budget since July 1, 2015 because of political discord between Rauner and the Democrat-controlled legislature, and the current spending plan is set to last for only about half the fiscal year. As a result, the government is on track to spend about $7.8 billion more than it brings in, according to the Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability. S&P lowered its rating on Illinois to BBB on Sept. 30 and has a negative outlook, signaling further downgrades are possible. Moody's rates Illinois an equivalent Baa2. Under the new terms, a termination event -- which would force the state to pay the penalties if banks decide to break off the deals -- would occur for swaps with Barclays, Bank of America and JPMorgan if Moody's or S&P drop the state to junk. Illinois would have to pay Deutsche Bank if ratings drop three steps to below Ba1 for Moody's or below BB+ for S&P. Deutsche Bank's swap is the largest, accounting for about $99 million of the potential fees. Until the 2008 financial crisis, state and local governments frequently purchased interest-rate swaps when they sold variable-rate bonds. The tactic was intended to prevent governments from being hit with rising expenses if interest rates increased, though the contracts also exposed them to risks that proved costly when credit markets seized up. "Governor Rauner inherited these swaps and letters of credit, which have been hanging over the heads of Illinois taxpayers for years," Catherine Kelly, a spokeswoman for Gov. Bruce Rauner, said Tuesday. She didn't disclose the terms of the deal, which the statement described as "more favorable."   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows Utah lawmakers: Time to take 'training wheels' off booming solar industry, retire tax credit NHL: Coyotes F Brad Richardson carted off ice on stretcher BYU football: UMass' struggles as independent, FBS newcomer, paint a cautionary tale Utah football: Hunter Dimick takes center stage for Utah's defense ELEVATE Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   From Wall St to Hawaii to Utah Valley: UVU Professor Cary Wasden Mentors MBA Finance Students   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 4, 2016 at 12:40PM Image source: Wikimedia Commons. If you're thinking about investing in JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), then you'll want to know a few things about the New York City-based bank. The three points below are a good place to start. 1. JPMorgan Chase is massive The first thing investors should know about JPMorgan Chase is that it's huge. The $2.5 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet ranks it first among banks in the United States in terms of size. JPM Total Assets (Quarterly) data by YCharts. And the assets on JPMorgan's balance sheet tell only half the story. It also exercises control over $24 trillion worth of its clients' assets. Most of these are assets under custody, held for corporate and institutional investor clients. The remainder, $2.5 trillion, are assets under management or held by wealthy people in various types of accounts, such as brokerage accounts. The reason it's important to know about JPMorgan Chase's size is because it weighs directly on the bank's performance. Thanks to new laws and regulations passed since the financial crisis, the nation's biggest banks must hold more capital than their smaller, simpler peers. This reduces a bank's leverage, which weighs on profitability. In JPMorgan Chase's case, it has to hold 3.5% more capital relative to its assets than your standard regional bank. This, combined with other regulations that apply specifically to the biggest banks, puts JPMorgan Chase and other multitrillion lenders at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors in the regional banking space. 2. It's a universal bank Another central point that investors should know about JPMorgan Chase is that it's a universal bank. This means that it operates both an investment and commercial bank. Holding all else equal, this makes JPMorgan Chase riskier than a bank that focuses on collecting deposits and making loans, as a traditional commercial bank does. The risk comes from an investment bank's trading operations. This was on display four years ago, when JPMorgan Chase lost $6 billion from a wrong way bet on the value of derivatives tied to the health of American corporations. The incident, known as the London Whale, cost chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon his 2012 bonus and nearly his job as well. Investment banks with trading businesses must allocate a larger share of their asset portfolios to safe and highly liquid assets, such as government bonds, as opposed to higher-yielding consumer and commercial loans. Regulators require this to offset the risk that incidents like the London Whale scandal present. The downside is that it drives down the yield on a bank's asset portfolio, as government bonds are less profitable than loans. 3. It's run by a very good banker The last thing that investors in JPMorgan Chase should know is that it's run by one of the best bankers of the current generation. Dimon cut his teeth working for the mastermind behind Citigroup, formed in 1998 when financier Sanford Weill initiated a merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group, which has since spun off on its own once again. Soon after the merger, Dimon was fired by Weill for refusing to promote Weill's daughter. Dimon was then hired to turnaround Ohio-based Bank One, the sixth biggest bank in the country at the time, which later merged with JPMorgan Chase. That's how Dimon found his way to the $2.5 trillion bank. Things could always change, but for the time being JPMorgan Chase investors can rest easy knowing that the 60-year-old executive is at the helm and doesn't seem intent on going anywhere anytime soon.

The Zurich-based bank, which has a securities and equities business in the country, is in talks with the central bank for an onshore licence, Iqbal Khan, head of the bank’s international wealth-management business, said in an interview in Dubai. About a dozen international lenders, including Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co, currently hold the licence, which allows banks to operate branches and take deposits in local currency. “Our ambition is to have a full Sama licence and we are working towards that,” said Khan, responsible for Credit Suisse’s wealth management business in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “The Middle East is going through a trough in the short term but we’re bullish in the long term,” he said. Samais the abbreviated name of the country’s central bank, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency. The number of high-net-worth individuals in the Middle East rose 0.1 per cent last year, while their combined wealth rose 0.9 per cent to $2.3 trillion, according to the Capgemini and Merrill Lynch 2016 World Wealth Report. Credit Suisse expects the number of millionaires in the region will rise to 500,000 from about 330,000 in 2015 and hired 45 relationship managers across the Middle East last year, Khan said. Thiam’s Strategy Under a strategy designed by Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam after he took the job in July 2015, the bank wants to focus on services for entrepreneurs and personal fortunes as it vies with competitors such as UBS Group AG and JPMorgan Chase to advise the ultra-wealthy. The Swiss bank is betting that it can attract affluent customers by offering individual clients loans as it pivots from investment banking to wealth management. The number of super wealthy individuals is growing even as countries like Saudi Arabia impose measures to offset the financial strain of lower oil. The government is cutting subsidies for citizens on basics like electricity while trying to increase tax revenue and create jobs. In September, it cancelled bonuses for state employees long taken for granted. Credit Suisse manages about 70 billion Swiss francs ($72 billion) of private banking assets in the region, with assets growing “double digits” in the first half, Khan said. “We see this as a very interesting wealth management market,” he said, pointing to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait as the most promising markets. “While in the short term there are challenges, there are also opportunities.” International wealth management raised about 11 billion Swiss francs in net new assets during the first half, an annualised growth rate of about 7 to 8 per cent, and extended more than 3 billion francs of new loans, Khan said.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 6 October 2016 Zhong An taps C. Suisse, JPMorgan, UBS to sponsor IPO HONG KONG: Chinese Internet insurer Zhong An Online Property and Casualty Insurance has picked three banks as sponsors of a planned initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong worth about US$2bil, IFR reported, citing people familiar with the deal. Zhong An, backed by Chinese Internet companies Tencent Holdings Ltd and Ant Financial, selected Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and UBS to lead the offering, expected to take place in 2017, added IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication. Zhong An did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment during a holiday week in mainland China. Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment and JPMorgan did not return a request for comment. Zhong An, China’s first Internet-only insurer, last year raised 5.78 billion yuan (US$867mil) from a group of investors that included Morgan Stanley, domestic investment bank China International Capital Corp Ltd and private equity firms CDH Investments and SAIF Partners. The fundraising valued Zhong An at US$8bil. The Zhong An listing would come as China’s biggest peer-to-peer lending platform, Lufax, is also looking to go public in a US$5bildeal. Lufax, which is backed by Ping An Insurance Co of China Ltd, is in talks with four investment banks including Citigroup and Morgan Stanley to lead its listing. Zhong An was founded in 2013 by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd executive chairman Jack Ma, Tencent’s chairman Pony Ma and Ping An’s chairman Ma Mingzhe. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: ipo , china , HK Related Stories US panel urges ban on China state firms buying US companies Yuan tumbles to 8-year low as banks weaken forecasts Chinese citizens snapping up homes in cities abroad VW’s Audi in talks for 2nd China tie-up, dealers uneasy Investors dodge outflow curbs imposed by China You May Be Interested Market ends week lower Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official ANZ's sale of insurance unit attracts Meiji Yasuda, AIA Group Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Senator's loyalty to Trump rewarded with attorney general nod Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away Property Related advertisement Latest News Opec moves closer to oil output deal as Iran gets new offer Wall St flat at the open; Nasdaq hits record high Prestariang wins RM3.5bil deal to revamp Immigration’s IT system Musa tables RM3.78bil surplus budget for Sabah SC appoints Gumuri as AOB executive chairman Most Viewed in Business Ringgit continues slide Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot Prestariang wins RM3.5bil deal to revamp Immigration’s IT system SC appoints Gumuri as AOB executive chairman Prince Alwaleed sees Saudi currency depeg as last resort Ringgit opens lower against US dollar Musa tables RM3.78bil surplus budget for Sabah MDEC and UOA Holdings to set up gaming hub Ringgit, KLCI continue to fall advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Morgan Investment Management Inc. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'AAAmmf' rating reflects: --The fund's overall credit quality and diversification; --Low exposure to interest rate and spread risks; --Holdings of daily and weekly liquid assets consistent with shareholder profile and concentration; --The capabilities and resources of J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. PORTFOLIO CREDIT QUALITY/DIVERSIFICATION The fund seeks to maintain a diversified, high credit quality portfolio consistent with Fitch's criteria for 'AAAmmf' rated money market funds (MMFs) by investing in highly rated securities with limited exposure to individual issuers. The fund may lend money for short-term temporary purposes to other J.P. Morgan funds, subject to meeting the conditions of an SEC exemptive order granted to the fund permitting such interfund lending. MATURITY PROFILE The fund seeks to limit interest rate and spread risk by maintaining a weighted average maturity (WAM) below 60 days and a weighted average life (WAL) below 120 days. As of Oct. 4 2016, the fund's WAM and WAL were 32 days and 98 days, respectively. LIQUIDITY PROFILE The fund seeks to maintain sufficient levels of daily and weekly liquidity to meet investors' flows. At a minimum, the fund seeks to maintain 10% of its portfolio in daily liquid assets and 30% in weekly liquid assets. As of Oct. 4, 2016, the fund's daily and weekly liquid assets were 47% and 63%. FUND OBJECTIVE The fund seeks high current income with liquidity and stability of principal. INVESTMENT ADVISOR The fund's investment adviser is J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. Fitch views J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.'s investment advisory capabilities, financial and resource commitments, operational controls, corporate governance and compliance procedures as consistent with the 'AAAmmf' rating assigned to the funds. RATING SENSITIVITES The rating may be sensitive to material changes in the credit quality, market risk, and/or liquidity profiles of the fund. Temporary deviations from metrics outlined in Fitch's criteria need not automatically result in a rating change, provided the fund manager is able to address them with credible near-term remedial actions. However, material adverse and continued deviations from Fitch's guidelines for any key rating driver may lead to the rating being placed on Rating Watch Negative or downgraded. SURVEILLANCE Fitch receives fund holdings information and other pertinent data from the fund in order to conduct surveillance and to maintain the rating.

A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmations are based on overall stable performance of the underlying collateral pool. As of year-end 2015, aggregate pool-level NOI has improved 4.8% from 2014 and remains 2.5% higher than issuance. As of the September 2016 remittance, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 2.4% to $1.056 billion from $1.082 billion at issuance. There have been no delinquent, specially serviced or defeased loans since issuance. Nine loans appear on the servicer's watchlist (9.3%) due to declines in Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), large tenant lease expiration, and a major casualty event. In particular, The Palms at Westheimer (2.2% of the pool) was affected by two incidences of fire in December 2015 displacing residents and destroying multiple units. The borrower has stated 52 of 798 units were taken off-line and are in the process of being restored. Since the fire, the borrower has made timely payments and an insurance check was deposited into a loss draft account. The borrower has sufficient loss business coverage extending for 12 months. The Dolfield Business Park loan (0.9%) is a notable Fitch Loan of Concern due to a substantial decline in occupancy to 39% from 91% due to several large tenants vacating at lease expiration. The loan is secured by a 71,400 sf office property in Owings Mills, MD. The borrower has several parties interested in the vacant space. The pool has two properties, Rivertowne Commons and Springfield Plaza (7.2%) with exposure to K-Mart as a tenant. K-Mart represents at least 20% of the NRA at each property. Although neither store was listed on any recent closing list, the exposure remains a concern based on the distressed credit of the retailer and pattern of frequent store closures. This pool has an above-average concentration of multifamily properties, which represent 25.6% of the total pool balance. This is above the average concentrations of 12.2% for the 2013 vintage for Fitch-rated transactions. Additionally, this transaction has a below-average concentration of hotel properties, which represent 8.5% of the total pool balance; the 2013 vintage average hotel concentration was 14.2%. The largest loan in the pool, Jordan Creek Town Center (10.9% of the pool), is a 10-year amortizing loan. The loan is subject to a $100 million pari passu note which is part of the JPMCC 2014-C18 transaction. The collateral consists of 503,034 sf of a 1.1 million-sf regional mall located in West Des Moines, IA. The property is anchored by Dillard's (non-collateral), Younkers (non-collateral) and Scheels All Sports. Sponsored by GGP, the loan is performing in line with expectations at issuance. As of June 2016, the mall was 94% occupied, compared to 95% at issuance. The servicer reported second quarter 2016 (2Q16) DSCR was 1.66x, compared to 1.63x at year-end (YE) 2015 and 1.59x at issuance. The Des Moines market is experiencing substantial growth with numerous development projects slated for completion including new retail developments, residential projects and several billion-dollar data centers planned by Google, Microsoft and Facebook. The second largest loan, EIP National Portfolio (8.8%), is secured by seven industrial buildings encompassing 3.2 million sf. The properties are located in six states, with two in Ohio and one each in Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas and Michigan. The portfolio is currently leased to seven tenants: Toys 'R' Us, Staples (rated 'BBB-'), Rite-Aid, International Paper Company, Plastipak Packaging, HEB Grocery Company and Commonwealth, Inc. As of March 2016, the portfolio was 100% occupied with reported DSCR of 1.72x. Three tenants (50% of NRA) have extended lease terms since issuance, including the largest tenant in the portfolio, Toys 'R' Us (20%), and the second largest tenant, Staples (17%) which renewed for seven and 10 years, respectively. The Toys 'R' Us at the Youngstown, OH location was replaced by HMS Manufacturing Co. on a lease through 2022. Rite-Aid (13%) also renewed for five years, which mitigates the risk of closure due to the proposed acquisition of Rite-Aid by Walgreens Boots Alliance. The third largest loan, The Aire (8.4%), is secured by a 43-story luxury multifamily building located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The property is a 310-unit, 42-story luxury residential building constructed in 2010 that features numerous amenities and high-end finishes. Lincoln Center and The Julliard School are located across the street from The Aire, and Central Park, Riverside Park and The Shops at Columbus Circle are within walking distance. The loan is subject to a $135 million pari passu note, which is part of the JPMCC 2013-C16 transaction. The collateral is performing in line with underwritten expectations with occupancy of 95% (as of June 2016) and second quarter 2016 DSCR of 1.77x, compared to the 92% occupancy and 1.16x DSCR at issuance. According to Reis' 2Q16 report, the Upper West Side submarket of Manhattan had an apartment vacancy rate of 4.3% with average asking rents of $5,006. The subject is performing in-line with the submarket. RATING SENSITIVITIES Rating Outlooks for all classes remain Stable due to overall stable performance of the pool and continued amortization. Upgrades may occur with improved pool performance and significant paydown or defeasance. Downgrades to the classes are possible should overall pool performance decline. Fitch will continue to monitor the performance of the properties with exposure to K-Mart and the potential for closure.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security.

In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

Bohemia-based Young Law Group PLLC, attorneys for Samuel Rudick, defendant in the case, argued that lender U.S. Bank failed to begin its foreclosure action in time. Most Popular Korean firm leaves Stony Brook, Start-Up NY Mortgage rates jump after Trump election LI vitamin maker NBTY changes its name Chili's manager takes away vet's free meal Zwanger-Pesiri to pay $8M in plea deal In 2003, Samuel Rudick and Patricia Rudick, who is now deceased, took out a $1.75 million loan for their Westhampton home. The Rudicks had the loan modified a year later, before taking out a second mortgage on the home in 2006. Later that year the two loans were consolidated with a third note, totaling $2.47 million. The original lender, JP Morgan Chase Bank, placed a lien on the home before sending a note of default to the Rudicks, “stating that they had defaulted on their mortgage loan by failing to tender their monthly payments,” Judge Joseph Santorelli wrote in his ruling Tuesday. In 2008 JP Morgan commenced a foreclosure action. “At some point that action was discontinued, and then the bank commenced a second foreclosure action,” said Ivan Young of the Young Law Group. According to documents, that second, 2014 action was dismissed for missing the six-year deadline started by the first foreclosure action. “Then they [U.S. Bank] commenced a third foreclosure action, in 2015.” Real EstateOpen houses for 155 storm-damaged LI homes underway Young, who said he has worked on “a dozen” foreclosure cases invoking the statute of limitations in the last two years, said what made the Rudicks’ case more complex was the change in lenders. The first two actions were initiated by JP Morgan Chase, before the loan balance was transferred to U.S. Bank in 2014. advertisement | advertise on newsday The lender still has a mortgage lien on the property, but Rudick can now file court papers seeking to have the lien removed, Young said. U.S. Bank has until Nov. 3 to file a notice of appeal if it will try to get the dismissal of the foreclosure overturned. A spokesman for the lender declined to comment. Young said he has worked on four cases in which judges dismissed foreclosure actions because lenders missed the six-year deadline. In one, a Brooklyn family was able to get the $75,000 mortgage lien on their property removed, so they now own it free and clear, Young said. In another case, a lender has appealed the dismissal of a foreclosure action on a Sound Beach home; the Appellate Division is expected to hear oral arguments soon, Young said. Under state law, the clock starts running when a lender first files a foreclosure case declaring the entire loan due, Young said. If that original case gets dismissed, the lender must file a new case within six years of calling in the loan. The Rudicks’ house, at 18 Alden Lane in the hamlet of Quiogue, is known as the Frederick Burrell Cottage and was built during the 1910s, according to a Southampton Town historic resources survey. Tweets from https://twitter.com/NewsdayBiz/lists/newsday-biz-staff A small number of Long Island homeowners have sought to have their foreclosures dismissed for exceeding the statute of limitations in recent years. The dismissals show how slow the foreclosure process is in New York. In 2007, lenders filed more than 13,000 foreclosure cases against homeowners, more than double the number in 2005, according to Nesconset-based real estate data company LI Profiles. The number peaked in 2009 at more than 19,000. With Maura McDermott and Laura Mann Get the Biz Briefing newsletter!

Public portions of so-called living wills refiled by eight of the largest U.S. lenders were released by the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on Tuesday, detailing what companies have done to fix shortcomings flagged earlier this year. Updates were due Oct. 1 from five banks that failed to produce sufficient plans and three others required to address deficiencies in preparation for the next round of annual filings in July. JPMorgan -- one of the five that failed in April -- said it has set up an intermediate holding company and has begun transferring assets to it. The new entity will “stand ready to make capital and liquidity contributions” to other units in a failure and has a contractual obligation to ensure resources are quickly channeled to the right places if the lender collapses. The bank also said it’s added “significantly” to its easy-to-sell assets and has stashed extra liquidity at each of its major units. Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and State Street Corp. also were ordered to refile their resolution plans, with the understanding that another failure could lead to government intervention and new capital demands. JPMorgan said the bank’s revised plan “responds fully to all deficiencies, substantially addresses the shortcomings identified in the agencies’ feedback and also addresses new requirements,” and other banks said they also are weighing similar intermediate holding companies. Living wills were mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act to lay out how complex banks could go through bankruptcy without roiling the financial system. If the Fed and FDIC decide a bank’s plan isn’t credible, they can force changes to its operation. Most of the 2015 submissions were rejected, and future failures would trigger a lengthy process that could -- in the worst case -- lead to a bank being forced to break up. JPMorgan also said it created a strategy for selling off as many as 16 independent pieces of the company that it called “highly attractive businesses.” The plan described the entities as “global leaders and top competitors in the products and markets in which they have chosen to compete” and said they would have a diverse array of potential buyers. Wells Fargo, which was criticized by regulators for “material errors” in its rejected 2015 plan, said it shed some of its non-core businesses to make the company easier to handle in a failure. The bank also said it has been “increasing both the liquid assets available to meet its needs in a time of stress and the amount of capital available to absorb potential losses.” Bank of America’s repairs included assuring regulators that it could better figure out where resources should be stockpiled in key units and how much might be needed. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. also had public portions of their refiled plans released by regulators on Tuesday. The plans address how they’re fixing individual shortcomings before the next annual submissions due July 1. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Chase, the biggest bank in the area by deposits, has 1,913 ATMs in the Chicago area, including Northwest Indiana. Of those, 442 are in Walgreens stores and are part of Chase's national sale of ATMs housed in drugstores and certain other nonbank locations to Cardtronics, the largest nonbank owner of ATMs in the world. Once the transfer to Houston-based Cardtronics occurs in early 2017, Chase will have 1,471 ATMs in the area. Until the transfer occurs, Chase customers won't have to pay fees to get cash at Walgreen ATMs, but they will after that. Chase has 372 area branches, by far the most of any bank here but down from 428 five years ago. Cutting ties with Walgreens, which has been aligned with Chase for 11 years, is the latest move by Chase to reduce its reach via relationships with other Chicago-area retailers. The demise of Dominick's Finer Foods in late 2013 led to the closure of nearly 50 Chase branches housed in the grocery stores. As the nation's largest bank and one of the biggest in the world, Chase's appeal to retail customers lies predominantly in convenience and technology. It can boast more branches and ATMs than any other bank in Chicago, giving customers fee-free access to their cash almost anywhere they are in the area. In a statement, Chase said that 11 years ago it was looking to fill gaps where it didn't have ATMs or branches. After Chase's 2008 acquisition of Seattle-based Washington Mutual, which had a significant branch network in Chicago, there were far fewer of those service gaps. “We are simplifying our business and found that our customers were using these ATMs less frequently, possibly because they want more from the ATM than just dispensing cash,” the company said. “Our customers can find a Chase ATM—usually one that takes deposits—within five minutes of most of the ATMs we are selling.” J.

Chairman Roger Altman said. “Keep in mind Deutsche Bank is small,” Altman said Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. He compared the roughly $18 billion market value of Deutsche Bank to that of JPMorgan, which is over $240 billion. “One of the things going on here is that Deutsche Bank’s under pressure for a number of reasons, but one of which is it’s so small.” Deutsche Bank shares have plunged more than 47 percent this year amid concern the firm will have to raise capital to pay legal costs. The largest German lender may face fines linked to a U.S. Department of Justice probe into residential mortgage-backed securities, and an additional expense tied to a money-laundering investigation at its Russian operation. The charges tied to the home loans may amount to $5.6 billion, lower than the $14 billion initially requested by the government, according to an estimate by Autonomous Research LLP. Balance Sheet Autonomous said last week that the bank has ample funds to weather more than two months of severe stress, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Deutsche Bank can also access backstops from the European Central Bank. Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer John Cryan said the balance sheet is safer than at any point in the past two decades. “The immediate reaction was, and is, well they can’t pay $14 billion,” Altman said. “That wouldn’t be the reaction against one of the big-cap U.S. banks.” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC Tuesday that there’s “ no reason” Deutsche Bank can’t resolve its issues, including settlement talks with the government. Altman, whose New York-based investment bank specializes in mergers and acquisitions, said the problems at Deutsche Bank aren’t likely to spread to other European banks such as UBS Group AG and Barclays Plc, because those firms are in better shape after changing their strategies. “These institutions when you study them are really quite different,” Altman said. “It’s more specific to Deutsche Bank than otherwise.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

the GOES satellite at 1620 UTC, shows Hurricane Matthew in the Caribbean Sea heading toward Jamacia, Haiti and Cuba on October 3, 2016. JPMorgan on Tuesday increased earnings estimates for a group of insurance stocks, advising clients to get behind the sector once hurricane Matthew passes. "Despite potential for a solid 3Q [third quarter], the P&C [property and casualty] (re)insurance stocks could sell off this week as Hurricane Matthew (currently a Category 4 hurricane in Caribbean) approaches the U.S.," wrote equity analyst Sarah DeWitt in a research note. The analyst predicts that earnings in the third quarter for the insurance group could come in ahead of expectations due to "moderate global catastrophe losses," with companies in the reinsurance space seeing the lowest impact.

Saudi Capital Market Authority Chairman Mohammad Al Jadaan and Tadawul stock exchange Chief Executive Officer Khalid Al Hussan are among officials attending the two-day event organised by JPMorgan Chase & Co., the bank said in an e-mailed statement on Monday. Senior representatives of the kingdom’s economy ministry and central bank will also be present. The meetings come at a difficult moment for the Arab world’s largest economy. The US Senate last week voted to override President Barack Obama’s veto of a bill allowing Saudi Arabia to be sued for its alleged links to the September 11 attacks, which people familiar with the matter said might delay the country’s first dollar-bond issuance. Meanwhile, the benchmark stock gauge entered its second bear market this year after a series of cuts to government salaries and bonuses triggered a selloff. “I’m sure they will discuss the implications of the 9/11 bill and try to get rid of the uncertainties around it,” said Robert Hahm, an investment manager at Mashreq Capital DIFC Ltd. in Dubai, which has $1.5 billion of assets under management. “We still don’t know if or how it’ll affect investment in Saudi Arabia and sentiment toward the kingdom.” Saudi Arabia plans to sell debt and attract foreign investors to its local market as it seeks to plug an estimated shortfall of about $100 billion in its budget this year and fund an economic transformation plan to wean itself off oil revenue. The Tadawul, which is trading near the lowest level in since 2011, is the worst performer in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council this year, down about 21 per cent. JPMorgan is one of the coordinators of the planned bond sale, which people with knowledge of the matter said in May could raise at least $10 billion.

Saudi Capital Market Authority Chairman Mohammed Al-Jadaan and Tadawul stock exchange Chief Executive Officer Khalid Al Hussan are among officials attending the two-day event organized by JPMorgan Chase & Co., the bank said in an e-mailed statement on Monday. Senior representatives of the kingdom’s economy ministry and central bank will also be present. The meetings come at a difficult moment for the Arab world’s largest economy. The U.S. Senate last week voted to override President Barack Obama’s veto of a bill allowing Saudi Arabia to be sued for its alleged links to the Sept. 11 attacks, which people familiar with the matter said might delay the country’s first dollar-bond issuance. Meanwhile, the benchmark stock gauge entered its second bear market this year after a series of cuts to government salaries and bonuses triggered a selloff. “I’m sure they will discuss the implications of the 9/11 bill and try to get rid of the uncertainties around it,” said Robert Hahm, an investment manager at Mashreq Capital DIFC Ltd. in Dubai, which has $1.5 billion of assets under management. “We still don’t know if or how it’ll affect investment in Saudi Arabia and sentiment toward the kingdom.” Worst Performer Saudi Arabia plans to sell debt and attract foreign investors to its local market as it seeks to plug an estimated shortfall of about $100 billion in its budget this year and fund an economic transformation plan to wean itself off oil revenue. The Tadawul All Share Index, which fell to the lowest level since 2011 this week, climbed 2 percent in Riyadh on Tuesday. The gauge is the worst performer in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council this year, down about 20 percent. Representatives of companies including Saudi Telecom Co., Saudi Basic Industries Corp. and Samba Financial Group will also attend the meetings, according to the statement. JPMorgan is one of the coordinators of the planned bond sale, which people with knowledge of the matter said in May could raise at least $10 billion. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Speculation was rife over the weekend that the bank was aiming to lower the $14 billion penalty which relates to a number of investigations related to mortgage securities. Shares of the firm rallied on Friday afternoon on rumors of a deal. See how European markets are trading right now Following a national holiday on Monday, shares rose higher at the open on the German DAX but soon pared gains. By the close of European markets, they had risen to clock gains of nearly 1.5 percent. "With no updates so far on the case, expect the stock to remain on a roller coaster," FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed said in a note on Tuesday morning. Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding. HSBC cut its price target on the German lender from 14 euros to 12 euros in a research note published Tuesday. But earlier it had also got a strong vote of confidence Monday from another major rival. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC that he believed the German lender was going to be fine. "There is no reason that Deutsche Bank shouldn't get over its problems," he said. The perception is that Deutsche Bank needs to raise capital following the proposed settlement from the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ. The bank has repeatedly defended itself over recent weeks, however, telling CNBC that there is "no reason to worry" and that the bank had a "comfortable cushion."

The euro moved in its narrowest range ever versus the dollar during the quarter just past. It’s a prime example of the biggest challenge faced by dealers: the volatility they exploit for profit is falling throughout the $5.1 trillion-a-day market, sending an index of top funds’ returns tumbling for a seventh month in September. The torpor is mainly due to central banks. The divergence trade that was supposed to see a rate-hiking Federal Reserve split from its peers and spur the dollar higher is sputtering, with a lackluster U.S. economy forcing officials to hold off on tightening policy. The euro has stagnated as investors judge that the European Central Bank is running out of ammunition to expand the money supply. The malaise is even spreading to the yen, this year’s best-performing developed-market currency, as dealers weigh the Bank of Japan’s latest policy twist. “Most of these managers did fairly well in jumping in on dollar longs in 2014 and 2015, but now that there’s no trend they’ve been struggling,” said Ugo Lancioni, a money manager in London at Neuberger Berman Group LLC, which oversees about $246 billion. “There’s no point in implementing momentum strategies if fundamentals don’t support the story.” A long position is a wager that a currency will appreciate. Staying Neutral A growing number of investors and traders say the euro-dollar rate is moving so little that it isn’t worth bothering about, while forecasts in a Bloomberg survey suggest it will remain within about a cent of its $1.0952-$1.1366 third-quarter range until 2018. That’s the narrowest range for a quarter since the single currency’s 1999 inception. “We’re not active in the euro-dollar space one way or the other,” said Roger Hallam, London-based chief investment officer for currencies at JPMorgan Asset Management, which oversees $1.7 trillion. “The market is beginning to consider the limits of monetary policy. There’s no real impulse for the euro to be trading significantly weaker from here.” A JPMorgan Chase & Co. volatility measure just posted its first back-to-back quarterly drop in more than two years as the impact of the Brexit referendum faded, dropping to 9.9 percent, from more than 12 percent in June. The Parker Global Index of returns is also falling, extending its decline this year to 3.5 percent, the most since 2011. The seven-month losing streak is the longest in data going back to 2003. Momentum trading, or following trends such as the anticipated dollar surge, has fallen since early July, according to a Deutsche Bank AG index. It’s up 2.4 percent this year, set for the worst performance since 2012, while the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has fallen 3.4 percent, headed for its first annual slide in four years. Since hurting investors with an unexpected gain in the first half of the year, the yen has paused its ascent amid speculation it strengthened too fast and after BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said Sept. 21 the central bank would target its bond purchases to boost inflation more effectively. On the same day, the Fed held its key rate unchanged and emphasized a gradual path toward tighter policy. Draghi refrained from boosting the ECB’s bond-purchase plan at its most recent meeting almost a month ago, even as the institution cut its 2018 economic growth forecasts. Carry Thrives One beneficiary of the drop in global volatility is the carry trade, where the profit from borrowing cheaply in one currency and investing where rates are higher can be wiped out by price swings. A Deutsche Bank index tracking this strategy has risen 7.5 percent in 2016 amid a rally in emerging-market currencies and as the Fed holds off raising rates for a second time since the financial crisis. For the market as a whole, though, the floundering of major central banks is making it difficult to take decisions. Ulf Lindahl, chief executive officer of A.G. Bisset Associates LLC, said it would take a surge in the euro for the currency manager to buy back into the single currency. It’s only a matter of time before that happens, though, he said; the euro has been flat for too long. “We are neutral on the euro against the dollar and have been since Aug. 1,” said the 35-year market veteran, who manages more than $1 billion from Norwalk, Connecticut. “But we’re prepared to buy it should it move higher.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

JPMorgan Chase's chief executive pushed back at the Democratic presidential candidate after she criticized the U.S. banking culture amid Wells Fargo's fake account scandal. "It is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on Wall Street wrecked our economy we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law," Clinton said on Monday. In response, Dimon said: "When people blanket a whole class of people...that's just unfair." Wells Fargo opened credit card, checking and savings account without customers' permission and fired thousands of employees over the course of several years for the deceptive sales practices, without fixing the problem. Banks have been under a microscope both in the U.S. and abroad. In Germany, concerns that banking giant Deutsche Bank will not be able to pay a $14 billion fine levied by the U.S. government. Financial markets across the globe were sent into flux last week, amid reports of hedge funds reducing their exposure to Deutsche Bank as well as talks of a possible settlement. Still, amid market worries that Deutsche is facing a capital squeeze, Dimon said he believes the German lender is going to be fine. "There is no reason that Deutsche Bank shouldn't get over its problems," the head of the largest U.S. bank by assets said of the fourth-largest European bank by assets. Deutsche shares have gotten pounded as investors worry that it has a weak capital position that is in even more danger due to a looming settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice involving the firm's mortgage-backed securities operations. The banks American Depositary Receipts are down about 47 percent in 2016 and nearly 53 percent over the past 12 months. "They have plenty of capital, plenty of liquidity," Dimon said during an telephone interview on CNBC's " Power Lunch. " "We want all these banks to get through because it's better for everybody." Shares of Germany's largest bank ended Monday trading near $13, a decline of less than 1 percent. Wells Fargo shares fell 1.02 percent. —CNBC's Jeff Cox and Ted Kemp contributed to this report.

Singapore's extremely-high-end properties are now cheap compared with similar luxury properties in other major capital cities, according to Brandon Lee, a property analyst at JPMorgan in Singapore. After a 15-25 percent drop in prime and luxury residential prices since the market peak in 2011, Singapore's properties now represent a good deal for ultra-high-net-worth investors who were comparison shopping between capitals, Lee said. Luxury housing in London, Hong Kong and New York was changing hands at prices as much as 165 percent higher than in Singapore, Lee noted. That "very attractive" gap was drawing interest from private equity and global property funds keen to buy multiple apartments from developers in "block" deals, Lee said. Family offices and rich individuals were also increasingly interested in making purchases, he noted. Despite often needing to offer additional discounts to do those bulk deals, developers have a big motivation: Singapore's government does not allow developers to sit on unsold units while waiting for buyers to return to the market. Any units unsold two years after a project's completion face an "extension charge" of 8 percent of the proportional land cost for the first year, rising to 16 percent in the second year and 24 percent in the third. show chapters <p>Singapore&#039;s home prices may take cues from car loans</p> <p>Looser car loan restrictions could indicate that Singapore&#039;s central bank may soon ease measures for the property sector.</p> Singapore's home prices may take cues from car loans    Tuesday, 14 Jun 2016 | 7:04 AM ET | 00:39 Some experts told CNBC the recovery in Singapore's ultra-high-end property was overdue. "Values in the market are a joke in comparison to some markets," such as London, Hong Kong and Monaco, said property investor Alexander Karolik Shlaen, an economist and CEO of Panache Management, a luxury brands and investment adviser. He noted that Singapore's freehold luxury property prices were running at about $2,000 a square foot, which he said in London wouldn't be considered a luxury price. Shlaen expected that purchasers who weren't subject to Singapore's Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) rule would also be motivated to buy. In a bid to rein in its housing market's sharp price rises, from 2011 Singapore's government imposed a series of cooling measures, including the ABSD, which adds much as an additional 15 percent to the purchase price for foreign buyers and Singaporeans with more than one property. While the additional cost may not seem terribly onerous for buyers at the high end, it appears to have successfully dampened interest in luxury properties in the city-state. But due to tax treaties, buyers from some countries, including the U.S., Switzerland and Lichtenstein, are exempt. JPMorgan's Lee noted that in an unusual development, Americans became the second-most frequent buyers of high-end Singapore homes in the second quarter. Individuals from Malaysia, Indonesia and China usually dominate the list, Lee said. "It could reflect that prices have fallen enough to look at the space," Lee said. But he was quick to note that he only saw Singapore's high-end as having bottomed out; the mainstream housing market still had room to drop, he cautioned. Munshi Ahmed | Bloomberg | Getty Images "If you look at unsold inventory, it's at a record low" for the high end, Lee said, but he added that wasn't true of the mass-market segment, which he said would see further supply growth even amid vacancy rates that were already as high as 15 percent. That segment also hadn't seen too much in the way of price declines yet, he said. "The only reason why we've not seen a lot of distressed properties out there is interest rates are still very low. Owners of properties have strong holding power and they're not willing to take a haircut," he said. Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority released a flash estimate on Monday that showed the city-state's private home prices fell at the fastest pace in seven years in the third quarter. The private residential property index fell 1.5 percent to 137.9 in the July-September quarter, according to the URA, after falling 0.4 percent in the previous quarter. The latest drop was the largest quarterly decline since home prices slid 4.7 percent in the second quarter of 2009, when fallout from the global financial crisis slammed into Asia and pushed Singapore's economy into contraction. - Reuters contributed to this report.

MIC currently expects the closing of the senior secured credit facilities and the refinancing to occur prior to the middle of October, subject to customary closing conditions. The new five-year credit agreement is expected to consist of a $400 million term loan, all of which is to be drawn at closing, and an up to $350 million revolving credit facility, of which approximately $200 million, excluding usage for undrawn letters of credit, is to be drawn at closing. Under the proposed terms, the facility would bear interest at LIBOR (with a 0.0% floor) plus a margin of between 1.5% and 2.25%, depending on Atlantic Aviation’s leverage ratio. The all-in cost could be higher if MIC elects to hedge all or a portion of the LIBOR component using either interest rate swap or cap agreements. “While not an immediate need, by seeking to refinance Atlantic Aviation’s debt today we are attempting to take advantage of what we believe is an attractive credit market,” said James Hooke, chief executive officer of MIC. The implementation of the new credit facility could generate as much as 2.00%, or approximately $12.0 million per year, in interest expense savings versus the current facility. The existing Atlantic Aviation senior secured credit agreement consists of a $595.9 million term loan maturing in 2020 and a $70 million revolving credit facility (currently undrawn) maturing in 2018. The facility bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a current margin of 2.5% and includes a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. Including the effect of interest rate swap agreements, the all-in cost of the current facility is 4.63%. MIC subsidiary Atlantic Aviation FBO Holdings, LLC would serve as guarantor on behalf of the borrower, Atlantic Aviation FBO Inc., together with substantially all of the borrower’s material domestic subsidiaries. About MIC MIC owns, operates and invests in a diversified group of infrastructure businesses providing basic services to customers in the United States. Its businesses consist of a bulk liquid terminals business, International-Matex Tank Terminals, an airport services business, Atlantic Aviation, entities comprising an energy services, production and distribution segment, MIC Hawaii, and entities comprising a Contracted Power and Energy segment.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 7:40 AM, October 4, 2016 NEW YORK - A decade after JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> said with great fanfare that it would make life easier for customers by putting its cash machines into Duane Reade drug stores in New York City and Walgreens stores in Florida, the big bank is retreating. Customers who use the ATMs marked with Chase's blue octagon logo in those drug stores are beginning to be met with a message: “Soon this machine will no longer be a Chase ATM.” The new message is the public start of a withdrawal that stems from an agreement the largest U.S. bank by assets made in April to sell 2,586 cash machines - primarily in Walgreens and Duane Reade drug stores, and other retailers - to ATM operator Cardtronics <CATM.O> for an undisclosed amount. The exact timing depends on how quickly the machines can be converted for use under the brand name of another financial institution. The deal includes ATMs in Walgreens in nine states in total, including stores in Arizona and the Chicago area. Chase spokesman Mike Fusco said the bank is logging off of the ATMs because it will save money and because customers use these particular machines less. "It really came down to simplifying the business," said Fusco. "Our customers are using those ATMs less frequently given that our ATM presence has expanded significantly over the last 11 years." When Chase disconnects, it will have about 15,500 ATMs, primarily in its branches. That is more than twice as many as in 2005 when the bank turned to drug stores to quickly place cash dispensers. It also has ATMs at some airports, train stations and sports arenas. Fusco said Chase has ATMs within five minutes of the "vast majority" of discontinued machines because of expansions since it made the drug store deals. For example, in 2008, two years after turning to Walgreens for more Florida locations, JPMorgan picked up 260 branches in its financial crisis purchase of Washington Mutual. Chase ATMs in branches accept deposits while the store machines it is giving up only dispense cash and show account balances. Cardtronics is talking to other financial institutions about putting their brands on the machines and it expects to announce new arrangements "later this year," Cardtronics spokesman Nick Pappathopoulos said in an email. A spokeswoman for Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, <WBA.O> which owns Walgreens and Duane Reade, had no immediate comment.

Yields rose for a fourth day across maturities as futures traders lifted the probability of a 2016 Fed hike to the highest since August. A gauge of the yield curve flattened after the Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index jumped last month to the highest since October 2015, after a slump in August. "You can see the reaction on an intraday basis right after the release — the big increase in rates and the flattening in the curve — both consistent with the repricing of the Fed," said Priya Misra, head of global interest-rate strategy in New York at TD Securities (USA), one of 23 primary dealers that trade with the central bank. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "The non-manufacturing data is a more important indicator because we are largely a service economy. It's telling you that the momentum in the third quarter is solid." Investors are weighing economic data against actions of global central banks for clues about the path of U.S. interest rates. Treasuries fell Tuesday in sympathy with German bunds after a Bloomberg report said the European Central Bank will gradually wind down bond purchases before the conclusion of its quantitative-easing program. Several Fed officials in the past week have talked up the possibility of a rate increase as soon as the central bank's November meeting. Yields on two-year notes, the coupon maturity most sensitive to Fed policy expectations, rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.83 percent as of 5 p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data, the highest closing level since Aug. 26. It touched 0.85 percent, the highest on an intraday basis since June 3. The price of the 0.75 percent note due September 2018 was 99 27/32. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield rose two basis points to 1.7 percent. Traders assign about a 64 percent probability of a hike by year-end and a 24 percent chance of a boost at the Fed's meeting next month, according to futures data compiled by Bloomberg. The calculation is based on the assumption the effective fed funds rate will trade at the middle of the new range after the central bank's next boost. JPMorgan Chase says the benchmark Treasury yield can climb as high as 2 percent this year, joining Goldman Sachs Group in predicting a level unseen since January. "An improved growth outlook continues to bolster an outlook for higher interest rates in the fourth quarter," JPMorgan strategists led by Jay Barry in New York wrote in a client note dated Oct. 4. "We think the 10-year yield can stretch as far as 2 percent." The benchmark yield dipped to a record-low 1.318 percent on July 6, when the market-implied odds of higher U.S. rates by December stood at just 12 percent. The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged last month, noting the case for an increase had strengthened and describing risks to the economic outlook as "roughly balanced." The U.S. probably added 174,000 jobs in September, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists, up from 151,000 the month before. Like JPMorgan, economists at Goldman Sachs see benchmark Treasury yields climbing to 2 percent by year-end, fueled by an improving outlook for inflation and economic growth. Faster inflation hurts the value of bonds' fixed payments. The weighted average forecast of analysts in data compiled by Bloomberg is for the yield on the benchmark note to end the year at 1.74 percent. "All of the signals are suggesting that we are now pretty close to full employment, and we're starting to exert some upward pressure on inflation," Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs in New York, said in a Sept. 27 interview with Bloomberg Television. "The Fed is going to respond to that. Gradually, but I think they will respond." The gap between yields on five- and 30-year debt, a gauge of the yield curve, flattened to about 1.18 percentage points.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows Utah lawmakers: Time to take 'training wheels' off booming solar industry, retire tax credit NHL: Coyotes F Brad Richardson carted off ice on stretcher BYU football: UMass' struggles as independent, FBS newcomer, paint a cautionary tale Utah football: Hunter Dimick takes center stage for Utah's defense ELEVATE Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   From Wall St to Hawaii to Utah Valley: UVU Professor Cary Wasden Mentors MBA Finance Students   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

The decision by U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan halts, for now, three years of litigation against Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, mining company Glencore Plc, and various commodity trading, mining and metals warehousing companies. Purchasers had accused the defendants of colluding from 2009 to 2012 to manipulate prices by hoarding inventory. They claimed that this caused delays of up to 16 months to fill orders, leading to higher storage costs, which in turn inflated aluminum prices and the cost of producing cabinets, flashlights, soft drink cans, strollers and other goods. In August, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan upheld Forrest's dismissal two years earlier of antitrust claims by "indirect" commercial end users and consumer end users. Applying that ruling, Forrest on Wednesday said related claims by "first level" purchasers, which she allowed to go forward in March 2015, must also be dismissed. She said both cases rested on the same "core assertion" that Platts Midwest Premium, a component of aluminum prices, rose because of alleged "shenanigans" in aluminum warehouse services. "There is no allegation or evidence in the record that defendants engaged in any anticompetitive conduct outside of the aluminum warehouse services market," Forrest wrote. "Profit by defendants or losses by plaintiffs subsequently experienced in physical aluminum is irrelevant to antitrust standing." Lawyers for the purchasers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally and JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said their banks were pleased with the decision. Glencore did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Forrest concluded with a long footnote lamenting how a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Gelboim v. Bank of America Corp, could impede settlements of complex litigation by letting some plaintiffs--here, the indirect purchasers--appeal dismissals of their claims while other plaintiffs press on. "In this case, the opposite has occurred," she wrote. "A 'Gelboim Appeal' has caused a case nearing final procedural stages to come to a halt. Perhaps this is the most just result. But plaintiffs will undoubtedly appeal--and if successful, the parties will be picking up where they left off two years hence." The case is In re: Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-md-02481.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen wants to rope more Americans into the workforce before raising interest rates. That's making some of her colleagues nervous. They worry the labor market could overheat, forcing policy makers to raise rates much more quickly and trip the economy into a new recession. Inflation will ultimately decide who is right, and, by several measures, it's going up. The Fed's preferred gauge of price pressures, PCE inflation, was 1.7 percent in the 12 months through August after stripping out volatile food and energy components. That's still below the Fed's 2 percent target, but the highest it's been in two years. The consumer price index was 2.3 percent. Both show a decided, if gentle, upward trend.  "The rise in core PCE inflation will serve to reinforce the argument of the centrists and hawks on the FOMC that the Fed is getting closer to both its employment and inflation objectives," Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, wrote in a note to clients, referring to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Trimmed Mean The trend is even clearer in two alternative measures that Ellis Tallman, director of research at the Cleveland Fed, likes to track: median CPI and his bank's "trimmed mean" CPI. Instead of taking out the segments that are considered historically volatile, a trimmed mean removes whichever components moved the most in that period, and so reveals something closer to the central trend.   "We don't see inflation rearing its ugly head,'' said Tallman. "On the other hand we do see inflation in the medium term heading back toward 2 percent.'' Still, against the sharp drop in unemployment over the past six years, coupled with the Fed's inaction on rates, that's a puzzlingly slow rise. One explanation: "Wages have not grown really as strongly as they should have, despite the fact they didn’t move interest rates," said Jeremie Banet, a fund manager at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach, California. Productivity the Culprit? Banet and his colleagues have dug into CPI figures looking for a purer signal on what's happening with wages. They narrowed their focus not only to services, but also tossed out rents and their equivalents, as well as energy. The resulting "core services ex-shelter" is up more than 3 percent in the year through August, significantly higher than average hourly earnings reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To Banet, this evidence that prices are rising faster than wages is a clue. Companies raise wages when productivity is high. Right now productivity is low. "That could explain why wages are not rising as much as you'd expect," he said. If true, and productivity remains weak, that would also support Yellen's decision to remain patient, as wages would be less likely to contribute meaningfully to an upward spiral in inflation. Fuel Injection on the Way Less divination is required when it comes to the impact of fuel prices on headline CPI. Since mid-2014, oil prices have plunged, with one of several big dips coming in late 2015 into this year. The impact of that drop is about to roll out of the year-on-year figures for the energy component of CPI. In the 12 months through August, motor fuel prices dropped nearly 18 percent. Should fuel prices remain exactly where they were at the end of August, the year-on-year deflation will disappear by November and turn into inflation that reaches 22 percent for fuel prices by February. Given the 3.26 percent weighting for motor fuels in overall CPI, that would result in an upward swing of more than 1.3 percentage points in CPI from August to February. The caveat here is that Fed officials regularly ignore swings in headline inflation caused by energy and food price changes. Janet Yellen has long spoken of the "transitory" nature of oil's impact on inflation. But with a historical bias guarding against high inflation, can the Fed ignore energy on the way up, as easily as they do on the way down? "I think they can," said Gennadiy Goldberg,  an interest-rate strategist at TD Securities LLC in New York.

Chandrasekaran , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} October 05, 2016 3:25pm   Comments Share: Related CMRE Earnings Scheduled For October 24, 2016 Costamare Cut Its Dividend By 65% And Stock Fell 19% Tuesday JPMorgan has upgraded Costamare Inc (NYSE: CMRE) shares from Neutral to an Overweight rating and lifted the target price from $12 to $13 on the stock implying over 70 percent upside potentials. The firm believes the dividend cut from $0.29 to $0.10 has removed the overhang hampering the stock movement. Analyst Noah Parquette expects the company to generate stable cash flow in the current and next year with its focus on smaller vessel classes. The management's move to reduce dividend rate could also free up cash flow to improve liquidity. Furthermore, the analyst sees the need for cash requirement lower with the DRIP program and founding family's participation. Although the dividend cut came in as a surprise, the brokerage admitted that the cut is sensible, improving the liquidity issue in the medium term. The firm expects cash requirements to be only $3 million for dividend compared to $22 million previously.

While there are still two smaller bullet payments in 2018, the fact that these refinancing were down well ahead of the maturities gives us confidence that the remaining refinancing should be relatively routine." JPMorgan boosted its estimates following changes in dividend and new financings. At last check, Costamare was up 1.78 percent at $7.45 on the day. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

They worry the labor market could overheat, forcing policy makers to raise rates much more quickly and trip the economy into a new recession. Inflation will ultimately decide who is right, and, by several measures, it's going up. The Fed's preferred gauge of price pressures, PCE inflation, was 1.7 percent in the 12 months through August after stripping out volatile food and energy components. That's still below the Fed's 2 percent target, but the highest it's been in two years. The consumer price index was 2.3 percent. Both show a decided, if gentle, upward trend.  "The rise in core PCE inflation will serve to reinforce the argument of the centrists and hawks on the FOMC that the Fed is getting closer to both its employment and inflation objectives," Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, wrote in a note to clients, referring to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Trimmed Mean The trend is even clearer in two alternative measures that Ellis Tallman, director of research at the Cleveland Fed, likes to track: median CPI and his bank's "trimmed mean" CPI. Instead of taking out the segments that are considered historically volatile, a trimmed mean removes whichever components moved the most in that period, and so reveals something closer to the central trend.   "We don't see inflation rearing its ugly head,'' said Tallman. "On the other hand we do see inflation in the medium term heading back toward 2 percent.'' Still, against the sharp drop in unemployment over the past six years, coupled with the Fed's inaction on rates, that's a puzzlingly slow rise. One explanation: "Wages have not grown really as strongly as they should have, despite the fact they didn’t move interest rates," said Jeremie Banet, a fund manager at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach, California. Productivity the Culprit? Banet and his colleagues have dug into CPI figures looking for a purer signal on what's happening with wages. They narrowed their focus not only to services, but also tossed out rents and their equivalents, as well as energy. The resulting "core services ex-shelter" is up more than 3 percent in the year through August, significantly higher than average hourly earnings reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To Banet, this evidence that prices are rising faster than wages is a clue. Companies raise wages when productivity is high. Right now productivity is low. "That could explain why wages are not rising as much as you'd expect," he said. If true, and productivity remains weak, that would also support Yellen's decision to remain patient, as wages would be less likely to contribute meaningfully to an upward spiral in inflation. Fuel Injection on the Way Less divination is required when it comes to the impact of fuel prices on headline CPI. Since mid-2014, oil prices have plunged, with one of several big dips coming in late 2015 into this year. The impact of that drop is about to roll out of the year-on-year figures for the energy component of CPI. In the 12 months through August, motor fuel prices dropped nearly 18 percent. Should fuel prices remain exactly where they were at the end of August, the year-on-year deflation will disappear by November and turn into inflation that reaches 22 percent for fuel prices by February. Given the 3.26 percent weighting for motor fuels in overall CPI, that would result in an upward swing of more than 1.3 percentage points in CPI from August to February. The caveat here is that Fed officials regularly ignore swings in headline inflation caused by energy and food price changes. Janet Yellen has long spoken of the "transitory" nature of oil's impact on inflation. But with a historical bias guarding against high inflation, can the Fed ignore energy on the way up, as easily as they do on the way down? "I think they can," said Gennadiy Goldberg,  an interest-rate strategist at TD Securities LLC in New York. "But if there is a little more inflation on the core side at the same time that headline is rising, that could catch their eye."   Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Dylan Martinez/File Photo By Eric Onstad | LONDON LONDON Commodities will battle to regain a prized place in many portfolios after the "super cycle" fizzled out and in a world of muted global growth, executives at JP Morgan Asset Management said. The sector could, however, claw back a shred of its former glory by providing some diversification benefits, they said during a conference by the fund manager in London this week. During a commodities boom mainly spurred by China's hunger for infrastructure in the years leading up to the global financial crisis, many investors boosted allocations to commodities to capture strong emerging market growth while diversifying from equities and bonds. But during subsequent years of the financial crisis, commodities often moved in tandem with other asset classes. "The rule of thumb is that assets diversify until they become fashionable," said John Bilton, head of the global strategy team for multi-asset solutions at JP Morgan Asset Management. The group is one of the world's biggest fund managers with assets of $1.7 trillion. "Commodities went from being a source of diversification to a source of additional return in portfolios." NO LONGER STAR PERFORMER The 19-commodity Thomson Reuters/Core Commodity CRB Index soared fourfold from early 1999 until touching a peak in July 2008, but has since slumped by more than half. Those former buoyant returns are not due to come back as China's transition to a consumer-led economy is moderating commodity demand and elsewhere heavy debt burdens will weigh on economic growth for years to come, he added. One bright area is that unloved commodities are no longer marching as much in step with other asset classes. "The opportunity for commodities to become more of a diversifier going forward is certainly there, but it's unlikely they're going to be the star performer in terms of returns." Bilton is advising clients to diversify through a host of methods from volatility funds to currencies. Institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance groups are also keen to diversify, but commodities are not on their radar, said Sorca Kelly-Scholte, head of EMEA pensions solutions and advisory at the fund manager. "Our view is that holding the actual commodities is not a long-term investment strategy for most pension funds. It may offer you some inflation protection over the long-term, but there's no added value from it." Other assets, such as infrastructure and real estate can provide inflation protection as well as added value, she added. Despite the long term slide in commodities, the sector has outperformed in recent months as oil and metals rebound, with the CRB Index up 15 percent since early April. That has driven natural resource funds, which have been popular recently among investors shifting from hedge funds and long-only funds into UCITs, a brand of funds regulated in the European Union (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities). "Interestingly enough, this year the number one performing sector has been the natural resources sector... so we've seen a lot of clients passively allocate to commodities," said Natasha Petiton, vice president in strategic product management. "But I don't think we're seeing a big trend in terms of significant target allocation to commodities, more of a tactical strategy."

Lu Wang Bloomberg News Published Wednesday, Oct. 05, 2016 11:03AM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Oct. 05, 2016 11:04AM EDT Comments AA The reckoning arrived for one of this year’s most popular trades. Low-volatility stocks have gone wild in recent months, discovering the danger in the second part of their name and rattling investors who sought safety by sending $6-billion dollars to the biggest exchange-traded funds that track them. Those flows have slowed as a measure of the group’s swings exceeds the broader market’s, reaching levels not seen in 20 years, data compiled by Bank of America Corp. and Bloomberg show. While analysts from firms including JPMorgan Chase & Co. have warned for months that elevated valuations have made the stocks vulnerable to a selloff, Tuesday’s slump in the S&P 500 Index provided a stark reminder of the pains inflicted by the unwinding of a crowded trade. Utility shares, the biggest component of the low-vol universe because of a once-coveted dividend payout, fell for an eighth straight day as rising bond yields erode the allure of equity income. “Selling begets more selling,” said Donald Selkin, the chief market strategist at National Securities Corp. in New York, who helps manage about $3-billion. “People did so well with those stocks earlier in the year and as the stocks start coming down, they say, ‘Get me out while I still have a profit.’ The perception can change rapidly, but now that’s the new mantra.” Volatility is exploding in a corner of the market that’s normally insulated from swings as central banks question the benefits of more stimulus after pushing global yields to record lows. Utility, phone and real-estate shares have started to move in lockstep with the prospects for higher interest rates, tumbling as the Federal Reserve moves closer to tightening this year. That’s a turnabout from the first half of 2016 when the groups led equity gains. Based on historic volatility over 60 days, low-vol stocks swung more than the market every day in the past two weeks. The group’s measure of fluctuations exceeded the S&P 500 by 14 per cent on Sept. 22, a level that’s been surpassed only once before, in January 1994. The runup in the shares this year also pushed valuations in the once-sleepy realm toward records. The S&P 500 Low Volatility Index trades at 20 times earnings, in line with the broader equity gauge. The low-vol group peaked at a valuation of 22 times in July, when the utility stocks that are its biggest component were 13 percent more expensive than technology shares that normally have among the highest valuations. Low-vol stocks on Tuesday fell to the lowest level since May, with a 1.2-per-cent decline double the loss in the S&P 500, as Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Fed Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker argued in favor of tightening monetary policy sooner than later. Investors see a 61-per-cent chance of the Fed raising rates in December, up 11 percentage points from a week earlier. Utility shares dropped 2.2 per cent, extending a 6.7-per-cent loss in the third quarter that’s the worst since the bull market began in 2009. The group’s down more than 7 per cent during its eight-day rout. The reversal is stark for the former market darlings. In the first six months, when the S&P 500 fell into a 10-per-cent correction and suffered a two-day selloff of 5.3 per cent in June after the U.K.’s secession vote, low-vol shares and utilities rallied at least 11 per cent, beating a 2.7-per-cent increase in the S&P 500. An investor retreat from ETFs may have exacerbated volatility in these stocks, according to Bank of America. The iShares Edge MSCI Minimum-Volatility ETF, the most favored equity fund in the first half with cash inflows that surpassed $6-billion, experienced two consecutive monthly declines in deposits through September. The PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio ETF saw investors pull $471-million last month, the biggest withdrawal in two years. “Overcrowded positioning in low-vol stock ETFs may be one reason behind their significantly higher volatility,” equity-derivatives analysts including Nitin Saksena wrote in a note Tuesday. “This corner of the market could be susceptible to further capitulation if there is a significant shift in confidence in the effectiveness of central-bank policy that causes investors to re-assess the duration risk embedded in their U.S. equity portfolios,” the analysts added.
