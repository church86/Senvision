John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 29, 2016 at 8:21AM Image source: The Motley Fool. The best thing about JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) stock has little to do with the stock itself, and more to do with the underlying fundamentals of the business. More specifically, if you buy shares of the nation's biggest bank by assets, you'll be aligned with one of the best bankers alive today. Getting to know Jamie Dimon JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon didn't follow the conventional path. After graduating near the top of his class at Harvard Business School, Dimon turned down some of the most coveted jobs in the financial industry, including the opportunity to work at Goldman Sachs. He instead chose to go and work under Sandy Weill, the president of American Express at the time and a well-known financial services empire builder. Weill was soon ousted from his post at the credit card giant and, along with Dimon, took control of a consumer credit company. They then expanded it over the years until, eventually, after merging with Citicorp in 1998, the company became what's known today as Citigroup. JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. Dimon became president at Citigroup, but was himself ousted by Weill not long after the merger, which created the first true universal bank in the United States since the Glass-Steagall Act was passed in the midst of the Great Depression. Dimon wasn't fired because he did anything wrong, but rather because he refused to promote Weill's daughter to a position Dimon didn't believe she was qualified for. After a brief hiatus, Dimon was hired to run Bank One, a regional bank based in Chicago at the time that ranked fifth in the country in terms of assets. He turned Bank One around, boosting not only its efficiency but also morale. He did the latter in part by investing a substantial part of his net worth in the bank's stock upon taking the helm. Dimon joins JPMorgan Chase Fast-forward to 2004, when JPMorgan Chase approached Bank One about a potential merger. The deal was attractive to JPMorgan Chase not only because it would give the Wall Street bank access to Bank One's plentiful retail deposit base, but also because it secured Dimon as the successor to William Harrison atop the combined firms. This was a prudent move. Dimon proceeded to improve the operations at JPMorgan Chase, much like he did at Bank One. And he was the single most important reason that the New York City-based bank not only survived the financial crisis of 2008, but actually thrived because of it. At the darkest points of the crisis, the government came to JPMorgan Chase twice for assistance (most other banks went in the opposite direction, hat in hand to the government). In March 2008, JPMorgan Chase rescued Bear Stearns, the fifth-largest stand-alone investment bank at the time. And six months later, JPMorgan Chase came to the rescue again, taking over the failed savings and loan giant Washington Mutual. These moves, combined with impressive organic growth under Dimon's watch, enabled JPMorgan Chase to climb once again to the apex of American finance, after years of lingering behind Citigroup and Bank of America. To this end, JPMorgan Chase is now the biggest bank in America by assets. And if you include assets under custody, it oversees around $30 trillion worth of on- and off-balance-sheet assets. And I'm not the only one who thinks highly of Dimon. Warren Buffett, one of the greatest bank investors in American history, praises the bank CEO regularly. Most recently, Buffett described an interview that Dimon sat for as "off the charts." And while Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, doesn't own shares of JPMorgan Chase, Buffett himself does. It was recently announced as well that one of Buffett's lieutenants at Berkshire has agreed to join JPMorgan Chase's board of directors. If you're considering buying shares of JPMorgan Chase and are wondering about the best reason to do so, I'd say it's none other than Jamie Dimon.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Money News | Sat Oct 29, 2016 | 12:46am IST Exclusive - Germany's Merck explores sale of biosimilar drug business: sources By Carl O'Donnell and Greg Roumeliotis German chemicals and pharmaceuticals company Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) is exploring a sale of its biosimilars unit, according to people familiar with the matter, as that business faces fierce competition from larger players in the sector. Biosimilars, the biotechnology-based equivalents of generic drugs, have become increasingly popular amid a drive to curb price increases. Stefan Oschmann, however, who took over as Merck's CEO earlier this year, has been focussed on finding ways to safeguard his company's leading position in the multiple sclerosis market. Its top selling drug in this space is Rebif. Merck has hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to sound out potential buyers for the biosimilar business, the people said on Friday. There is no guarantee that the discussions will result in any deal, they added. Merck's biosimilars business could be worth as much as $1 billion because of its long-term sales potential, the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Merck, which is independent of U.S. drug marker Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), declined to comment. A JPMorgan spokeswoman offered no immediate comment. Merck's biosimilar business includes a drug in advanced clinical trials that is a competitor to AbbVie Inc's (ABBV.N) popular arthritis treatment Humira. The unit also has several early-stage compounds. Merck is facing off against several larger competitors, including Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Novartis AG (NOVN.S), both of which have won regulatory approval for biosimilar drugs. Biosimilars have become an increasing area of focus for investors and industry executives in the past year, as regulators have begun approving a handful of compounds in the United States. Biosimilars are more complex than traditional drugs, requiring genetically engineered proteins. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration was not allowed to consider generic versions of biologic drugs until U.S. President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010. So far, the FDA has approved four biosimilar drugs, most recently a competitor for Humira made by Amgen Inc (AMGN.O). There are more than 60 biosimilars awaiting approval. More of those drugs are expected to be approved in the coming years, as biologic drugs representing more than $30 billion in sales will lose their patent protection between now and 2020, according to data from IMS Health. In Europe, where biosimilars were approved by regulators as early as 2006, more than 21 biosimilars made by 14 companies have been approved.

There are plenty of reasons to conclude that JPMorgan Chase is an attractive buy at today’s price. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 28, 2016 at 10:40AM Image source: Wikimedia Commons. There are few industries that have suffered as much over the last decade as banks, causing their stocks to tumble. But this shouldn't be interpreted as a reason to avoid the space. As a cursory analysis of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) shows, this is when enterprising investors want to think about adding these stocks to their portfolios. Bank stock valuations There's one reason that big bank stocks, like JPMorgan Chase, are compelling right now: valuation. Analysts and investors tend to value bank stocks by comparing their share prices to their book values per share. The typical bank in ordinary times will trade at or around one times book value, though this will vary over time as the prospects for the industry rise and fall with the business cycle. JPM Price to Book Value data by YCharts. When times are great and banks are making a lot of money, bank stocks trade for two or more times book value. But when the economy takes a turn for the worse, fueling loan losses and thereby weighing on bank share prices, bank stocks will trade for meaningful discounts to book value. It's for that reason that bank investors try to adhere to the axiom: "buy at half of book value and sell at two times book value." Doing that is hard, as calling either the bottom or the top of the market is difficult, if not impossible. Yet, you don't have to get your timing exactly right to still benefit from this approach. Why JPMorgan Chase stock is compelling Right now, JPMorgan Chase's shares offer a case in point. The nation's biggest bank by assets is trading for 1.1 times book value. That's not the bargain basement price that Bank of America or Citigroup are trading at -- approximately 30% below their respective book values -- but it's nevertheless reasonable when considering that JPMorgan Chase could easily trade for 1.5 times book value or higher in the years ahead. I say that because JPMorgan Chase is bound to make a lot more money when interest rates rise. There's no telling when that will happen, though chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon believes the Federal Reserve should do so sooner rather than later. Either way, it's safe to assume that higher rates are in the cards for the future. JPMorgan Chase even goes so far as to estimate how much this could help its top line. According to its latest quarterly filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission, a 100 basis point, or 1 percentage point, boost in rates would translate into $3 billion more net interest income. If rates rose by 200 basis points, it would generate $4.9 billion more net interest income from its asset portfolio. This would not only increase JPMorgan's profitability, it would also enable it to continue growing its already voluptuous dividend. The New York-based bank's shares yield 2.8%. That's the sixth highest among the nation's blue-chip bank stocks -- the roughly two dozen stocks on the KBW Bank Index -- and it's well above the 2.1% average yield on the S&P 500. While it's impossible to predict the future with any semblance of certainty, it's not unreasonable to think that JPMorgan Chase's shareholders will benefit as we proceed further and further away from the low interest rates produced by the financial crisis.

A consortium of 23 financial institutions previewed Zelle, which will be available next year, at an industry conference Sunday, according to Recode. Zelle’s website says users will be able to send money to almost anyone as long as they have a debit card. The money would be transferred immediately and could be used to pay bills or make payments to friends or others. Zelle will be available to more than 76 million customers who already do mobile banking with the large financial firms, according to Bloomberg. The initiative is designed to keep Square Cash, PayPal-owned Venmo and other mobile payment platforms from eating into bank business.

The upgrade of the primary servicer of Prime product rating reflects enhancements to Chase's servicing operations that are focused on improving the customer experience and increasing efficiencies. The upgrade, as well as the affirmation of the other Primary and Special servicer ratings and Stable Rating Outlook, reflects operational improvements, technology enhancements, continued progress on regulatory settlements, and consistent internal audit and Regulation AB (Reg AB) results. The affirmation of the master servicer rating and Stable Outlook reflect the company's established master servicing operation, continued support for the platform, consistent Reg AB and USAP results, and Fitch's observations regarding portfolio runoff. All of the servicer ratings incorporate the company's financial condition. Chase is rated 'AA-' with a Stable Outlook by Fitch. A company's financial condition is a component of Fitch's servicer rating analysis. Enhancements to Chase's servicing operations during the current review period included improved capacity planning to optimize customer communication channels leveraging multi-function specialists, streamlined processing of correspondence, and proactive monitoring of customer inquiries to identify complaints. Chase also expanded its use of scripting to increase the efficiency of processing payment exceptions. In addition, Chase developed and implemented a new platform for the management of its third party oversight program, and migrated the management of third party providers to the new platform. Chase continues to make progress on regulatory settlements entered into over the past several years. In January 2016, the OCC terminated the mortgage servicing-related consent order against Chase, and in September 2016, the RMBS Settlement Monitor released its final report regarding Chase's compliance with the settlement. Chase's internal audit reports continue to show an improving trend, with the number of significant findings remaining low. In addition, in Chase's most recent Reg AB report, the number of instances of material noncompliance for the primary and special servicing platform remained at one, which is consistent with the prior review. The most recent USAP report did not contain any instances of non-compliance. Chase's servicing operations are headquartered in Columbus OH, with additional servicing sites in Dallas, Phoenix, Monroe, LA and Jacksonville, FL and a captive site in Manila, the Philippines. As of June 30, 2016, Chase's primary and special servicing portfolio was comprised of more than 5.7 million loans totaling $881.3 billion. Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp. (WMMSC), a subsidiary of Chase, continues to be the legal entity overseeing Chase's master servicing activities. WMMSC has been operating for more than 38 years, including several predecessor entities that Chase acquired from Washington Mutual Bank (WaMu) and EMC Mortgage. Chase is leveraging the master servicing operation in its oversight of two subservicers. The most recent Reg AB and USAP reports for the master servicing operation did not contain any instances of material non-compliance, which is consistent with the prior review. WMMSC's portfolio continues to decrease, with no loans expected to be added to the platform to offset runoff. As of June 30, 2016, WMMSC's portfolio was comprised of approximately 23,700 loans totaling $7 billion, a decrease of 8.5% in loan count from 25,900 loans totaling $8 billion as of June 30, 2015. Fitch is concerned that as the portfolio continues to decline and with limited opportunities for new master servicing assignments due to low RMBS issuance, WMMSC may not continue to provide timely updates to its systems and processes with operational enhancements that incorporate industry changes. Fitch believes that Chase has capable primary, special, and master servicing operations with the staff, procedures, controls, default management processes, and technology to manage its current servicing portfolio. Fitch rates residential mortgage primary, master, and special servicers on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the highest rating. Within some of these rating levels, Fitch further differentiates ratings by plus (+) and minus (-) as well as the flat rating. For more information on Fitch's residential servicer rating program, please see Fitch's report 'Rating U.S. Residential and Small Balance Commercial Mortgage Servicer Rating Criteria', dated April 23, 2015 which is available on the Fitch Ratings web site at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Biosimilars, the biotechnology-based equivalents of generic drugs, have become increasingly popular amid a drive to curb price increases. Stefan Oschmann, however, who took over as Merck's CEO earlier this year, has been focused on finding ways to safeguard his company's leading position in the multiple sclerosis market. Its top selling drug in this space is Rebif. Merck has hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co to sound out potential buyers for the biosimilar business, the people said on Friday. There is no guarantee that the discussions will result in any deal, they added. Merck's biosimilars business could be worth as much as $1 billion because of its long-term sales potential, the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Merck, which is independent of U.S. drug marker Merck & Co Inc, declined to comment. A JPMorgan spokeswoman offered no immediate comment. Merck's biosimilar business includes a drug in advanced clinical trials that is a competitor to AbbVie Inc's popular arthritis treatment Humira. The unit also has several early-stage compounds. Merck is facing off against several larger competitors, including Pfizer Inc and Novartis AG, both of which have won regulatory approval for biosimilar drugs. Biosimilars have become an increasing area of focus for investors and industry executives in the past year, as regulators have begun approving a handful of compounds in the United States. Biosimilars are more complex than traditional drugs, requiring genetically engineered proteins. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration was not allowed to consider generic versions of biologic drugs until U.S. President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010. So far, the FDA has approved four biosimilar drugs, most recently a competitor for Humira made by Amgen Inc. There are more than 60 biosimilars awaiting approval. More of those drugs are expected to be approved in the coming years, as biologic drugs representing more than $30 billion in sales will lose their patent protection between now and 2020, according to data from IMS Health. In Europe, where biosimilars were approved by regulators as early as 2006, more than 21 biosimilars made by 14 companies have been approved.

Subscribe today! By Mark Williams The Columbus Dispatch  •  Friday October 28, 2016 4:03 PM The McCoy Center, JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s sprawling operation at Polaris, is getting an upgrade. The bank said Friday that it plans to spend $200 million to make over the 20-year old office building. The bank also plans some work at its mortgage operations at Easton. "To be investing this amount of money in a single facility certainly makes a statement of our commitment to the market and desire to have a facility that attracts the best and brightest in Columbus and around the world," Chase spokesman Jeff Lyttle said. The McCoy Center is Chase's largest building in the world and houses 10,000 workers. At 2 million square feet, the building is basically the size of the Empire State Building. While there will be cosmetic improvements to the building, including a remake of the quarter-mile atrium inside the McCoy Center, the focus will be on creating customized work space for employees. "There will be many more collaborative spaces where teams can gather and brainstorm, room with floor to ceiling whiteboards that they can write and come up with ideas," Lyttle said of the McCoy Center. The banking industry has changed significantly since the McCoy Center opened. Today, much of the focus of the workers at the building and surrounding campus is on technology. Teams are working on digital products such as Chase's website, mobile apps and products for consumers and small businesses along with improvements on Chase offices and ATMs. "It's re-imagining the work space. It's the reflection of the changing nature of the industry, the largest tech hub for the firm in the world," Lyttle said. Worker already has started on the roof, but the project is expected to take several years to complete. As part of the project, Chase also plans work at its building on Vision Drive at Easton. mawilliams@dispatch.com @BizMarkWilliams Favorite Print Story Advertisement • Place an ad News Video More Videos Advertisement • Place an ad Explore Columbus Search Businesses Featured Businesses Loading...

(TSX VENTURE: MBC) ("MBAC" or the "Company") is pleased to announce the completion of the Canadian portion of its previously announced recapitalization transaction (the "Recapitalization") pursuant to an amended and restated plan of compromise and arrangement (the "CCAA Plan") under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) (the "CCAA") dated September 14, 2016. As previously announced, the CCAA Plan was approved by affected unsecured creditors of the Company that voted, in person or by proxy, at a meeting held on September 20, 2016. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) (the "Court") granted an order approving the CCAA Plan on October 3, 2016. In combination with the CCAA Plan, MBAC and certain affiliates implemented a concurrent plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act (the "CBCA Plan" and together with the CCAA Plan, the "Plan"). Implementation of the Plan will result in a number of benefits to the Company, including, among other things, a significant reduction of the Company's debt and improved financial flexibility for the Company. Additional information regarding MBAC's CCAA proceedings is available on the website established by Ernst & Young Inc., in its capacity as court-appointed monitor, at http://www.ey.com/ca/mbac. Effect of the Plan The working capital and operational requirements of MBAC and its subsidiaries prior to and during the CCAA process were funded by secured interim financing (the "Interim Financing") provided by Zaff LLC (the "Plan Sponsor") pursuant to secured promissory notes and pursuant to a DIP term sheet that was approved by the Court on August 4, 2016. The Interim Financing in an aggregate principal amount of approximately U.S.$11.4 million was advanced by the Plan Sponsor in connection with the implementation of the Plan and the Brazilian Proceedings (as defined below). Prior to the implementation of the Plan, the Plan Sponsor was the owner of substantially all outstanding secured and guaranteed funded debt of the Company and its Brazilian subsidiaries (other than guaranteed debts owing to Banco Modal S.A.) as well as certain outstanding unsecured debts of the Company and the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries that were not guaranteed by the Company (collectively, the "Acquired Debt"), which claims, together with the claims of other creditors of MBAC and its subsidiaries, were compromised through the CCAA Plan or are anticipated to be comprised through the Brazilian Plan (as defined below). As a result of the implementation of the Plan: --  MBAC completed a vertical amalgamation with two wholly-owned
    subsidiaries. The resulting entity ("MBAC Amalco") is named "MBAC
    Fertilizer Corp.".

--  Common shares of MBAC Amalco ("Common Shares") issued and outstanding
    immediately prior to the implementation of the Plan were consolidated at
    a ratio of one (1) post-consolidation Common Share for each 100 pre-
    consolidation Common Shares (the "Consolidation"). Any fractional Common
    Shares resulting from the Consolidation were rounded down to the next
    whole share without any additional compensation thereof. As a result of
    the Consolidation and the other steps described below, holders of such
    shares represent approximately 3.48% of the equity of MBAC Amalco in the
    aggregate. A letter of transmittal with respect to the Consolidation
    will be mailed to affected shareholders which letter sets out
    instructions as to how registered shareholders can receive certificates
    representing post-Consolidation Common Shares.

--  MBAC Amalco continued under the laws of the Cayman Islands.

--  The Plan Sponsor transferred to MBAC Amalco its indirect interest in
    approximately U.S.$237 million of secured and unsecured debt plus
    accrued interest owing by the Brazilian subsidiaries of MBAC to the Plan
    Sponsor or its affiliates, in exchange for 34,291,400 Common Shares.

--  The Plan Sponsor transferred to MBAC Amalco its indirect interest in (i)
    GB Minerals Ltd., a TSX Venture Exchange (the "TSXV") listed phosphate
    exploration company; and (ii) Stonegate Agricom Ltd., a TSX listed
    phosphate exploration company, in exchange for an aggregate of 9,569,760
    Common Shares.

--  The Plan Sponsor settled the Interim Financing, as well as the funding
    provided by the Plan Sponsor to satisfy cash distributions under the
    Plan in the amount of approximately C$700,000, in exchange for 6,012,986
    Common Shares.

--  Certain unsecured creditors of MBAC elected to receive 5.5% of their
    claim in cash, or payment of their claim in full up to C$10,000.

--  Certain unsecured creditors of MBAC received a combination of Common
    Shares and restructured debt of MBAC Amalco, in the form of debentures
    ("Debentures"). Debentures mature in ten (10) years and, with respect to
    the principal amount thereof only, are convertible into Common Shares at
    a price per share equal to the greater of: (i) C$25.00; and (ii) if
    applicable, the closing market price of Common Shares on the TSXV for
    the most recent trading day preceding the eleventh business day
    following the date on which Common Shares commence trading on the TSXV,
    subject to TSXV approval. An aggregate of 463,826 Common Shares and
    C$3,691,217.81 in principal amount of Debentures were issued to such
    unsecured creditors. Assuming a conversion price of C$25.00 per Common
    Share, an additional 147,648 Common Shares are issuable on conversion of
    the Debentures.

 As a result of the implementation of the Plan, there are currently 52,154,038 Common Shares issued and outstanding of which 50,198,869 Common Shares, representing 96.25% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares (on an undiluted basis), are beneficially owned, or controlled or directed, directly or indirectly, by the Plan Sponsor. In addition, assuming full conversion of the Debentures, there would be 52,301,686 Common Shares issued and outstanding. The Brazilian Proceedings In connection with the Recapitalization, certain of MBAC's subsidiaries, including its primary operating subsidiary in Brazil, Itafos Mineracao S.A., as well as MBAC Fertilizantes S.A. and MBAC Desenvolvimento S.A. (collectively, the "Brazilian Restructuring Entities") commenced parallel extrajudicial restructuring proceedings under applicable restructuring laws in Brazil (the "Brazilian Proceedings") seeking to implement a reorganization plan (the "Brazilian Plan") entered into by and among MBAC, the Brazilian Restructuring Entities, the Plan Sponsor and its affiliates, and Alpha Fundo de Investimento em Participacoes. MBAC is an intervener in the Brazilian Proceedings. On May 16, 2016, the Brazilian Court issued a decision which, among other things, granted a 180 day stay period and directed the publication of a public announcement to notify the Brazilian Restructuring Entities' unsecured creditors of the deadline to object to the Brazilian Proceedings. Certain objections were filed in connection with the Brazilian Proceedings and were rejected by the Brazilian Court, which confirmed the Brazilian Plan. Generally, and pursuant to applicable bankruptcy laws in Brazil, such appeals neither stay the proceedings nor prevent the implementation of the Brazilian Plan. It is anticipated that the Brazilian Plan will be implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a result of the Brazilian Proceedings, certain unsecured creditors of the Brazilian Restructuring Entities will receive either a combination of (i) restructured debt ("Brazilian Debentures") of the respective Brazilian Restructuring Entity; and (ii) warrants of the respective Brazilian Restructuring Entity ("Warrants") or, in the alternative, cash. Brazilian Debentures and Warrants are exercisable into preferred shares of the applicable Brazilian Restructuring Entity, which preferred shares may then be exchanged for up to 1,074,965 Common Shares. Information Concerning MBAC Amalco Following Implementation of the Plan The following table shows the effect of the Plan on MBAC Amalco's consolidated debt structure. Unaudited Pre-Plan and Unaudited Pro Forma (as at June 30, 2016) Debt Structure Enclosed with this press release is an unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position of MBAC Amalco as at June 30, 2016 after giving effect to the Plan.

The unaudited pro forma financial information was prepared based upon currently available information and assumptions deemed appropriate by management and is for illustrative purposes only. The pro forma financial information has not been audited and should not be considered comprehensive and may differ significantly from the actual adjustments that may result from the implementation of the Plan and related transactions in the future. Pursuant to the Plan, all existing options issued under MBAC's stock option plan were cancelled and the stock option plan was amended in accordance with the rules of the TSXV to, among other things, provide for restrictions on the issuance of options to certain categories of persons. Additionally, new plans were established to provide for the issuance of deferred share units and restricted share units, respectively. Options may be issued to specified officers and members of management of MBAC Amalco and its affiliates for up to 5% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares at an exercise price based upon the market price of Common Shares ten (10) business days after Common Shares commence trading on the TSXV.

(the "Company") includes pro forma adjustments illustrating the impact that the specific terms of the plan of compromise and arrangement pursuant to the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (the "Plan of Arrangement") will have on the Company's financial position. These adjustments are for illustrative purposes only, have not been audited, should not be considered comprehensive and may differ significantly from the actual adjustments that may result from the approved Plan of Arrangement in the future. This unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position should be read in conjunction with: 1.  the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the years
    ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (and accompanying notes and related
    management discussion and analysis);
2.  the June 30, 2016 consolidated interim financial statements (and
    accompanying notes and related management discussion and analysis); and
3.  the press release of the Company dated October 27, 2016 that details the
    implementation of the Plan of Arrangement.

 The Company's financial statements on a future date giving effect to the Plan of Arrangement may differ significantly from the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (and accompanying notes and related management discussion and analysis) and this unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position.

    company.

 Other than those transactions described above, the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at June 30, 2016 does not give effect to transactions occurring after June 30, 2016. The events and transactions will be accounted for on the basis of events and circumstances at the implementation date of the Plan of Arrangement (the "Effective Date"). In conjunction with the implementation of the Plan of Arrangement, certain liabilities and equity classified as "Accounts payable and accrued liabilities", "Notes payable", "Option component of convertible notes", "Share capital" and "Deficit" on the Company's unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at June 30, 2016 are subject to recapitalization. Plan of Arrangement Pro Forma Adjustments In conjunction with the implementation of the Plan of Arrangement, adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position are as follows: 1.  Compromise of Company Debt: As a result of the Plan of Arrangement and
    reorganization proceedings in Brazil, secured and unsecured creditors
    will receive either cash (up to allowed limits) or shares.

2.  Acquisition of Assets by the Company: In connection with implementation
    of the Plan of Arrangement, the Company indirectly acquired:

    a.  all of the shares of GBL beneficially held by the Plan Sponsor at
        the time of closing; and
    b.  all of the shares of Stonegate beneficially held by the Plan Sponsor
        at the time of closing. At the time of implementation of the Plan of
        Arrangement, the Plan Sponsor owned approximately 31.3% of GBL and
        approximately 36.5% of Stonegate.

3.  DIP Financing for Restructuring Costs: The Plan Sponsor has advanced
    funds until the Effective Date and will continue to advance funds to
    allow the Company to meet its ongoing care and maintenance operations
    plus restructuring costs.

But the last really politically meaningful piece of data comes this morning at 8:30 a.m. with the first read on Q3 U.S. growth. Estimates are all over the map from under 2 percent (a welcome headline for Donald Trump) to over 3 percent (a big talking point for Hillary Clinton). The numbers so far this year have been weak with Q1 at just 0.8 percent and Q2 at 1.4 percent. Those tepid figures have allowed Trump and the GOP to argue for a change of course in economic policy. But partly due to the GOP nominee’s inability to stick to a single clear message (along with the many other distractions surrounding his campaign), the state of the economy has not dominated the 2016 campaign the way it might have. Clinton has also been able to point to a steadily dropping unemployment rate and increasing wages as counter points to the sluggish growth numbers. Story Continued Below HFE’s Jim O’Sullivan on what to expect: “We have raised our estimate for Q3 real GDP growth to 3.0 percent at an annual rate from 2.5 percent. … [W]e held off on making a change until we saw the September durable goods report. … [W]e expect a decline in the business-investment-in-equipment component of GDP in the Q3 report. Other components should be more than offsetting, however — most notably consumer spending, exports and inventories. Pantheon’s Ian Shepherdson: “Two entirely separate factors point to significant upside risk to the first estimate of third quarter GDP growth, due today. First, we think it likely that farm inventories will not fall far enough to offset the unprecedented surge in exports of soybeans, which will add some 0.9 percentage points to headline GDP growth. … “We suspect our forecasts for the other components of GDP growth aren't far from the consensus estimates. We look for a 2.7 percent rise in consumption, unchanged fixed investment, excluding housing, and a 1 percent drop in government spending. But if the BEA is very cautious on farm inventories and allows only a partial export offset, and the IVA is in line with the PPI data, then GDP will come in well above the consensus, and it might — might — even reach 4 percent.” CITI ON INFRASTRUCTURE — Donald Trump on Thursday proposed spending $1 trillion on infrastructure. In a new report, Citi suggests even that huge sum is just a small part of the global need: “[G]lobal infrastructure needs will amount to $58.6 trillion over the next 15 years … Yet challenges continue to prevent this capital from being unlocked, including a lack of transparency and data, and political and regulatory instability. “Should these challenges be overcome, the benefits are clear: Per Citi analysis, every 1 percent increase in infrastructure spend will lead to a 1.2 percent growth in GDP. For global GDP growth in 2017 to reach the OECD prediction of 3.8 percent, infrastructure spending must increase by 1 percent of global GDP from 3.4 percent of global GDP to 4.4 percent.” Full report. THE CITY IS STARTING TO BRACE FOR CARNEY'S DEPARTURE — Via POLITICO’s Francesco Guerrera, maestro of the London-based “Morning Exchange” newsletter: “Let me say it at the outset: I don't know whether Mark Carney will decide to leave the helm of the Bank of England in 2018 as planned, or serve out his eight-year term until 2021. But I'm picking up a growing concern in financial circles that the BoE governor might soon say he is leaving in 2018. Some people claim to actually know, others are reading the tea leaves (and Carney's recent pronouncements). Why now? Because Carney has said that he will announce his intentions before the end of the year. And because he has been attacked by Euroskeptic politicians for his alleged siding with the Remain campaign before the referendum. Of late, even Prime Minister Theresa May and Finance Minister Philip Hammond added to the criticism of the BoE's policies, prompting a visibly nonplussed Carney to tell a town hall meeting in Northern England: ‘We will not take instructions on policy from the politicians.’ Read more.

DRIVING THE DAY — Hillary Clinton campaigns in Cedar Rapids and Des Moines, Iowa. President Obama campaigns for Clinton in Orlando … Donald Trump campaigns in Manchester, N.H., Lisbon, Maine (home of one electoral vote) and Cedar Rapids, Iowa … First look at Q3 GDP at 8:30 a.m. expected to show growth of 2.6 percent … Univ. Of Michigan Consumer Sentiment at 10:00 a.m. expected to rise to 88.5 from 87.9. TRUMP OCT. CONTRIBUTION: $31K — Tweet via @kenvogel: “Trump boasted he'd reach $100M in self-funding, but he only gave his campaign $31k this mo. Now at $56.1M total.” FEC report. TOTALS — Trump’s campaign reported $15.9M on hand as of 10/19. Hillary Clinton’s campaign reported $62.4M on hand. Oddly enough, Clinton also apparently gave more to her campaign during the reporting period ($50K) than Trump. TOP TRUMP QUOTES OF THE DAY — To supporters in Toledo, Ohio: "We should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right? What are we even having it for? Her policies are so bad." To Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly on polls: “The only one I really like are the ones where I'm winning.” ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: Now delivering: Retirement security for life!

Learn more at: http://irionline.org/agenda. ** BIDEN FOR STATE? — POLITICO’s Edward-Isaac Dovere: “Joe Biden is at the top of the internal short list Hillary Clinton’s transition team is preparing for her pick to be secretary of state, a source familiar with the planning tells POLITICO. This would be the first major Cabinet candidate to go public for a campaign that’s insisted its focus remains on winning the election, and perhaps the most central choice for a potential president who was a secretary of state herself. “Neither Clinton nor her aides have yet told Biden. According to the source, they’re strategizing about how to make the approach to the vice president, who almost ran against her in the Democratic primaries but has since been campaigning for her at a breakneck pace all over the country in these final months” Read more. DEAL FRENZY DOESN’T PAUSE FOR ELECTION — WSJ’s Dana Cimilluca, Dana Mattioli and David Benoit: “The eve of a presidential election is typically a time when companies put merger plans on hold and wait for clarity on crucial matters like antitrust policy. Not this year. Less than two weeks before voters head to the polls, U.S. companies have unleashed a wave of deals that has made this month the busiest ever for mergers and acquisitions. The deal making culminated inQualcomm Inc.’s agreement Thursday to buy NXP SemiconductorsNV for $39 billion, part of a swirl of consolidation in the semiconductor industry. “The NXP acquisition counts as the second-largest pure technology deal of all time after Dell Inc.’s recent acquisition of EMC Corp. for about $60 billion. And it comes just days after AT&T Inc. struck the biggest takeover deal of the year, with a pact to buy Time Warner Inc.for $85 billion. A day earlier, British American Tobacco PLC made a $47 billion offer to take full control of Reynolds American Inc. in a move that would create the world’s largest listed tobacco company by revenue and market value” Read more. FCC CHOOSES PRIVACY — The Washington Post’s Brian Fung and Craig Timberg: “Federal officials delivered a landmark ruling in favor of online privacy Thursday, limiting how Internet providers use and sell customer data, while asserting that customers have a right to control their personal information. “Under the Federal Communications Commission’s new rules, consumers may forbid Internet providers from sharing sensitive personal information, such as app and browsing histories, mobile location data and other information generated while using the Internet.” Read more. AMAZON SLIPS — FT’s Hannah Kuchler: “Amazon shares fell 6 per cent in after-hours trading in New York on Thursday when the online retailer significantly missed earnings expectations in the third quarter, and forecast operating income of as little as zero next quarter. “Investment in distribution warehouses, video content from top tier directors and actors and the engineering teams behind virtual assistant Alexa helped push operating costs up 29 per cent — and look set to continue into the holiday shopping season.” Read more. DEUTSCHE BOUNCES BACK — NYT’s Chad Bray and Landon Thomas Jr.: “The bank, Germany’s largest, said on Thursday that it had returned to a profit in the third quarter and was making progress in its efforts to turn around the business. Analysts expected a loss for the quarter. “In addition, Deutsche Bank, which also has big trading operations in New York and London, said that its capital position had improved, with its Tier 1 capital ratio edging up to 11.1 percent, from 10.8 percent.” Read more. CETA GETS A SECOND LIFE — POLITICO EU’s Christian Oliver and Simon Marks: “Belgium’s regional governments have granted a temporary stay of execution to the European Commission’s trade policy by agreeing at the 11th-hour to support a landmark EU deal with Canada. “Belgium’s Prime Minister Charles Michel announced on Thursday that days of marathon talks between the federal government and regional leaders had finally paid dividends and that it would be possible to win backing for the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement from the rebel assemblies: Wallonia, Wallonia-Brussels and Brussels.” Read more. NCUA ALLOWS CREDIT UNION EXPANSION — POLITICO’s Victoria Guida: “The National Credit Union Administration Thursday approved a final rule that would further expand the potential for credit unions to serve a wider population of customers, in a move that is rankling community banks “While credit unions are cheering the move as long-awaited relief from restrictions on who they can sign on as members, community banks have criticized the rule as outside the scope of the Federal Credit Union Act, which gives credit unions tax-exempt status.” Read more. TWITTER KILLS VINE — The Washington Post’s Andrea Peterson: “Twitter announced Thursday that it's shutting down Vine, a social network that lets users create and share short-form videos, ‘in the coming months.’ “The decision to shutter Vine comes as Twitter is in a state of flux after weeks of rumors about a possible sale. On Thursday, the company also announced a restructuring that will cut 9 percent of its workforce. It's unclear whether members of the Vine team will be included in the layoffs.” Read more. GE IN TALKS WITH BAKER HUGHES — WSJ’s Dana Mattioli, Kate Linebaugh and Joann S. Lublin: “General Electric Co. is in talks to buy Baker Hughes Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, a transaction that would be the biggest in the history of the industrial giant and extend its bet on the battered oil industry. “With a market value of $23 billion, Houston-based Baker Hughes could go for more than $30 billion in a takeover, given the typical premium. GE has a market value of $259 billion.” Read more. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — BANK TRADES RIP NCUA — ABA’s Rob Nichols: “We’re deeply concerned about NCUA’s decision to go beyond its statutory authority to move credit unions even further away from the common bonds that define their missions” ICBA’s Cam Fine emails: “What the NCUA did today was eviscerate the common bond statute by allowing all air breathing mammals to join credit unions. Credit unions are tax-free institutions and were never meant to operate as the functional equivalent of commercial banks. “They don’t pay one dime in Federal or state taxes. The growth of the credit union industry is on the backs of American taxpayers and thousands of communities across the nation who rely on tax-paying community banks to fund their local schools, fire halls, hospitals, and community infrastructure.” NAFCU DEFENDS — Executive Vice President of Government Affairs & General Counsel Carrie Hunt: “NAFCU continues to hear from our members that NCUA’s current FOM rules and regulations have unnecessarily inhibited their ability to serve their communities. Additionally, NAFCU members believe that the federal credit union charter must keep pace with changes in state laws, technology, and the progressiveness of the financial services industry” ADS HIT GOP MEMBERS OVER WALL STREET — Per release: “Today, the Working Families Party launched new 30-second TV ads that slams three Republican members of the House Financial Services Committee for putting Wall Street ahead of working families … The ad takes aim at Reps. Scott Garrett (NJ-05), Sean Duffy (WI-07) and French Hill (AR-02) over a recent vote in the Financial Services Committee for a bill (HR 5983) which would roll back financial regulations” CARLYLE PIVOTS AWAY FROM HEDGE FUNDS — NYT’s Alexandra Stevenson: “Prominent public pension funds have turned their backs on hedge funds, and so have a few big insurance companies. Now, one of the world’s biggest private equity firms, the Carlyle Group, is walking away, too. Carlyle told investors this week that it was pivoting away from its hedge fund investments, once worth $15 billion. “Speaking to investors, the Carlyle co-founder William E. Conway Jr. said the firm’s performance in hedge funds did not meet the expectations of its investors. ‘And when our performance falls short, it is critical for both our fund investors and for the firm that we deal with the consequences,’ Mr. Conway said.” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements. With longer lifespans, this often means saving for a longer retirement. These challenges have made planning and saving for retirement more difficult. But what if all Americans could get paychecks for life? Policymakers can help make this possible by supporting policies that encourage saving, make workplace retirement plans more broadly available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies.

JPMorgan beat analyst expectations this month, announcing fixed income revenues were up 48 percent on the year. Goldman Sachs crushed estimates, reporting that its fixed income, currency and commodities trading was the main driver, increasing 34 percent on year. The same happened for Citigroup and Bank of America and European lenders, such as Barclays, have followed suit. And this trend could be set to continue, according to Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank. "It is possible that banks' profits will continue to be supported by fixed income. The increase in volatility may support the number of transactions and could lead to higher profitability for banks," she told CNBC. Foley defends that political uncertainty in 2017 will lead to more volatility in bond markets. The uncertainty regarding the U.S. election might soon evaporate, but Europe faces key elections – including in Germany, France and the Netherlands, where rising support for nationalist parties is becoming stronger. Getty Images Janet Yellen Expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will again raise interest rates and potential changes to global inflation might also increase the odds of market volatility. This comes after bonds, which are perceived as a safe haven, have once again been back in favor this year with the German government bund yield falling below zero a few months ago. Yields move inversely to bond prices. "Fixed income trading will continue to drive investment bank profitability (into 2017), as the new bond issuance calendar looks strong. M&A (merger and acquisition)-related issuance as well as corporates extending their debt maturity profile seems like it will continue, especially ahead of further U.S. interest rate increases," Shilen Shah, a bond strategist at Investec, told CNBC. Fed officials have given indications that a second rate hike this year could take place in December. However, in Europe, there are no interest hikes on the horizon, with the ECB (European Central Bank) expected to keep its monetary policy loose. "Divergence (in) interest rate policy could potentially be a catalyst for more volatility in bond markets," Shah said. "If inflation expectations increase, driven for example by a higher oil price, some of the deflationary pressures on bond yields could be reserved. Increased bond market volatility is most likely to benefit those banks with large fixed-income flow businesses, as they are likely to see higher trading volume."

Three people familiar with the case say the government has been investigating at least a dozen Venezuelans and is expected to file charges in Houston against a few of them as soon as next month. Those on the list, including former executives of Petroleos de Venezuela SA, known as PDVSA, are suspected of having taken bribes from middlemen to award contracts at inflated prices, helping to siphon more than $11 billion out of the country. All three people spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing and sensitive due to its impact on U.S. foreign policy. The government has set its sights on a number of U.S. assets, including about 20 residential properties, some in West Palm Beach and the Houston suburbs. Switzerland has seized $118 million in assets from Swiss banks related to the matter and sent $51 million to U.S. authorities, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. Venezuela’s Congress Accuses Venezuela’s opposition-run congress is separately seeking to recover $11.3 billion that went missing from PDVSA between 2004 and 2014 while Rafael Ramirez, currently Venezuela’s ambassador to the United Nations, was company president. It seeks to hold him politically responsible. Ramirez has rejected the congressional accusations as lies. Investigators are also looking at the dealings involving PDVSA and a number of companies, including Pratt & Whitney, General Electric Co. and Rolls Royce Holdings Plc, as well as ProEnergy Services, a Missouri-based firm, two of the people said. The prosecutors have been tracking money that flowed through Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co., they added. A Pratt & Whitney spokesperson declined to comment and noted that its power systems business, which operated in Venezuela, was divested in June 2013 and became PW Power Systems. PW Power Systems did not respond to requests for comment. The other three companies declined to comment, as did all three banks and PDVSA. The banks handled transactions through accounts held by the individuals who transferred some of their gains out of the country, two of the people said. Money-laundering controls may not have caught transactions done through shell companies, they said. Cocaoine trafficking The people under investigation include current Venezuelan government officials, prominent businessmen and individuals suspected of involvement with cocaine trafficking, two of the people said. Homeland Security Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI are all involved in the investigation, which has been under way for at least three years and looks at activity going back to 2005. The FBI declined to comment, as did the DEA, the Justice Department, Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S. Attorney’s office in Houston. The investigation comes at a time when the cost of corruption is vividly apparent in Venezuela’s crumbling economy. A former finance minister, Jorge Giordani, has said that as much as $300 billion was embezzled from Venezuela in the last decade through high-level corruption. Meanwhile, hunger is spreading in a country that was once one of the world’s wealthiest. Struggling to avoid default, PDVSA on Monday reached an agreement with some creditors to push back bond maturities. Confrontation with Maduro In response to the national crisis, the opposition has sought a voter signature drive aimed at recalling President Nicolas Maduro. Last week the National Electoral Council, which is run by Maduro loyalists, suspended that effort. On Sunday, the opposition accused the president of carrying out a coup and vowed to try to replace key figures on the Supreme Court and electoral council and appeal to the International Criminal Court. The U.S. has a strong legal interest in the case because the allegedly ill-gotten money passed through its banks and was used to buy property here. The people under investigation have been linked to billions of dollars of gains, much of which was transferred to offshore accounts in Panama, the people said. The U.S. would seize homes and properties — many of them worth tens of millions each — as well as private jets and other assets to create a fund that would eventually be returned to the Venezuelan government after a democratic election, one of the people said. Ricardo Hausmann, a Venezuelan economist at Harvard who would like to see the current government replaced, said U.S. leadership in this area could prove important. ‘Devastating Political Effect’ “If the U.S. were to say, ‘We’ve identified billions of dollars,’ it would have a devastating political effect at home with Venezuela’s current government,” he said. Washington would also earn goodwill if it later returned any stolen funds, he added. Javier Corrales, a political scientist at Amherst College, said that in dealing with Venezuela the U.S. has made a point of sanctioning individuals rather than the government as a whole. Some within law enforcement have nonetheless alleged that the Obama administration is dragging its feet in pursuing Venezuelan officials because of its desire to avoid a political and economic implosion there and to help negotiate a soft landing from the current crisis. Corrales said that while political interference may play a role in the sealing of some indictments, the U.S. government largely lets its justice system do its work. PDVSA’s U.S. affiliate that handles international purchasing is in Houston, where the U.S. recently prosecuted a case which investigators say resembles this one. Roberto Rincon-Fernandez, a Venezuelan national living there, took part in a $1 billion bribery scheme to secure contracts with PDVSA. He pleaded guilty to two counts, including conspiracy to violate corruption laws. Ever since the leftist party of Hugo Chavez was elected in 1998, Venezuela has allied itself with historic opponents of the U.S., including Cuba and Iran. The U.S. accuses Venezuela of allowing itself to be used as a route for illegal drugs and of failing to adhere to international counter-narcotics agreements. Two nephews of President Maduro arrested in Haiti are being held in the U.S. on charges that they were involved in a drug-trafficking ring. They have denied it. A State Department official said they are cooperating with federal investigators. Click Tag(s) for Related Articles: BriberyCorruptionCourt of JusticePDVSAU.S.A.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 29, 2016 at 8:21AM Image source: The Motley Fool. The best thing about JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) stock has little to do with the stock itself, and more to do with the underlying fundamentals of the business. More specifically, if you buy shares of the nation's biggest bank by assets, you'll be aligned with one of the best bankers alive today. Getting to know Jamie Dimon JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon didn't follow the conventional path. After graduating near the top of his class at Harvard Business School, Dimon turned down some of the most coveted jobs in the financial industry, including the opportunity to work at Goldman Sachs. He instead chose to go and work under Sandy Weill, the president of American Express at the time and a well-known financial services empire builder. Weill was soon ousted from his post at the credit card giant and, along with Dimon, took control of a consumer credit company. They then expanded it over the years until, eventually, after merging with Citicorp in 1998, the company became what's known today as Citigroup. JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. Dimon became president at Citigroup, but was himself ousted by Weill not long after the merger, which created the first true universal bank in the United States since the Glass-Steagall Act was passed in the midst of the Great Depression. Dimon wasn't fired because he did anything wrong, but rather because he refused to promote Weill's daughter to a position Dimon didn't believe she was qualified for. After a brief hiatus, Dimon was hired to run Bank One, a regional bank based in Chicago at the time that ranked fifth in the country in terms of assets. He turned Bank One around, boosting not only its efficiency but also morale. He did the latter in part by investing a substantial part of his net worth in the bank's stock upon taking the helm. Dimon joins JPMorgan Chase Fast-forward to 2004, when JPMorgan Chase approached Bank One about a potential merger. The deal was attractive to JPMorgan Chase not only because it would give the Wall Street bank access to Bank One's plentiful retail deposit base, but also because it secured Dimon as the successor to William Harrison atop the combined firms. This was a prudent move. Dimon proceeded to improve the operations at JPMorgan Chase, much like he did at Bank One. And he was the single most important reason that the New York City-based bank not only survived the financial crisis of 2008, but actually thrived because of it. At the darkest points of the crisis, the government came to JPMorgan Chase twice for assistance (most other banks went in the opposite direction, hat in hand to the government). In March 2008, JPMorgan Chase rescued Bear Stearns, the fifth-largest stand-alone investment bank at the time. And six months later, JPMorgan Chase came to the rescue again, taking over the failed savings and loan giant Washington Mutual. These moves, combined with impressive organic growth under Dimon's watch, enabled JPMorgan Chase to climb once again to the apex of American finance, after years of lingering behind Citigroup and Bank of America. To this end, JPMorgan Chase is now the biggest bank in America by assets. And if you include assets under custody, it oversees around $30 trillion worth of on- and off-balance-sheet assets. And I'm not the only one who thinks highly of Dimon. Warren Buffett, one of the greatest bank investors in American history, praises the bank CEO regularly. Most recently, Buffett described an interview that Dimon sat for as "off the charts." And while Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, doesn't own shares of JPMorgan Chase, Buffett himself does. It was recently announced as well that one of Buffett's lieutenants at Berkshire has agreed to join JPMorgan Chase's board of directors. If you're considering buying shares of JPMorgan Chase and are wondering about the best reason to do so, I'd say it's none other than Jamie Dimon.

A JPMorgan spokeswoman offered no immediate comment. Merck's biosimilar business includes a drug in advanced clinical trials that is a competitor to AbbVie Inc's popular arthritis treatment Humira. The unit also has several early-stage compounds. Merck is facing off against several larger competitors, including Pfizer Inc and Novartis AG , both of which have won regulatory approval for biosimilar drugs. Biosimilars have become an increasing area of focus for investors and industry executives in the past year, as regulators have begun approving a handful of compounds in the United States. Biosimilars are more complex than traditional drugs, requiring genetically engineered proteins. The US Food and Drug Administration was not allowed to consider generic versions of biologic drugs until US President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010. So far, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved four biosimilar drugs, most recently a competitor for Humira made by Amgen Inc . There are more than 60 biosimilars awaiting approval. More of those drugs are expected to be approved in the coming years, as biologic drugs representing more than $30 billion in sales will lose their patent protection between now and 2020, according to data from IMS Health. In Europe, where biosimilars were approved by regulators as early as 2006, more than 21 biosimilars made by 14 companies have been approved.

This gala will honor the winners and finalists of the 2016 Start Something Challenge (SSC), as well as RTC’s 2016 Champions of Entrepreneurship: JPMorgan Chase, “Champion of Inclusive Economies”; inventor Joy Mangano–whose story was featured in the movie “Joy”– “Entrepreneur of the Year”; and The Blackstone Charitable Foundation, “Champion of Innovation.” “There is no way we could impact the communities we work in without the support of our funders who underwrite our programs, our community partners who refer students to us and host our classes, our instructors and coaches who deliver needed services to our entrepreneurs, and our entrepreneurs who trust us to help them grow their businesses,” explained Alfa Demmellash, CEO, and co-founder of Rising Tide Capital. “We are so grateful to our community of partners whose support allows us to provide financial grants to our 2016 SSC winners and to transform ideas into sustainable and community-enriching businesses. Because of their commitment, as of 2015 there were 1,385 graduates of our nationally-recognized Community Business Academy–many of whom continue to receive support services from Rising Tide Capital through our Business Acceleration Services program.” At the gala, the winners of this year’s SSC will be recognized and they will receive $25,000 in grants and prizes. Over the past 5 years, nearly 400 individuals from across New Jersey have entered the competition and the winning entrepreneurs have been awarded with approximately $125,000 in grants to support and grow their businesses. The proceeds from the gala will underwrite scholarships for entrepreneurs from traditionally underserved communities to participate in Rising Tide Capital’s nationally recognized Community Business Academy, an intensive and targeted 12-week training on how to start, grow, and sustain a business. Within 2 years of graduating from this program entrepreneurs see a 64% increase in their business sales and a corresponding 47% increase in household income. They also experience a 56% reduction in the use of public assistance resulting from the ongoing support and resources offered by RTC. Event sponsors include The Blackstone Foundation, JPMorgan Chase, Mack Cali, NJ Advance Media, PNC Bank, Prudential, TD+ Partners, and Wells Fargo. Tickets are still available for the 5th Annual Start Something Champions Gala, which takes place from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. at the Liberty House Restaurant in Jersey City.

Over the past 5 years, nearly 400 individuals from across New Jersey have entered the competition and the winning entrepreneurs have been awarded with approximately $125,000 in grants to support and grow their businesses. The proceeds from the gala will underwrite scholarships for entrepreneurs from traditionally underserved communities to participate in Rising Tide Capital’s nationally recognized Community Business Academy, an intensive and targeted 12-week training on how to start, grow, and sustain a business. Within 2 years of graduating from this program entrepreneurs see a 64% increase in their business sales and a corresponding 47% increase in household income. They also experience a 56% reduction in the use of public assistance resulting from the ongoing support and resources offered by RTC. Event sponsors include The Blackstone Foundation, JPMorgan Chase, Mack Cali, NJ Advance Media, PNC Bank, Prudential, TD+ Partners, and Wells Fargo. Tickets are still available for the 5th Annual Start Something Champions Gala, which takes place from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. at the Liberty House Restaurant in Jersey City.

Stefan Oschmann, however, who took over as Merck's CEO earlier this year, has been focussed on finding ways to safeguard his company's leading position in the multiple sclerosis market. Its top selling drug in this space is Rebif. Merck has hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to sound out potential buyers for the biosimilar business, the people said on Friday. There is no guarantee that the discussions will result in any deal, they added.Merck's biosimilars business could be worth as much as $1 billion because of its long-term sales potential, the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Merck, which is independent of U.S. drug marker Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), declined to comment. A JPMorgan spokeswoman offered no immediate comment. Merck's biosimilar business includes a drug in advanced clinical trials that is a competitor to AbbVie Inc's (ABBV.N) popular arthritis treatment Humira. The unit also has several early-stage compounds. Merck is facing off against several larger competitors, including Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Novartis AG (NOVN.S), both of which have won regulatory approval for biosimilar drugs. Biosimilars have become an increasing area of focus for investors and industry executives in the past year, as regulators have begun approving a handful of compounds in the United States.Biosimilars are more complex than traditional drugs, requiring genetically engineered proteins. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration was not allowed to consider generic versions of biologic drugs until U.S. President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010. So far, the FDA has approved four biosimilar drugs, most recently a competitor for Humira made by Amgen Inc (AMGN.O). There are more than 60 biosimilars awaiting approval. More of those drugs are expected to be approved in the coming years, as biologic drugs representing more than $30 billion in sales will lose their patent protection between now and 2020, according to data from IMS Health. In Europe, where biosimilars were approved by regulators as early as 2006, more than 21 biosimilars made by 14 companies have been approved.

Eberhardt Tepin Print Email Facebook Twitter Comment While Tepin is in a different spot this year compared with last year going into the Breeders' Cup Mile (gr. IT), in terms of her most recent race outcome, trainer Mark Casse is confident the champion turf mare can deliver another winning result. Tepin was one of five horses trained by Casse being pointed to Breeders' Cup races who completed workouts Oct. 28 at Churchill Downs. Casse said all five, a group that also includes grade I winners Classic Empire and Victory to Victory, appeared to come out of the works in good order and are ready to ship to Santa Anita Park for the Nov. 4 and Nov. 5 races. Casse planned an easy breeze for Tepin Friday and the 5-year-old Bernstein mare delivered, completing four furlongs in :49 as she finished serious preparation toward defending her victory in last year's Mile. The other four Breeders' Cup workers for Casse on Friday also enjoyed easy moves. Claiborne Breeders' Futurity (gr. I) winner Classic Empire breezed four furlongs in :50 as the Pioneerof the Nile   colt prepares for the Sentient Jet Breeders' Cup Juvenile (gr. I); Natalma Stakes (Can-IT) winner Victory to Victory completed a half-mile in :48 2/5 as the Exchange Rate   filly readies for the Juvenile Fillies Turf (gr. IT); Dixiana Bourbon Stakes (gr. IIIT) winner Keep Quiet completed four furlongs in :50 as the Elusive City colt works toward the Juvenile Turf (gr. IT); and JP Morgan Chase Jessamine Stakes (gr. IIIT) winner La Coronel breezed four furlongs in :47 4/5 as the Colonel John   filly prepares for the Juvenile Fillies Turf. The move was the fastest of the Casse Breeders' Cup horses and sixth fastest of 39 at the distance. Robert Masterson's Tepin entered last year's Mile off a seven-length victory in the First Lady Stakes (gr. IT) on the Keeneland turf and followed with a 2 1/4-length score in the Mile. In this year's First Lady, Tepin suffered her first loss of 2016 when she finished second to front-running upset winner Photo Call.  While Casse obviously would have preferred Tepin win the First Lady, after taking some time to look at the result, he believes the performance will set her up well for her Breeders' Cup bid. Teresa Viola Racing Stables' Photo Call earned the year's top Equibase Speed Figure, 128, with her 2 3/4-length win, while Tepin was awarded a 124. That figure is three points better than the 121 she ran in winning the Ricoh Woodbine Mile (Can-IT) Sept. 17, and 10 points better than her number in last year's First Lady run on soft turf. "After analyzing the race over a period of 24 hours, I thought the race was better than it looked. We knew going in that she was going to regress a little bit off of her previous start, and it was one of the reasons why we chose the First Lady over the Shadwell Turf Mile (gr. IT)," Casse said. "That being said, I think Photo Call really ran a huge race. ... So much was said about Tepin getting beat, where I think maybe the emphasis should have been more on how great Photo Call ran. So I tip my hat to her." Going into the race, Casse thought Celestine might be Tepin's main competition. Seeing those two on even terms at the quarter pole and then watching Tepin finish 3 1/2 lengths ahead of that grade I winner gives Casse confidence going into the Mile. He said Tepin has settled into a routine at Churchill Downs since moving from Saratoga Race Course, where she was based in the summer. "It amazes me to watch Tepin and her attitude, how she moves at Saratoga versus how she does at Churchill Downs. It's night-and-day," Casse said. "I mean, the old Tepin—I see her. We tried to get ready for the Woodbine Mile and then, of course, the First Lady in Saratoga, but since getting back to her home in Louisville, she's refreshed. She looks great. I thought watching her train this week that she's moving better than I've ever seen her move." While Tepin aims to add to her long list of accomplishments, John Oxley's Classic Empire will enter the Juvenile off his first grade I win, a three-length victory in which he showed maturity rating in third early before overwhelming 11 rivals under Julien Leparoux. Casse said Classic Empire is very competitive, which is one of the reasons he stopped working him in company. NOVAK: Classic Empire in Breeders' Futurity Score Earlier this year Classic Empire worked with eventual dead-heat Spinaway Stakes (gr. I) winner Pretty City Dancer but because of Classic Empire's talent and competitive drive that proved a mismatch. "I told (assistant Norm Casse) that we had to stop working them together, because I didn't want Classic Empire hurting her confidence. We knew she was good too," Casse said. "When he sees something, he wants to run after it. I mean if he sees a fly, he will go." Casse thinks the reason Classic Empire wheeled and dumped rider Irad Ortiz Jr. at the start of the Hopeful Stakes (gr. I) at Saratoga was because he spotted an auxillary gate along the outside rail. Blinkers were added for the Breeders' Futurity and the trainer hopes that issue is behind him. "I want to say it's behind us, but I'm also knocking on wood," Casse said. "Seeing him break from post 11 smoothly in the Breeders' Futurity and work his way into that stalking position was a good feeling." Casse said the Oct. 8 Breeders' Futurity win was huge because it essentially was Classic Empire's first start in three months because of the Hopeful problems and was his first try at two turns. Casse sees a young horse moving forward.  "What really struck me about him in the Breeders' Futurity was that he just settled off of what was a fast pace. They went :46 3/5 for a half mile. And the ease that he was running, and watching Julien just sitting there, it really struck me," Casse said of the Breeders' Futurity. "I'm not being cocky, but I think I have the one to beat. He's a very good horse."

The Hariris are reaching out to potential buyers after a company they own in Turkey failed to pay an instalment of $290 million due in September and was given an extension until the end of October to resolve the matter, the people said, asking not to be named because the discussions are confidential. The loan is linked to the family’s purchase in 2005 of a majority stake in Turk Telekomunikasyon AS, Turkey’s biggest phone company. The family has requested an additional extension to the end of November to make a payment as they seek to raise funds via a stake sale, the people said. Three bidders including a telecoms operator not based in Turkey and a company from Qatar, are currently in talks to buy part of Oger Telecom Ltd, which the Hariris own along with Saudi Telecom Co, one of the people said. The troubled loan was the biggest syndication in Turkish history when it was issued in 2013, with 29 participants that included all of the country’s largest lenders, as well as international banks including Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG. Turkey’s Akbank TAS has about $1.5 billion in exposure to the loan, while Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS lent about $1 billion, according to one of the people. Akbank and Garanti were among the six bookrunners and mandated lead arrangers on the loan, according to a statement from the borrower. Share moves Turk Telekom rose as much as 2.2 per cent to 5.96 liras in Istanbul, the highest level since Sept. 6 on a closing basis. Garanti fell as much as 1.1 per cent to 8.33 liras and Akbank declined 1.3 per cent to 8.22 liras. The Turkish Treasury owns around 30 per cent of Ankara-based Turk Telekom, which provides fixed, mobile and broadband services in the country. The remainder is traded on Borsa Istanbul. “While Oger’s payment problems does not directly have much to do with Turk Telekom, they were weighing on the stock’s performance,” Behlul Katas, an analyst at Istanbul-based Deniz Invest, said by phone. “The prospect that this pressure may be removed is helping improve investor sentiment. That said, despite the market’s initial enthusiasm; a sale is unlikely to impact the company’s fundamentals.” A refinancing of the 2013 debt is possible after the shareholder structure of Oger became clearer, one of the people said. Ojer Telekomunikasyon AS, the special purpose vehicle unit owned fully by Oger Telecom and set up to acquire the 55 per cent Turk Telekom stake, took the 2013 facility to refinance an earlier loan used to purchase the stake. Ojer, also known as Otas, pledged its holdings in Turk Telekom as collateral to borrow the loan, one of the people said. Otas had repaid about $500 million on the loan until the missed payment, people familiar with the deal said on October 12. No guarantees A senior Akbank executive, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, declined to comment. Garanti also declined to comment via its public relations office, as did an executive at Ojer who asked not to be identified. “We do not expect news on media related to one of our shareholders Ojer Telekomunikasyon to have any impact on our daily operations, commitments or liabilities,” Turk Telekom said after reports of the missed loan repayment on October 12. “Financing agreements signed by Turk Telekom and its subsidiaries do not include cross-default provisions in relation to its shareholders missing their payments on their liabilities. Otas is not guarantor for any of our financing agreements. Our company does not have any guarantee or pledge in favour of Otas.” More from Telecoms Billionaire bids to end Egypt bourse row ONEm offers new business model Etisalat rolls out IPv6 for home subscribers Zain Saudi told to pay rival Mobily $58.5m Orange Egypt to get €500m loan for 4G licence Zain Saudi weighing fibre-internet service Pay App Store, Apple Music, iTunes via etisalat Du’s Q3 profit falls 6.66% due to higher fees tags from this storyQatar follow this tag on MGNLebanon follow this tag on MGNDubai follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsTelecoms tagsQatar follow this tag on MGN+ MGNLebanon follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDubai follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In TelecomsBillionaire bids to end Egypt bourse row Business Gallery Highlights: Guangzhou Auto Show 2016 Kish island turns to be a major tourism hub Business Videos PlayStrata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Etisalat rolls out IPv6 for home subscribers 02Zain Saudi told to pay rival Mobily $58.5m 03Billionaire bids to end Egypt bourse row Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Emirates Group announces record profits May 10, 2016 1Image In pictures: Evolution of Emirates airline Oct 25, 2015 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 11Images Highlights: Japan Aerospace 2016 air show Oct 13, 2016 8Images Where to live in Downtown Dubai Mar 15, 2011 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News UAE announces public, private sector holidays Jailed, abused, and homeless Viral: Saudi man’s love poem to Ivanka Trump 2016 UAE holidays Data of 34 million Keralites leaked Tiger attacks girl in Saudi Arabia 'Utter devastation' after New Zealand quakes Your guide to tonight’s Supermoon Indian embassy to take up expats’ rupee concerns Close Recommended For You EU offers help to de-escalate Iran-GCC tensionPUBLISHED ON Nov 20, 2016 Speculations on upcoming bank mergers afloatPUBLISHED ON Nov 20, 2016 Tiger attacks girl in Saudi ArabiaPUBLISHED ON Nov 20, 2016 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

The global banking space has been weathering a number of storms since the start of the global financial crisis in 2008, the latest being the uncertainty around the U.K. exit from the European Unio n. Add to that the poor economic outlook and negative interest rates and the pressure is heaped on a bank's profitability. But while the European banks struggle to keep their share price stable, their counterparts at the Wall Street seem to be doing a much better job. "European banks have had a particularly tough 2016, with the Stoxx 600 banking sector seeing declines of over 20 percent so far this year," Alex Dryden, Global Market Strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management told CNBC via email. "This puts the European banking sector on track for its worst year since the depths of the euro zone debt crisis in 2011." Dryden however further explained that despite the sharp pullback in banking share prices, and speculation that investors are not pricing in the impending collapse of one or more European banks, the region's banking system is not on the brink of collapse it found itself at the height of the global financial crisis. "The cost of buying insurance against European financials firms has ticked up in 2016, but is still below the highs of the euro zone debt crisis. If we dig a little deeper into the balance sheets of European financial companies, there is actually more cause for comfort than concern. These show that European banks have taken significant steps to strengthen their position since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and euro zone debt crisis." But a number of analysts have said that European banks face an entire basket of uncertainties that tend to weigh on their performance. Latest earnings results show that while Deutsche Bank and Barclays have posted better-than-expected results in the third quarter, concerns over their performance in the final quarter of the year and their future continues to loom. The situation is however quite different with big U.S. banks such as JP Morgan , Citi and Goldman Sachs that have posted stronger-than-expected profits in the third quarter. "There are a number of major reasons that we prefer U.S. banks over European banks," Naeem Aslam, chief markets analyst at Think Markets UK told CNBC via email. "Firstly, it is the interest rate environment which is a lot more favorable for the U.S. banks. The Fed is about to increase the interest rate for one more time this year and this is going to be positive news for them. But if you look in Europe, we do not think that interest rates are going to move higher anytime soon" Aslam further explained that the fixed income business and their investment arms are performing very well over in the U.S. and this trend could continue. "As for European banks, they are in process of cutting the fat and still structural reforms remain the key issue. Also, if you look at the number of toxic assets, European banks have an abundance of these, although they are getting rid some of them now. The U.S. banks have strong balance sheets and they are in a much better position. " The International Monetary Fund in its latest Global Financial Stability report said that more deep-rooted reforms and systemic management were needed, especially for European banks. The report further stated that European investment banks in general have higher leverage and more compressed risk weightings on assets than their U.S. counterparts, suggesting that they have a more challenging adjustment path. According to the IMF, the European banking sector faces three major headwinds – these include high levels of non-performing loans, excess capacity in the banking system and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) - requires an 8 percent bail-in of a bank's creditors, including very large foreign banks and hedge funds — be applied before taxpayers get put on the hook. "The return on assets for European banks is structurally low at 0.25 to 0.50 percent, compared with about 1 percent at U.S. banks," the IMF report said.
