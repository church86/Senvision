In digital channels, biometrics are all the rage. Touch ID has become ubiquitous for many mobile apps. Banks like USAA are letting their customers verify their identity on mobile through scans of their thumbs, voices and faces. Wells Fargo has been working with EyeVerify to create iris scans for its commercial customers. But banks increasingly are looking at how they might use biometrics to make their interactions customers in branches and at the ATM easier, too. “In the next few years, biometrics will become mainstream for authentication and fraud detection in terms of servicing our customers,” said Ryan Crowley, the head of branch innovation for JPMorgan Chase. The key is figuring out which biometrics customers are most comfortable with, he said. While current technology capabilities enable a wide range of biometrics, customer feedback is crucial in determining which are the right ones to roll out on a large-scale basis, Crowley said, and creating a common customer authentication method, whether that is voice, facial recognition, or something else. In other words, companies have to strike a balance between cutting-edge biometrics technology and their customer’s perception of those methods. JPMorgan is experimenting with new biometrics technologies at an innovation lab in Columbus, Ohio, where customers are invited in to test them and offer feedback, Crowley said. “We conduct extensive user research and testing on all of our new products and innovations before we put them into the market,” he said. “This allows us to get real-time feedback, understand customer behaviors and design the best experience with the right safeguards.” For now, the bank isn’t using any experimental biometrics technologies in it branches, but if and when it does, the customer feedback from these exercises will likely prove valuable, he added. GESA Credit Union in Richland, Wash., meanwhile, is pleased with how its members have taken to palm-vein authentication technology it rolled out last year in three of its branches. Members register for the service. When they visit a branch from then on, they place their hands over a palm scanner on a tablet. The scan is matched against their preregistered palm-vein patterns and they are authenticated. Once the match is confirmed, the member’s profile is automatically displayed on the teller’s screen. The solution eliminates the need for the member to present a photo ID or enter an account number, and enables staff to serve members quickly, personally and more intelligently, said Karl Guynn, director of products at the credit union. Thus far, the technology has reduced the time it takes to authenticate a member at the teller line by 93%, from 15 seconds down to less than a second. “The response has been fantastic,” said Guynn, who added that by the end of the month GESA expects to install the technology in the final few branches where it isn’t already in place. “The security is so much higher than the previous way, and so is the convenience.” GESA plans to roll out the technology for authentication at its ATMs in the future, Guynn said. "People encounter biometrics almost everywhere they go," says Karl Guynn, director of products at GESA Credit Union. The technology was developed by Fiserv and it is integrated with the Fiserv core platform that the credit union uses. The technology was specifically developed for GESA; the palm-scanning project began when the credit union entered a beta program for the technology in November 2014, which ran through October 2015 before being more broadly rolled out. Guynn said the credit union often looks at new technology to make customer interactions more efficient. The popularity of the product at GESA has led Fiserv to offer the technology to all its bank and credit union members, said Chris Van Der Stad, chief technology officer for Fiserv’s open solutions division. “We’re seeing a lot of excitement around the efficiency of this process of authentication, and not having to do things like show a driver’s license,” he said. While there is still a “creepiness factor” with some forms of biometrics, Guynn says it is not significant. “Everyone is so used to biometrics now,” he said, referring to Touch ID technology on mobile devices. “People encounter biometrics almost everywhere they go.” The key to success is giving customer choice when it comes to authentication, Guynn said. “We don’t require people to use it and we never will,” he said. “We think of it like the TSA Pre-Check option; some might consider that more invasive but you stand on a shorter line. And we’re seeing use in many different demographics. For example, older people with arthritis love it; they don’t have to dig and fumble through their purse or wallet for an ID.” (Guynn was referring to the Transportation Security Administration's PreCheck program, where travelers pay a fee and undergo extra vetting in exchange for access to a faster security process at airports.) Further, the popularity of in-branch biometrics authentication such as facial scanning in other parts of the world bodes well for its future in the U.S., said Devon Watson, vice president of strategy and operations at Diebold Nixdorf. “It’s quite prevalent for customers in LatAm, for example,” he said. “It’s quite convenient.” It’s a topic Diebold is actively thinking about; last year it partnered with Citi to experiment with how iris-scanning ATMs in branches might work. Though nothing concrete has yet come of that project beyond the initial pilot, Watson said the fact it happened shows banks are bullish on biometrics. “The challenge is to carefully toe that line between creepy and convenient,” he said. “It depends from market to market.” But Watson said the U.S. likely will adopt further biometrics technology when it comes. “Three years ago Americans probably would say they didn’t want their finger scanned to authenticate; now it’s commonplace,” he said. “They know that when you use [technology like Touch ID] your fingerprint gets turned into a code, the bank only sees that code and no one is stealing your fingerprint.” Guynn agreed with Crowley that for the technology to be most effective, financial institutions need to do research and seek customer feedback. “It’s not one-size-fits-all,” Guynn said. “What works at a location in a city might not work in a rural area.” Beyond the psychological hurdles some customers may have when it comes to things like face or palm scanning, a potentially bigger deterrent to mass adoption of biometrics is determining who stores the data and where it is stored, said Owen Wild, global marketing director for financial services security solutions at NCR. “The challenge is determining the ownership of the database that you’re validating against,” he said. “Who owns and runs that? Will it be the individual financial institution or a centralized authority? Who is going to secure it?” Wild also noted that widespread use of biometrics is easier to accomplish in countries that have few banking options, or with centralized state control of the banking system. In the U.S., with thousands of banks of varying sizes, it becomes much more difficult. “While you’re seeing some individual [financial institutions] roll out this technology," Wild said, "for it to be broad-based it’s probably going to have to be something agreed upon with some form of industry standardization.” Article Your Top CECL Questions Answered How should banks approach CECL implementation and can existing processes be used as a starting point?

Rebecca Ungarino | @ungarino 1 Hour AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters 'Trump bump' in financial markets should be reflected in US bank earnings, says analyst    6 Hours Ago | 02:21 Quarterly earnings season kicks into gear this week as reports from three big banks — Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan — are set to be released on Thursday morning. Independent analyst Mike Mayo told CNBC that the big banks may potentially turn in double digit growth in quarterly earnings, thanks to the "Trump bump" that benefited financial markets. "The 'Trump bump' has materialized to some degree in the financial markets and you should see that in the bank earnings. You'll see better debt underwriting, better fixed income activity, you'll see the largest banks show double digit earnings growth on double digit growth in capital markets," Mayo said Thursday on CNBC's "Squawk Box". Of the three banks scheduled to report earnings on Thursday, JPMorgan appears most attractive, said Dennis Davitt, options strategist at Harvest Volatility Management. The options market is pricing the "downside insurance" in the stock very low, Davitt said. In other words, investors are not anticipating a big move lower in the stock. And by the same measurement, Davitt said Citigroup looks least attractive and would be particularly cautious about the stock at this juncture. "Citigroup options are trading at a higher volatility; people are asking more money to sell you insurance on Citigroup," Davitt said Tuesday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." show chapters Which bank to buy ahead of earnings?    Tuesday, 11 Apr 2017 | 3:37 PM ET | 05:31 Meanwhile, "Wells Fargo has been kind of leaking a lot of bad news lately, so that's a stock that I don't think is going anywhere," Davitt added. Indeed, Wells Fargo shares tumbled late last year when it was revealed that employees created fake accounts; the bank's CEO stepped down in the wake of the scandal. Bank stocks as a group have fallen nearly 4 percent this year as the spread between the two-year Treasury yield and 10-year Treasury yield has fallen. As the yield curve flattens, the banks' net interest margins are negatively impacted. But from a technical standpoint, Piper Jaffray technical analyst Craig Johnson sees potential in Citigroup. Its shares have fallen about 7 percent off its year-to-date highs, while its two peers are off about 10 percent. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup have all broken below their 50-day moving averages, Johnson observed. "[Citigroup] is off the least amount, it's holding up better in terms of the charts, than where you're at with Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. And I'll point out that a close above $61.50 would start a new leg higher for Citigroup," he said in an interview Tuesday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." Looking ahead, Johnson is closely watching the banks' relative strength, the group's net interest margin, and the overall trend of the struggling sector. Still, Johnson said, "I still think that it's just a correction in the context of a longer-term uptrend for the financial sector itself," he said Tuesday. The financials as a group will see further downside this year, said Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com. "I think some technical damage is done to these financials and we might want to explore some additional downside," he said Monday. And to profit from the downside he foresees in the XLF, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the financials, Gordon turns to the options market. He wants to sell the April 13 weekly 23-strike calls, and buy the April 13 weekly 24-strike calls. Gordon said on Monday he is selling the call spread for a 62 cents credit, or a credit of $62 per options spread. The $62 would be Gordon's maximum reward on the trade, should the XLF close below $23 when the trade expires on Thursday. The XLF was trading around $23.30 on Wednesday.

 A top trader at Credit Suisse just quit to take a role at JPMorgan Matt Turner Apr. 12, 2017, 12:56 PM 6,333 facebook linkedin twitter email print via eBay A top trader at Credit Suisse just quit to take a role at JPMorgan. Matt Mallgrave, head of US equity flow trading at Credit Suisse, resigned today, according to people familiar with the matter. He is set to join JPMorgan, the people said. Credit Suisse declined to comment. JPMorgan did not comment in time for publication, and Mallgrave didn't return a phone call requesting comment.  Mallgrave was at Credit Suisse for a little over a year, having quit his role at Goldman Sachs in late 2015 to join the Swiss bank. A Harvard graduate, Mallgrave was selected by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1988 NHL draft. The equities business in which Mallgrave worked has been an area of focus for JPMorgan. Cash equities is the one business where the bank doesn't rank inside the top three in industry revenue rankings compiled by Coalition, a data tracker. Daniel Pinto, the head of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, said at the bank's February investor day that JPMorgan's equities and prime finance business had increased its market share from 6.9% in 2010 to 10.1% in 2016. Cash equities revenues fell 4% from 2014 to 2016, while industry revenues fell 18%.  JPMorgan NOW WATCH: These are the states you should live in to pay the least taxes Loading video...

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Apr 12, 2017 at 8:00AM Everything old is new again. For years, we've read stories about how people aren't buying PCs anymore, and how that was lousy news for computer hard drive makers like Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) -- but no more. Yesterday, Wall Street analysts at Longbow Research and JPMorgan simultaneously decided to recommend buying shares of both of these big hard drive makers. Here are three things you need to know about why they did that. Hard disk drives (HDDs) are in focus on Wall Street this week. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Upgrading Seagate... We begin our story with Seagate, upgraded on Tuesday from neutral to buy at Longbow Research, with a $55 price target. Last month, as you may recall, we talked a bit about Goldman Sachs and its upgrade of Seagate storage rival Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), which Goldman said would benefit from "tight" supplies of NAND flash memory around the globe. That was good news for Micron, which makes a lot of money from NAND. It may also be good news for Seagate, though (which like Micron -- and like Western Digital -- also makes NAND memory). This is because, as TheFly.com reports, "shortages of NAND are causing demand for hard disk drives to rise" as an alternative to flash memory. Longbow believes this demand will obey the laws of supply ­and demand, by driving hard disk drive prices up -- boosting profits at Seagate. 2. ...and Western Digital as well And not only at Seagate. JPMorgan sees this dynamic of rising hard disk prices benefiting Western Digital stock as well -- maybe even more than Seagate. Additionally, JPMorgan points out that sales of personal computers are "stabilizing," according to TheFly.com, while at the same time Western Digital's costs are falling as the company finds "synergies" among its recent acquisitions. Stable PC sales, falling costs, and widening profit margins on hard drives -- that all adds up to higher profits for Seagate, in JPMorgan's view, and justifies an overweight rating and a $116 price target on the stock. 3. Just how good will these profits get? Doing a bit of quick pencil work, JPMorgan estimates that Western Digital stock will produce profits of $8.31 per share this year (3% better than previously expected). 2018 profits could be even better -- as much as $11.13 per share. Both those numbers would be significant improvements over the $1.59 per share that Western Digital lost last year. Even the lower number -- $8.31 -- would be enough to make 2017 the most profitable year Western Digital has booked in a single calendar year this millennium. But would that be enough to make Western Digital a buy? The upshot for investors Because when you get right down to it, that's what matters to investors: Yeah, 2017 (and 2018) might be very profitable years for Seagate stock, and might be even better for Western Digital. But if the stocks cost too much relative to the profits, then neither stock would make for a good investment. Fortunately, that looks to be not the case. At JPMorgan's projected profits, Western Digital stock looks likely to both earn great profits, and offer great value to investors as well. Here's how the numbers work: JPMorgan is saying Western Digital will earn $8.13 this year. But Western Digital stock only costs about $85 a share. That works out to about a current-year price-to-earnings ratio of 10 on Western Digital stock. And with most analysts on S&P Global Market Intelligence predicting Western Digital will grow profits at 13.5% annually over the next five years, that works out to a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 0.8. Throw in a modest 2.4% dividend yield, and Western Digital stock is looking quite attractively valued indeed. And Seagate? The story there is even better, because whereas JPMorgan bases its Western Digital valuation on projected profits, Seagate is already earning actual profits -- $514 million last year, and more than twice what it earned in 2015. S&P estimates show Seagate growing its earnings fourfold this year, to $3.22 per share. If they're right, that works out to about a current-year earnings valuation of 15 times on the stock. And again, between Seagate's projected growth rate (15%) and its dividend (5.3%), that looks like a very good deal for investors, indeed. Long story short, I'm fully onboard with both these analysts' upgrades this week. Longbow Research may lean toward Seagate, while JPMorgan prefers Western Digital. I think either stock should perform just fine. Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of Western Digital. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Leveraged Bank ETFs Step Into Earnings Spotlight Dow's JPMorgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo To Report Q1: What To Watch (Investor's Business Daily) JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s (NYSE: JPM) J.P. Morgan Asset Management (JPAM) unit added to its lineup of exchange traded funds last week with its second fixed income ETF, the JPMorgan Global Bond Opportunities ETF (BATS: JPGB). Actively managed, the JPMorgan Global Bond Opportunities ETF isn't confined to a particular bond benchmark and can offer investors broad-based fixed income exposure. The new ETF “seeks to take advantage of opportunities across market sectors, credit quality, countries and currencies, extending beyond traditional fixed income investments. It captures J.P. Morgan's highest conviction ideas in a flexible strategy that identifies opportunities in response to evolving market conditions,” according to a statement from New York-based JPAM. See Also: Q1 Earnings Kick Off: Can Big Banks Reignite Sagging Rally In The Space? JPGB makes good on the benefits of an unconstrained bond approach as the new ETF offers investors exposure to 15 different corners of the fixed income universe across 50 countries. The new ETF's allocations are dynamic and can change as market conditions evolve. “The fund is managed by a highly experienced investment team, led by Global CIO and portfolio manager Bob Michele, who has been managing global fixed income for over 35 years,” JPAM said in the statement. JPGB, which charges 0.55 percent per year, or $55 on a $10,000 investment, is the second bond ETF introduced by JPAM. Last year, the firm introduced the JPMorgan Disciplined High Yield ETF (NYSE: JPHY). JPHY holds only dollar-denominated high-yield credit of U.S. and foreign issuers. The fund is run by a seasoned and well-resourced high yield investment team with over $35 billion in AUM. Each of the senior managers has more than 20 years of experience navigating multiple market cycles, said JPAM. Posted-In: J.P.

Nearly two-thirds of voters, 66 percent, support last week’s airstrikes on a Syrian air field, the poll shows. That includes 35 percent who strongly support the strikes, and another 31 percent who somewhat support them. Only 24 percent oppose the strikes, and 10 percent don’t have an opinion. Support for the strikes is fairly bipartisan, the poll shows. While 82 percent of Republicans back the strikes, so do 57 percent of Democratic voters and 59 percent of independents.” http://politi.co/2p6Z6DK SPICER’S MEA CULPA -- “Spicer apologizes for claiming Hitler didn’t use chemical weapons,” by Josh Dawsey: “White House press secretary Sean Spicer had to do something Tuesday night his boss deeply dislikes: He apologized. Hours after seemingly minimizing the Holocaust in an attempt to explain the atrocities of chemical attacks by the Syrian regime, Spicer went on CNN to ask forgiveness for an ‘inappropriate’ reference and to offer a mea culpa to his TV-obsessed boss for becoming a ‘distraction.’ ‘I mistakenly used an inappropriate, insensitive reference to the Holocaust,’ Spicer told Wolf Blitzer. ‘I apologize. It was a mistake to do that.’” http://politi.co/2oxWkcH -- ALEX ISENSTADT (@politicoalex): “NEW: Spicer reached out to Sheldon Adelson’s office and ‘said he made a terrible mistake+ apologized if he was offensive,’ per Adelson spox” … -- GRETA VAN SUSTEREN will interview Spicer at 9:20 a.m. at the Newseum’s “The President and the Press: The First Amendment in the First 100 Days”. http://bit.ly/2o5WANa FOR YOUR RADAR -- “Xi stresses China’s North Korea concerns in talk with Trump,” by AP’s Chris Bodeen and Gerry Shih in Beijing: “Chinese President Xi Jinping told President Donald Trump in a phone call Wednesday that Beijing is willing to work with Washington on ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program but wants a peaceful solution. Xi’s comments come after the U.S. president tweeted that China should do more on the issue Washington sees as an increasingly urgent threat, or the U.S. would go it alone. The call, brief details of which were released by the Chinese foreign ministry, also come as tensions have risen with the deployment of a U.S. aircraft carrier to the area and the conducting of the biggest-ever U.S.-South Korea military exercises. Xi told Trump that China insists on peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and wants to find a solution to the problem through peaceful means.” http://apne.ws/2oo232B ****** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Tax reform, skills and workforce development and infrastructure investment are some of the keys to unlocking inclusive American economic growth. Learn more in JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon’s Annual Shareholder letter http://politi.co/2oaMj4Q ****** BULLET, DODGED -- “Republicans fend off strong challenge to hold on to House seat in Kansas,” by WaPo’s Dave Weigel in Wichita: “Republicans fended off a surprising Democratic challenge on Tuesday in the first special election of the year for a House seat vacated by a Republican lawmaker who became part of President Trump’s administration. Ron Estes, the GOP state treasurer, was buoyed by an 11th-hour intervention from national Republicans, Vice President Pence and Trump himself in his bid to retain the seat of former congressman Mike Pompeo, who is now the CIA director. In a victory speech, Estes told voters he’d ‘repeal and replace Obamacare’ and fight for a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution.” http://wapo.st/2oy0TUh -- One Republican operative involved in the race emailed that the last-minute $100,000 infusion in activity was a “smart insurance investment.” “Name of the game is motivating Republicans. Everything that was done had that in mind: NRCC ad on abortion, Cruz, Pence, Trump,” the operative emailed. Senior Republican officials said they expected to win by six or seven points -- and they did. The DCCC did not spend a dime in this race. Again: Trump won this district by 27 points. -- “Newly Energized Liberals Pour Record Effort Into Local Races,” by WSJ’s Janet Hook in Alpharetta, Georgia: “Much of the grass-roots energy is being channeled not by Democratic leaders but by virtual political organizers who have proliferated online in the wake of Democrat Hillary Clinton’s loss to Mr. Trump last year. Liberal advocacy sites like The Daily Kos and Moveon.org are breaking political fundraising and participation records. ActBlue, an online fundraising conduit for Democratic campaigns, handled 4 million donations totaling $111 million in the first quarter of 2017 -- more than four times as much as in that period in 2015.” http://on.wsj.com/2p6V8e9 LATEST ON RUSSIA -- “FBI obtained FISA warrant to monitor Trump adviser Carter Page,” by WaPo’s Ellen Nakashima, Devlin Barrett and Adam Entous: “The FBI obtained a secret court order last summer to monitor the communications of an adviser to presidential candidate Donald Trump, part of an investigation into possible links between Russia and the campaign, law enforcement and other U.S. officials said. The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Page’s communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to the officials. “This is the clearest evidence so far that the FBI had reason to believe during the 2016 presidential campaign that a Trump campaign adviser was in touch with Russian agents. Such contacts are now at the center of an investigation into whether the campaign coordinated with the Russian government to swing the election in Trump’s favor. … ‘This confirms all of my suspicions about unjustified, politically motivated government surveillance,’ Page said in an interview Tuesday. ‘I have nothing to hide.’ He compared surveillance of him to the eavesdropping that the FBI and Justice Department conducted against civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.” http://wapo.st/2oy0WiS OH -- “Classified docs contradict Nunes surveillance claims, GOP and Dem sources say,” by CNN's Jim Sciutto, Manu Raju and Eric Bradner: “After a review of the same intelligence reports brought to light by House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers and aides have so far found no evidence that Obama administration officials did anything unusual or illegal, multiple sources in both parties tell CNN. Their private assessment contradicts President Donald Trump’s allegations that former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice broke the law by requesting the ‘unmasking’ of US individuals' identities. Trump had claimed the matter was a ‘massive story.’ However, over the last week, several members and staff of the House and Senate intelligence committees have reviewed intelligence reports related to those requests at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland.” http://cnn.it/2oodrf3 TRUMP’S WASHINGTON -- “White House calls for deep agency cuts,” by Ian Kullgren and Matt Nussbaum: “The White House on Wednesday will direct federal agencies to make deep personnel cuts over the next year, according to the White House budget chief and documents provided to POLITICO. Agency heads will receive a 14-page memorandum outlining changes. The memo, which replaces the federal hiring ban Trump enacted in January, outlines cuts based on Trump’s ‘skinny’ budget, released last month. The budget proposal called for deep cuts to domestic programs and an increase in military spending. The memo tells agencies to ‘begin taking immediate actions to achieve near-term workforce reductions.’ “It also instructs agencies to develop by June 30 a plan to ‘maximize employee performance’ — i.e., take steps to reward employees deemed effective while working to improve or dismiss weak performers.

Ahmadinejad’s decision will upend an election many believed would be won by moderate President Hassan Rouhani, who negotiated the nuclear deal with world powers. ...

They include payments in 2007 and 2009, providing the first evidence that Manafort’s firm received at least some money listed in the so-called Black Ledger.” http://apne.ws/2oy8hzj FOGGY BOTTOM WATCH -- “Why Tillerson has his hands full with Russian counterpart,” by Michael Crowley: “Tillerson’s counterpart, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, is a wily veteran of world diplomacy who has dueled — and routinely infuriated — no less than four of Tillerson’s predecessors as secretary of state. ... An English-speaking lover of scotch, cigarettes and an acerbic joke, the 67-year-old Lavrov has spent years exasperating his U.S. counterparts with a mastery of detail, an unwavering promotion of the Kremlin line, and a jaundiced view of American power.” http://politi.co/2o5t0XW -- “UN peacekeepers’ child sex ring left victims, but no arrests,” by AP’s Paisley Dodds: “An Associated Press investigation of U.N. missions during the past 12 years found nearly 2,000 allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by peacekeepers and other personnel around the world -- signaling the crisis is much larger than previously known. More than 300 of the allegations involved children, the AP found, but only a fraction of the alleged perpetrators served jail time.” http://apne.ws/2p7lrkn K ST FILES -- “Plane mutiny unlikely to clip United’s wings,” by Kathryn Wolfe and Lauren Gardner: “The dragging of a battered, bloodied physician off a United Airlines flight ‘disturbed’ the White House, provoked outrage from political leaders in both parties and turned one of the world’s biggest air carriers into a social media pariah as far away as China — while wiping out a quarter-billion dollars of the company’s market value Tuesday. But don’t expect it to wreak much damage on the clout that United and other U.S. airlines wield in Washington, even as Sunday’s incident appeared to crystallize years of travelers’ discontent with cramped seats, luggage restrictions and bewildering fees.” http://politi.co/2o5tSM6 WOMEN RULE PODCAST: In a wide-ranging “Women Rule” exclusive, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao details her life as a child immigrant in America, including the experience of learning to use a fork instead of chopsticks.

He announced that he’d scheduled his trip ‘last fall’ — well before the New York Times reported he paid $13 million to settle harassment claims. A Fox News spokesperson confirmed O’Reilly will return on April 24. But according to four network sources, there’s talk inside Fox News that tonight’s show could be his last. Lawyers for the law firm Paul, Weiss, hired last summer by 21st Century Fox to investigate Roger Ailes, are currently doing a ‘deep dive’ investigation into O’Reilly’s behavior. ... “Fox News co-president Bill Shine has been working hard to keep O’Reilly, sources said. But O’Reilly’s future is in the hands of the Murdochs ... [who] are presently divided over how to handle it.

By Lewis Braham Biography April 8, 2017 12:50 a.m. ET Economists still theorize about “rational actors.” But by now most financial academics have grudgingly accepted the notion that investors aren’t rational. Psychologist Daniel Kahneman won a 2002 Nobel Prize for his behavioral-economics research, and Michael Lewis recently published The Undoing Project, a best-selling book that has rocked efficient-market theorists to their core. But can Kahneman’s theories actually beat the market? There are now 24 mutual funds practicing behavioral-finance techniques, with mixed results....

Through TASP, the Center for Community Progress (Community Progress), a national nonprofit, will help local governments and other stakeholders break new ground in their efforts to address property vacancy, abandonment, and deterioration.   The three recipients were chosen through a competitive process, which included a written application round followed by an in-person site assessment for five finalists. Proposed projects are reviewed on a range of criteria, including the potential for innovation from which other cities can learn, demonstrated leadership to implement reform, overall scale of vacancy challenges, and need for outside assistance.   “Albany, Huntington, and Memphis have each demonstrated a commitment to strengthening their revitalization work to benefit local residents,” said Tamar Shapiro, president and CEO of the Center for Community Progress. “We are excited to work in each of these places to pioneer strategies that will not only help these communities, but also other places that will learn from these efforts.”   Each city will receive up to 400 hours of assistance from a team of national experts over eight months between April and November 2017. Assistance may include a diagnosis of the most pressing problems, evaluation of current systems and strategies, and recommendations on solutions that involve key government decision-makers, residents, and other stakeholders. Grant funding from JPMorgan Chase provides the program’s support.   “Addressing blight is one of the most impactful ways to improve neighborhoods and local economies,” said Janis Bowdler, Head of Community Development at JPMorgan Chase. “By arming city leadership with technical assistance through the Center for Community Progress, we are giving them the tools they need to drive inclusive economic growth in a highly tactical and productive way.”   HUNTINGTON, West Virginia In Huntington, technical assistance will help the Huntington Urban Renewal Authority and other local and statewide stakeholders unpack the costs that vacant and abandoned properties impose on municipal government and residents. This work will focus on delinquent tax enforcement systems, public safety, and neighborhood stabilization. The goal is to raise awareness among rural communities seeking to better understand the costs of, and solutions for, vacancy and abandonment in West Virginia and beyond.     “We are honored to be a recipient of a technical assistance scholarship from the Center for Community Progress. We have been innovative in addressing our vacant and abandoned properties, and we intend to set a standard that others will follow,” said Mayor Steve Williams. “The Center for Community Progress is a leading advocate on addressing distressed properties and has been an active partner with the City of Huntington. We look forward to expanding that relationship further.”   ALBANY, New York In Albany, technical assistance will strengthen the partnership between the Albany County Land Bank and the Albany Community Land Trust. Land banks and community land trusts are each critical tools in the work to address vacancy and abandonment, but around the country, their efforts have rarely intersected. This innovative partnership will demonstrate how, by working together on tangible projects, land banks and community land trusts can strengthen each other’s efforts in support of improved community outcomes.   “This honor from the Center for Community Progress highlights the good works done by the Land Bank and its progress toward renewing our community,” said Albany County Executive Daniel P. McCoy. “It also confirms that our investment in the Land Bank is bringing returns for potential home buyers and the taxpayers.”     MEMPHIS, Tennessee In Memphis, technical assistance will assess the legal systems pertaining to receivership and property tax enforcement. It will identify reforms that will support the transfer of clear, marketable title to the Blight Authority of Memphis (BAM). This project will be an innovative, tangible example of how receivership can work alongside property tax enforcement and land banking to support clear, marketable title for properties.   "Our administration is focused on reducing blight -- both to aid our core city’s renaissance and to simply give every Memphian a neighborhood they can be proud of,” said Mayor Jim Strickland. “We’re grateful for this assistance from the Center for Community Progress, which we think will only further amplify what we’re doing in Memphis.”   Since its founding in 2010, the Center for Community Progress has provided technical assistance to more than 200 communities across 30 states. Community Progress launched TASP in 2014 in response to two needs: first, the need to develop fresh approaches to problem properties that could become models for cities to replicate, and second, the need to provide individual cities with affordable, high-quality guidance in the fight to remediate vacant, abandoned, and deteriorated properties.   This is the fifth round of the Technical Assistance Scholarship Program. Prior recipients are: Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; Butte-Silver Bow, Montana; Lafayette, Louisiana; Dallas, Texas; Detroit, Michigan; Gary, Indiana; High Point, North Carolina; Trenton, New Jersey; Cleveland, Ohio; Lucas County, Ohio; Rockford, Illinois; and St. Louis, Missouri.   More information about the Technical Assistance Scholarship Program is available on the Center for Community Progress website.   About Center for Community Progress Founded in 2010, the Center for Community Progress is the only national 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization solely dedicated to building a future in which entrenched, systemic vacancy and abandonment no longer exists in American communities. The mission of Community Progress is to ensure that communities have the vision, knowledge, and systems to transform vacant, abandoned, and deteriorated properties into assets supporting neighborhood vitality. As a national leader on solutions for vacancy and abandonment, Community Progress serves as the leading resource for local, state and federal policies and best practices that address the full cycle of property revitalization, from blight prevention, through the acquisition and maintenance of problem properties, to their productive reuse.

Conway G. Gittens reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript JP Morgan Chase is shelling out $1.7 billion to put to rest charges it failed to adequately report suspicious activity in the Bernie Madoff fraud. By law, the bank is supposed to monitor customer activity for money laundering and inform regulators. JPMorgan Chase admits it did not do the latter, even though bankers in more than one area noticed things weren't adding up when it came to Madoff's finances. As part of the settlement, the bank agreed not to apply for a tax deduction or tax credit for the $1.7 billion payment AND to tighten up anti-money laundering controls. The money is headed for Madoff's victims. Bernie Madoff is serving a 150-year prison term for defrauding thousands of investors in one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in modern history.

While you were sleeping: US bank stocks drop in pre-earning season jitters Nevil Gibson Thursday April 13, 2017 Share Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager with Morgan Stanley Investment Management Play NBR radio on Stocks on Wall Street fell, dragged lower by bank shares a day before Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase kick off the earnings reporting season. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 59.44 points, or 0.3%, to 20,591.86, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.4% to 2344.93. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5% to 5836.16. The Dow’s drop was led by manufacturing exporters Caterpillar, down 2.3%, and Boeing, down 1.4%. Citigroup, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo are all set to report their first-quarter earnings before the stock market opens on Thursday, unofficially launching earnings season. Nevertheless, US companies are expected to report their strongest quarterly earnings since 2011, as of March 31, according to FactSet. Solid first-quarter results are needed to support the post-election stocks rally. If stocks are to remain at these levels, earnings must live up to expectations, analysts say. “The market has priced in this earnings recovery,” Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager with Morgan Stanley Investment Management, told Dow Jones. He adds that stocks seem to be in “quiet season” ahead of the onslaught of first-quarter earnings and that’s led to some stalling in stock prices. “The good news is, usually when the markets have stalled going into earnings season, it sets up for a good period for stocks during earnings,” he says. Focus on the economy While geopolitical worries from the Middle East to the Korean Peninsula, as well as the timing of US tax reforms and the French presidential election, have attracted investors’ attention, mostly they have focused on the health of the US economy. “Markets are thrown a geopolitical curveball from time to time but economic data is good and there is still every reason to believe in risk,” says Geoffrey Yu, head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management. United Airlines’ stock erased all of its post-passenger eviction scandal losses, advancing as much as 1.4% in intraday trade before closing down 1.1%. This came on the heels of Tuesday’s stock plunge, which wiped about $US255 million off the company’s market cap. Whole Foods Market rose 1,7% after Bloomberg reported Amazon had shown an interest in the retail chain but did not go ahead with the deal. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note ticked lower to 2.294% from 2.298% on Tuesday. The WSJ Dollar Index fell 0.3% after President Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal in an interview that the dollar “is getting too strong.” Oil prices ended a six-session streak of gains after federal data showed crude output continued its relentless growth. US crude futures settled down 0.54% at $US53.11 a barrel. European stocks recovered, led by oil companies and car makers. The Stoxx Europe 600 index picked up 0.2% to close at 381.90, ending at its highest close since early December 2015. Germany’s DAX 30 rose 0.1%, France’s CAC 40 was down marginally and the UK’s FTSE 100 was down 0.2%.

I threw out a lot of large company names, so let’s do some quick math on what the large deals likely mean for the DFW market regarding net absorption.   Toyota is the largest contributor, it will directly account for just under two million square feet of positive net absorption as the company is relocating from Torrance, Ca.  Toyota currently has only a couple hundred thousand square feet of temporary space in the market.  Most of the other mega deals are not so straight forward.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. already has several sizable locations within DFW and it will be vacating some, but not all those current locations.  For example, it will be vacating space in Lewisville, but will remain in much of its space in the Dallas CBD.   Liberty Mutual, likewise, is currently in the region, but will be increasing its business operations significantly. It should also be noted, that even as the new projects are delivered this year, the residual impacts often take a couple of years to completely play out.  State Farm, which had a new corporate campus built in 2015 and 2016 at Cityline, has not finished vacating some blocks of space and is currently trying to sublease some of its older space. All told, the DFW office market is expected to have net absorption in 2017 north of six million square feet.  This is a big number, far surpassing anything we’ve seen this business cycle (since the great recession).  To put that number in perspective, the Dallas-Fort Worth market which has consistently seen stronger net absorption than almost any other market in the country has had average annual net absorption of 3.3 million square feet over the past six years.  The concern ahead is what happens to the construction pipeline moving into 2018 and beyond.  There are still some large built-to-suits after 2017 (Signet Jewelers and Brinker International) but the majority of the current construction pipeline beyond 2017 is likely to transition into a much heavier concentration of speculative development. The trend in speculative development has been to attract tenants from existing, older buildings, for significantly less square feet on average as the newer properties are more efficient and tenants adjust to the higher rental rates on new construction by reducing their size footprint.  This can often result in sizable negative absorption, particularly on a submarket level.  The other concern is the amount of speculative construction underway at this point in the business cycle.  Can near-record demand hold, even with most of the mega deals being completed in 2017?  Who will follow Boeing, which just announced it will be opening a new headquarters location in Legacy West for its global services division.  I’ll save conversation on the spec construction pipeline in 2018 and related dynamics for a future article.

Harish Grama will join the firm next week as its chief information officer for cloud services, according to an internal memo from Dana Deasy, global chief information officer, that was obtained by American Banker. The new hire was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Grama will oversee relationships with external cloud providers and will chair the cloud steering committee, according to the memo. He will also develop a strategy to retrain JPMorgan developers to create cloud-native applications. Related Citi Recruits JPM's Gavin Michael to Lead Consumer Technology How B of A's Billion-Dollar Tech Cuts Could Fuel Startups IBM Touts Security of Blockchain Cloud Service Grama spent the last 20 years at IBM in various software development roles. He was most recently head of software development for IBM's cloud unit, according to the memo. "Harish has extensive experience in leading large globally distributed organizations in cloud native offerings," the memo said. "Additionally, he was a key leader in driving the transformation of IBM's developer workforce." JPMorgan is pursuing a "hybrid cloud model," which means it is looking to use both public and private clouds. The company has dubbed its private cloud Gaia. The use of cloud technology is appealing to banks because it promises greater efficiencies and should make it easier for the bank to adopt newer technology. However, security risks are the downside.

It's complicated How Dodd-Frank repeal would hurt banks' collateralized loan obligations Banks get more goodies in GOP's updated Dodd-Frank overhaul plan Three community bankers on how to balance tech, high-touch, costs search goes here BankThink Sorry, Jamie. 'Too big to fail' is alive and well By Camden R. Fine Published April 12 2017, 1:38pm EDT More in TBTF Regulatory relief Regulatory reform Community banking Jamie Dimon Print Email Reprints Share Share on JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has provided little comfort with his recent assurance that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for the nation’s largest and riskiest financial firms. In his annual letter to shareholders, Dimon wrote that not only have post-crisis reforms largely eliminated the chance of a megabank failure, but the reforms would also prevent a domino effect in the financial markets if such a scenario were to occur again. Don’t believe everything you read. Dimon’s pledge fails to address the increasing concentration of our banking system in the hands of a few multitrillion-dollar financial behemoths. This trend has only been exacerbated by the 2008 Wall Street crisis that, of course, set off the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression and ushered in a wave of new regulations on the community banks that did not cause the crisis. In fact, 0.2% of all U.S. banks hold nearly 70% of industry assets and enjoy the lowest cost of funds in the banking industry despite having the lowest credit quality. This represents a precarious risk to the broader financial sector and an artificial funding advantage subsidized by an implicit taxpayer guarantee. The letter ignores a long precedent of the federal government stepping in to save troubled megabanks and their creditors. History indicates that not only are financial crises unpredictable, but regulatory safeguards designed for the last crisis fail to stop future ones. As Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari wrote in a blog post, governments are quick to rescue those that hold debt in the largest financial firms to ward off contagion and collapse. In his letter to shareholders, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said post-crisis regulatory changes such as the creation of “bail-inable” debt offers taxpayers protection if a big bank fails. But not everyone agrees. Bloomberg News Meanwhile, concerns remain that the largest banks’ private gains and socialized losses have spawned morally hazardous behavior, in which megabank employees take excessive risks knowing that taxpayers have their backs. Wells Fargo’s phony-accounts scandal demonstrates the harm of the megabanks’ grow-at-all-costs mentality, while the largest banks have repeatedly displayed financial impropriety within a system they are capable of rigging. No wonder the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and the Government Accountability Office have concluded that the "too big to fail" problem persists. After all, the Justice Department never brought a case against senior Wall Street executives following the 2008 crisis. At the time, then-U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder admitted that prosecutors held off on megabank prosecutions over fears of the economic impact. Not only are the largest banks too big to fail, they are too big to jail. To truly address the problem, policymakers should consider: enhanced capital, leverage and liquidity standards, stronger concentration limits, stricter resolution regimes and restrictions on the use of the federal safety net. Additionally, Congress and the administration should continue to pursue regulatory relief for community banks to promote localized banking and economic growth. Community banks reinvest in local communities and offer relationship-based services that incentivize true financial stewardship — something that should be promoted by policymakers, not punished through increasingly burdensome regulations. Despite the assurances of the chief executive of the nation’s largest financial institution, the “too big to fail” problem remains unsolved. History shows that you simply can’t take everyone at their word.

He is pulling Barclays out of Africa, after a century, and has sped up its retreat from other markets. He has also poached several folk from JPMorgan Chase, where he spent 34 years and ran the investment bank. On April 10th it emerged that Mr Staley had clumsily planted a boot out of bounds. Last June Barclays’ board and an executive received anonymous letters about a “senior employee” hired earlier in 2016. These, say the bank, raised concerns “of a personal nature” about this person and Mr Staley’s role in dealing with the matter “at a previous employer” (presumably JPMorgan Chase).

In July he inquired whether the matter was resolved—and formed the “honestly held, but mistaken” belief that he was now free to identify one of the authors. He set security on the trail again. This time they called in American law-enforcement officials, but failed to unmask the writer. Both boss and bank are up before the beak: regulators are examining Mr Staley’s conduct and Barclays’ treatment of whistle-blowers. Barclays will reprimand Mr Staley in writing and cut last year’s bonus of £1.3m ($1.6m). By how much depends on the regulators’ findings. After the financial crisis Barclays’ reputation took a battering. Mr Staley and his predecessor, Antony Jenkins, have tried to repair it. But new troubles are easily born, and old ones die hard. In 2012 Barclays was fined £290m for rigging LIBOR, a key interest rate; four of its traders were later jailed. On April 10th the BBC stirred bad memories, with fresh allegations about the scandal and questioning whether the whole truth had emerged in a parliamentary inquiry. Regulators are also examining Barclays’ raising of capital from Qatar in 2008. It may not comfort Mr Staley that others had an even worse start to the week. Wells Fargo, America’s third-biggest bank by assets, castigated John Stumpf, its former boss, for tolerating sales practices that led to the opening of 2m-odd ghost accounts, for which Wells was fined $185m last year. Wells is reclaiming $69m from Mr Stumpf and $67m from Carrie Tolstedt, ex-head of its consumer bank. How was your Monday?

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is delaying a plan to move some wealth-management clients to a self-directed platform as the bank awaits word on whether the Trump administration will rewrite or scrap higher standards for brokers. The lender had told some customers who currently have human advisers they would be transferred this month to a system letting them manage their own retirement accounts as the U.S. Department of Labor prepared to enact the so-called fiduciary rule, which seeks to ensure advisers pitch products in savers’ best interests. But in a follow-up letter to clients this week, the New York-based bank said it’s holding off on the changes. Meanwhile, “your financial adviser can continue to provide you with investment guidance and assist with any service requests you may have on this account,” the firm wrote. A bank spokesman confirmed the contents of the letter and declined to comment further. Broadly, the pending Labor Department rule says advisers handling retirement accounts must give advice in a client’s best interest and shouldn’t earn more than reasonable compensation. Shortly after taking office, President Donald Trump signed an executive memorandum directing the regulator to review the measure, a move that’s left its fate in limbo. The rule had been set to take effect this week, but the Labor Department moved to extend a deadline for compliance by two months as it continues the examination.

X Barclays: What happens when you go after the whistleblower Decades of corporate scandals have taught us the importance of empowering whistleblowers about 20 hours ago Brooke Master The British authorities are investigating Barclays and its chief executive, James E. Staley, after he admitted to trying to learn the identity of a whistleblower last year.         Barclays’ chief executive Jes Staley is a supportive colleague and friend. Since starting work in December 2015, he has brought in at least four senior executives who had worked with him at JPMorgan Chase, to help revamp the UK bank. Then in June, when Barclays received two anonymous letters making unpleasant allegations of what the bank describes as “a personal nature” about one of those hires, Mr Staley went a good deal further. Believing the letters to be an “unfair attack”, he asked Barclays’ security team to track down the author, but was told that was not appropriate because the bank’s compliance department had logged the letters as potential whistleblowing. A month later he went back and asked if the issue had been resolved. Exactly what Mr Staley was told is disputed, but he called in the hounds again and this time they tapped US law enforcement for help. That episode, which came to light this week, may make Mr Staley a very good friend, but it also makes him a very bad chief executive. Decades of corporate scandals - from Enron’s 2001 collapse, to Wells Fargo’s fake accounts scheme - have taught us the importance of empowering whistleblowers. When companies start to go off the rails, whether through accounting shenanigans or overseas bribery, ordinary employees, customers and suppliers are often among the first to see it. If they are taken seriously, misconduct can be caught early, before it becomes endemic. But it requires courage for whistleblowers to act on what they see, especially in the UK. A recent survey by the Ethics Resource Centre of employees in 13 countries found that 63 per cent of British employees who reported wrongdoing experienced retaliation, second only to India and far worse than the 36 per cent global average. Barclays, of all places, should be particularly solicitous of those who want to expose wrongdoing. The bank is notorious for its constant legal tangles. It has admitted attempting to rig three separate sets of benchmarks - Libor, foreign exchange and Isdafix - and has been forced to eject chief executive Bob Diamond in the process. At a time when most banks have put their legal woes behind them, it is still being probed by the UK over a 2008 capital-raising drive and is fighting US allegations of mortgage securities mis-selling. Against that background, Mr Staley’s decision to investigate the anonymous letter writer sends exactly the wrong message. Even if the claims were as unfair as he believed, bringing the full power of Barclays’ security team and US law enforcement to bear was inappropriate and counterproductive. “Healthy organisations encourage their employees to speak up and they focus on the misconduct reported, not the person who reported it,” says Jordan Thomas, a lawyer who helped develop the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s whistleblower programme and now represents whistleblowers. “If your people don’t trust you, they won’t talk to you.” To be fair, the Barclays board has taken the matter seriously. When a second whistleblower alerted them to Mr Staley’s yen for detection, they immediately ordered an investigation, reprimanded Mr Staley and reported him to the UK banking watchdogs. They have also promised a “very significant” cut to his bonus once the regulatory probes are complete. “I am personally very disappointed and apologetic that this situation has occurred,” chairman John McFarlane said in a statement. The bank has also promised to review its whistleblowing programme, even as it cut ties with the technology company that was set to provide an anonymous internal chat service that could be used to report issues. Mr Staley’s supporters argue that he apologised and took his medicine, and that he should be allowed to get on with reviving Barclays’ sagging investment bank. The board seems to agree - it declared that the attempted witch hunt was an honest mistake and the CEO still has their “unanimous confidence”. The board was probably seeking to reassure investors about Mr Staley at a time when he has had some success in bolstering Barclays’ performance. In this, they seem to have succeeded: Barclays shares are basically flat. But the board’s instant declaration of unconditional support also suggests that its support for anonymous tipsters only goes to so far. Barclays employees can take a hint. If they are considering reporting information that might threaten the chief executive - or his friends - they are likely to think again. And that is likely to be much worse for investors in the long run. - (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017)       Topics: Bob Diamond Jes Staley John Mcfarlane Jordan Thomas Cork Harbour Alliance for a Safe Environment Exchange Commission Barclays Enron Wells Fargo India United Kingdom United States Read More Credit Suisse may seek full Irish licence as Brexit looms It’s five years since the O’Reilly family lost control of INM – is the company any better off?

Well being: Really good bosses have the human touch TOP 5 REASONS FOR LONG-TERM ABSENTEEISM 1 Acute medical conditions 2 Musculoskeletal injuries 3 Stress 4 Mental ill health 5 Back pain Source: fitforwork.org It’s not often that a company offers its staff the chance to clock off early, especially a bank. But Karin Overgren, who heads human resources for JPMorgan Chase in the UAE, Lebanon, Egypt and Qatar, says one of her company’s most successful wellness programmes was their work-life balance initiative. "We asked employees to find one thing in their work week that would assist with their work-life balance," says Ms Overgren, also a certified health coach. "I go to the gym once a week at lunchtime, another person might pick leaving early on a Thursday to spend time with the family, or come in late on Sunday mornings to go for a run on the beach. We’ve had lots of positive feedback." But Ms Overgren says not all her initiatives have fared so well. Two years ago when organising a wellness week, she set up sessions of office yoga. "Unfortunately they weren’t as enthusiastic as me," she says. "We had a low turnout. I learnt that you really have to ask people what they want in terms of wellness, because it’s very personal. Now I do a survey each year to see what people want." Employers increasingly realise the long-term benefits that workplace wellness programmes can provide. A study published this year by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Truven Health Analytics and the American Heart Association showed that employers with wellness policies had fewer workers with high blood pressure, tobacco use and physical inactivity. But programmes must be tailored to fit the company. Emma Carbery runs mindfulness training programmes through her Dubai company The Workplace Yogi to help employees alleviate stress and stay focused. But she says her standard mindfulness-based stress reduction programme needed tweaking to adapt it to the corporate environment. "A huge element of that programme is meditation and, let’s face it, sitting around a boardroom table with your colleagues meditating is not the most natural thing to do," says Ms Carbery. Her revised programme, Thriving Minds, focuses on productivity – not just thinking productively, but working productively. q&a mind and body fine-tuned Tommy Hutchinson, the co-founder of the Global Centre for Healthy Workplaces, tells Jessica Hill how to keep employees happy and healthy: Who in a company should be driving the corporate wellness programmes? The programmes need direction from the very top – the chief executive and the company’s board of executives all have to be on board. Companies like to be seen to be doing something. Where they allow the brand managers and the PRs to drive these programmes it might seem to do well, but it isn’t real. Your organisation conducted a global survey with other partners on well-being initiatives. What did it find? That only 52 per cent of employers worldwide are measuring specific outcomes from their wellness programmes. In the US, 59 per cent of employers say they don’t know if their wellness programmes are having an impact on healthcare cost trend (their top-stated objective). These findings underline the need for more awareness and education around evaluation, as well as for systematic planning aligned with a continuous improvement cycle. What was the most encouraging trend? The increasing globalisation of employers’ wellness programmess among multinational companies. More than half of the mulitnationals surveyed implemented a global wellness strategy. This has occurred in spite of major challenges because of differing cultures, laws and practices around the world. What were the most common components of wellness programmes? Human Resource polices related to flexible work arrangements and paid time off ranked as No 1, with employee assistance programmes rankingNo 2, driven by their prevalence in the US, Canada, Africa and Australia. What did the study identify as the main objectives driving wellness strategies? Improving workforce morale, reducing sick leave and disability, improving workplace safety and reducing presenteeism. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More The Life Brands take note: Middle Eastern teenagers are a generation apart Wife of UAE tenant who lost his job needs leeway on rent from landlord Well being: Employees can find their own way to healthiness Book review: A handbook for the chief executive on camera MOST VIEWED Business | All First Abu Dhabi Bank confirms job losses Emirates trolls beleaguered United Airlines boss Emirates hits back at United Airlines for mistreatment of passenger - video Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ UAE release date revealed, comes with Etihad flight discount Wife of UAE tenant who lost his job needs leeway on rent from landlord Aldar closes in on early completion of Abu Dhabi projects Abu Dhabi Financial Group plans flotation of Dh3 billion Reit this year Nakheel awards Dh4.2 billion Deira Mall project to Unec Meraas plans new hotel brands at Bluewaters Island in Dubai Mubadala Development raises US$1.5 billion in two-part bond sale More Most Viewed UAE public appeal to identify man who has lost his memory in car crash First Abu Dhabi Bank confirms job losses Emirates trolls beleaguered United Airlines boss Dubai fire hero’s grief for lost daughter Emirates hits back at United Airlines for mistreatment of passenger - video Emirati, 19, dies in RAK motorcycle crash The reign of Assad is ‘coming to an end’ Teachers from certain countries to be fast-tracked through UAE’s new education licensing scheme UAE patients ‘as young as 28’ having heart attacks Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ UAE release date revealed, comes with Etihad flight discount More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Fuel for Thought: There’s nothing flowery about the renewables bidding bubble Tipping in the UAE: Some are more equal than others Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT UAE public appeal to identify man who has lost his memory in car crash Aldar closes in on early completion of Abu Dhabi projects Switch to Mobile Site About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

He sees the Nifty’s target of 10,500 in a bull case scenario, but also highlights the inconsistency on macroeconomic data front. Adrian Mowat Chief Asian & Emerging Market Strategist | JP Morgan Infosys Q4 2017 results: Experts welcome dividend policy, but worry on EBIT guidance Top trading ideas to trade for today by market experts Experts discuss the reasons for contraction in IIP and an in-line inflation number Benchmark indices have witnessed a strong run in the past couple of months, clocking record highs ever since the results of state assembly elections were announced. Experts say that a large part of the rally is also due to high liquidity and better flows from DIIs and FIIs as well as retail participation through mutual funds. The next big trigger for the market will now be earnings growth, which has not seen much upside for a while now. JPMorgan is of the view that the market will maintain its current level of rich valuations. There is an environment where domestic mutual funds have seen strong inflows, fixed deposit rates are at the lower end of the cycle and we have a nice technical position, Adrian Mowat, MD, Chief Asian & EM Equity Strategist at JPMorgan told CNBC-TV18 in an interview. He also outlined how they set index targets in case scenarios such as bull or bear pan out. The bull case scenario target for the Nifty was 10,500, he said. “Part of what is going on India is a bull case…what is not consistent with the macroeconomic data, specifically with the corporate investment. We need to see those data points coming through to see the Nifty finishing with that target,” he told the channel. Speaking on the rally in emerging markets (EMs), he explained that they value it based on earnings per share (EPS) and return on equities (ROEs). In 2016, EMs delivered positive earnings growth for the first time in five years, he highlighted. Furthermore, he expects the earnings to go up with earnings growth numbers. Results for FY17 will be relatively pedestrian and growth will be in high single-digits, Mowat told the channel. But, in FY18, one has to keep an eye on these figures. Areas such as banking need to see a pick-up in activity. Mowat also saw a recovery in emerging markets and expects financials to lead it. An early stage of that would be lower credit cost, he added. Meanwhile, he saw optimism around consumption space and likes building materials space. In the banking space, he said that distress among borrowers was improving as well. Furthermore, among non-banking financial companies (NBFCS), he likes some housing finance companies as a big opportunity was delivered due to constraints of PSU banks’ capital issues. Meanwhile, on the affordable housing policy of the government, he sees it being a difficult environment for the private sector which is dependent on policies. “A change in government policy can have a profound impact on business model,” he told CNBC-TV18. Mowat is the guest editor on the channel for the day and will be interacting with representatives from different industries through the day. Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview. Latha: Almost all indices are at all-time highs, it is not just Sensex and Nifty, the midcap indices are at all-time highs, smallcap indices are at all-time highs, does it give you a sense that there is a sugar rush here or can we continue to buy? A: There are some things to be cautious about. So we have an environment in which we have got strong inflows into domestic mutual funds. They are quite encouraging in many ways because they are monthly inflows which is definitely the right way to buy equities as opposed to buying them at the top which often happens with retail money. We have also got a dynamic where the positioning in emerging market funds is still very underweight relative to global funds. So you have got a very nice technical position but at the same time, you are buying markets on reasonably high valuations. So look at things based upon the MSCI indices for common comparison across markets, so India is about 18 times on a forward P/E, that is about 0.9 standard deviations above its 10-year mean. I do in fact, while talking to clients, get the general feedback that it is difficult to find things to buy. They know what the themes they want to play, the sectors but the valuations there they are anxious about. I do not think that situation is going to change for now. If you think about the relative opportunities, we have got a very flush monetary system, fixed deposit rates have been much lower than they have been historically, bond yields are behaving themselves and the rupee is proving to be surprisingly strong relative to expectations. So, I think we will maintain these premium valuations but our view is that the market should probably go up with the earnings growth numbers. We are going to be getting the results for fiscal year 2017. I think they will be relatively pedestrian, high single digit growth. The question is what do we achieve in fiscal 2018. I think that is where -- we have got some guests from the real estate sector, from the banking sector and these are the areas where we are going to need to see activity pickup particularly in the banking sector when it comes to corporate loans, which have been quite disappointing. Then we also have the distortion of the final course of last year, the calendar year with demonetisation and how does that come back. It is a very interesting dynamic because if you look at India for Q1 in terms of stock markets performance and some of the data points, it looks very strong but remember we are comparing that to a weaker base in the final course of last calendar year. So it is a very interesting dynamic at the moment. Q: Emerging markets after a long time have come out of a funk. This year at least they have started to perform, deliver some returns, why do you think that is and what would your view be between developed and emerging markets for the rest of the year? A: I with respect describe my clients as growth tourists. So they sit in London, New York, Tokyo and they buy emerging market equities for premium earnings per share (EPS) growth. It is not about gross domestic product (GDP) growth etc, you have to live a premium earnings growth if you are an equity and from 2011 to 2015 the EPS in EM fell. Developed markets were delivering premium EPS growth, they are delivering EPS growth I should say. In 2016, that was the first year in five that emerging market equites delivered premium earnings per share growth. For this year again we are delivering the same thing. The positioning is extremely bearish by the global asset allocators in emerging markets because they had five years of underperformance. So the core fundamental of premium earnings per share growth is now in place. The reasons for that are many but if I was to think of some key big reasons, in 2009 and 2010, there was too much stimulus in the emerging world and in 2011 we had an inflation problem so we started to tighten just as all this new capacity is coming on stream and so you get a collapse in profitability because there is a lack of pricing power and then we should have exited that tightening cycle around 2013 but on May 22, 2013, the Fed published the tapering minutes and that capped the tightening cycle going for some countries for longer including India. The other overlay we had was a fall in commodity prices which is very much an issue of too much supply than necessarily a lack of demand and as commodity prices fell, the terms of trades for many of the emerging countries deteriorated and their currencies fell. So those were sort of big factors. We are now turning around and I think what is very interesting is just how cautious the corporate sector is across emerging markets and that is because they have been through quite a protracted downturn. We could get a dynamic that is similar to what we saw in United States where you have got good corporate profitability rising RoEs but perhaps the economists are commenting in a more negative way saying that corporate capex is not picking up as we wanted. For us, as providers of capital that environment can actually be quite good if companies are cautious. Although ultimately in the longer-term, we do need people to believe in growth, we do need the corporates to invest. Latha: Within corporate earnings, which is the sector that you think will outshine or lead the recovery? A: I think financials should be leading to recovery. An early stage of that will be lower credit costs and credit cost has been a big theme for the last couple of years when it comes to the financials. We have also got the interesting dynamics of trying to work out what is going to be the normal net interest margin (NIM) with the demonetisation effect and having more money in the formal system. However, to get the profit growing, we need to get loan growth above 5 percent and that is something we need to focus on here. Then if we look at the consumer space, also there is optimism around that but again we have got some of the dynamics of demonetisation - that perhaps would generally a lot of growth because you are comparing it with sort of easy final quarter. Building materials is also another area. India has probably been through a five-six year downturn in the real estate industry. So when we look at presales, they have been weak and in some markets - nationwide it is down 40 percent from its 2007 peak. So a turnaround in the real estate industry and how that then helps a consolidating building materials industry also looks fairly interesting. So these will be the types of cyclical areas to look at. Latha: You spoke about credit cost, you must have seen a lot of countries grappling with this bad loan issue, are you confident that you are going to see lower credit cost this year and would you therefore go to the big corporate lenders Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Baroda (BoB)? A: I am confident that the distress in borrowers is improving. Remember often that credit costs are a lagging indicator. A particular example, we are doing work on five of the big overcapacity industries in China and we estimate that between 2015 and 2017 their free cash flows improved by 1.1 trillion renminbi. Latha: That include steel, does it? A: It does include steel, its petrochemicals, cement. So there is dramatic improvement in profitability. We have this theme about the end of PPI deflation, in India's case wholesale price index (WPI) and the improvement in PPI, WPI is hand-in-hand with improvement in pricing power on profit margins. So for the industries in India whether it has been a big focus on credit cost or high credit cost, we see a turnaround in places like China, which is probably very important in terms of a price setter that should be good news for India. So it is possible that banks charge of more but the forward looking indicators that market should focus on are moving in the right direction. Sonia: Do you still have a year-end Nifty target range of 9,300 to 9,600 if I am not wrong, is the reason for that because you expect the markets not to move at all considering that some of the more heavier sectors like banks etc have issues or is this some other bigger concern? A: We set our index targets shortly after the US presidential election and we set them with a series of scenarios for a base case, a bear case and a bull case. So our bull case, the Nifty equivalent is about 10,500. So part of what is going on in India is consistent with the bull case. What is currently not consistent with the bull case is the macroeconomic data specifically issues like corporate investment and we would need to see those data points coming through to be comfortable to say that it is reasonable in terms of a valuation target to have the Nifty finishing this calendar year at 10,500. As a market we are going to become much more dependent on the macro data proving that there is an acceleration going on. An acceleration going on in the underlying numbers not in the real GDP number, which does not seem to be correlated with the profits on a turnover of many of the companies on the Nifty. Latha: Let me ask you the financial sector questions, while credit cost will impact the P&Ls of the corporate lenders, there is the non-bank area, which is picking up a lot of speed. In fact Sonia was referring to the 4 percent loan growth. That is bank loan growth. Bank loan growth as a percentage of total loans that India lent to the commercial sector is to be as high as 85 up until two years ago, last year it dropped to 75, now it is 73, 27 percent is occupied by the bond markets. Therefore the NBFCs, how do you like them? A: We do like some of the housing finance companies as an example of NBFCs that we do cover and I think there is an opportunity here and a big part of that opportunity is delivered by the constraints on the capital of the PSU banks. The other thing is focusing on the housing finance where you have had relatively strong loan demand that has tended to be with the consumer. Latha: Government of India (GoI), the Prime Minister had announced housing for all scheme, a low cost, affordable housing scheme where the government picks up a large part of the bill – almost 3-4 percent of the interest cost on houses up to about 110 square meters, small houses basically, is that a motor enough to push up a lot of stocks, would you bet on that theme and therefore with stocks? A: This is something we should explore with DLF because they had moved into mid-range housing and then sort of moved back out to higher-end housing. It is only in a place like Mexico that I have seen a business model of listed companies where they are into low cost housing. So it is quite a difficult environment for the private sector and it is very policy dependent and obviously a change in the government policy, how much discounts they are going to give on mortgages, can have a profound impact on a business model. Sonia: Do you see the market sort of test our patients a bit more before it gets above that 30,000 zone on the Sensex? A: If we look at what is going on globally, we had a very big run up in PMIs so indicating a surprise, the economy is much better than people were expecting and then PMIs peak around February and have come down a little bit in March and then in April, they are still very much in the expansion zone, we do not have this surprise for the markets, so we have moved into this sort of steady growth environment for the economy. There are uncertainties around US policy implementation. Actually I have quite a lot of confidence in terms of fiscal stimulus. We then have military action in Syria, which is drawing people’s attention to this ongoing problem in North Korea. Sonia: Do you think it is a global-led problem? A: I think it is a global-led problem and I would also throw in April 23, which is the first round of the French presidential election and not so much with Marine Le Pen but some of the other opinion poll moves have been surprising for the market. And the lesson from last to last year is try not to predict politics because you will probably get it wrong.We have made money in markets for quite a few months. We are going to have a consolidation phase and India will not be immune to that type of environment but think of it as consolidation, don’t think we need to sell now aggressively, it is more that you get a period of consolidation.

The settlement means Finra is known to have punished just one individual associated with a 2015 product-pushing case in which JPMorgan admitted it breached its fiduciary duty to clients nationwide: a whistleblower. Burris says he spent $50,000 defending himself in the case. "They've still done nothing to anybody at JPMorgan, for God's sake," says Burris, now a registered investment adviser in Surprise, Ariz., "but they come after me for trying to help out my clients." In settling, Burris neither admitted nor denied guilt. Officials at JPMorgan and Finra declined to comment for this story. Bank admitted guilt In 2015 JPMorgan admitted it breached its fiduciary duty by pushing the bank's own high-priced investments on unsuspecting clients. It paid the highest Securities and Exchange Commission fine of the year in the case, at $267 million, and another $40 million to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in a parallel case. The fines came three years after Burris supplied the SEC with hundreds of pages of documentary and other evidence about the same alleged sales practices, including recordings of managers urging him to push certain products. Johnny Burris, a whistleblower in an SEC case against JPMorgan Chase, was found by the Labor Department to be the victim of retaliation by the company. After Finra sued Burris on behalf of JPMorgan in an unrelated client matter, Burris said he agreed to a settlement because it was getting too expensive to fight. That $307 million in total is substantially more than the $185 million in fines paid by Wells Fargo in the high-profile phony-accounts scandal last year that continues to draw national attention. Earlier this year, the Labor Department found that JPMorgan retaliated against Burris when it fired him in 2012 months after he blew the whistle. Burris is appealing that decision, which awards back pay and damages in the mid six figures, far less than the $2 million he says he has lost in compensation since 2012. Whistleblower protection laws provide that people who experience retaliation must be immediately reinstated to their positions, and some can receive lost wages. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ordered reinstatement of an unnamed Wells Fargo whistleblower last week and indicated that it may do the same for another Wells whistleblower named Claudia Ponce de Leon. The cases could mean that the government is taking a stronger approach to protecting whistleblowers than it has in the past. 'Very serious violations' Finra sued Burris on behalf of JPMorgan in September, while his OSHA case was still underway, over an unusually small loss for a pair of his married clients: just $624. It also accused him of other transgressions, such as using doctored bank letterhead. "These are very serious violations," a Finra spokeswoman said last year of the Burris case. "Finra does not file a formal complaint unless it has strong reason to believe there are violations at its core." A quasi-governmental body, Finra is run by the firms it polices. JPMorgan is its largest member firm, with $2.5 trillion in assets. However, the clients JPMorgan accused Burris of harming signed an affidavit saying they never complained about Burris. They say Finra attributed "wrongful" statements to them in writing up a complaint under their names. [Read the document] JPMorgan admitted that Burris' former manager Laya Gavin wrote up complaints on behalf of his clients. Finra filed a notice on Gavin's BrokerCheck report that it may take action against her, though she no longer works for the bank. Burris' showed American Banker and its sister publication Financial Planning a document that he said demonstrates that his compliance officer approved the use of the letterhead. "Finra had a range of choices as to how to treat the tax issue, and it had no good reason to punish Johnny the way it did, except to please JPMorgan," says Darrell Whitman, a former federal whistleblower investigator for OSHA, who briefly handled Burris' case in 2014. Most bank whistleblowers must file cases with OSHA in order to seek the full protection under the law. Whitman and the next investigator who handled Burris' case, Susan Kamlet, say the federal government denied Burris justice. Both Whitman and Kamlet were later fired from their jobs. Whitman accuses the Labor Department of routine collaboration with corporate defendant firms in his own whistleblower case, which is now pending before the Office of Special Counsel. A 'smear' campaign Tom Devine, a lawyer who is representing Whitman in his special-counsel case, described Finra's decision to sue Burris last year as a "smokescreen." "The tax issues were pretexts generated by JPMorgan to smear Mr. Burris and have been repudiated by all the so-called victims," says Devine, who says the tactic is a common one among defendant corporations in whistleblower cases. Corporations never admit to firing whistleblowers, adds Stephen Kohn, executive director of the National Whistleblower Center. "They always come up with a phony reason to justify the retaliation," says Kohn, who represented a former UBS employee in a 2012 case that produced the largest IRS whistleblower award to date at $104 million. "This makes whistleblower cases expensive and painful for the employee." Richard Moberly, a dean at the University of Nebraska College of Law and an expert in whistleblower law, said generally speaking such tactics are common. "When retaliation occurs, one strategy of companies is to rely on pretextual reasons for the firing," Moberly said. Burris' former clients Leona and Raymond Weaklend criticized the way Finra lawyer Margery Shanoff and Andrew Held, another former JPMorgan executive who managed Burris, handled their case. "Mr. Burris has been nothing but helpful our entire time of working with him," the couple wrote in a notarized letter on Dec. 15, 2015. “Maybe Chase needs to reimburse us for the stress, time, frustration, and wrongful statements attributed to us by Mr. Held." After Burris left JPMorgan, the couple moved their assets over to his registered investment advisory firm. On top of the $50,000 Burris said he spent defending himself in the Weaklend case, he says he spent at least $100,000 more on an earlier Finra arbitration he lost to the bank in 2013. "They could have put there was a unicorn in my backyard, and I'd have had to sign it," Burris says of this month's settlement. "I have been drained of money by Finra and JPMorgan."

Debt slavery is here, and it’s real Posted on April 13, 2017April 10, 2017 by GS Early Views: 4 0 Shares I stumbled across a very interesting chart the other day. Apparently, this graph was put together by Jon Gabriel using U.S. Treasury and Congressional Budget Office data, so the numbers are about as credible as you can find (which may not be saying much). If you have had a sinking feeling for the past number of decades about why it has felt like the U.S. economy wasn’t really moving in the right direction even before the financial crises in 2008, this will fill in that feeling with facts. Very disturbing but inescapable facts. Here it is:   And this is just up to 2013. It has gotten no better since then. Sure, worry about the deficit. Argue about entitlement programs. The owners of all this consumer and commercial debt are happy you’re not looking at the real problem because now they don’t have to do anything about it but profit from it. The politicians are bought off by the bankers, so they rail about government spending and tax reform and libertarian values on one hand and take money from the people consolidating wealth on the other. What’s more, this isn’t a partisan issue. We’re all getting screwed by this other than the 1 percent. Elected officials aren’t going to do anything about it. And the bankers aren’t going to do anything about it. There are two ways to look at this from the point of view of your own investments, as I can see it. The first is, realize the banks once again rule the land like the dinosaurs of old… and follow quietly in their wake. Be like a bird that sits on the back of a rhino walking through tall grass. As the rhino moves through the underbrush the insects fly into the air and the bird flies off and grabs them. Hold the big banks you might have in your portfolio and expect them to expand their domination of both the domestic and global markets through acquisitions. If you want to go this route, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE: BK) or Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) are right up your alley. Or you can choose to believe that this is simply a long-term super-cycle which will eventually implode. As Bob Livingston has said for decades, we have transitioned from a world of money to a world of debt. And this chart bears that out clearly. Individuals have increasingly less control over their economic or day-to-day lives than they have any time in the history of the U.S. The politicians have used partisanship to slow down Congress and distort the real challenges facing the country. But the bankers’ greed will have its limits. Eventually they won’t be able to tap into Americans’ pockets any longer. Just like what happened at the end of the housing bubble. This debt bubble has been even more pervasive. It will have a reckoning that will reverberate for a century. There won’t be grass roots revolution. It will collapse from its own weight. By doling out debt, it keeps individuals feeling like they’re doing OK. As long as they’re somewhat comfortable and feel like they can reach the next rung, they won’t rock the boat. And because many are already so deep in debt they’re scared to lose what they have and damage their almighty credit rating — the greatest invention the banks have launched in 50 years. This is why I have advocated getting money out of the system — not all of it but some of it for now. If you want a stock that is a good play on this current trend, look at Fair Isaac Corporation (NYSE: FICO). They invented the FICO score and get a fee for every time someone checks their score. Visa (NYSE: V) and MasterCard (NYSE: MA) should do well too as they debt message spreads across developing nations. They will spearhead the debt contagion. If you want to get out of the loop on a personal finance front, the first step is to make paying off your debt your top financial priority (aside from low fixed rate big ticket items like your house or car). Only bank with local banks or better yet, local credit unions. Hold real assets like gold and silver. Collectibles like antique cars and art can also be helpful. I also recommend you learn about bitcoin. As of April 1, bitcoin is now considered legal tender in Japan. Trading around $1,150 per bitcoin, the price has remained high. It’s the enemy of the banksters since it operates beyond their systems. Because of this, it will never be considered a “real” currency by the banksters and the markets will not make it easy for firms trying to grow it. But it’s here and it’s real. — GS Early This entry was posted in Featured and tagged U.S. Economy. Bookmark the permalink.

Illustration: Dominic Xavier/Rediff.com Is big always beautiful? Not necessarily so in the mutual fund industry. While big fund houses with their strong distribution reach and multiple schemes to match all kind of investors' needs are able to garner most of the money, several smaller fund houses have small schemes with assets of less than Rs 1,000 crore that deliver steady returns to investors. Funds from fund houses like Quantum Long Term Equity and PPFAS Long Term Value are examples. Many investors, however, are afraid to invest in these funds because of their small size. Experts say that provided you avoid the minuscule-sized ones, you may invest in small-sized funds and in fact benefit from their nimbleness. Small means agile A small-sized fund is nimble and agile. If a fund has an AUM (assets under management) of Rs 500 crore and wants to invest five per cent of its corpus in a stock, that is only Rs 25 crore. The fund can deploy the money quickly. "With small size it becomes easier to time your calls. Real active management is much more possible when your asset size is not very large," says Vidya Bala, head of research, Fundsindia.com. Consider the converse situation, where a fund has an AUM of Rs 15,000 crore. Even one per cent of Rs 15,000 crore is Rs 150 crore. Such a fund will have to let go of many stock ideas because they are too small for it. Those stocks may not have the required liquidity for the fund manager to be able to deploy enough money in them. If s/he does buy a stock with low liquidity, the impact cost (price getting driven up due to the fund's purchases, increasing its average cost of acquisition) will be high. This is especially an issue in the mid- and small-cap segment (not so much in the large and multi-cap space). A big fund also needs many more stock ideas. Such a fund may become too large to deploy all its money in the fund manager's 25 best ideas. The manager may hence be forced to invest in ideas that are not as compelling. Moreover, if a fund manager has to invest in a large number of stocks, tracking them all becomes difficult. This problem of asset bloat could result in muted performance. Myths about small size Investors harbour many fears about small-sized funds from smaller fund houses. While these issues do exist, one needs to see if they are exclusive to small fund houses. One fear is that a small fund house could get taken over. As Rajeev Thakkar, director and chief investment officer at PPFAS Mutual Fund, says: "The issue of viability has been there across size. Many financial powerhouses like JPMorgan, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, etc set up fund houses in India and then exited after a few years as they couldn't make the business viable." At the same time, a fund house like Quantum (AUM Rs 1,012 crore) continues to thrive since 2006. Investors also fear that a fund manager who has proved her/his mettle at a smaller fund house might get poached by a larger fund house. Again, this is not borne out entirely by facts. Fund managers at smaller fund houses might move to bigger ones, but the reverse also happens. In recent times, while Vetri Subramanian (from Invesco to UTI Mutual Fund) moved from a smaller fund house to a bigger one, there has also been movement in the reverse direction, with Anoop Bhaskar (from UTI MF to IDFC MF) and Kenneth Andrade shifting to smaller outfits (the latter from IDFC MF to setting up his own PMS firm, Old Bridge Capital Management). Investors also fear that in a small-sized fund any redemption pressure could force the manager to sell some of the better stocks in the portfolio. This could hurt future performance and be detrimental to investors who have not exited. "That is more of a fear in debt funds, like liquid and ultra-short term categories, where large institutional investors predominate. In equity funds, you usually have a large number of retail (individual) investors," says Bala. Redemption pressure is likely to arise in an equity fund only in case of a steep market correction. Hence, Fundsindia.com has a minimum AUM criterion of Rs 200 crore for the large-cap funds and Rs 100 crore for the mid- and small-cap funds it recommends. You, too, could follow this rule. Performance doesn't always lead to bigger AUM Sometimes, a fund's AUM remains small despite sound performance due to extraneous factors. Take the case of Motilal Oswal MOSt Focused 25, a large-cap fund that has given a return of 18.55 per cent over the past three years, beating its benchmark by 7.63 percentage points. The same fund house's midcap fund, Motilal Oswal MOSt Focused Midcap 30, has given a return of 31.07 per cent, beating its benchmark by 5.08 percentage points. The large-cap fund has so far managed to garner an AUM of Rs 478.6 crore, while its midcap cousin has an AUM of Rs 1,256 crore. "Particular types of funds do well in particular periods. Money flows to the segment of the market where returns are higher, while other segments get ignored. In this case, though our large-cap fund has also done well, it has not managed to gather much AUM because a particular style is doing better and is attracting most of the inflows," says Siddharth Bothra, senior vice-president and fund manager, Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund. If a fund's size is small because of such factors, one should not fear investing in it. Finally, a fund house has many expenses, such as the fund management team's salary, providing the team with research tools such as Bloomberg, allowing analysts to travel and meet sources, etc. All this makes it essential that a fund house should have a minimum corpus to be able to pay for these. If it doesn't, it could lead to compromises on quality of work. Experts, however, say it is hard to stipulate a minimum AUM size a fund house should have. So long as a small fund house runs a limited number of schemes, it may do a good job. "If a small fund house is focused on the task of asset management, and has good risk management systems, good processes, and a good team, we don't mind its small size," says Amar Pandit, founder and chief executive officer, My Financial Advisor.

Not this time. With the return of inflation and improving economic growth, they are instead upgrading their 2017 estimates for earnings around the world. Positive revisions are outnumbering negative ones, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, which bodes well for equities in the coming months. The upgrades are uncommon, say JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Emmanuel Cau and Mislav Matejka, especially since consensus projections at the start of the year were already elevated. First-quarter earnings are expected to rise 15% for European companies, 9% for those in the US and 16% for Japanese firms, the equity strategists wrote in an April 10 note. Despite the high expectations, JPMorgan sees scope for positive surprises in the upcoming earnings season, saying that corporate pricing, operating leverage, commodity prices and credit conditions were all supportive during the three-month period. “We think the earnings delivery will be significantly better than even the robust fourth quarter was,“ the strategists wrote. Bank of America-Merrill Lynch says a global earnings upgrade cycle has begun, with the number of prof it upgrades outnumbering downgrades for the first time in six years.Previous instances of the earnings revision ratio rising above 1 have flagged a stock rally in the the following 12 months on average, its strategists wrote in a March 30 note. While the earnings season has barely begun, early indications have lent credence to the forecasts. In the US, Delta Air Lines Inc. on Wednesday said a gauge of its pricing power would rebound after a two-year decline, while Germany's Daimler AG boosted investor sentiment on carmakers after saying first-quarter profit almost doubled.Lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. report on Thursday . In Europe, the profit revival has been a long time coming. Analysts have raised annual earnings estimates for only the second time in a decade, UBS strategists including Nick Nelson and Karen Olney wrote in an April 12 note, as the increase in inflation boosted corporate revenue. Margins on earnings for Euro Stoxx 50 Index members have already widened from a 14-year low last July as consumer prices picked up, reversing a trend that's been in place since the height of the region's sovereigndebt crisis in 2011. An acceleration in inflation can only help.

(Photo: OTA Photos/flickr/cc) As a society obsessed by money, we pay a gigantic price for not educating high school and college students about money and banking. The ways of the giant global banks – both commercial and investment operations – are as mysterious as they are damaging to the people. Big banks use the Federal Reserve to maximize their influence and profits. The federal Freedom of Information Act provides an exemption for matters that are “contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions.” This exemption allows financial institutions to wallow in secrecy. Financial institutions are so influential in Congress that Senator Durbin (D, IL) says “[The banks] frankly own this place.” Although anti-union, giant financial institutions have significant influence over the investments of worker pension funds. Their certainty of being bailed out because they are seen as “too big to fail” harms the competitiveness of smaller, community banks and allows the big bankers to take bigger risks with “other people’s money,” as Justice Brandeis put it. These big banks are so pervasive in their reach that even unions and progressive media, such as The Nation magazine and Democracy Now have their accounts with JP Morgan Chase. Look for county commissioners and state treasurers to come on board when they see the enormous safeguards and savings that can be secured through “public banks” in contrast to the convoluted casino run by unaccountable Wall Street gamblers and speculators. The government allows banks to have concentrated power. Taxpayers and Consumers are charged excessive fees and paid paltry interest rates on savings. The bonds of municipalities are are also hit with staggering fees and public assets like highways and public drinking water systems are corporatized by Goldman Sachs and other privatizers with sweetheart multi-decade leases. Then there are the immense taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street, such as those in 2008-2009 after the financial industry’s recklessness and crimes brought down the economy, cost workers 8 million jobs, and shredded the pension and mutual fund savings of the American people. Standing like a beacon of stability, responsiveness and profitability is the 98 year-old, state-owned Bank of North Dakota (BND). As reported by Ellen Brown, prolific author and founder of the Public Banking Institute (Santa Clarita, California), “The BND has had record profits for the last 12 years” (avoiding the Wall Street crash) "each year outperforming the last. In 2015 it reported $130.7 million in earnings, total assets of $7.4 billion, capital of $749 million, and a return on investment of a whopping 18.1 percent. Its lending portfolio grew by $486 million, a 12.7 percent increase, with growth in all four of its areas of concentration: agriculture, business, residential and student loans…” North Dakota’s economy is depressed because of the sharp drop in oil prices. So the BND moved to help. Again, Ellen Brown: “In 2015, it introduced new infrastructure programs to improve access to medical facilities, remodel or construct new schools, and build new road and water infrastructure. The Farm Financial Stability Loan was introduced to assist farmers affected by low commodity prices or below-average crop production. The BND also helped fund 300 new businesses.” All this is in a state with half the population of Phoenix or Philadelphia. A California coalition is forming to establish a state-owned bank for California. Coalition organizers say a California State Bank will cut the state’s long-term financing costs in half, compared to what avaricious Wall Street is charging. The nation’s largest state (equivalent to the world’s sixth largest economy) can free itself from massive debt accumulation, bid-rigging, deceptive interest-rate swaps and capital appreciation bonds at 300% interest over time. What assets does the state have to make this bank fully operational? California has surplus funds which total about $600 billion, including those in a Pooled Money Investment account managed by the State Treasurer that contains $54 billion earning less than 1 percent interest. Money in these funds is earmarked for specific expenditure purposes, but they can be invested – in a new state bank. To escape from a Wall Street that is, in Brown’s words “sucking massive sums in interest, fees and interest rate swap payments out of California and into offshore tax havens,” a state bank can use its impressive credit power to develop infrastructure in California. Huge state pension funds and other state funds can provide the deposits. Each one billion dollar capital investment can lend $10 billion for projects less expensively and under open stable banking control by California. Presently, California and other states routinely deposit hundreds of billions of dollars in Wall Street banks at minimal interest, turn around and borrow for infrastructure construction and repair from the Wall Street bond market at much higher interest and fees. This is a ridiculous form of debt peonage, a lesson Governor Jerry Brown has yet to learn. He and other officials similarly uninformed about how the state of California can be its own banker should visit publicbankinginstitute.org and read Ellen Brown’s book, The Public Bank Solution. Legislation for public banks is being pursued in the states of Washington, Michigan, Arizona and New Jersey, as well as the cities of Philadelphia and Santa Fe. Look for county commissioners and state treasurers to come on board when they see the enormous safeguards and savings that can be secured through “public banks” in contrast to the convoluted casino run by unaccountable Wall Street gamblers and speculators. A longtime backer of public banking, retired entrepreneur Richard Mazess, hopes that national civic groups like Public Citizen, Common Cause, People for the American Way and Consumer Watchdog can get behind the proposal. “Public, not private, infrastructure is essential for an equitable economy,” he says. California already has a public infrastructure bank called the IBank. Mr. Mazess and others believe that expanding the existing IBank into a depository institution would be more likely to pass through the California legislature. The deposits would come from public institutions, and NGOs (not from private persons). These pension funds and other public deposits would become reserves and serve as the basis for safely leveraged loans to public projects at a conservative tenfold multiplier. No derivatives or other shenanigans allowed. Before that proposal can be enacted, however, there needs to be much more education of state legislators and the public at large. Such enlightenment would illuminate the enormous savings, along with the restoration of state sovereignty from the absentee, exploitative grip of an unrepentant, speculating, profiteering Wall Street that believes it can always go to Washington, DC for its taxpayer bailouts.

Oil futures had a solid gain of 1.6%, closing at $53.08 per barrel. The gain was attributed to a U.S. missile attack on a Syrian airbase and the “turnaround” of a carrier fleet with a new heading to North Korean waters. Rumors spread of Chinese troops heading for the North Korean border, but the report could not be confirmed. The shortened week, due to Good Friday, will still have some noteworthy earnings: Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) are expected to report Q1. Despite the international tensions, gold fell 0.3% to $1,251.10 per ounce. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2 points at 20,658, the S&P 500 gained 2, as well, with a close at 2,357, the Nasdaq rose 3 points at 5,881, and the Russell 2000 closed at 1,367 for a gain of 3 points. The NYSE’s primary exchange traded 661 million shares with total volume of 2.7 billion shares, and the Nasdaq crossed 1.6 billion shares. On the Big Board, advancers outpaced decliners by 2.1-to-1, and on the Nasdaq, decliners led by a small margin. Blocks on the NYSE fell to 5,438 from 6,168 on Friday. Click to Enlarge The “most-watched index,” the Dow Jones Industrial Average, topped on March 1 at 21,169 and has taken back about 50% of the move from the breakout at January’s high at 20,125. Now prices are being squeezed between the resistance line at 20,750 and the 50-day moving average at 20,045. Volume gives no clue as to the direction of the coming break, but MACD is negative and that could determine the outcome. Conclusion: Shortened weeks don’t usually provide new market directions. However, the market’s near-term direction may depend on the international situation. We are faced with America’s largest companies’ stocks at an apex, which is a bull/bear inflection point.

U.S. stock indexes edged lower in early trading Wednesday, April 12, 2017, weighed down mainly by a slide in materials and industrial companies. Consumer goods stocks were up the most.

Updated 5 hours ago Industrial and materials companies led stocks modestly lower Wednesday on another day of subdued trading in advance of the long Easter holiday weekend. The slide marked the second decline in a row for the stock market, extending its losses for the month. Energy stocks also fell as oil prices snapped a six-day winning streak. Utilities, phone companies and other high-dividend stocks were among the biggest gainers. Bond prices rose, sending yields lower. “The market is kind of on hold until we start getting earnings reports and you start to read the body language on what managements are saying,” said Thomas Martin, portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta. “We're getting this slow churning really until we start getting some information.” The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 8.85 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,344.93. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 59.44 points, or 0.3 percent, to 20,591.86. The Nasdaq composite index lost 30.61 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,836.16. Small-company stocks did far worse than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index gave up 17.75 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,359.20. Twice as many stocks fell as rose on the New York Stock Exchange, while trading in declining stocks was 2.5 times as heavy as that of stocks that closed higher. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note fell to 2.25 percent from 2.32 percent late Tuesday. That's its lowest yield since November. “That's indicative of people, once more, taking that opinion of being risk-off, or not willing to make a bet that equity prices are going to be up because of higher earnings to be reported here for the first quarter,” said Terry DuFrene, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Companies are due to begin disclosing their latest quarterly results over the next few weeks, beginning on Thursday with several big banks. Among the stocks that helped pull the market lower Tuesday was Tractor Supply, which sank 8.3 percent. The farm equipment retailer said sales of seasonal goods fell during the first quarter. The stock fell the most among companies in the S&P 500, shedding $5.86 to $64.61. Industrials sector stocks were the biggest decliner in the S&P 500. Fastenal led the sector slide, tumbling 8 percent after the maker of industrial coatings and construction fasteners disclosed that its business was hurt by higher freight expenses and inventory costs. The stock lost $4.05 to $46.29. Other laggards in the sector included United Rentals, which slid $4.80, or 3.8 percent, to $121.13, and Rockwell Automation, which shed $5.88, or 3.8 percent, to $150.23. Investors bid up shares in Blackberry after arbitrators awarded the smartphone maker $814.9 million to resolve a dispute with Qualcomm over royalty overpayments. The stock gained $1.23, or 16 percent, to $8.93. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed. In Europe, Germany's DAX rose 0.1 percent, while France's CAC 40 dipped less than 0.1 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.2 percent. Earlier in Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index slid 1 percent after the dollar fell under 110 yen for the first time in five months, pressuring the country's exporters. Hong Kong's Hang Seng reversed its losses in the final hour of trading, rising 0.9 percent. South Korea's Kospi climbed 0.2 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude snapped a six-day winning streak, losing 29 cents to close at $53.11 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell 37 cents to close at $55.86 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline dipped 2 cents to $1.74 a gallon. Heating oil held steady at $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas rose 4 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $3.19 per 1,000 cubic feet. Among metals, gold rose $3.90 to $1,278.10 an ounce. Silver gained 5 cents to $18.30 an ounce. Copper fell 6 cents to $2.55 a pound. The dollar had been losing ground much of the day, but recovered by midafternoon. By late afternoon, however, the U.S. currency took a sharp turn lower after President Donald Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the dollar was “getting too strong.” In late trading, the dollar weakened to 109.10 yen, down from 109.69 yen late Tuesday. The euro strengthened to $1.0669 from $1.0608. U.S. markets will be closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday.

U.S. stock indexes closed with modest losses Wednesday, weighed down mainly by a slide in materials and industrial companies. Trading was subdued as investors monitored brewing geopolitical tensions head of the long Easter holiday weekend. By Alex Veiga, AP Business Writer | April 12, 2017 at 2:24 pm Industrial and materials companies led U.S. stocks modestly lower Wednesday on another day of subdued trading ahead of the long Easter holiday weekend. The slide marked the second decline in a row for the stock market, extending its losses for the month. Energy stocks also fell as oil prices snapped a six-day winning streak. Utilities, phone companies and other high-dividend stocks were among the biggest gainers. Bond prices rose, sending yields lower.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 59.44 points, or 0.3 percent, to 20,591.86. The Nasdaq composite index lost 30.61 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,836.16. Small-company stocks did far worse than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index gave up 17.75 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,359.20. Twice as many stocks fell as rose on the New York Stock Exchange, while trading in declining stocks was 2.5 times as heavy as that of stocks that closed higher. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note fell to 2.25 percent from 2.32 percent late Tuesday. That’s its lowest yield since November. “That’s indicative of people, once more, taking that opinion of being risk-off, or not willing to make a bet that equity prices are going to be up because of higher earnings to be reported here for the first quarter,” said Terry DuFrene, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Companies are due to begin disclosing their latest quarterly results over the next few weeks, beginning on Thursday with several big banks. Among the stocks that helped pull the market lower Tuesday was Tractor Supply, which sank 8.3 percent. The farm equipment retailer said sales of seasonal goods fell during the first quarter. The stock fell the most among companies in the S&P 500, shedding $5.86 to $64.61. Industrials sector stocks were the biggest decliner in the S&P 500. Fastenal led the sector slide, tumbling 8 percent after the maker of industrial coatings and construction fasteners disclosed that its business was hurt by higher freight expenses and inventory costs. The stock lost $4.05 to $46.29. Other laggards in the sector included United Rentals, which slid $4.80, or 3.8 percent, to $121.13, and Rockwell Automation, which shed $5.88, or 3.8 percent, to $150.23. Investors bid up shares in Blackberry after arbitrators awarded the smartphone maker $814.9 million to resolve a dispute with Qualcomm over royalty overpayments. The stock gained $1.23, or 16 percent, to $8.93. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed. In Europe, Germany’s DAX rose 0.1 percent, while France’s CAC 40 dipped less than 0.1 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.2 percent. Earlier in Asia, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index slid 1 percent after the dollar fell under 110 yen for the first time in five months, pressuring the country’s exporters. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng reversed its losses in the final hour of trading, rising 0.9 percent. South Korea’s Kospi climbed 0.2 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude snapped a six-day winning streak, losing 29 cents to close at $53.11 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell 37 cents to close at $55.86 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline dipped 2 cents to $1.74 a gallon. Heating oil held steady at $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas rose 4 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $3.19 per 1,000 cubic feet. Among metals, gold rose $3.90 to $1,278.10 an ounce. Silver gained 5 cents to $18.30 an ounce. Copper fell 6 cents to $2.55 a pound. The dollar had been losing ground much of the day, but recovered by midafternoon. By late afternoon, however, the U.S. currency took a sharp turn lower after President Donald Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the dollar was “getting too strong.” In late trading, the dollar weakened to 109.10 yen, down from 109.69 yen late Tuesday. The euro strengthened to $1.0669 from $1.0608. U.S. markets will be closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday. Tags:  Stocks Alex Veiga, AP Business Writer Subscribe Today!

Morgan: The Trump/Ryan premium is fading By SueChang Markets reporter iStockphoto Where do stock markets go when they die? The stock market is so quiet that one Wall Street analyst compared the trading environment to the spiritual no-man’s-land where dead souls linger. “The S&P 500 is stuck in purgatory and hasn’t moved in the last [roughly] 1.5 months. Until the nominal growth clouds clear (and the S&P 500 vs. Treasury gap is resolved) domestic equities will likely continue trading in a sideways/sluggish fashion,” wrote Adam Crisafulli, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., in a note to clients. After hitting a record in early March, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.38%  has largely stalled, trading in a limited range for the past few weeks. Over the same stretch, the 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.41%  has dropped toward 2.25% from 2.46% as appetite for bonds remains robust, driving bond prices up—and yields down—even as the Federal Reserve is expected to further raise interest rates. “Treasurys aren’t doing much but have rallied meaningfully in the last few days—and the S&P 500 and 10-year yields are telling a very different story on the landscape and investors are waiting for a resolution to the discrepancy,” he said. In contrast to the exuberance that overwhelmed the stock market in the aftermath of Trump’s election, the mood has become more subdued as investors seek more clarity on how effectively and quickly the president can execute tax cuts and deregulation. Meanwhile, stock-market investors are growing accustomed to the doldrums. Until Wednesday, when the S&P 500 declined 0.38%, the large-cap index hadn’t closed higher or lower by 0.35% or more for 10 days in a row, something that hadn’t happened since December 1968, according to Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James, even likened the market to the Twilight Zone, a black-and-white TV series that was science fiction, psychological thriller, and morality tale all rolled into one. “’Lockdown’ is what the stock market has been on since mid-February,” he said, in a Tuesday note. “We’ve got multiple terrorist attacks around the world, we’ve launched a U.S. missile strike on Syria, a battle fleet is headed for the Korean Peninsula, and the stock market just hangs in there.” For now, analysts are counting on first-quarter earnings—which are expected to grow by double digits—to jolt the market out of its catatonic trance. Read: A conflicted stock market faces moment of truth as earnings loom But given the market’s reluctance to budge from its range-bound trading, it may take a bit more than stellar corporate results to resurrect stocks. That catalyst may come from the one area that has been defying expectations—the economy. “The one upside over the last 1-2 weeks are diminishing political expectations—which means there isn’t a big Trump/Ryan premium left although this makes economic data that much more important,” said Crisafulli. The “Trump/Ryan premium” refers to earlier market optimism fueled by expectations Republican control of the White House and Congress, with a House led by Speaker Paul Ryan, would help ensure rapid enactment of tax cuts and other elements of Trump’s campaign pledges. The Goldman Sachs U.S. MAP surprise index (see chart below) is at its highest since 2013, a sign that economic performance is outpacing expectations. But a weaker-than-expected March jobs report and other recent data are raising concerns that growth may be starting to slow. Data will be closely watched, indeed.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Bank expert Dick Bove warns savvy investors to withdraw and cash out from risky and dangerous bank stocks. "I think you should be getting out of the banks right here. I think they are a very treacherous area to invest in," Bove told CNBC. "You are going to have to wait till the fall before you are going to make any money in bank stocks," he said. The reasons people are investing in bank stocks are "simply wacko," Bove, vice president of equity research and financial sector analyst at Rafferty Capital, said. Bove said that investors in essence have an "incorrect" theory that bank stocks are not really companies but bond-market surrogates. "What's happening now is if the yield on the 10-year goes down, which mean that the value of the assets of the banks go up, bank stocks go down," Bove said. "If the yield on the 10-year goes up, which means the value of bank assets go down, bank stocks go up." Bond prices typically go down as yield rises, CNBC.com explained. "I still think JPMorgan is one of the best companies the United States has ever created, under Jamie Dimon. That's a pretty good stock to look at," he said. Meanwhile, other gurus recently have offered their insight on the best places for investors to seek shelter, and possibly profit, in this volatile market. Entrepreneur, stock trader, television personality and author Adam Mesh told Newsmax TV that not every section of the stock market is a safe bet just because investors have enjoyed a bull run since Donald Trump’s presidential victory. “It's hard to explain how it got here. All of last year seemed surreal in how we went up and then the expectation was going into the election if Trump became president that we'd go down, but then we just continued higher and now it seems that everybody is bullish,” he told Sunday’s “The Income Generation Show.” “It's just hard to buy up here because everything has come so far already. If you were going to go see Hamilton in New York and you didn't buy tickets because they were $250, would you pay $1,000? It's the same thing right now with the market,” said founder of the Adam Mesh Trading Group. But be advised: one of the most respected financial minds of our times bluntly warns there is no safe place for investors these days. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said that while it’s difficult to call a market top, valuations have gotten ahead of the economy in recent months. “I’m not sure that I see what in the economy would justify a market move of the magnitude we’ve seen in the last months,” Summers said in an interview Wednesday on Bloomberg Television. “It wouldn’t surprise me if people look back and see that there was a bit of a sugar high in some of the valuations that we’re seeing,” said Summers, a Harvard University economist who led the Treasury Department under Democratic President Bill Clinton. Summers said that there’s more downside risk to markets than upside risk right now, and said there’s “a certain amount of apprehensiveness” given politics in Europe, uncertainty in Asia and challenges moving U.S. legislation.

Morgan: The Trump/Ryan premium is fading By SueChang Markets reporter iStockphoto Where do stock markets go when they die? The stock market is so quiet that one Wall Street analyst compared the trading environment to the spiritual no-man’s-land where dead souls linger. “The S&P 500 is stuck in purgatory and hasn’t moved in the last [roughly] 1.5 months. Until the nominal growth clouds clear (and the S&P 500 vs. Treasury gap is resolved) domestic equities will likely continue trading in a sideways/sluggish fashion,” wrote Adam Crisafulli, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., in a note to clients. After hitting a record in early March, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.38%  has largely stalled, trading in a limited range for the past few weeks. Over the same stretch, the 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.41%  has dropped toward 2.25% from 2.46% as appetite for bonds remains robust, driving bond prices up—and yields down—even as the Federal Reserve is expected to further raise interest rates. “Treasurys aren’t doing much but have rallied meaningfully in the last few days—and the S&P 500 and 10-year yields are telling a very different story on the landscape and investors are waiting for a resolution to the discrepancy,” he said. In contrast to the exuberance that overwhelmed the stock market in the aftermath of Trump’s election, the mood has become more subdued as investors seek more clarity on how effectively and quickly the president can execute tax cuts and deregulation. Meanwhile, stock-market investors are growing accustomed to the doldrums. Until Wednesday, when the S&P 500 declined 0.38%, the large-cap index hadn’t closed higher or lower by 0.35% or more for 10 days in a row, something that hadn’t happened since December 1968, according to Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James, even likened the market to the Twilight Zone, a black-and-white TV series that was science fiction, psychological thriller, and morality tale all rolled into one. “’Lockdown’ is what the stock market has been on since mid-February,” he said, in a Tuesday note. “We’ve got multiple terrorist attacks around the world, we’ve launched a U.S. missile strike on Syria, a battle fleet is headed for the Korean Peninsula, and the stock market just hangs in there.” For now, analysts are counting on first-quarter earnings—which are expected to grow by double digits—to jolt the market out of its catatonic trance. Read: A conflicted stock market faces moment of truth as earnings loom But given the market’s reluctance to budge from its range-bound trading, it may take a bit more than stellar corporate results to resurrect stocks. That catalyst may come from the one area that has been defying expectations—the economy. “The one upside over the last 1-2 weeks are diminishing political expectations—which means there isn’t a big Trump/Ryan premium left although this makes economic data that much more important,” said Crisafulli. The “Trump/Ryan premium” refers to earlier market optimism fueled by expectations Republican control of the White House and Congress, with a House led by Speaker Paul Ryan, would help ensure rapid enactment of tax cuts and other elements of Trump’s campaign pledges. The Goldman Sachs U.S. MAP surprise index (see chart below) is at its highest since 2013, a sign that economic performance is outpacing expectations. But a weaker-than-expected March jobs report and other recent data are raising concerns that growth may be starting to slow. Data will be closely watched, indeed.

The company expects to price its 10.6 million shares in the range of $15 to $18 per share, with an overallotment option for an additional 1.59 million shares. At the maximum price, the entire offering is valued up to $219.42 million. The company intends to list its stock on the New York Stock under the symbol WTTR. The underwriters for the offering are Credit Suisse, FBR, Wells Fargo, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, RBC Capital Markets, Simmons and Tudor Pickering Holt. This company is a leading provider of total water solutions to the U.S. unconventional oil and gas industry. Within the major shale plays in the United States, management believes that the firm is a market leader in sourcing and transfer of water (both by permanent pipeline and temporary pipe) prior to its use in drilling and completion activities associated with hydraulic fracturing, which it collectively refers to as “pre-frac water services.” In most of its areas of operation, Select Energy provides complementary water-related services that support oil and gas well completion and production activities, including containment, monitoring, treatment, flowback, hauling and disposal. These services are necessary to establish and maintain production of oil and gas over the productive life of a horizontal well. Water and related services are increasingly important as oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) companies have increased the complexity and completion intensity of horizontal wells (including the use of longer horizontal wellbore laterals, tighter spacing of frac stages in the laterals and increased water and proppant use per foot of lateral) in order to improve production and recovery of hydrocarbons. Historically, the firm has generated a substantial majority of its revenues through providing total water solutions to customers. It provides services to major integrated and large E&P companies, who typically represent the largest producers in each of its areas of operations. The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for a few things: Up to $51 million will be used to repay borrowings incurred under our credit facility to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Permian Acquisition. $10.7 million will be used for the cash settlement of outstanding phantom units at SES Holdings. Approximately $5 million will be used for growth capital expenditures in the Bakken, including the expansion of the Bakken Pipeline systems. The balance will be used for general corporate purposes, including other organic and acquisition growth opportunities.

U.S. stock indexes edged lower in early trading Wednesday, April 12, 2017, weighed down mainly by a slide in materials and industrial companies. Consumer goods stocks were up the most.

Shizuo Kambayashi AP Photo 1 of 6 National April 12, 2017 10:26 AM Asian shares mixed as Trump talks down US dollar By JOE McDONALD AP Business Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story BEIJING Asian stock markets were mixed Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew a threat to declare China a currency manipulator. Trump's comment that the U.S. dollar was getting too strong helped push the yen higher, hurting Japanese exporters' shares. KEEPING SCORE: Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 1.0 percent to 18,362.43 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.1 percent to 24,296.85. The Shanghai Composite Index edged 0.1 percent higher to 3,277.88. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 retreated 0.8 percent to 5,885.50 while Seoul's Kospi added 0.4 percent to 2,137.05. Benchmarks in Taiwan and Jakarta gained, while Singapore and New Zealand slipped. WALL STREET: Industrial, materials and energy companies led U.S. stocks modestly lower before markets were due to be closed Friday for a holiday. That extended losses for the month as investors waited for a round of earnings reports to start this week. Utilities, phone companies and other high-dividend stocks were among the biggest gainers. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent to 20,591.86 and the Nasdaq composite index lost 0.5 percent, to 5,836.16. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 0.4 percent, to 2,344.93. TRUMP WATCH: U.S. President Donald Trump said he won't declare China a currency manipulator, dropping a key campaign promise. In a newspaper interview and a White House news conference, Trump hailed the rapport he developed with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in meetings last week that seem to have eased trade tensions. A declaration that China manipulates the exchange rate of its yuan to gain a trade advantage could have opened the way to sanctions. "They're not currency manipulators," Trump told The Wall Street Journal, saying Beijing hadn't been cheating on its currency for months. DOLLAR TALK: On the dollar's overall value against major trading partners, Trump said: "I think our dollar is getting too strong, and partially that's my fault because people have confidence in me." He added that "It's very, very hard to compete when you have a strong dollar and other countries are devaluing their currency." Those remarks helped push the yen to its highest level since mid-November, just after the presidential election. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After a few weeks of relative calm, the 'Trump hurricane' is back to disrupt the tranquility in the currency markets," Margaret Yang of CMC Markets said in a commentary. "I describe Trump's influence on currencies as a hurricane as it's both harmful and unpredictable. It is debatable whether Trump can have both a weak currency and massive fiscal stimulus at the same time." CHINA TRADE: China's export growth accelerated in March while import growth moderated to still-robust double-digit levels in upbeat news for Chinese economic growth and global demand. Customs data show exports rose 16.4 percent from a year earlier to $180.6 billion, up from 4 percent growth in the first two months of the year. Imports rose 20.3 percent to $156.6 billion, down from the January-February rate of 26.4 percent. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude sank 7 cents to $53.04 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 29 cents on Wednesday to $53.11. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed 5 cents, to $55.81. It lost 37 cents the previous session to $55.86. CURRENCY: The dollar declined to 108.84 yen from Wednesday's 109.03 yen.

Peacock, a top policy expert in the Office of Management and Budget, joined the Business Roundtable Wednesday and will lead policy work on the group’s key issues related to Trump’s agenda, including tax legislation, infrastructure spending and regulatory reform, the roundtable said. Peacock will recuse himself from lobbying OMB for six months, the roundtable said. When he joined the Trump administration, Peacock signed an ethics pledge required by the president that would’ve banned him from lobbying his former office for five years. The White House granted him a waiver from that commitment, the roundtable said. At OMB, Peacock served as a special government employee -- a temporary position that allows a person to work no more than 130 days in a year. Since JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief executive Jamie Dimon took over in January as chairman of the roundtable, the group has been taking steps to capitalize on the Trump administration’s pro-business agenda. Dimon installed as president Joshua Bolten, a former chief of staff to President George W. Bush who also worked with Peacock in that administration. “Marcus Peacock has built a distinguished record in Washington and is widely recognized for his expertise in budgeting, policy and federal regulation,” Bolten said in a statement. “I am delighted he is joining our team at Business Roundtable.” Dimon and Bolten are trying to change the reputation of the roundtable, which is comprised of about 200 corporate leaders. The association’s CEO-only membership gives it heft, but the executives have often struggled to reach consensus on key issues. The current debate over whether Congress should impose a border-adjusted tax that would apply to imports but not exports is a case in point because it has pitted retailers against manufacturers. The roundtable hasn’t in the past been known for engaging in bare-knuckled legislative fights. It doesn’t have a political action committee to direct contributions to lawmakers, nor does it endorse candidates. Both are time-tested ways to ensure lobbying results, and have been used successfully by other big business trade groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up Peacock, an engineer by training, got his master’s in public policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School and first served at OMB as a desk officer in the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs during President Ronald Reagan’s administration and the early months of George H. W. Bush’s. He was a deputy administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency under President George W. Bush. He has also served as a staff director at the Senate Budget Committee, a project director at Pew Charitable Trusts and a deputy director for policy on Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign. “We are seeing a new dedication by the president and Congress to get this nation moving again with policies that support jobs and economic growth,” Peacock said in a statement. “It’s an exciting time full of opportunities for the nation, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on these issues.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now One of North Texas' biggest mortgage companies is poised to relocate hundreds of workers in a new office in Lewisville. Nationstar Mortgage — which is based in the Cypress Waters development north of LBJ Freeway near Belt Line Road — is negotiating to lease a big block of office space in the Lake Vista office campus off State Highway 121 in Lewisville. The mortgage company would rent more than 240,000 square feet of offices now occupied by JPMorgan Chase. Chase is moving its Lewisville operation and many other North Texas office facilities to a new campus under construction in the Legacy West development in West Plano. Chase will move to its new $300 million campus late this year. Meet Mr. Cooper, an established mortgage company with an altered ego The move will leave behind empty space at Lake Vista, but special servicers of the debt on the buildings have been notified of the potential lease with Nationstar. A spokesman for Nationstar Mortgage confirmed that the deal is in the works. "We are planning to move some D-FW team members next year and are working to finalize details," he said in an email. Along with its Cypress Waters location, Nationstar also has an office in Irving. The big pending lease is good news for the North Texas real estate market. JPMorgan Chase, Toyota and Liberty Mutual Insurance plan to vacate millions of square feet of office space in Dallas' northern suburbs when they move into their new Plano campuses later this year and into 2018. The four-building Lake Vista office campus in Lewisville was built between 2001 and 2006 and contains almost 500,000 square feet. The two-story buildings surround a small lake and are served by parking garages. Commercial real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield is marketing the buildings for sale. Chase is moving workers from its Lewisville campus to the new Legacy West development in Plano.

The bank consortium expects to launch a full-scale version of the platform by mid-2017 with firms testing it in early 2017, a spokesman for R3 confirmed Wednesday. Current members of the consortium haven't committed to using it and aren't bound to it. R3 launched almost a year ago with nine bank backers to develop a settlement platform for the billions of dollars in transactions processed by the financial industry each year. It has since grown to more than 60 members, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citi. The group has acted as a sort of standards-setting body thus far as its fellow blockchain vendors have begun developing technology for financial services more publicly. Related Banks' Privacy Concerns Shaping Blockchain Vendors' Strategies Bank Consortium CEO Wants to Build the Microsoft of Blockchains Why Standards Would Aid Blockchain's Adoption Blockchains and Shared Ledgers: A Banker's Guide In September the firm hired IBM's former executive architect of banking innovation, Richard Gendal Brown, who has since been building Corda to record and manage important, financial agreements among institutions. Corda is just one element of the wider Concord platform, the startup's development project that will allow companies to run high-scale financial applications on permissioned blockchain networks across organizations and internally, according to the Wall Street Journal, who first reported on Concord Wednesday morning. Such applications could include trade clearing and settling, recording cash balances and asset registry and reconciliation. Pushing middle- and back-office functions to a cloud-based ledger is a major focus of the project and there will be various other elements of Concord like Corda, though R3 declined to give further details. Separately, R3 members BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Santander and UBS are also working on a blockchain-based transaction settlement project called the Utility Settlement Coin, an asset-backed digital cash instrument for institutional financial markets implemented on blockchain technology. The initiative builds on earlier experiments by UBS and blockchain software company Clearmatics, Deutsche Bank said in a Wednesday news release.

Partner Insights Sponsor Content From: Banking April 3 Corrected August 24, 2016 at 4:44PM: An earlier version of this story misstated the project for which R3 had filed a patent.

Participants will gather at 11:30 a.m. in Central Park, near Fourth and C streets, and walk at noon to nearby branch offices of Wells Fargo, Bank of America, U.S. Bank and JPMorgan Chase. Marchers will be joined by several people who have pledged to close their accounts with some of these banks. Participants are encouraged to bring signs. The banks targeted in this march are among those financing the recently completed Dakota Access Pipeline. Over the past year, the DAPL has become a symbol of environmental racism, violation of indigenous treaty rights and sacred ground, and human rights abuses.

DiStefano writes about Philadelphia-area enterprise, and the people and money that make it go.  More by Joseph N. DiStefano A deal disclosed: Why Philadelphia master Walter D’Alessio had to step aside Apr 12 Drug firm that makes wearables files for bankruptcy Apr 12 Paint wars: Axalta to pay $420M for Valspar unit, so Sherwin-Williams can buy the rest Apr 12 More from Joseph N. DiStefano Arrow icon Unilife Corp., a King of Prussia- and York-based company which is developing "wearable injectors" to deliver drugs to patients for pharmaceutical firms including Amgen, has filed for Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy restructuring in Delaware. "Operations will remain ongoing" as the company seeks either a fiscal settlement with its creditors, or a buyer, Unilife said in a statement. OrbiMed Advisors, a New York investment firm, has offered $7 million "debtor-in-posession" financing package to keep the company running for the next two months, until June. Unilife employs around 80, down from 160 last year following layoffs in early April, and 278 -- almost half of whom worked in R&D -- in mid-2015.  The filing follows months of review with Unilife advisers, including turnaround specialist SSG Advisors, of West Conshohocken, in which creditors, including OrbiMed and Amgen, failed to reach agreement about raising capital from new investors. Shares of the Nasdaq-listed company, whose major owners include clients of JPMorgan and Vanguard Group, fell below 20 cents on the news today. The shares had been slipping toward penny-stock levels in recent months. Shares peaked at $179 in February 2010, shortly after the company began trading at $100, and were still in the high $50s in early 2014. Unilife reported sales of a little more than $1 million a month in the last fiscal year, but has been burning a net $3 million to $6 million a month in expenses. "Chapter 11 is the best path forward at this time," Unilife chief executive John Ryan said in a statement.  Ryan, a former partner at Philadelphia's Duane Morris LLP law firm and ex-lawyer at Aramark Corp., became Unilife's acting CEO a year ago as founder Alan Dennis Shortall left the company. Ryan added that either "restructuring Unilife's balance sheet, or the sale of its assets as a going concern through the Chapter 11 process, will best position Unilife's business for future success." Unilife listed assets of $83 million and debts of $201 million in its bankruptcy filing. Unsecured creditors listed in Unilife's bankruptcy filing include drugmaker Sanofi Winthrop Industrie of France, which says it is owed $10 million, and Kahle Automation, Morristown, N.J., which says it is owed $4.2 million. Unilife says it is contesting both claims.  Unilife also owes $4 million to Morgan Stanley, the investment bank; $2.75 million to Kikma Pharmaceuticals of Jordan; and $1.1 million to Meco Inc., Mandeville L.A. The company also says Pennsylvania wants it to pay $300,000 in sales taxes, which it plans to dispute. In his statement, Ryan wrote that "Unilife's current capital structure was put in place to support our business model as a diffuse drug delivery system company." But now, "in light of the terms of the company's debt obligations and its inability to continue to finance the business outside of bankruptcy, we need to restructure the company's debt and equity or sell the assets as a going concern." Ryan also said he's "confident that our business can emerge from this process ready to focus on delivering for our customers and their patients" while "minimizing disruption."  Besides SSG, Unilife advisers include Philadelphia law firms Cozen O'Connor, as restructuring counsel, and Duane Morris, corporate counsel.

 What you need to know on Wall Street today Business Insider Apr. 12, 2017, 1:24 PM 582 facebook linkedin twitter email print Alfredo Mendez/Flickr Welcome to Finance Insider, Business Insider's summary of the top stories of the past 24 hours.   On March 23, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer was the keynote speaker at a Brookings Institution dinner in Washington, DC. There, he gave prepared remarks on regulatory policy and the Fed's response to the financial crisis, in addition to taking questions from the audience on the highly market-sensitive topic of interest-rate policy. Federal Reserve officials give speeches all the time. What makes this one notable is that it was closed to the public, Fischer's prepared comments have not been made available, and the fact the speech took place at all was not widely known. Fischer's secret speech shows the Fed has learned nothing from its leak scandal, according to Business Insider's Pedro da Costa. In Wall Street news, hedge fund manager David Einhorn just accused GM of sabotaging him. A top trader at Credit Suisse just quit to take a role at JPMorgan. And a Barclays exec who went to prison for LIBOR-rigging has broken his silence. "Traders have been served up as fall guys to protect these more powerful senior bankers," he told Business Insider. Ray Dalio, the founder of the hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates, is cautious about the effects of coming changes to fiscal policy and regulations. And there's not going to be another 2008-style crash, but there will be "a gradual noose tightening," according to Dalio. The creator of Wall Street’s "Charging Bull" is criticizing "Fearless Girl" for the same thing he once did. The United Airlines debacle continues. Here are the headlines: Man dragged off United flight breaks his silence, says "everything" is injured UNITED CEO: "This can never, will never happen again on a United Airlines flight" United Airlines ignored an easy solution before dragging a customer off the plane There's a simple economic reason why the United Airlines incident happened — and why it will probably happen again Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway lost up to $58.5 million after the United debacle A "Fight Club" meme slamming United captures a disturbing truth about airlines and people who fly coach Emirates is trolling United Airlines' CEO in a new commercial The White House is now required to address the United Airlines incident due to this petition by an 18-year-old student Meanwhile, in President Trump news: TRUMP: "We're doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations" TRUMP: "It's been very much misreported that we failed with healthcare" Carl Icahn made a big bet against biofuel credits right before advising Trump on regulations Trump's budget chief thinks fears about the consequences of a looming government shutdown are "blown out of proportion" In other news, retailers are filing for bankruptcy at an alarming rate that's quickly approaching recessionary levels. And we took a look inside L'Oréal's New York office, where employees of the $103 billion company can relax on a roof terrace and test products before they're on the market. The New York Auto Show is symbolic of everything dominating the car business right now. In related news, Lincoln just revealed an all-new Navigator SUV at the show. New York's Financial District has become one of the most exciting places to eat in the city — here's why. And lastly, here are the 28 most expensive homes for sale in the US right now. Here are the top Wall Street headlines from the past 24 hours. CREDIT SUISSE: A merger between 2 stock market behemoths makes a lot of sense - The London Stock Exchange's search for a buyer hit a wall last month when the European Commission put the kibosh on a merger between the London Stock Exchange and Germany-based Deutsche Börse.  Whole Foods shares jump on a report that Amazon had considered a bid - Whole Foods is up again Wednesday morning, higher by 1.5%, after a pair of analyst upgrades and a Bloomberg report that Amazon had considered a bid for the company last fall but never followed through.  Even doctors are getting priced out of San Francisco's housing market - Medical practitioners from anesthesiologists to surgeons occupy the top nine spots in the Bureau of Labor Statistics' ranking of the highest paying jobs in America. But by comparing doctors' annual median salary to the median house price in San Francisco, Trulia found that only 41.6% of homes are affordable. TransferWise CEO: 'If I was setting up TransferWise today, I probably would not choose London' -  The CEO and cofounder of $1 billion fintech startup TransferWise is calling for "action not just words" from the British government to protect the fintech industry in the wake of Brexit. Analysts think Synaptics is the company most at risk of being ditched by Apple next - Apple is increasingly ditching its suppliers and moving elements of its production in-house, and analysts have identified the company they think is most at risk of being "insourced" next: Synaptics. Delta's profit drops 36.3% - Delta Air Lines Inc on Wednesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and forecast passenger unit revenue, a closely watched revenue measure, to increase 1-3 percent in the second quarter, citing healthy demand. Mark Carney: Blockchain could 'transform' payments, clearing, and settlement - Bank of England governor Mark Carney thinks the technology first developed to underpin digital currency bitcoin could "transform" crucial parts of financial infrastructure. A payment business backed by Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey made $1.4 million in revenue for each employee last year - Dutch payments business Adyen doubled revenue last year to $727 million (£583 million), the company announced on Wednesday.

 This chart shows how Netflix's originals keep getting better and better Nathan McAlone Apr. 12, 2017, 2:32 PM 4,678 facebook linkedin twitter email print Netflix Netflix continues to invest billions on its programming, and that is paying off big-time, according to a new Morgan Stanley Alphawise survey. Netflix is set to spend $6 billion on content in 2017, more than rival Amazon, which JPMorgan estimates will spend $4.5 billion, and many times HBO. Though Netflix doesn’t break out exactly how much of that is going towards its original shows and movies, Netflix's CFO said last year that the company is moving toward a 50/50 mix of original and licensed content. What we do know is that Netflix will release a whopping 1,000 hours of original content by the end of this year, which would take you 41 days to binge-watch if you sat down and viewed it straight. That is a huge bet, and it seems to be working. How well? 33% of respondents to Morgan Stanley’s survey said Netflix had the best original programming of any streaming service or premium TV network. Not just good: “the best.” That’s up from 17% in 2014. This year, Netflix snagged its first Golden Globe in a major show category when "The Crown" won best drama series. ("Stranger Things" was nominated in the same category.) Netflix is also rolling out new show formats at a rapid clip, from its game-show debut "Ultimate Beastmaster," to locally-produced shows from regions around the world. That doesn't mean everything has been a hit. For instance, Netflix's latest Marvel series, "Iron Fist," was trashed by critics. But still, if Morgan Stanley's survey is any indication, Netflix's quality keeps going up and up, even in a "peak TV" world of 455 scripted TV shows in 2016.  Here’s the chart that shows Netflix’s progress since 2014 in the survey: Morgan Stanley This trend could be instrumental in driving subscriber growth, as Morgan Stanley found that original programming is rising as one of the top reasons Netflix users subscribe to the service. This is true especially around marquee original shows that come back every year, according to Netflix management. In January, Netflix CFO David Wells said that the company has found returning shows do a better job of boosting subscriber growth than brand-new ones. "If they are brand new shows ... if they are having to punch into the consciousness of the consumer, they do not tend to draw new subscribers in as great of numbers as some of our existing shows," Wells said.  SEE ALSO: Here are all the confirmed original shows coming to Netflix in 2017 NOW WATCH: United Airlines CEO apologizes after initially calling the passenger 'disruptive' and 'belligerent' Loading video...

(JPM, C) Trade of the Day: MINDBODY Inc (NASDAQ:MB) 3 Semiconductor Stocks to Put on Your Watch List View All Posts Earnings season is about to kick into high gear with some of the major financial companies reporting tomorrow. Investors have a lot to digest, so is this an opportunity or a danger? Source: via Wikimedia Results from the big financials are always key, but this go-round is even more important than usual as the market wrestles with the Federal Reserve raising rates – which should be good for financials — and yet bond yields remain stubbornly low. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), for example, has fallen 9% since its all-time high just six weeks ago but remains significantly higher since November’s election. While earnings on the S&P 500 are projected to grow nearly 9%, expectations for the major banks are actually low — a paltry 0.2% increase over last year. Keep in mind, though, that a low bar often leaves a lot of room for outperformance, which can move stocks higher. Let’s look at a couple of the most important banks in the world, both of which will release their results early tomorrow. Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) is expected to earn $1.24 a share on revenue of $18.07 billion. The whisper number — which is like Wall Street’s private estimate — is higher at $1.30 per share. I also think there’s a good chance C will beat the $1.24 consensus. The company has a large international exposure, and with the developed and emerging markets around the globe generally strong over the last quarter, this could result in a nice boost to the bottom line. Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) Q1 Earnings Preview Wall Street is looking for JPM to report $1.52 per share on $24.57 billion in revenue. Once again, the whisper number is higher at $1.59. In the annual report JPM released last week, the company highlighted rising sentiment against globalism and noted that it is preparing for the U.K. exit from the European Union. Because the major banks are global players, it will be important to see if the numbers show any effect from anti-globalism views. You should also watch for comments on interest rates going forward and the increasingly tense geopolitical situation. SIVB: A Next-Generation Bank While I have nothing against the big financials, they have already enjoyed a nice run since the election. And let’s face it, they’ve been around a long time and they are huge. I see better plays out there with more upside and less risk. One I like is SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB), the holding company for Silicon Valley Bank, which is positioned well to take advantage of higher interest rates in the months and years ahead, not to mention continued improvement in the U.S. economy. As you can tell by the name of the company, it’s located in Silicon Valley, which remains a hub of innovation and technology. This strategic location has been a big boost to the earnings and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. As a matter of fact, it is one of the few companies that have seen their earnings estimates increase over the last month, now up to $1.85 for the first quarter. 10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Bleed for the Rest of 2017 As with any stock, there are prime buying and selling opportunities along the way, and I use the charts to determine those. In the big picture, though, SVB is a next-generation bank that is helping finance tomorrow’s technology breakthroughs. That makes it a new way to play financials and a stock to keep on your radar for a long time.

Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, told Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray at a hearing this month that “the president is clearly justified in dismissing you and I call upon the president – yet again – to do just that, and to do it immediately. American consumers need competitive markets and a cop on the beat to protect them from fraud and deception. They don’t need Washington elites trampling on their freedom of choice and picking their financial products for them.” Carolyn Kaster Associated Press file Business April 12, 2017 1:08 PM Banks fund foe of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau By David Lazarus Los Angeles Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, was trying to be funny. It’s the only explanation. Otherwise, we’re left to assume that Hensarling was being the world’s biggest corporate shill and hypocrite when he accused the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of “abusing his authority.” i In a contentious hearing this month that bordered on outright abuse, Hensarling told CFPB Director Richard Cordray that “the president is clearly justified in dismissing you and I call upon the president – yet again – to do just that, and to do it immediately. “American consumers need competitive markets and a cop on the beat to protect them from fraud and deception,” he snarled. “They don’t need Washington elites trampling on their freedom of choice and picking their financial products for them.” Make no mistake: Hensarling doesn’t give a damn about American consumers, and he sure as hell isn’t pushing for a “cop on the beat” to keep banks in line. What he wants is to liberate his deep-pocketed corporate patrons from regulatory oversight that’s resulted in billions of dollars being reimbursed to customers. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Hensarling has been raking in cash from the financial sector since he was first elected to Congress in 2002. The top single donor to his campaign efforts over the years is JPMorgan Chase, which has contributed $106,686. The second-biggest donor is Bank of America, which has given $86,250. Hensarling’s third-biggest donor is the rest of the banking industry in the form of the American Bankers Association, which has given him $85,300. It’s part of the game.span Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray, in response to criticism he’s received from Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee On an industry basis, he’s received $1.3 million from commercial banks, $1.4 million from securities and investment firms, $1.4 million from insurers and $703,304 from finance and credit companies. And this is a guy with consumers’ best financial interests at heart? “Jeb Hensarling has a long, long list of contributions from banks and Wall Street firms,” Sally Greenberg, executive director of the National Consumers League, told me. “He and his committee have set their sights on the CFPB because the CFPB has been so successful at protecting consumers from being ripped off.” Since it opened for business in 2011, the bureau says it has recovered about $12 billion fleeced from consumers via illegal and questionable financial practices. It has overseen a revamping of mortgage rules, proposed new regulations for payday lenders and held dozens of firms accountable for fiscal misdeeds. I contacted the Financial Services Committee and said that a consumer advocate had suggested that Hensarling might be influenced by his industry ties. I asked if they’d like to respond. Sarah Rozier, a committee spokeswoman, first wanted me to name the consumer advocate, although why that should matter was a mystery. All she had to do was say, no, Hensarling isn’t influenced by the millions of dollars he’s received from financial firms. So I passed along Greenberg’s name and, an hour later, Rozier sent an email dismissing Greenberg’s organization as “a liberal group backed by labor unions.” Republicans feel that Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray has too much power and acts with impunity. They’re emboldened by a recent court ruling that declared the CFPB’s leadership structure unconstitutional. However, that decision will be revisited by the U.S. Court of Appeals. Instead of explicitly denying that Hensarling is influenced by the money he gets from financial firms, Rozier said, “Chairman Hensarling led the fight against the Wall Street bailout in Congress.” She also said that legislation proposed by Hensarling would impose “the toughest penalties in history for those who commit fraud and insider trading.” Um, OK. Hensarling and his Republican colleagues, in their first face-to-face encounter with Cordray since the November election, spent nearly five hours Wednesday treating the CFPB chief like a pinata. The tone was set early when Hensarling said he was surprised that Cordray had shown up, even though the CFPB director is required to do so twice a year when the House Financial Services Committee requests his presence, which it did. In his next breath, Hensarling told Cordray, a former Ohio attorney general, that he’d half-expected him to be in his home state running for governor, which he isn’t. “Perhaps the rumors of your political aspirations are greatly exaggerated,” Hensarling said. Republicans feel that Cordray has too much power and acts with impunity. They’re emboldened by a recent court ruling that declared the CFPB’s leadership structure unconstitutional. However, that decision will be revisited by the U.S. Court of Appeals. “This tyranny must end,” Hensarling said at Wednesday’s hearing, reaching deep into his muddy bucket of hyperbole. He and other Republicans want to replace the bureau’s single director with a more easily influenced committee, and want to control the CFPB’s budget, which of course would make it vulnerable to industry lobbying. After the Republicans had taken turns getting in their licks, frequently denying Cordray a chance to respond, Rep. Michael Capuano, D-Mass., said, “Boy, they really hate you, don’t they?” Cordray replied that “it’s part of the game.” It’s not a game. If the CFPB were derelict in its mission of consumer protection, lawmakers would have every right to demand changes. But the bureau’s track record is one of unqualified success – much to the consternation of big-money banks and financial firms. “Chairman Hensarling is furious at the CFPB because it’s working, protecting consumers and holding banks and lenders accountable for their actions,” said Christine Hines, legislative director for the National Association of Consumer Advocates. “He’s made it clear that his leadership on the Financial Services Committee is strictly for the industry’s benefit.” Of all House members running for re-election last year, Hensarling was the second-largest recipient of contributions from commercial banks ($274,900), topped only by Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., ($344,399), the Center for Responsive Politics found. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., seemed to put his finger on things when he told Cordray that last week’s hearing was little more than political theater. “It’s not really about any of this stuff,” he said. “It’s about the CFPB diverting money to the pockets of working Americans and not financial interests.” You can take that to the bank.

Department of Labor Delays Implementation Until June Posted on April 9, 2017 by Jerri-Lynn Scofield By Jerri-Lynn Scofield, who has worked as a securities lawyer and a derivatives trader. She now spends most of her time in Asia and is currently researching a book about textile artisans. She also writes regularly about legal, political economy, and regulatory topics for various consulting clients and publications, as well as scribbles occasional travel pieces for The National. Last week, the Department of Labor (DOL) formally announced it would delay implementation of the “fiduciary rule”– previously promulgated in 2016 and due otherwise to come into effect on Monday, April 10– until June 9. By that date, the DOL may elect to implement the rule as written, revise it, or torpedo it entirely. What is the fiduciary rule and why does it matter? Permit me to quote from my February post on this topic: [On February 3], Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum on Fiduciary Duty Rule, in which he directed the Department of Labor (DoL) to conduct an examination of the a new fiduciary rule, due to come into effect on April 10. This rule would impose a basic fiduciary duty standard on investment advisors, requiring them to act in a client’s best interest.  The fiduciary rule replaces the previous suitability standard, which consumer advocates have criticised for allowing investment advisors to provide conflicted advice, motivated by fees. This suitability standard imposes costs estimated at $17 billion annually on investors and depresses investment returns on retirement savings by a percentage point. Brokerages and insurance companies rely heavily on commission-based compensation. What Is the Impact of the DOL Action? The latest delay does not necessarily spell the death knell for some form of the rule.  As I noted in my February post– relying on reporting in The Wall Street Journal, “Procedures for complying with such a complicated framework are not developed overnight, and many investment advisers had already taken steps to conform theirs to the new framework that was slated to come into effect in April.” Further reporting from Saturday’s Wall Street Journal, New Retirement Rule Is Delayed, but Not Its Impact  further expands on this point, describing steps already undertaken by many investment advisers to comply with the rule as promulgated, under the assumption that the rule would be implemented according to the original schedule. When Trump issued his February memo, many measures were either in place, or in the process of being implemented, and these are not easily reversed: The rule would have required brokers who oversee $3 trillion in tax-advantaged retirement savings to act in their clients’ best interest. That is a stricter standard than many brokerages were using. After the rule was unveiled in April 2016, some brokerages moved clients from commission-based accounts that could run afoul of the rule to fee-only accounts. Among firms that disclosed their plans after the fiduciary rule was announced, Merrill Lynch— Bank of America Corp.’s wealth-management unit—and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. say they are still moving most clients to fee-based accounts. A J.P. Morgan spokesman said the bank would push back its deadline to track the Labor Department’s actions. Other brokerages including Morgan Stanley and Edward Jones have said they would keep some previously announced changes, such as lower commission charges and some sales restrictions. Other industry groups— including the Financial Planning Association and the National Association of Personal financial Advisors– supported adoption of the new fiduciary rule. It’s well and widely understood that the 1974 Employment Retirement Security Act (ERISA) framework is long overdue for an overhaul (and indeed, the latest reform efforts date to 2010). Will the Rule Survive? Despite the steps such firms have already taken, the current consensus is that the rule as promulgated will not survive– and will at least in some respects be watered down before it becomes effective, especially with respect to the legal liability provisions. Allow me to quote from a Forbes piece from last week, Under Trump, The Future Of Fiduciary Rule Is Uncertain As DOL Delays Rule: So where does the delay leave the future of the rule? The short answer is no one knows yet. Uncertainty remains king today. It is possible that the current rule that is set to “go live” on June 9, 2017, still survives. However, very few people expect the rule that was passed back in 2016 to ever see the light of day. Either the rule will be repealed completely, or the ability to qualify for an exemption to the rule will be significantly loosened, allowing more financial advisors to avoid compliance. Given the compliance steps already undertaken, I’m less certain than is Forbes that the fiduciary rule will be completely gutted.  Yet even if a  weakened version of the rule survives, its legal liability provisions– which allow consumers to sue investment advisers and the financial firms with which  consumers hold their retirement accounts for breach of the new fiduciary standards– will almost certainly be scaled back. Republicans control the executive branch and Congress, and they are extremely unlikely to allow any significant expansion in the ability of private actors to sue to enforce this or for that matter any other rule that would expand corporate legal liability to proceed. Recall further that congressional Republicans are intent on further weakening the already-listing class action litigation framework, as Russ and Pam Martens reported in March in Republicans Plan a Coup Today in the House, Gutting Established Class Action Law.  (This is a longstanding trend. One significant step was taken in President George W. Bush’s 2005 Class Action Fairness Act– which I should point out, was passed with the assistance of some Democrats, including the vote of a certain junior Senator from the state of Illinois. But what had a far greater impact on class action litigation than this statutory change was a series of business-friendly legal decisions that have seriously constrained the ability of plaintiffs to recover significant punitive damages– citing constitutional grounds.  Sadly, I don’t expect the newest Supreme Court Justice– Neil Gorsuch– to do anything that might arrest, let alone reverse, this trend.) I should mention two other areas of uncertainty.  First, as I mentioned in my February post, litigation challenging the fiduciary rule as promulgated in April 2016 is pending.  I won’t hazard a guess as to how these suits could proceed, except to say any of them could upset the apple cart– effectively preempting what the DOL would be able to do. And second, the 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Competitiveness act authorizes the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  to issue its own new fiduciary standards– which would extend beyond the narrow area of retirement accounts to cover brokerage accounts more generally.  The agency has yet to act on this authority. The SEC is unlikely to forge ahead on this issue at this point, since with only two of five sitting commissioners in place, agency activity is effectively stymied. That is particularly so on the issue of expanding fiduciary standards for brokers, as acting chairman Michael Piwowar has denounced the DOL’s existing rule, and would be extremely unlikely to support any expansive  SEC rule-making in this area (and even if the SEC were to proceed, it would take a minimum of years rather than weeks to develop new rules in this area.) Bottom Line So, for the moment, it looks like the DOL efforts on the fiduciary rule will remain the only game in town– and we’ll need to wait until June, to see what the agency decides to do next. 00000 This entry was posted in Banking industry, Guest Post, Investment management, Regulations and regulators, The destruction of the middle class on April 9, 2017 by Jerri-Lynn Scofield.

Reply ↓ Vatch April 9, 2017 at 12:46 pm This whole situation seems strange to me. Republican voters are more likely to have investment advisors than Democratic voters are, because the Republicans are, on average, richer than the Democrats (of course there are individual exceptions). A person won’t even bother to think about consulting an investment advisor unless she or he has a non-trivial amount of money saved. Republican voters should be up in arms contacting their Senators, Representative, and the White House switchboard about this. Why isn’t it happening? Is it hubris? Are Republicans too proud to admit that they can be tricked by an investment advisor? Reply ↓ Jim Haygood April 9, 2017 at 12:56 pm If by investment adviser you mean an RIA (Registered Investment Adviser), they are already required to follow a fiduciary standard. The Financial Planning Association supports the fiduciary rule. http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20170111/FREE/170119983/rias-could-be-ultimate-winners-if-dol-fiduciary-rule-is-repealed-or It’s mainly brokerage houses with their registered reps and (especially) insurance brokers who are resisting a fiduciary standard. Reply ↓ Vatch April 9, 2017 at 1:24 pm From the article: Independent registered investment advisers, which have largely supported from the start the idea of requiring fiduciary responsibility when managing retirement account assets, could be set up for a big win if the rule fades away or falls way behind the April enactment schedule. Are they required by law to follow a fiduciary standard? The article appears to indicate that there is some leeway. Reply ↓ Jim Haygood April 9, 2017 at 1:11 pm Republican voters should be up in arms Watching the R party sell out its base is about as exciting as watching the sun rise. It literally happens every day. To put it in slightly hyperbolic terms, the D party is quite honest and upfront about its intent to wreck the economy with war, taxes and over-regulation. Whereas the R party flat out lies about its sole raison d’être, running a government of, by and for Big Business. That’s the only reason the D party has soldiered on this long — typically it takes less than a year for the utter hypocrisy of a new R administration to become apparent. This time we got ‘er done in less than three months. ;-) Reply ↓ Jim Haygood April 9, 2017 at 12:49 pm “Dodd–Frank … authorizes the SEC to issue its own new fiduciary standards – which would extend beyond the narrow area of retirement accounts to cover brokerage accounts more generally.” Can you say “regulatory capture”? Wall Street’s “suitability rule” [meaning in practice that clients can be screwed silly with astronomical fees, when dirt-cheap equivalents are available] is as antiquated as the bucket shops that were shut down a century ago, frustrating ol’ Jesse Livermore’s most profitable wheeze. So-called “financial professionals” who want to continue fleecing serving clients under a suitability standard really ought to work under ornate gaslights in three-piece suits with stand-up collar shirts and ornate watch chains, to project historical authenticity. Ultimately the fiduciary rule will be instituted by informed customers, followed by the useless appendage of the SEC scurrying behind them on its tiny mouse legs, squeaking “Me too! Me too!“ Reply ↓ lyle April 9, 2017 at 7:30 pm But all one has to do is ask if the advisor is following the fiduciary rule and if not say thanks but no thanks, goodbye. If companies supplying 401ks provide information about the definition of a fiduciary and explain that one should ask, then it would also help. Reply ↓ Collin April 9, 2017 at 8:25 pm Bank of America/Merrill Lynch had planned to make lemonade from lemons, using the rule to tell clients “we’re forced into changing your retirement account to a fee based system by the gov’t”, with some ML brokers already securing contracts with their predominantly elderly clients for a fee based structure at 2.2% per year. I have personal knowledge of this. Reply ↓ K April 10, 2017 at 12:08 am Correct! It is terrible for the client. It will cost them more. Reply ↓ seabos84 April 9, 2017 at 11:04 pm I’m scratching my head. Since 1992, we’ve had 8+ years of Bush-Cheney-Heil-Herr-Trump thieving, and 16 years of Clinton-Obama sell outs to thieves. It is all VERY sim[le – the MORE rules & the MORE complicated the rules, the MORE crap they’re pulling. ta da. Why weren’t the bandits of Wall Street shipped more spun gold foam … ummm … ooops … I mean locked up for 10 year minimum sentences, decades ago? Bill & Hill & Darth & … wouldn’t have been living as large! Haygood at 12:49 nails it. I think Las Vegas is more honest. rmm. Reply ↓ MLS April 10, 2017 at 4:47 pm I don’t see why this needs to be an either/or situation. Give clients the option of enforcing a Fiduciary standard whereby the FA would have to abide by the rules and put their client’s interests first. These accounts would be charged based on assets under management and such fees would need to be clearly disclosed (including product fees, loads, 12(b)-1 charges, etc.). Some people, however, are savvy enough to make their own decisions and don’t need or want advice – they want execution of a trade and occasionally a conversation with their FA about a particular idea. Such accounts would not need to be managed under the Fiduciary standard and the FA could recommend whatever he/she likes, including investments with rip-your-face-off upfront and ongoing costs if they so choose. These accounts would be charged under the old structure on a per-trade basis. Trying to fit everyone into one box when they may not want it is what the government does because they refuse to accept that plenty of people are capable making their own, well-informed decisions in their own best interest. Reply ↓ Lyle April 10, 2017 at 7:36 pm Go a step further and do as Vanguard (at least) does no advice unless you ask for it, just an execution platform. Of course you could always decide that advice from a non fiduciary advisor is fit only for the bit bucket, not to be acted on for any reason. Basically you replace the FA with a website where you enter your trades. No human involved. There is lots of free advice on various forms of media. however you need to decide which makes sense for you. Reply ↓ JTMcPhee April 10, 2017 at 8:12 pm Of course, that formulation you suggest “normalizes” the kinds of moral-hazard behaviors that have turned “investing” into “exposed to risk.” Risk On! Glad you are a Promethean, maybe even successful, player in the casino — somebody has to win, and there have to be fools and suckers, muppets and mopes, to lay bets on the other side of all those trades. At least, if the present scammery is to continue… And of course it would not be possible to segregate the “rip your face off” FAs (and stop calling them that, it confuses the issue, call them “commission salespeople”) as a marketing division, at least, where you and “sophistcated” gamblers can get your bits of talk-it-over and pay whatever fees you can be boltered into, from actual sets of financial advisers who should be bound to that fiduciary standard. Which, of course, is a prudential standard, tested against that most elastic of legal standards, reasonableness. Even though there’s this definitional frame, A fiduciary is a person who holds a legal or ethical relationship of trust with one or more other parties (person or group of persons). Typically, a fiduciary prudently takes care of money or other asset for another person. One party, for example a corporate trust company or the trust department of a bank, acts in a fiduciary capacity to the other one, who for example has entrusted funds to the fiduciary for safekeeping or investment. Likewise, asset managers—including managers of pension plans, endowments and other tax-exempt assets—are considered fiduciaries under applicable statutes and laws.[1] In a fiduciary relationship, one person, in a position of vulnerability, justifiably vests confidence, good faith, reliance, and trust in another whose aid, advice or protection is sought in some matter.[2] In such a relation good conscience requires the fiduciary to act at all times for the sole benefit and interest of the one who trusts. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary , That “highest standard of care” does not saddle the fid with the burden of perfection, of course. “Future performance may not reflect past results.” And there’s this interesting discussion on the distinction between the “suitability” category, and the little changes that the Reds have now forestalled in implementation of regulation over FIRE salespeople. http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/the-smarter-mutual-fund-investor/2015/03/19/is-your-financial-advisor-a-fiduciary Maybe there are enough people who still have a moral compass that points somewhere other than in the direction of their own neoliberal me-first-screw-you interest, who can offer actual useful fiduciary-quality advice on how to place one’s money to ‘earn and honest return’ without the looting. I personally think the whole thing is part of the whole thing — that FIRE is what helps fuel the whole thing that is so erroneously called “capitalism.” But hey, what do I know? I got cleaned out, following “financial advice,” three times now — guess I am just not smart enough to be an “investor,” or wily enough to play Liar’s Poker… So like all losers, I get the sh!tty end of the stick… As Walter Cronkite used to say in closing, “and that’s the way it is.” Meanwhile, the short quick bits jump over the minuscule time gap between the market makers, and the Goldman basement HFT machinery. Ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching… Reply ↓ Ken April 11, 2017 at 12:25 am A fiduciary rule is very important, but not the DOL’s rule. It is a contraption. It is very expensive to implement to do little or nothing more than the rule the Registered Investment Advisors already follow. The DOL rule is so bad that some parts require reasonable fees, but those are yet to be determined…by future court judgements! Millions of dollars are being spent to comply with the record keeping requirements that is duplicating other record keeping requirements. Scrap the DOL fiduciary rule. Put in place the rule used by RIAs or something very close. Reply ↓ Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The bank had told some customers they would be transferred this month to a system letting them manage their own retirement accounts as the US Department of Labor prepared to enact the so-called fiduciary rule, which seeks to ensure advisers pitch products in savers’ best interests. However, in a follow-up letter to clients this week, the New York-based bank said that it is planning to hold off on the changes. Meanwhile, “your financial adviser can continue to provide you with investment guidance and assist with any service requests you may have on this account,” the firm wrote, according to a copy of a letter obtained by reporters. A company spokesman did not respond to a message seeking comment outside normal business hours. Broadly, the pending Labor Department rule says advisers handling retirement accounts must give advice in a client’s best interest and should not earn more than reasonable compensation. Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive memorandum directing the regulator to review the measure, a move that has left its fate in limbo. The rule had been set to take effect this week, but the Labor Department moved to extend a deadline for compliance by two months as it continues the examination.

 A Barclays exec who went to prison for LIBOR-rigging breaks his silence: 'Traders have been served up as fall guys to protect these more powerful senior bankers' Lianna Brinded Apr. 12, 2017, 10:17 AM 6,232 facebook linkedin twitter email print Former Barclay's trader Alex Pabon arrives at Southwark Crown Court in London on April 4, 2016. Reuters Former Barclays trader Alex Pabon was sentenced to two years and nine months in prison for his role in LIBOR fixing. He was released from prison in March 2017 — serving just under a year. Pabon spoke to Business Insider about how he is "happy to see some of the truth about LIBOR 'manipulation' finally coming out," which involves newly reported allegations that the Bank of England was instructing traders to "lowball" rates. He adds "low-level traders have been served up as fall guys to protect these more powerful senior bankers." One of the biggest financial scandals in recent history reared its head again when secret recordings of phone calls between two former Barclays traders were leaked this month. The transcripts suggested that the Bank of England (BOE) gave instructions to commercial banks to keep the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) low. Alex Pabon, a former Barclays trader who was convicted of LIBOR fixing in July 2016, told Business Insider that he is " happy to see some of the truth about LIBOR 'manipulation' finally coming out," and that Britain's central bank is finally being brought back into the picture. "Evidence of lowballing, the practice of requesting dishonest rates which involved senior bank management, the British Bankers’ Association, and the Bank of England, was generally not allowed at my trial," Pabon told Business Insider in a call from Houston, Texas. The BBA is the trade association for the UK banking sector. Low-level traders have been served up as fall guys to protect these more powerful senior bankers. "I spent almost a year in prison for requesting honest rates within a range at which the bank could actually borrow pursuant to acceptable bank and industry practice. Low-level traders have been served up as fall guys to protect these more powerful senior bankers. I look forward to the full truth coming to light." LIBOR is the daily measure showing the interest rate at which banks will lend to each other. It is used to set the price of hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of financial products.  The LIBOR rate was rigged by traders from numerous banks, who agreed amongst themselves to submit rates that were either higher or lower than the rate should actually have been. Prosecutors said it allowed them to make more money on trades. Pabon was one of the four traders convicted of the crime in July 2016. He was found to have asked for more than 30 changes to Barclays' LIBOR submissions even though he told the court that he knew changing the LIBOR number affected the valuations of swaps — a type of credit derivative based on interest rates. After being sentenced to two years and nine months, and ordered to pay £2,300 within 14 days, he was released in March 2017. Pabon served half his sentence and, because he is a foreign national, had another nine months shaved off when he was deported back to the US. He spoke to us from his home in Houston. Alex Pabon Now, more trials of other traders have transpired and secret recordings have been leaked that allegedly show the BOE wanted banks to report artificially lower rates. The truth is "finally" coming out about the whole financial scandal, he says. "This is not scapegoating but the focus has been on only one particular aspect of LIBOR (the setting of the rate). People don't realise that there is one particular aspect of LIBOR, that there is LIBOR low-balling and high-balling before and after these periods," he said. "People don't think about what the culture is at the time and why it was seen as acceptable to do what we did. It was simple. You sent a request for a LIBOR level. We say 'we have a position and we want you to consider this position' to someone at the same bank." "We work so hard for these [jobs] and we go to school and work hard to get the degrees, we compete hard, and it's hard to get into these trading positions. The last thing you're going to do is risk your career for a small amount of money. It doesn't add up. People just look at one small aspect of this case and not look at the whole picture." Barclays declined to comment on the details of this feature. Where it all started  Former Barclays trader Alex Pabon arrives for sentencing at Southwark Crown Court in London on July 7, 2016, with his wife Julie. Reuters Pabon was born and raised in Houston, Texas, and made his way into banking after a degree in industrial engineering at Texas A&M University. He received a Masters in Financial Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. His masters was a quantitative degree, which is like an MBA but specialising in the mathematics of finance. He then started working at the French bank BNP Paribas on the short-term interest rate desk in 2002. He was in charge of pricing financial products, and then moved into trading fixed income products such as swaps and forward-rate agreements. In 2004, it all changed for Pabon. He was recruited by Barclays, which was in the process of building its presence in fixed income products by hiring from other major investment banks. Pabon said, "you were just being pulled and poached to Barclays." Barclays wanted its new talent to be "profitable and replicate your business" from your previous place of employment, said Pabon. Other people were hired from banks such as Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs.  He moved to Barclays from BNP Paribas with his old boss, Fred Gourtay, and went into short-term US dollar trades.  "So everyone was new, there wasn't really a prevailing culture amongst the desk. There was not a set Barclays culture when I got there, as there weren't a lot of employees in that area," said Pabon. "But I did get the impression that they were a very aggressive bank." Part of his role was to set LIBOR — the wholesale interest rate in which banks lent to each other. This was only a small element of a much more complex job that saw him work from at least 6.30 a.m. until 5.30 p.m. each day. "The job is very busy. You're never really away from your desk. Even when you were out of work, you were never truly 'away.' I think that's the slightly unique thing with banking. When you walk in at 6.30 a.m., you don't have time to do anything apart from your job," he said. I did get the impression that they were a very aggressive bank "You did not go out for lunch for an hour. And I don't think I ever logged onto the internet while I was at work (for anything other than work)." Just two years later in 2006, Pabon left Barclays as he was "tired of the business" and "wanted to have a break." He said the nature of the job, where you are always "on" was "obviously draining." He took the opportunity to have a year off work and relaxed and travelled a little. He had a stressful time the previous year. His boss, Gourtay, had been "terminated" from Barclays following the loss of $40 million due to three bad trades the pair had made, according to Bloomberg's report of Pabon's trial. Gourtay has never been accused of wrongdoing for anything related to LIBOR fixing. Pabon remained at the bank after Gourtay left, he said, but after a year it was time to move on. "I originally didn't know how long I would take off but it ended up being a year. But then I started getting bored," he said. Pabon then went to trade for himself and did some projects here and there. A pedestrian passes a street sign in the Canary Wharf financial district, in east London. Reuters In 2010, he received his first "order" from the US regulator Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). An order from the regulator is a notification that it is looking into your historical actions at work for some reason. It stated that five years previously, he had possibly sent inappropriate emails related to LIBOR. He said he was pretty calm about it because, after all, "the order wasn't anything specific" and he sent so many emails during the time they mentioned, he didn't really know what they were talking about and did not think he did anything wrong. After some questions from FINRA, he continued with his life and said he did not do anything "substantial" until he took a job at a software company in 2012. Meanwhile, banks started settling with regulators in the UK and US over LIBOR fixing, and in turn public anger grew over bankers seemingly behaving badly. Politicians focused on the individuals, and public prosecutors were looking to put traders' heads on proverbial spikes. First the prosecutors came for the banks, then the traders  In 2012, Barclays became the first bank to settle with UK and US regulators for its "serious, widespread" role in trying to manipulate LIBOR, and paid £230 million in total. The Financial Services Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority's predecessor, worked with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice (together with the Federal Bureau of Investigation), and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Later, the Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, Lloyds Banking Group, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, and brokerages RP Martin and ICAP, all settled with authorities and paid fines related to their role in LIBOR manipulation since 2012. In 2012, when Barclays settled with the regulators, the authorities published highly embarrassing transcripts of trader conversations that, they said, showed that "a significant number of employees," including senior managers, colluding to manipulate markets and then bragging about it. Here is just a snippet from the reams of transcripts that the CFTC released to the public: CFTC The transcripts ranged over a few years. The CFTC and FSA said that the communications ranged from 2005-2008. Here is another snippet from 2007: CFTC And in 2008: CFTC And this is where Pabon says that people need to look at the whole picture and question why the traders would speak so openly about the way they were setting LIBOR and why, even after those traders left, the people replacing them would request LIBOR levels in the same way. "For example, when I left [Barclays] in 2006, Ryan [Reich] (who was later charged, tried, then acquitted) took my seat. He wasn't doing the exact same job [overall] but eventually he was trading in the exact same seat I was in and he was giving requests the same way I did," said Pabon. "I never even met him. So this second guy from Princeton, who I never met, is supposedly doing this criminal activity a month after I left, you've got to ask why and look at the broader view and go 'ok maybe these guys didn't understand what was wrong.'" You've got to ask why and look at the broader view and go 'ok maybe these guys didn't understand what was wrong.' Pabon said that he was merely following orders to set LIBOR a certain way. But, he stipulates, he was not doing it mindlessly. "It did not mean that your boss can ask you whatever he wants and you do it without room for thought, unless it was completely egregious and something where you go, 'what are you talking about?' You just do it," said Pabon. "Your boss is more experienced and you assume there is a reason [behind the order]. There is not much room in finance for more questioning of motives. The day after trading, you may have time to question it but there is a hierarchy and you take the orders and execute." Pabon did not think he did anything wrong and it was for this reason he was pretty calm about receiving that first order from FINRA. "The UK authorities never contacted me until December 2013 and I didn't read the press [about the LIBOR scandal unfolding]. But I did become concerned from the tone from the UK's Serious Fraud Office. The letter they sent me wasn't really information presented in a way that they were kind of looking and finding out what happened — it was 'we're coming to get you at some stage.' That's when I first started getting concerned," said Pabon. "But I thought that nothing would come out of it because when you looked at all the emails and evidence, they wouldn't charge us." Former Barclays employee Peter Johnson leaves Southwark Crown Court on March 3, 2014. Reuters But that wasn't meant to be. Former traders Peter Charles Johnson, Jonathan James Mathew and Stylianos Contogoulas were charged on February 17, 2014. Then in April 2014, Pabon, Jay Vijay Merchant, and Ryan Michael Reich were also charged. "I was living in Houston at the time and I remember getting an email at five in the morning from the attorney that I had been charged. I didn't have a strong reaction but my wife [Julie] was devastated. She is an attorney so her reaction made me even more concerned and I thought maybe I was downplaying this situation too much," said Pabon. From there, he had to fly over to the UK to be charged, which was stressful in itself but it was "a tough time" for his wife especially since she was pregnant.  "I obviously set my expectation low as I wanted to be prepared for the worst" Like dominoes,  a dozen banks and brokerages have settled with authorities since 2012. In the background, US and UK regulators and fraud offices were investigating individual traders that were involved in the whole conspiracy. Tom Hayes is perhaps the most famous of the total 5 LIBOR traders who were convicted. Hayes — who was initially jailed for 14 years in 2015, but had his sentence reduced to 11 years on appeal — was a trader making millions in bonuses as the scandal came to light and became one of the most recognisable faces of the affair.  After Hayes was sentenced,  Pabon and the other charged traders were still in the midst of their own trial of "conspiracy to defraud" in relation to LIBOR fixing in 2015. Alex Pabon in 2016. Reuters Not knowing how the case was going to pan out, Pabon said he and his wife Julie took the decision to induce her labour two weeks before his court date so he would be there for the birth of his son Christian. In July 2016, Mathew, Merchant and Pabon were convicted by a jury after an 11-week trial. The jury could not reach verdicts for two of their co-defendants, Stylianos Contogoulas and Ryan Reich (both were acquitted a year later). Pabon was sentenced to two years and nine months in prison, while Mathew and Merchant were convicted of four years and six and a half years respectively. Merchant's sentence was later reduced to five and a half years on February 22, 2017. Their former colleague Peter Johnson was also sentenced to four years having pleaded guilty before the start of the trial.  The week between the date Pabon was convicted to the time he was sentenced was "probably the worst week of my life," he said. "I spent my time walking around London and the whole thing was depressing — I was buying clothes I didn't want, I was buying clothes to go to prison. I didn't know what my sentence would be, although I did prepare myself for a six-year sentence, which I think was the maximum I could have got. I obviously set my expectation low as I wanted to be prepared for the worst." He was sentenced in Southwark Crown Court, and then sent to Wandsworth Prison — the largest in the country. It is a category B prison for men, which is for "those who do not require maximum security, but for whom escape still needs to be made very difficult." He was there for two months until he was moved to a category C prison. He said Wandsworth was "not a good place." "I was in my cell for 23 and a half hours a day, with just 30 minutes outside of your cell. You could either use that time to exercise or have a shower or make a phone call. But those 30 minutes were not scheduled so one time I was let out at 2 a.m. and I had to use that time to call my wife," said Pabon. Wandsworth prison. WikiCommons/Derek Harper "We didn't have a TV in the cell but we had a radio and I just listened to the radio and read for two months. I was, though, fortunate to have a good cellmate. But when I moved to a Category C prison it was better. I had a job and worked so I was busy." But Pabon said that his time in prison didn't fundamentally change him nor shape him dramatically. He said it may be "weird" but it was a lot worse on his family than on him. "When I was in prison, it was hard on my family as they don't know what it is like, they've never been — so their imagination can run wild. I don't take anything negative away from being in prison. It was difficult but I am not taking about any negative aspects," said Pabon. In late March 2017, Pabon was released. Under UK law, he could be released on good behaviour and serve just half his sentence. But since he is a foreign national and was deported by home, that shaved off another nine months. In total, he was in prison for eight months. The night he got off the plane back in Texas, his family threw him a party and then another one the next day. He spent the first week of freedom "enjoying being around family." "At the moment, I am just enjoying being around family and I am not thinking of what I will do next," he said when BI asked if he was thinking about what he will do for a job or go back to a software company for work. But while the prison part is over, the stress is definitely not over "I will obviously move on at some point but I am purposely not letting my mind think about it because when I do, I get stressed out about it. I know with a conviction, it will change what I can do now. Right now I am focused on time with my family," he said, while his two-year-old son Christian was laughing and playing in the background on the call. He also credits his wife for standing by him and keeping the family together during the difficult years.  "She has done so much for the family over the course of all this. It wouldn't have been possible without her. I'm sure she's happy now that I'm back and she's been giving until the end. But while the prison part is over, the stress is definitely not over. But she's grateful I'm out of prison."  Pabon is right though. This was not the end of the saga. The role of the Bank of England and the BBA during the LIBOR fixing scandal The Bank of England has consistently said it did not know until much later about LIBOR rigging and lowballing. However, a recording from 2008 uncovered by BBC Panorama appears to contradict the BOE's claim. A transcript of the secret recording between a senior Barclays manager, Mark Dearlove, and Barclays' LIBOR submitter Peter Johnson, states that Barclays had "some very serious pressure from the UK government and the Bank of England about pushing our Libors lower." The BBC claims that the conversation took place on the same day, October 29, 2008, as a phone call between former BoE deputy governor Paul Tucker and CEO Bob Diamond, on which LIBOR was discussed. Diamond and Tucker later told the Treasury Select Committee in 2012 that they only become aware of lowballing after 2008. Tucker stepped down from the BoE in 2013. Treasury Select Committee A Bank of England spokesperson sent the following statement to Business Insider: "LIBOR and other global benchmarks were not regulated in the UK or elsewhere during the period in question. Nonetheless, the Bank of England has been assisting the SFO’s criminal investigations into LIBOR manipulation by employees at commercial banks and brokers by providing, on a voluntary basis, documents and records requested by the SFO." "The Bank is committed to publishing materials relating to the SFO’s investigations into benchmark manipulation when it is appropriate to do so." "Until the SFO’s ongoing prosecutorial activity relating to LIBOR and other benchmarks has concluded, the Bank is not in a position to publish these materials." The recording re-aired two key issues: 1. It reignited the argument that traders had been instructed by senior managers to keep LIBOR down at the behest of the BOE. Both Hayes and Pabon told BI that they were not allowed to include this argument in their defence. Court documents that surfaced in November 2016 said that senior figures at the BOE reportedly knew about the rigging as early as mid-2007. 2. It seemingly contradicts evidence given by former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond and ex-deputy Bank of England governor Paul Tucker to UK politicians in 2012. Treasury Select Committee MP Chris Philp told BI that he will push to reopen an investigation into LIBOR fixing. Diamond said to the BBC, following the publication of the recordings: "I never misled parliament and I stand by everything I have said previously." Tucker did not respond to the BBC's questions regarding the same recording . Tom Hayes arrives at Southwark Crown Court with his wife Sarah on, August 3, 2015. Reuters Tom Hayes, the former trader serving 11 years in prison, told BI "the involvement of the Bank of England in lowballing LIBOR was a key plank of my defence." "The prosecution did not give me the evidence I needed to prove it and my jury were misled. It is my view that there should be an urgent public inquiry into the real LIBOR scandal: where central banks, politicians and the British Bankers' Association colluded to get artificially low LIBOR rates," he added. Hayes, who said he is still appealing, added that "traders like me should not be in prison — we were only requesting LIBOR submissions that reflected market conditions." Pabon thinks his case would have gone a lot differently if the jury knew about the BOE's alleged involvement.   "It is always easier to bring regulatory action rather than criminal prosecution against the firms themselves" In January 2016, former ICAP brokers Colin Goodman, and Danny Wilkinson, ex-brokers from RP Martin Terry Farr and James Gilmour, and Noel Cryan of Tullett Prebon all faced the jury and were found not guilty. Their trial lasted 15 weeks, but the jury was out for less than a day before revealing its verdicts. Cryan  said in a statement at the time: "It has turned our lives upside down. Realistically, we should never have been here. We feel we’ve been scapegoated. There are things to be answered but we are not the ones who should be answering them."  It has turned our lives upside down. Realistically, we should never have been here. We feel we’ve been scapegoated The Guardian reported that Read said the case had been a sham and that the SFO "didn’t investigate it properly and didn’t listen." Alison McHaffie, a partner with law firm CMS, also told The Guardian at the time that "apart from being acutely embarrassing to the SFO, these verdicts show how difficult it is to demonstrate criminal activity by individuals for this type of type of market misconduct. "It is always easier to bring regulatory action rather than criminal prosecution against the firms themselves. In future, the regulator will find it easier to pursue disciplinary actions against individuals for wrongdoing." The SFO director David Green said : "The key issue in this trial was whether these defendants were party to a dishonest agreement with Tom Hayes. By their verdicts the jury have said that they could not be sure that this was the case. Nobody could sensibly suggest that these charges should not have been brought and considered by a jury." Former Barclays trader Ryan Reich leaves Southwark Crown Court on April 6, 2017. Reuters Meanwhile, Ryan Reich, Pabon's successor in his trading chair at Barclays, and another trader, Stylianos Contogoulas, were acquitted by a jury of conspiracy to defraud charges at Southwark Crown Court on April 5 and April 6,  2017. During the trial, the defence said the SFO expert witness Saul Haydon Rowe was found to be texting banker friends while he gave evidence asking for definitions of trading terms, according to the Financial Times and the BBC. This called into question his ability as an expert. Rowe had also testified as an expert at Pabon's trial. The court heard how Rowe sent a text during Hayes' trial in June 2015: "Got caught out on a couple of points, eg where yen Libor futures contracts trade. Not my area, and I didn't get one sound bite in that I wanted to get." Texts included the following sent during another trial in April 2016 detailed by the BBC: ROWE: "I don't know the usual trades stir [short-term interest rates] people put on but I'm learning." TRADER FRIEND: "Trouble is, out of context it's actually quite hard to interpret. You get used to the methodology of the people around." ROWE: "Yes I agree. That's what I see on all my cases but it doesn't help when I have to explain a few emails and look knowledgeable." "You have misrepresented your expertise to the SFO and to the juries," Reich’s lawyer said to Rowe in court in March, according to Bloomberg.  "I suggest you have failed to comply with your basic duties of disclosure, and that you have concealed, rather than revealed, the sources of statements which you have presented as your own opinion." Rowe replied: "There are many suggestions. And I think I disagree with them all." Rowe also told the court "they are basic questions, so I could make sure I got the basics correct."  You have misrepresented your expertise to the SFO and to the juries He also said, according to the BBC covering the trial, that he had several conversations with the SFO about whether it still wanted him as an expert witness considering he had not been a trader of investments based on short-term interest rates. He said the SFO asked him to remain as their expert witness in the LIBOR trials.  The court heard that expert witnesses are obliged to disclose all the sources of information they have consulted  under the Criminal Procedure Rules 2015. Rowe was asked if he had read those rules, and Rowe said he did not know. Rowe said in a truth statement that a report titled "Libor and Interest Rate Markets, Products, Concept and Terminology" was his own work. That report was used in all four UK trials related to LIBOR fixing. However, the court heard that it was in fact written by his colleague. Rowe claimed that it was fair to say it was his work considering he had reviewed the work and could defend it in cross examination. A spokesperson from Turing Experts Limited, which is where Rowe came from, told BI: "We are conducting an investigation into these matters." I feel strongly that the result of my case would have been different if we had been provided full disclosure on the SFO's only trading expert, which was provided in the second LIBOR trial Pabon says he didn't know Rowe needed help with his expertise until after his trial. Rowe's testimony was used in all the SFO's LIBOR trials:  "I feel strongly that the result of my case would have been different if we had been provided full disclosure on the SFO's only trading expert, which was provided in the second LIBOR trial," said Pabon.  "He turned out not to be an expert in interest rate trading and it was suggested that he misled the jury in regards to his expertise. Additionally, in the second trial,the jury had actually been asked to consider whether as a matter of fact any trader deliberately broke the rules or caused false Libors to be submitted. Both of these points were new information to a jury that unanimously acquitted the traders in the second LIBOR case after only a few hours of deliberation."  The SFO did not return with any additional comment.

Follow @lisaabramowicz1 Facebook Twitter Email Print Share April 12, 2017 9:52 AM EDT SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL -0.24 At Closing, April 12th 32.81 USD CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORP -0.67 At Closing, April 12th 82.42 USD After years of packing on debt, more American consumers are struggling to pay their credit-card bills. Credit card charge-offs have been rising steadily, posting their biggest surge since 2015 in February. Lenders from Capital One Financial Corp. to Discover Financial Services have ratcheted up loan-loss provisions and reported increasing delinquencies. This has raised concern among analysts and investors alike, especially when paired with the fact that card loans outstanding just surpassed $1 trillion for the first time since the financial crisis. Tardy Payments Delinquency rates on loans at a variety of credit card companies have been rising Source: Bloomberg Intelligence The consequences could be significant for some lenders, especially private-label card companies including Synchrony Financial and Alliance Data Systems Corp., which both report earnings next week. These firms are likely to be canaries for broader weakness among consumers because they cater to subprime borrowers unlike, say, American Express Co. or JPMorgan Chase & Co. Unpaid Bills Synchrony's charge-off rates are higher than many of its peers and poised to rise Source: Bloomberg Intelligence Also, these lenders partner with brick-and-mortar retailers such as J.C. Penney and L Brands. Synchrony and Alliance depend on these retailers to sign up new credit-card accounts, and, as Susquehanna International Group analyst James Friedman noted, they tend to miss payments more frequently if retailers close stores near them or file for bankruptcy. These retailers are facing their own troubles, and a slowdown in sales may hamper the credit-card companies' ability to bring in new business. Indeed, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst David Ritter expects Synchrony and Alliance loan originations to slow this year. Meanwhile, charge-offs are increasing across the board, but the rates are higher at lenders that have a greater proportion of subprime borrowers. For example, about 30 percent of Synchrony's card clients have credit scores below prime, while competitors such as JPMorgan, American Express and Discover focus mainly on prime borrowers, Bloomberg Intelligence data show.  Capital One also has a significant proportion of clients with subprime credit scores, so it's worth watching this firm's earnings on April 25 as well. Bond investors have already started stepping away from Capital One and Synchrony as they grow more worried about their sizeable proportion of subprime borrowers, according to Bloomberg Intelligence's Ryan O'Connell and Himanshu Bakshi.  To be clear, this doesn’t signal imminent collapse by any means, for either the $1 trillion of credit card debt or these lenders. Loss and delinquency rates are still relatively low. Synchrony in particular has been exceedingly successful at expanding its business online, which arguably puts it in a better spot to attract younger customers going forward relative to bigger competitors.  But this consumer weakness is a new dynamic after years of households paying down debt and saving their money. Suddenly, investors are paying much more attention to how quickly lenders are increasing pools of money to compensate for unpaid bills. It doesn’t seem as if the creditworthiness of consumers is deteriorating at an alarming pace, but it’s concerning that so many people are failing to pay their bills when the economy is supposedly accelerating. Lots of Bills The amount of U.S. credit card debt has soared to levels not seen since the crisis Source: Federal Reserve It’s especially worrisome that credit card lenders are still aggressively trying to rake in new business. They want consumers to borrow more -- even if that means that more customers end up getting in over their heads -- as long as it means they get bigger interest rates and more revenue that offset increasing losses. This will only make the lenders and, more important, the consumers more vulnerable when the economy starts to contract. Credit card debt isn’t a serious problem spot yet. But it’s important to watch, with next week’s earnings offering clues into how quickly loan quality is deteriorating.

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 12, 2017 10:46am   Comments Share: Geopolitical concerns keep stalking the markets, helping so-called “safe haven” investments and putting pressure on equities ahead of the fast-approaching earnings season. The cautious stance that prevailed earlier this week seemed to continue Wednesday, judging by some key indicators. For instance, the Japanese yen reached five-month highs against the dollar. The yen is sometimes thought of as a safety play in times of investor fear. Gold – another so-called “risk-off” investment – reached multi-month highs as well, climbing above $1,275 an ounce. Concerns about U.S./Russia relations, Syria and North Korea, the coming French election, and U.S. politics may all play into investor caution. Though the markets ended Tuesday close to where they started, volatility continues to climb, with VIX hitting its highest levels since November. The rising volatility may reflect those same geopolitical worries, and could also hint at some trepidation ahead of earnings season. That said, the S&P 500 (SPX) on Tuesday managed to close above the recent pivot point of 2350, and perhaps found some technical support at the 50-day moving average of 2349, according to Briefing.com. We’ll see if support in that area can hold again today. Speaking of earnings season, Thursday marks the start of the quarterly bank earnings parade, with Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC) all due before the open. Last time out, these three put pretty good wood on the ball and helped cheer the broader markets. Q1 earnings expectations for the financial sector are high. According to FactSet Research, earnings are expected to grow at 14.8% year-over-year in the first quarter, the highest earnings growth projection across all 11 sectors. One question is how the continued strength in bonds might affect the financial sector. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields are stumbling, moving below key technical support of 2.3% early Wednesday. The bond market rally came despite a better than expected Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report Tuesday that showed 5.743 million job openings in February, a gain of around 100,000 from the prior month. Keep an eye on Friday’s retail sales report, which may provide insight into how the jobs picture may be affecting consumers. There isn’t much economic data on the calendar today, however. Trading has generally been pretty light this week, and that was the case Tuesday as well. With the markets closed for a holiday on Friday, people may be a little bit nervous to add on to their positions. Mark the Calendar Once Congress returns from recess, it faces a deadline with possible ramifications for the stock market. On April 28, the current continuing resolution that keeps the government running expires, meaning Congress needs to act quickly to keep doors open at national parks and federal agencies for the five months left in the fiscal year. In the past, shutdowns and the possibility of shutdowns helped create volatility in the markets, and if a shutdown did occur, it could mean delays in some key government economic data. But with Republicans in control of both the White House and Congress, a shutdown scenario seems less likely than back in 2013 when we last saw one. Even so, it could be prudent for investors to keep this on their radar and watch Washington to see if Congress can resolve a few key issues that go into avoiding any interruption. Marquer le Calendrier That means “mark the calendar” in French. And the date to watch is April 23, the French election. Normally, elections in France don’t tend to have huge market impacts here in the U.S., but this one is a bit different. That’s because it features Marine Le Pen, of the far right National Front party, who currently leads several other candidates in the polling, news reports say. This is only the first round, but if polls are right, it looks like Le Pen may have a good chance of making it to the next round. It’s early to predict how this might play out, but a strong performance by Le Pen could perhaps give the dollar a boost against the euro and bring back more memories of Brexit, when England decided to leave the European Union. Any sign of major political change in Europe deserves attention from U.S. investors, simply because Europe is such a huge trading partner and also a key player in geopolitical stability. Caught on Camera We've seen again this week how an incident captured with a phone camera and posted on social media can negatively affect a major stock. There’s not a lot an average investor can do to avoid one of his or her companies being embarrassed on social media, but that said, some sectors, by their very nature, could be more susceptible than others. These include sectors where operations are right out front for everyone to see and easily capture, including energy and consumer discretionary. There’s no sense in avoiding these sectors, which can be important in maintaining a well-diversified portfolio, but it’s also smart to be prepared for any possibility and also not to lose your head when something bad happens and the stock goes down. It might make more sense in that situation to look closely at the company from a broader perspective and see if it’s well positioned from an industry and financial perspective, and also watch to see what sorts of measures it takes publicly to avoid such incidents in the future. Sometimes a bad day for a stock can turn out to be a good wake-up call that helps strengthen the company down the road.

By ChristinaRexrode CorrieDriebusch Bank stocks have rallied since last November’s presidential election. Now, a lender created from the rubble of the financial crisis will test investors’ appetite for new bank shares. Cadence Bancorporation, a Houston-based firm that counts former J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.38%   Chief Executive William Harrison as lead director, will be the first major U.S. bank since last September looking to list shares in an initial public offering. How Cadence fares could serve as a proxy for what investors think of several key topics in the banking industry, including how firms will deal with volatile energy loans and how small banks will handle higher regulatory burdens as they expand. Cadence is expected to price Wednesday after the market closes, according to people familiar with the offering. While the IPO market has picked up of late, the act of going public has been relatively unusual for banks. “There are just a finite number of management teams interested in being public versus many more who are actively looking to…sell their company,” said Christopher Marinac, director of research at FIG Partners.

Not this time. With the return of inflation and improving economic growth, they are instead upgrading their 2017 estimates for earnings around the world. Positive revisions are outnumbering negative ones, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, which bodes well for equities in the coming months. The upgrades are uncommon, say JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Emmanuel Cau and Mislav Matejka, especially since consensus projections at the start of the year were already elevated. First-quarter earnings are expected to rise 15 percent for European companies, 9 percent for those in the U.S. and 16 percent for Japanese firms, the equity strategists wrote in an April 10 note. Despite the high expectations, JPMorgan sees scope for positive surprises in the upcoming earnings season, saying that corporate pricing, operating leverage, commodity prices and credit conditions were all supportive during the three-month period. “We think the earnings delivery will be significantly better than even the robust fourth quarter was,” the strategists wrote. Bank of America-Merrill Lynch says a global earnings upgrade cycle has begun, with the number of profit upgrades outnumbering downgrades for the first time in six years. Previous instances of the earnings revision ratio rising above 1 have flagged a stock rally in the the following 12 months on average, its strategists wrote in a March 30 note. While the earnings season has barely begun, early indications have lent credence to the forecasts. In the U.S., Delta Air Lines Inc. on Wednesday said a gauge of its pricing power would rebound after a two-year decline, while Germany’s Daimler AG boosted investor sentiment on carmakers after saying first-quarter profit almost doubled. Lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. report on Thursday. In Europe, the profit revival has been a long time coming. Analysts have raised annual earnings estimates for only the second time in a decade, UBS strategists including Nick Nelson and Karen Olney wrote in an April 12 note, as the increase in inflation boosted corporate revenue. Margins on earnings for Euro Stoxx 50 Index members have already widened from a 14-year low last July as consumer prices picked up, reversing a trend that’s been in place since the height of the region’s sovereign-debt crisis in 2011. An acceleration in inflation can only help. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

By ChristinaRexrode CorrieDriebusch Bank stocks have rallied since last November’s presidential election. Now, a lender created from the rubble of the financial crisis will test investors’ appetite for new bank shares. Cadence Bancorporation, a Houston-based firm that counts former J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.38%   Chief Executive William Harrison as lead director, will be the first major U.S. bank since last September looking to list shares in an initial public offering. How Cadence fares could serve as a proxy for what investors think of several key topics in the banking industry, including how firms will deal with volatile energy loans and how small banks will handle higher regulatory burdens as they expand. Cadence is expected to price Wednesday after the market closes, according to people familiar with the offering. While the IPO market has picked up of late, the act of going public has been relatively unusual for banks. “There are just a finite number of management teams interested in being public versus many more who are actively looking to…sell their company,” said Christopher Marinac, director of research at FIG Partners.

Traders may be reluctant to make significant moves amid lingering geopolitical uncertainty as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson meets with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The looming Good Friday holiday may also contribute to light trading activity, as some traders are already away from their desks. After coming under pressure early in the session on Tuesday, stocks regained some ground but remained mostly in negative territory. The pullback on the day came on the heels of the modest uptick seen on Monday. The major averages ended the day modestly lower but well off their worst levels of the day. The Dow edged down 6.72 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 20,651.30, the Nasdaq dipped 14.15 points or 0.2 percent to 5,866.77 and the S&P 500 slipped 3.38 points or 0.1 percent to 2,353.78. The weakness on Wall Street partly reflected geopolitical concerns on the heels of President Donald Trump's decision to launch a missile strike at an airbase in Syria. Trump also lashed out at North Korea on Twitter on Tuesday, urging China to do more to rein in its communist neighbor. "I explained to the President of China that a trade deal with the U.S. will be far better for them if they solve the North Korean problem!" Trump tweeted. He added, "North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A." The tweets from Trump come following his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last week. Trading activity remained somewhat subdued, however, with a lack of major U.S. economic data keeping some traders on the sidelines. The economic calendar for the week starts off relatively quiet but picks up in the coming days, including with the release of some key data while the markets are closed on Friday. Reports on retail sales, producer and consumer prices, and import and export prices may attract attention later this week. On the earnings front, financial giants Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) are due to report their quarterly results next Thursday. Telecom stocks showed a significant move to the downside, dragging the NYSE Arca Telecom Index down by 1.2 percent. With the drop, the index fell to its lowest closing level in two months. Semiconductor and trucking stocks also saw notable weakness, while gold stocks rallied amid an increase by the price of the precious metal. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures are rising $0.26 to $53.66 a barrel after climbing $0.32 to $53.40 a barrel on Tuesday. Gold futures, which jumped $20.30 to $1,274.20 an ounce in the previous session, are advancing $3.90 to $1,278.10 an ounce. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 109.56 yen compared to the 109.62 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Tuesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.060 compared to yesterday's $1.0605. Asia Asian stocks turned in a mixed performance on Wednesday as rising geopolitical tensions continued to spur demand for safe-haven assets such as gold and the Japanese yen. The dollar fell under 110 yen for the first time in five months and gold prices hit five-month highs after North Korean state media warned of a nuclear attack on the United States at any sign of American aggression. Chinese shares retreated as inflation data painted a mixed picture of the economy. While consumer inflation rebounded slightly in March after slipping to a more than two-year low in the previous month, producer inflation cooled for the first time in seven months, separate reports showed. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped 15.14 points or 0.46 percent to 3,273.83, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 225.04 points or 0.93 percent to 24,313.50. Japanese stocks extended losses from the previous session to hit their lowest levels in more than four months as the yen spiked to a five-month high. A government report showed that the country's machinery orders rebounded less than expected in February, further weighing on sentiment. The Nikkei 225 Index fell 195.26 points or 1.04 percent to 18,552.61, the lowest level since December 7th, while the broader Topix Index closed 1.04 percent lower at 1,479.54. Exporters Panasonic and Toyota fell around 2 percent each, while banks Mitsubishi UFJ Financial and Sumitomo Financial lost more than 1 percent. Electronics maker Toshiba slid 1 percent after the company warned there are "material events and conditions" that make it questionable whether it can continue as a going concern. Australian shares roughly flat after three sessions of gains. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index and the broader All Ordinaries Index closed marginally higher as a private indicator of Australian consumer sentiment showed consumers are more pessimistic about the future economic outlook and the housing market. Telecom stocks fell, with shares of Telstra Corp plunging 7.5 percent after rival TPG Telecom won a government tender for mobile phone airspace. Vocus Group shares lost 5.6 percent. CSL, which is facing legal action in the U.S. over a patent, slid 0.6 percent. Gold Miners Newcrest, Evolution, Northern Star Resources and Regis Resources climbed 2-3 percent as gold prices hit a five-month high on safe-haven demand. Europe European stocks have also turned mixed on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has edged down by 0.1 percent, the German DAX Index is just above the unchanged line and the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.1 percent. Geopolitical tensions eased somewhat after China's President Xi Jinping called for a "peaceful" resolution to tensions over North Korea in a phone conversation with President Donald Trump. Also, investors shrugged off political uncertainty in France after a new poll showed that far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon's support increased by 7 percentage points in the French presidential race. Daimler has advanced after the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars reported higher than expected first-quarter earnings, boosted by one-off gains and strong performance of its new Mercedes-Benz E-Class brand. Puma shares have soared after the German sporting goods firm raised its 2017 earnings forecast after reporting a 70 percent jump in first-quarter earnings. On the other hand, Dialog Semiconductor has fallen to extend Tuesday's losses after an analyst warned that its biggest client Apple could move business away from the firm. Tesco, Britain's biggest retailer, tumbled as much as 4 percent despite reporting better-than-expected annual earnings. On a light day on the economic front, data from Destatis showed German wholesale price inflation eased for the first time in five months in March. Another report showed that the U.K. unemployment rate held steady at 4.7 percent in the three months to February, the lowest level seen since 1975, in line with expectations. U.S. Economic Reports Reflecting a steep drop in fuel prices, the Labor Department released a report showing an unexpected decline in U.S. import prices in the month of March. The Labor Department said import prices dipped by 0.2 percent in March after climbing by a revised 0.4 percent in February. The decrease came as a surprise to economists, who had expected import prices to inch up by 0.1 percent compared to the 0.2 percent increase originally reported for the previous month. Meanwhile, the report said export prices rose by 0.2 percent in March following a 0.3 percent increase in February. Export prices had been expected to tick up by 0.1 percent. At 10:30 am ET, the Energy Information Administration is due to release its report on oil inventories in the week ended April 7th. Crude oil inventories are expected to edge up by 87,000 barrels. The Treasury Department is scheduled to announce the results of its auction of $12 billion worth of thirty-year bonds at 1 pm ET. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Unhappy Campers: The 10 Most Miserable Nations on Earth Feeling Groovy: The 10 Countries With the Best Health Care The Ten Largest Economies In Africa Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Food Delivery Robots Debut In San Francisco Lawsuit Claims CEO Said App 'Only For Rich People' Uber PR Head Leaving Vodafone Scraps Roaming Charges In 40 Countries Google Details Pay Methodology To Answer Charges Of Gender Discrimination United Airlines CEO Says Deplaned Passenger Was "disruptive And Belligerent" FCC Looks To Keep In-Flight Call Ban AMC Revamps Menu To Include More Meal Items Starbucks Testing Lunch Menu In Chicago Unilever Looking To Sell 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter,' Other Spreads Victoria Beckham Clothing Line Debuts At Target Airlines Improving Flying Experience, Study Shows AKRX Confirms Acquisition Talks, CBIO Plunges, Be All Ears For GERN FDA Approves 1st Drug For Tardive Dyskinesia, AGRX On Track, ITEK, AZRX On Watch Gainers & Losers Of Apr.10: CYTX, AXON, GERN, OMED, TXMD...

Trump said in a Wall Street Journal interview that the dollar "was getting too strong," though he also said he would like to see interest rates stay low. The dollar, which has risen along with prospects for higher rates, hurts profits at U.S. multinationals when it strengthens. "Markets don't like uncertainty," said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. "This just kind of added another wild card into the mix in a way, whether there will be actions taken to keep the dollar from strengthening further." Investors sought shelter in defensive shares and other low-risk assets. Industrials and materials were the biggest drags on the market along with financials, while utilities, staples and telecommunications gave the S&P 500 its biggest lift. The S&P financial index .SPSY was down 0.9 percent a day ahead of results from three major banks in what will mark the start of the corporate earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings to have risen 10 percent for all S&P 500 companies in the first quarter, Thomson Reuters data shows. The materials .SPLRCM and industrials .SPLRCI indexes both ended more than 1 percent lower on the day. In a sign that further weakness may be ahead, the S&P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 8. The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, Wall Street's fear gauge, extended recent gains, a day after it closed above 15 for the first time since the election. Rising U.S. tensions with Russia, North Korea and Syria after U.S missile strikes in Syria last week and the moving of U.S. warships toward the Korean Peninsula have kept investors cautious. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI closed down 59.44 points, or 0.29 percent, to 20,591.86, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 8.85 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,344.93 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 30.61 points, or 0.52 percent, to 5,836.16. Investors are concerned these developments could distract Trump from pursuing pro-business policies such as tax cuts, simpler regulations and higher infrastructure spending, promises that have powered Wall Street to record highs since his election in November. Wells Fargo, Citigroup (C.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N) are due to report results on Thursday, the last trading day of the week ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) closed down 0.5 percent at $45.05 despite a better-than-expected quarterly profit and an upbeat forecast for current-quarter passenger unit revenue. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 51 new highs and 42 new lows. About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Now, there is a hybrid of the two, where companies are writing their own stories, creating their own TV programs and putting "native" posts on social media. These are all labeled as being paid for by a brand, but they look like editorial content. Companies in the U.S. are so keen on this type of marketing that 73 percent of marketers said creating more engaging content was a top priority for 2016, according to statistics from the Content Marketing Institute, which surveyed more than 260 people online. And they are spending big too; consultancy BCG expects US marketers to spend $25 billion on branded content in 2019. But the one problem with branded content is that it can be hard to understand how consumers feel about it and what competitors are doing. Enter Knowledge, a new search engine for branded content, from technology company Knotch, which counts GE and JP Morgan Chase among its clients. Knotch Businesses can search for competitors' content online "The question is: How much content is too much content?" said Knotch founder and Chief Executive Anda Gansca, speaking to CNBC by phone. "Especially in an age where we are all oversaturated with entertainment and information, branded content is just adding to that. So we started thinking what type of product could we build to answer that question." The new tool recognizes pieces of branded content on publishers' websites, collects them together and lets marketers search through them. "You can actually create a competitive group - here are the brands competing for the same demographic that I'm after, I'm going to follow them and see how much content are they pushing out a day, a week, a month, who are they working with, what creative themes are they focused on, and what is the cadence of content," Gansca added. Businesses will also be able to tell which publishers brands prefer to work with, as well as whether the articles are part of a syndication deal or have been written specifically for a particular site. Knotch Knotch provides a 'search engine' for branded content But the issue of measurement goes beyond comparing a business to its competitors. How does a brand know whether its content is being read or enjoyed? Publishers may produce figures, but this isn't enough, according to Gansca. "There are a lot of transparency issues around data reporting, namely that a lot of the distribution channels are basically grading their own homework, the data reporting was less up to them. So there was a need around data [marketers] can trust," she said. Reporting and transparency are currently big issues in the marketing industry, with online ad fraud (where bots, rather than humans "see" or click on ads) estimated to cost businesses $16.4 billion this year. Procter and Gamble Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard has been particularly outspoken about how the company had sometimes been distracted by new digital marketing methods which didn't always work, and has told media suppliers they have until the end of the year to become "transparent, clean and productive." To help companies understand the impact of their content online, Knotch created a product called Measurement, a research method to understand how people reading articles respond to them, so brands can collect "sentiment data". One company using Knotch's tools is GE, a business that has invested in its own content platform, GE Reports (a recent post from @GE_Reports is below), which includes articles both about what the company is doing ("Lettuce see the future: LED lighting helps farming go high-tech in Japan," was read by more than a million people, according to agency Contently), as well as pieces such as "Five coolest things on earth this week." TWEET Chief creative officer Andy Goldberg says this investment in content is part of GE's long-term plan. "GE is investing in branded content because we believe storytelling around innovation is one of the most meaningful and relatable ways to convey our leadership. This is especially important as GE transforms into a digital industrial company. "And, as this transformation is our critical mission, overall sentiment and understanding is what we are most curious to measure," he told CNBC via email. It is using Knotch's technology to "understand the value of paid content and make smarter, more informed investment decisions," he added. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

The United States launched missiles at a Syrian airfield last week to retaliate a deadly chemical attack on civilians. The strikes pushed President Donald Trump, who came to power in January calling for warmer ties with Syria's ally Russia, and his administration into confrontation with Moscow. Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping called on the U.S. for a peaceful resolution with North Korea, which has warned it would launch a nuclear attack if provoked by the United States, as a U.S. Navy strike group headed toward the western Pacific. Investors are closely watching the quarterly earnings to support lofty valuations on Wall Street following a rally fueled by bets on Trump's pro-growth agenda. The big banks unofficially kick-off the season on Thursday, with results due from JPMorgan , Citigroup and Wells Fargo. "It would be very important what they (banks) offer as forecast because stock prices imply better times ahead and investors are looking for assurances and positive forecasts to be issued," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. Dow e-minis were down 19 points, or 0.09 percent, at 8:17 a.m. ET (1217 GMT), with 28,815 contracts changing hands. S&amp;P 500 e-minis were down 4.25 points, or 0.18 percent, with 177,798 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 9.5 points, or 0.18 percent, on volume of 30,660 contracts. Gold prices were flat but remained close to the highest level hit in November. The dollar index was also little changed, while oil prices edged up slightly. Comments from Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan will be parsed for clues on interest rate hikes and the Fed's plans to trim its balance sheet. Kaplan is expected to speak at 10:00 a.m. ET. (1300 GMT) Shares moving premarket included Whole Foods, which rose 2.8 percent to $34.50 after Bloomberg reported overnight that Amazon.com had mulled buying the organic food chain last year. Delta Air Lines was up 2.8 percent at $46.55, following a quarterly profit that beat analysts' expectation.

X Barclays: What happens when you go after the whistleblower Decades of corporate scandals have taught us the importance of empowering whistleblowers about 20 hours ago Brooke Master The British authorities are investigating Barclays and its chief executive, James E. Staley, after he admitted to trying to learn the identity of a whistleblower last year.         Barclays’ chief executive Jes Staley is a supportive colleague and friend. Since starting work in December 2015, he has brought in at least four senior executives who had worked with him at JPMorgan Chase, to help revamp the UK bank. Then in June, when Barclays received two anonymous letters making unpleasant allegations of what the bank describes as “a personal nature” about one of those hires, Mr Staley went a good deal further. Believing the letters to be an “unfair attack”, he asked Barclays’ security team to track down the author, but was told that was not appropriate because the bank’s compliance department had logged the letters as potential whistleblowing. A month later he went back and asked if the issue had been resolved. Exactly what Mr Staley was told is disputed, but he called in the hounds again and this time they tapped US law enforcement for help. That episode, which came to light this week, may make Mr Staley a very good friend, but it also makes him a very bad chief executive. Decades of corporate scandals - from Enron’s 2001 collapse, to Wells Fargo’s fake accounts scheme - have taught us the importance of empowering whistleblowers. When companies start to go off the rails, whether through accounting shenanigans or overseas bribery, ordinary employees, customers and suppliers are often among the first to see it. If they are taken seriously, misconduct can be caught early, before it becomes endemic. But it requires courage for whistleblowers to act on what they see, especially in the UK. A recent survey by the Ethics Resource Centre of employees in 13 countries found that 63 per cent of British employees who reported wrongdoing experienced retaliation, second only to India and far worse than the 36 per cent global average. Barclays, of all places, should be particularly solicitous of those who want to expose wrongdoing. The bank is notorious for its constant legal tangles. It has admitted attempting to rig three separate sets of benchmarks - Libor, foreign exchange and Isdafix - and has been forced to eject chief executive Bob Diamond in the process. At a time when most banks have put their legal woes behind them, it is still being probed by the UK over a 2008 capital-raising drive and is fighting US allegations of mortgage securities mis-selling. Against that background, Mr Staley’s decision to investigate the anonymous letter writer sends exactly the wrong message. Even if the claims were as unfair as he believed, bringing the full power of Barclays’ security team and US law enforcement to bear was inappropriate and counterproductive. “Healthy organisations encourage their employees to speak up and they focus on the misconduct reported, not the person who reported it,” says Jordan Thomas, a lawyer who helped develop the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s whistleblower programme and now represents whistleblowers. “If your people don’t trust you, they won’t talk to you.” To be fair, the Barclays board has taken the matter seriously. When a second whistleblower alerted them to Mr Staley’s yen for detection, they immediately ordered an investigation, reprimanded Mr Staley and reported him to the UK banking watchdogs. They have also promised a “very significant” cut to his bonus once the regulatory probes are complete. “I am personally very disappointed and apologetic that this situation has occurred,” chairman John McFarlane said in a statement. The bank has also promised to review its whistleblowing programme, even as it cut ties with the technology company that was set to provide an anonymous internal chat service that could be used to report issues. Mr Staley’s supporters argue that he apologised and took his medicine, and that he should be allowed to get on with reviving Barclays’ sagging investment bank. The board seems to agree - it declared that the attempted witch hunt was an honest mistake and the CEO still has their “unanimous confidence”. The board was probably seeking to reassure investors about Mr Staley at a time when he has had some success in bolstering Barclays’ performance. In this, they seem to have succeeded: Barclays shares are basically flat. But the board’s instant declaration of unconditional support also suggests that its support for anonymous tipsters only goes to so far. Barclays employees can take a hint. If they are considering reporting information that might threaten the chief executive - or his friends - they are likely to think again. And that is likely to be much worse for investors in the long run. - (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017)       Topics: Bob Diamond Jes Staley John Mcfarlane Jordan Thomas Cork Harbour Alliance for a Safe Environment Exchange Commission Barclays Enron Wells Fargo India United Kingdom United States Read More Credit Suisse may seek full Irish licence as Brexit looms It’s five years since the O’Reilly family lost control of INM – is the company any better off?

"I would doubt that would happen," Stephen Schwarzman, chairman of Blackstone Group, told Bloomberg Television in an interview, when asked about China being designated in the Treasury Department's next foreign-exchange report. Schwarzman chairs the president's strategy and policy forum, a panel of business leaders that includes JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock CEO Laurence Fink. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The Treasury is expected to release its first currency report under Trump this month. The department is required by law to report to Congress twice a year on whether America's major trading partners are gaming their currencies. The last report, in October, included China and five other nations on a watch list of countries at risk of engaging in unfair foreign-exchange practices, but it didn't name any country a manipulator -- a step the U.S. hasn't taken since 1994. Sparing China from being labeled a currency manipulator would be the latest indication that Trump's rhetoric on trade as the Republican candidate last year was harsher than the policies he's establishing as president. The administration has yet to launch renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, another step Trump promised during the campaign. Nor has the U.S. imposed punitive tariffs on foreign countries or U.S. companies that move jobs offshore, as Trump has threatened. Trump accused China during the election campaign of manipulating its currency to gain the upper hand in trade. But he didn't follow through on his promise to label the country a manipulator on his first day in office, and Trump didn't mention the issue publicly during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to the U.S. this month. After the meeting, the White House announced a 100-day plan to discuss re-balancing the bilateral trade relationship. Schwarzman chaired the second meeting of Trump's advisory panel on Tuesday at the White House. Schwarzman said China didn't come up Tuesday in a meeting with the president and five Cabinet secretaries. The Treasury created a new monitoring list in April after Congress passed a law requiring closer scrutiny of foreign-exchange regimes. Treasury officials developed three criteria to decide if countries are being unfair: an economy having a trade surplus with the U.S. above $20 billion; having a current-account surplus amounting to more than 3 percent of its gross domestic product; repeatedly depreciating its currency by buying foreign assets equivalent to 2 percent of output over the year. Meeting all three would trigger action by the president to enter discussions with the country and seek potential penalties. In the October report, the Treasury noted that China has actually been intervening in exchange markets to prop up the yuan. While the currency has dropped 6.5 percent against the dollar this year, it has appreciated nearly 17 percent since 2005, when China loosened its peg against the greenback. "If you just let the Treasury guys do their jobs, it's unlikely" the U.S. will name China a manipulator, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the president of the American Action Forum and former chief economist to George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. "If you look at the recent data, it's inconsistent with currency manipulation." The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, told reporters in a conference call on Tuesday that Trump should designate China a currency manipulator and pressure Chinese leaders to end subsidies for aluminum and other commodities. Trump hasn't done enough to crack down on China's theft of intellectual property from U.S. businesses or force the country to more fully open its markets to foreign competition. "For far too long, China taken us to the cleaners as far as the economy," Schumer, of New York, said. "I can't think of a single job they have saved by a single action against China." The Treasury may toughen its currency criteria so the yuan is found to be out of step with economic fundamentals, said David Dollar, a former Treasury official and China expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Such a finding might put pressure on China to avoid letting the yuan fall too far, without accusing the government of manipulation. "The manipulator language suggests you're directly intervening," he said. "The language of misalignment is that you're far away from some kind of long-run equilibrium."   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Utah Jazz: Gregg Popovich misses his drinking buddy, Boris Diaw Once free despite his sex assault convictions, it's prison for former Mormon bishop Jazz polish off the Spurs but lose out on first-round home-court advantage BYU basketball: Piano performances by two players, touching farewells highlight annual banquet Utah brothers launch billboard campaign to send message to Chaffetz ELEVATE You may be procrastinating on your taxes if...   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Traffic Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

The editor and publisher of Gartman Letter observed that years spent on the trading floor has taught him that, "stuff goes down a whole lot faster than stuff goes up." Explaining on CNBC Wednesday why this week's spike in the VIX index (measure of equity market volatility) didn't precipitate a fall in major U.S. equity markets, Gartman noted that the assumption that volatility only measured downside risk was flawed and that markets were beginning to acknowledge that. "What we're seeing now is the VIX beginning to understand you can have volatility in both directions," he said, clarifying that the VIX is not a measure of bearishness or bullishness but volatility. "There are geopolitical circumstances out there that are very disturbing … And I think the market wants to price that in," he added, referring to the VIX's 17 percent move higher in the first two trading days of this week. show chapters Hopes for banks to earn superior returns are being dashed: Gartman    Wednesday, 12 Apr 2017 | 1:11 AM ET | 02:27 U.S. equity market participants are very focused this week on the first-quarter earnings reports of major banks, many of which will be rolled out over Wednesday and Thursday. Following last quarter's bumper set of results for many of the financial institutions and a strong performance for U.S. financials since the election of President Donald Trump last November (despite a slight pullback in the past month), expectations among many investors are high for another robust set of results. Gartman, however, says he cannot share the wild optimism. "Everybody wants to continue to believe that JPMorgan will surprise us again as demonstrably again as they surprised us with their previous quarter's earnings and I think that the chances of that happening are slim to none," he soberly opined. show chapters The yield curve has flattened: Gartman    Wednesday, 12 Apr 2017 | 1:11 AM ET | 01:13 Gartman pointed out that recently banks have been dealt the opposite card to what they need – above all, a flattening yield curve with longer-term rates falling and shorter-end rates rising rather than a steepening curve which allows them to secure margin pick-up. "These are all things which work to the detriment not to the benefit of the banking system and I think the chance of a surprise for any of the major banks is minimal at best," Gartman added. The long-term trader also highlighted that the purpose of banks is to lend to businesses – an activity seemingly stuck in a rut, according to the latest disappointing data from February on U.S. loan growth. "Business lending is almost negative, it's barely, barely higher and that's a real problem for the banks," he said, adding, "loan growth is very minimal at best and I think that has to weigh upon prices." All told, Gartman's outlook for financials lacks optimism. Juan Manuel Serrano Arce | Getty Images "Life in a flat yield curve, life in an inverted yield curve is awful. Life in an increasingly positively sloped yield curve is much more pleasant - let us hope that that happens. I think the odds of that happening are relatively minimal, however," he concluded. Not everyone shares the trader's pessimism, however, with analysts from Jefferies in a recent research piece acknowledging the difficulties ahead for banks but articulating more bright spots. "While turbulence in D.C. policy-making has taken a bite out of the post-election bank rally, investor sentiment is still relatively positive with another rate hike in the books and more likely on the way. Loan growth is the first quarter soft spot and biggest forward wildcard, but we believe full-year loan growth guides should remain intact for now on hopes for a better second half," said the research. The analysts were also keen to emphasize the challenges ahead were more likely to weigh on smaller and mid-tier banks rather than the largest, global institutions. "While sluggish loan growth in the first quarter is likely to impact the majority of banks to some extent, large-cap banks could benefit from offsets such as stronger investment banking fees and trading revenues. Mortgage production is expected to decline significantly versus the fourth quarter but servicing should be stronger - which also tends to help the larger banks," the note added.

By Karthick Arvinth Updated April 12, 2017 06:52 BST Barclays chief executive Jes Staley has received a formal reprimand from the bank's boardReuters Barclays's head of internal security is to be investigated by the bank's board over the whistle-blower scandal that has engulfed its chief executive Jes Staley, according to reports. The BBC says Troels Oerting assisted Staley in his attempts to unmask the author of an anonymous letter that was sent to the bank last year. The letter reportedly raised questions about the past conduct of Tim Main, a senior employee who was hired by Barclays in early 2016. Main was a former colleague of Staley, with the pair having worked together for many years at US investment bank JP Morgan. Staley has been formally reprimanded for his actions by Barclays and is likely to be hit with a financial penalty in excess of £1m ($1.3m). The Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority have also opened their own investigations into the whistleblower case, along with New York's Department of Financial Services. In a statement released on 10 April, Barclays said Staley, 60, had "honestly, but mistakenly, believed that it was permissible to identify the author of the letter". In an internal letter to staff seen by the Guardian newspaper, Staley explained that he got personally involved in the matter as he believed that Mann was being "maliciously smeared". "One of our colleagues was the subject of an unfair personal attack sent via anonymous letters addressed to members of the board and a senior executive at Barclays," the letter reportedly said. "The allegations related to personal issues from many years ago, and the intent of the correspondents in airing all of this was, in my view, to maliciously smear this person. "My hope was that if we found out who was sending these letters we could try and get them to stop the harassment of a person who did not deserve that treatment. "Nevertheless, I realise that I should simply have the compliance function handle this matter, as they were doing. This was a mistake on my part and I apologise for it."

X The Barclays boss and the whistleblower London Briefing: Punishment needed if Threadneedle Street codes to be enforced Wed, Apr 12, 2017, 06:00 Updated: about 19 hours ago Fiona Walsh         Is Jes Staley a kind, caring boss who went the extra mile to protect a colleague from unwarranted smears? Or is he an arrogant ex-Wall Street banker who just decided the rules didn’t apply to him? Protection for whistleblowers has been enshrined in British law for almost two decades, yet the Barclays boss saw fit to unleash the hounds in his attempt to unmask the author of letters containing allegations of a personal nature about a recently recruited senior banker. The banker, Tim Pain, had been a long-standing colleague of Staley’s at his former employer, JPMorgan. Staley tasked Barclays’ internal security team with discovering the identity of the whistleblower and, even after being told to desist, drafted in a US law enforcement agency to aid the pursuit. Staley admits now he got too personally involved, while the Barclays board describes his actions as “an honest mistake”. Coincidentally, that’s the same phrase Bank of England governor Mark Carney used last month to describe the actions of his former deputy, Charlotte Hogg, who failed to declare a conflict of interest with her brother, Quintin. There are distinct parallels between the Staley scandal and the Bank of England affair. Staley is one of the big beasts in the banking world while Hogg, widely tipped as a future governor of the Bank of England, was one of the most powerful women in the City. Code of conduct But she broke Threadneedle Street’s code of conduct – one she helped to write – when she failed to declare her brother is a senior executive at a major UK bank (Barclays, funnily enough). She was given a formal warning and her salary was frozen but, after a damning report from MPs, Hogg tendered her resignation and will leave the bank later this year. The governor made it quite clear at the time that he did not regard her offence as egregious and, in his view, it was certainly not a resigning matter. Likewise at Barclays, the board remains “unanimous” in its support of its chief executive. As Staley is not a stupid man, the “honest mistake” defence stretches credulity. It’s hard to escape the conclusion that he simply believed the rules did not apply to him or, if they did, he was more than willing to break them. The Barclays board may believe that docking the multimillionaire banker’s bonus is punishment enough, but will the City regulators go along with that? They are now investigating both the bank and its chief executive and have the power to fine the former and ban the latter from the financial services industry, in which case he would be forced to quit. The action they take will show how serious the City is in cleaning up its act and promoting a more honest culture. If others are to be encouraged to come forward when they see wrongdoing, the authorities have only one course of action. And that’s to throw the book at the Barclays boss. TESCO BOUNCES BACK Tesco has come a long way in the two years since it reported one of the biggest losses in British corporate history, plunging into the red by £6.4 billion (€7.5 billion). On Wednesday, chief executive Dave Lewis, who took over in the wake of the 2014 accounting scandal, is expected to report that profits have bounced back comfortably above £1 billion. While Tesco has now put the false accounting crisis behind it – the High Court approved its £129 million settlement with the Serious Fraud Office on Monday – Lewis is likely to be given something of a rough ride in the City today despite the impressive recovery in profits. At issue is the group’s ambitious £3.7 billion takeover of the cash and carry company Booker. Shareholders are concerned the ambitious deal will derail the recovery, eating up management time and energy that should be spent securing the performance of the core UK supermarkets chain. ‘Destruction of value’ Investors are also worried about the high price being paid by Tesco – a heady 23 times Booker’s earnings. Such terms are highly likely to result in “the destruction of value” for Tesco, according Nick Kirrage of Schroders, its third-largest shareholder. The Booker deal has already resulted in the loss of one key member of the Tesco board – senior independent director Richard Cousins quit in protest at the proposed move at the start of the year. Analysts and investors will today be looking to Lewis to provide reassurance on the strength of the group’s recovery and the merits of the Booker deal.

The ways of the giant global banks – both commercial and investment operations – are as mysterious as they are damaging to the people. Big banks use the Federal Reserve to maximize their influence and profits. The federal Freedom of Information Act provides an exemption for matters that are “contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions.” This exemption allows financial institutions to wallow in secrecy. Financial institutions are so influential in Congress that Senator Durbin (D, IL) says “[The banks] frankly own this place.” Although anti-union, giant financial institutions have significant influence over the investments of worker pension funds. Their certainty of being bailed out because they are seen as “too big to fail” harms the competitiveness of smaller, community banks and allows the big bankers to take bigger risks with “other people’s money,” as Justice Brandeis put it. These big banks are so pervasive in their reach that even unions and progressive media, such as The Nation magazine and Democracy Now have their accounts with JP Morgan Chase. The government allows banks to have concentrated power. Taxpayers and Consumers are charged excessive fees and paid paltry interest rates on savings. The bonds of municipalities are are also hit with staggering fees and public assets like highways and public drinking water systems are corporatized by Goldman Sachs and other privatizers with sweetheart multi-decade leases. Then there are the immense taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street, such as those in2008-2009 after the financial industry’s recklessness and crimes brought down the economy, cost workers 8 million jobs, and shredded the pension and mutual fund savings of the American people. Standing like a beacon of stability, responsiveness and profitability is the 98 year-old, state-owned Bank of North Dakota (BND). As reported by Ellen Brown, prolific author and founder of the Public Banking Institute (Santa Clarita, California), “The BND has had record profits for the last 12 years” (avoiding the Wall Street crash) “each year outperforming the last. In 2015 it reported $130.7 million in earnings, total assets of $7.4 billion, capital of $749 million, and a return on investment of a whopping 18.1 percent. Its lending portfolio grew by $486 million, a 12.7 percent increase, with growth in all four of its areas of concentration: agriculture, business, residential and student loans…” North Dakota’s economy is depressed because of the sharp drop in oil prices. So the BND moved to help. Again, Ellen Brown: “In 2015, it introduced new infrastructure programs to improve access to medical facilities, remodel or construct new schools, and build new road and water infrastructure. The Farm Financial Stability Loan was introduced to assist farmers affected by low commodity prices or below-average crop production. The BND also helped fund 300 new businesses.” All this is in a state with half the population of Phoenix or Philadelphia. A California coalition is forming to establish a state-owned bank for California. Coalition organizers say a California State Bank will cut the state’s long-term financing costs in half, compared to what avaricious Wall Street is charging. The nation’s largest state (equivalent to the world’s sixth largest economy) can free itself from massive debt accumulation, bid-rigging, deceptive interest-rate swaps and capital appreciation bonds at 300% interest over time. What assets does the state have to make this bank fully operational? California has surplus funds which total about $600 billion, including those in a Pooled Money Investment account managed by the State Treasurer that contains $54 billion earning less than 1 percent interest. Money in these funds is earmarked for specific expenditure purposes, but they can be invested – in a new state bank. To escape from a Wall Street that is, in Brown’s words “sucking massive sums in interest, fees and interest rate swap payments out of California and into offshore tax havens,” a state bank can use its impressive credit power to develop infrastructure in California. Huge state pension funds and other state funds can provide the deposits. Each one billion dollar capital investment can lend $10 billion for projects less expensively and under open stable banking control by California. Presently, California and other states routinely deposit hundreds of billions of dollars in Wall Street banks at minimal interest, turn around and borrow for infrastructure construction and repair from the Wall Street bond market at much higher interest and fees. This is a ridiculous form of debt peonage, a lesson Governor Jerry Brown has yet to learn. He and other officials similarly uninformed about how the state of California can be its own banker should visit publicbankinginstitute.org and read Ellen Brown’s book, The Public Bank Solution. Legislation for public banks is being pursued in the states of Washington, Michigan, Arizona and New Jersey, as well as the cities of Philadelphia and Santa Fe. Look for county commissioners and state treasurers to come on board when they see the enormous safeguards and savings that can be secured through “public banks” in contrast to the convoluted casino run by unaccountable Wall Street gamblers and speculators. A longtime backer of public banking, retired entrepreneur Richard Mazess, hopes that national civic groups like Public Citizen, Common Cause, People for the American Way and Consumer Watchdog can get behind the proposal. “Public, not private, infrastructure is essential for an equitable economy,” he says. California already has a public infrastructure bank called the IBank. Mr. Mazess and others believe that expanding the existing IBank into a depository institution would be more likely to pass through the California legislature. The deposits would come from public institutions, and NGOs (not from private persons). These pension funds and other public deposits would become reserves and serve as the basis for safely leveraged loans to public projects at a conservative tenfold multiplier. No derivatives or other shenanigans allowed. Before that proposal can be enacted, however, there needs to be much more education of state legislators and the public at large. Such enlightenment would illuminate the enormous savings, along with the restoration of state sovereignty from the absentee, exploitative grip of an unrepentant, speculating, profiteering Wall Street that believes it can always go to Washington, DC for its taxpayer bailouts.

The number of people with jobs rose by 60,900 in the month, the strongest gain since October 2015, and smashing market forecasts of a gain of 20,000. Full-time jobs drove the growth, with 74,500 positions created, the largest rise since June 2011, offsetting a fall of 13,600 in part-time jobs. The unemployment rate remained steady at 5.9 per cent, as expected, largely because the participation rate - which refers to the number of people either employed or actively looking for work - rose to an eight-month high of 64.8 per cent. Advertisement The better than expected figures pushed the Australian dollar back towards 76 US cents, and economists said they should please the RBA, which has recently described the labour market as soft. "The latest figures would cheer up the Reserve Bank," CommSec chief economist Craig James said. "Given the dour commentary accompanying the April interest rate decision, policymakers could do with some cheering up." But the data will not change current forecasts of no foreseeable change in the RBA's cash rate, Mr James said. JPMorgan economist Tom Kennedy expects the RBA to remain on alert, but "less alarmed" following Thursday's data. "From a policy perspective, while RBA officials will take heart from the better tone of the March data, the fact that last month's pop in the jobless rate is now 'locked in' is likely to be a concern," he said. Provided that the data isn't reversed, the RBA will be relieved that the loss of momentum in the labour market in recent months appears to have been temporary, St George Bank senior economist Janu Chan said. "The case for further easing from the RBA has diminished but without a meaningful decline in the unemployment rate, talk of rate hikes is still premature," she said.

Japan and the United States kick off an economic dialogue on April 18 that will be led by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso. The talks will cover issues such as macroeconomic policy, infrastructure investment and trade. Sixteen of 37 economists said they were somewhat concerned the talks would hurt Japan, the poll showed. Fifteen said they don't expect much from the dialogue; few saw a positive impact. And some predicted the meeting would sow the seeds for future bilateral trade talks. "It is reasonable to forecast that the dialogue will develop to trade negotiations as Washington sees Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. is a result of unfair commercial practice," said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. Twenty-nine of 37 analysts said bilateral trade negotiations would happen in the near future, while eight said it was unlikely, according to the poll taken April 4-12. After his inauguration in January, President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact and declared Washington would instead seek one-on-one trade deals. His protectionist trade policies could undermine Japan's export-reliant economy. "There is a chance that Washington could demand Japan to make concessions to what have been agreed at the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the two nations could move on to negotiations on an individual sector such as autos to reduce the U.S. trade deficit," said Harumi Taguchi, principal economist at IHS Economics. Washington is pushing for trade to be a key issue in top-level economic talks with Japan, a person directly involved in preparations for the talks told Reuters on Thursday, an unwelcome development for Tokyo, which has sought to keep the talks from turning into a forum for U.S. pressure to reduce the bilateral trade imbalance. BOJ OUTLOOK Most analysts, meanwhile, maintained their view that the Bank of Japan's next action will be scaling back its ultra-easy monetary policy. Thirty of 38 analysts projected the central bank would phase out its stimulus while the rest said it is likely to ease further if it decides to change policy. That was largely in line with the previous survey. "The BOJ emphasizes the importance of maintaining inflation momentum more than that of attaining 2 percent at the earliest possible time," said Hiroshi Ugai, chief economist at JP Morgan Securities. "Therefore, we expect the BOJ's next policy move will be unwinding even though the BOJ cannot attain 2 percent target in fiscal 2018." Some analysts pushed back the timing of the central bank's projected next move. Five analysts said the move would start in the latter half of this year, down from ten in last's month survey, and seven projected it would happen in the first half of next year. Eight believe it will happen in the latter half of 2018. Eleven analysts see the BOJ taking steps in 2019 or later, up from eight in the previous survey. A few declined to predict the timing. Asked about what steps the BOJ would take if it decides to unwind its stimulus policy, the majority expect it to raise the 10-year Japanese government bond yield target from around zero percent now. Others said the central bank would raise the negative 0.1 percent interest rate applied on a small portion of commercial banks' excess reserves. Economists forecast the world's third-largest economy will expand 1.3 percent this fiscal year, started April, and grow 1.1 percent the next. That's up a tick from last month's 1.2 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively. The nation's core consumer prices, which include oil products but exclude fresh food prices, will probably rise 0.8 percent this fiscal year and 1.0 percent next, unchanged from a March survey.

Trump said in a Wall Street Journal interview that the dollar “was getting too strong,” though he also said he would like to see interest rates stay low. The dollar, which has risen along with prospects for higher rates, hurts profits at U.S. multinationals when it strengthens. “Markets don't like uncertainty,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. “This just kind of added another wild card into the mix in a way, whether there will be actions taken to keep the dollar from strengthening further.” Investors sought shelter in defensive shares and other low-risk assets. Industrials and materials were the biggest drags on the market along with financials, while utilities, staples and telecommunications gave the S&P 500 its biggest lift. The S&P financial index was down 0.9 per cent a day ahead of results from three major banks in what will mark the start of the corporate earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings to have risen 10 per cent for all S&P 500 companies in the first quarter, Thomson Reuters data shows. The materials and industrials indexes both ended more than 1 per cent lower on the day. In a sign that further weakness may be ahead, the S&P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since November 8. The CBOE Volatility index, Wall Street's fear gauge, extended recent gains, a day after it closed above 15 for the first time since the election. Rising US tensions with Russia, North Korea and Syria after US missile strikes in Syria last week and the moving of US warships toward the Korean Peninsula have kept investors cautious. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 59.44 points or 0.29 per cent to 20,591.86, the S&P 500 lost 8.85 points or 0.38 per cent to 2,344.93 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 30.61 points or 0.52 per cent to 5,836.16. Investors are concerned these developments could distract Trump from pursuing pro-business policies such as tax cuts, simpler regulations and higher infrastructure spending, promises that have powered Wall Street to record highs since his election in November. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan are due to report results on Thursday, the last trading day of the week ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Delta Air Lines closed down 0.5 per cent at $45.05 despite a better-than-expected quarterly profit and an upbeat forecast for current-quarter passenger unit revenue. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.23-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 51 new highs and 42 new lows. About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, compared with the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The markets are closed tomorrow, but we'll be back on Monday from 9am. Thanks to everyone for reading along and sharing your thoughts. We'll see you on the other side of Easter. Have a good evening and a lovely weekend.  4:26pm Plunging iron ore prices and a renewed focus on geopolitical tensions sent the ASX lower on Thursday, erasing around half the gains made earlier in the week.  The benchmark S&P/ASX200 fell 0.7 per cent to 5889.9 in broad-based losses, while the broader All Ordinaries index was 0.7 per cent lower to 5925.9. That drove the ASX to a small weekly gain, with the ASX200 up 0.5 per cent. Weighing most on the index were the miners, after iron ore tumbled 8.5 per cent overnight. While iron ore futures did point to the metal recovering later in the day, it wasn't enough to save Australia's major resource companies, with the materials index weighing heavily - down 2.9 per cent - on the index. BHP and Rio Tinto were 4.0 per cent and 4.4 per cent lower respectively. Pure-play iron ore miner Fortescue was savaged, falling 6.8 per cent.  Meanwhile gold miners, who'd already done well earlier in the week, posted the index's largest gains. Northern Star Resources surged 6.8 per cent, Evolution Mining was up 2.9 per cent while Independence Group added 3.0 per cent. The All Ordinaries Gold Index rose 2.2 per cent over the week's four trading sessions.  Defensive buying could also be discerned in some of the ASX's best performers on Thursday. Yield stocks like Sydney Airport and REA Group rose strongly, both up 1.9 per cent.  "There is a lot of risks out there at the moment and a lot of unknowns," said Chris Conway, chief strategist and head of trading at Australian Stock Report. "Geopolitical tensions – Russia, Syria and North Korea – must be on investors' mind at the moment." Not that investors should panic, he added. "At this stage, the current pullback looks like any other pullback we've seen over the past few months," "Such pullbacks have been greeted as a buying opportunity from the market." 4:10pm Get set for a price war in the Australian mobile phone market as the near-$2 billion entry of the aggressive telco TPG, controlled by reclusive billionaire David Teoh, sets the scene for a major industry shakeup, Elizabeth Knight writes: TPG, which is already a big player in the broadband market, kicked off its entry with a $1.26 billion investment in spectrum and has earmarked a $600 million spend on rolling out cell sites in order to cover 80 per cent of the Australian market. Run by rich-lister Teoh, who has an estimated personal wealth of $2.2 billion, TPG has a history of disrupting the telecommunications market, running a low-cost business and cutting prices. The extent of the damage to incumbent players was evident immediately on Wednesday morning as Telstra's shares fell more than 7.5 per cent, wiping more than $4 billion from its stock market value. TPG expects to have the new mobile business earnings positive when it reaches a 6 per cent to 7 per cent share of the $8 billion mobile market. Attracting those customers will require attractive pricing for voice and data – which the other major players – Telstra, Optus and Vodafone will need to adjust for. This, in turn, will have a negative effect on their profit margins. As the biggest player Telstra will have the most to lose, its pricing levels are already higher than the others, which it justifies by better network coverage. Even without the entry of TPG, the level of competition in mobiles has been increasing and it's putting a strain on the telco earnings. Here's more The level of competition in mobiles has been increasing. Photo: Glenn Hunt 3:41pm Construction and contract mining giant CIMIC Group's quarterly profit has jumped 23 per cent. CIMIC made a net profit of $160.3 million in the three months to March, up from $130.3 million a year earlier. It has reaffirmed its guidance of an annual profit of between $640 million and $700 million in 2017. Chief executive Adolfo Valderas told shareholders at the company's annual general meeting on Thursday that there was nearly $80 billion worth of tenders relevant to CIMIC to be awarded over the rest of 2017, and around $250 billion for 2018 and beyond. CIMIC also said it would keep its options open in relation to mining services provider Macmahon Holdings, in which CIMIC holds a 23.6 per cent stake after its recent takeover effort. The recent acquisition of engineering, construction and maintenance firm UGL also provides CIMIC with a further platform for expansion, Mr Valderas said. Cimic shares are flat at $36.38. 3:13pm AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver has backed fellow economist Chris Richardson advice that young Australians consider renting rather buying a home in the current cycle. "The one bit of advice I give to young Australians is right now you know...amid our housing markets of the moment is 'don't buy'," the Deloitte Access Economics economist told the National Press Club this week. "...rents today make a lot more sense than housing prices," he added. Oliver told the AFR that Richardson's advice was "totally right" given that rental yields were at record lows with "rents not kept up with ridiculous home price gains". "Now is not the time to buy, but rather to rent in places like Sydney and Melbourne. Obviously its more complicated than that for some people. I am talking from a purely financial point of view," he said. Gross rental yields in Sydney and Melbourne range from 2.7 per cent to 4 per cent, according to CoreLogic, and would be half that on a net basis once borrowing and other real estate costs are deducted. Oliver likened the disconnect between rents and house prices to company profits not keeping up with share price gains. "It will be alright for a while, but eventually the market will recognise there is an overvaluation," said Oliver. Here's more at the AFR 'Now is not the time to buy, but rather to rent in places like Sydney and Melbourne.'  Photo: TREVOR COLLENS Back to top 2:39pm While Australians will dig into Easter chocolates over the next few days, it's unlikely to reverse the bad news for the world's cocoa producers, who've seen prices for the commodity tumble 34 per cent in the past 12 months. Meanwhile, those slightly further down the supply chain aren't doing much better, which chocolate consumption falling, albeit slowly, across much of the developed world. "Our research reveals that changes in per capita consumption points to an important shift in consumers' eating habits, as consumption of chocolate confectionery is declining in the top five markets," said Marcia Mogelonsky from researcher Mintel. Nielsen data also showed a drop in consumption. Global chocolate sales fell 2.1 per cent in the past six months, falling especially quickly in Europe and the Americas, while growing in Asia.  Meanwhile, cocoa futures for July delivery fell 1.1 per cent today - on top of the 34 per cent price fall in the past year. The falling futures reflect improving weather conditions which led to a bumper crop, as well as the falling demand. The cocoa producers of Ivory Coast and Ghana, who together account for over 60 per cent of the world's cocoa supply, said today they would work together to coordinate production in order to tackle price volatility. "It's become imperative that our countries take decisions on points concerning production and sustainability and on points concerning the prickly question of the volatility of prices," the head of Ivory Coast's Coffee and Cocoa Council, Massandje Toure-Litse, told reporters after a meeting with her counterpart Joseph Boahen Aidoo, CEO of Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod). "Henceforth the world cocoa leaders speak with one voice everywhere and at all times."

Cohen has been in the role since January 11, replacing long-term chief execuive Laura McBain, who resigned after a torrid two months for the company. Bellamy's has also appointed as a non-executive director John Ho, the founder and chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based investor Janchor Partners, which has a stake of 7.01 per cent in Bellamy's. Shares are flat at $4.45. John Ho has been appointed a non-executive director of Bellamy's. Photo: Daniel Munoz 1:41pm Here are some economist reactions to the suspiciously strong jobs report. Look at the trend figures, is the most popular recommendation: Gareth Aird, CBA: The integrity of the ABS labour force report will be called into question once again due to today's data. The market was positioned for a decent report (consensus +20k, CBA +25k) and the ABS delivered an incredible set of numbers. Taken at face value, the report is comprehensively strong. The trend unemployment rate, which we consider the best barometer of the jobless pulse, inched higher and has been on a very slight uptrend since September 2016. Andrew Ticehurst, Nomura: We have noted the volatility in this data before due to sample size and the effects of sample rotation, so we downplay the indicative value of these numbers. We also note that March has generally produced above-average gains over the past few years, so there may well be some residual seasonality affecting this print as well. Instead we prefer to rely on the ABS trend data, which for March shows a more reasonable 16,500 person job gain. This brings the trend up a little, but to a level now consistent with our interpretation of job ads, skilled vacancies and business surveys. Paul Dales, Capital Economics: The huge leap in employment in March looks suspicious to us and we think the stagnation in the unemployment rate at a 14-month high of 5.9% is a better signal of the state of the labour market. That rate is close to the 6% plus mark that we think would really worry the RBA. Uur forecast that the unemployment rate will stay close to 6.0% for most of this year means those concerns will linger for a while yet.  Scott Haslem, UBS: There's clearly more work to be done on improving Australia's jobs survey data. All that can be said is the 6mth trend is consistent with a ~2% y/y pace, broadly consistent with the leading indicators, that have for some time now been suggesting a more positive jobs market than the ABS data (until now?). Were this pace to continue, it suggests the unemployment rate should begin to drift lower, regaining its ~5½% level from six months ago by end-17. The apparent better jobs market may eventually underpin a pick-up household income, currently a key area of softness for the economic outlook. Felicity Emmett, ANZ: We think the RBA would be pleased with the strength in employment in today's numbers, although the stubbornly high unemployment rate will remain a source of concern. With spare capacity in the labour market taking longer than expected to be worked off, and the resulting dampening impact on wages growth, we remain comfortable with our view that the RBA is likely to be on hold for an extended period. Tom Kennedy, JPMorgan: While we acknowledge the positive developments, in our view the unemployment rate remains the most important metric to watch, given it tends to abstract from much of the month to month volatility that plagues the employment and supply-side numbers. From a policy perspective, while RBA officials will take heart from the better tone of the March data, the fact that last month's pop in the jobless rate is now 'locked in' is likely to be a concern. 1:14pm Not only iron ore miners are facing the heat today: Whitehaven Coal shares are down 5.8 per cent at $3.015 after reporting a drop in quarterly sales. But the miner expects coking coal prices to remain high for months as supply disruptions since Cyclone Debbie damaged train lines and interrupted exports reverberate through markets. Whitehaven, whose mines about 1300 km south of the cyclone's path have been unaffected by the rail stoppages, also plans to boost its own coking coal sales next quarter as exporters further north grapple with stalled operations. Five miners in the cyclone-hit region, including BHP Billiton and Glencore have declared force majeure - a clause typically invoked after natural disasters - since multiple landslides and flooding knocked out major coal rail networks. Railway operator Aurizon is gradually returning some tracks to service. Its Blackwater line resumed operations on Monday and its Newlands line is expected to open today. However, with the busiest Goonyella line further north closed until May, the disruption caused by the cyclone could lead to the potential loss of 15 million tonnes of coking and thermal coal exports from Australia, Whitehaven said. "This loss of exports is likely to be positive for coal prices until normal production and shipments resume and any contract delivery shortfall recovered, which could take some months," the company said. Coking coal prices this month posted the biggest one-day surge on record as the rail outages blocked up to half the world's export shipments. Whitehaven said customer requests for coking coal "increased substantially" since the storm and that the company expected to boost coking coal sales next quarter. Whitehaven said it produced 5.7 million tonnes of coal for the quarter, a decrease of 11 per cent frm the previous quarter, and affirmed its full-year production guidance of 21 to 22 million tonnes. Whitehaven expects the cyclone outages to keep coal prices up for months. Photo: LUKE SHARRETT 12:53pm The ASX still hasn't found a bottom for the day, falling further below the 5900-line amid a fierce sell-off in miners. BHP and Rio have both dropped more than 4 per cent, while Fortescue is down 6.7 per cent. Possibly heralding temporary relief, Chinese iron ore futures have opened marginally higher, rising 5 yuan to 508.5, after several sessions of vicious selling. The spot price of iron ore plunged 8.5 per cent to $US68.04 a tonne last night. "The trend is still for steel and iron ore to weaken in the coming weeks," said a trader active on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. "There is a lot of steel and iron ore being produced, too much." Today's drop in the ASX would be the first loss in five session, but it does make the 6000-point target look a bit less unlikely, at least over the short term. In our recent poll, 50 per cent of readers said they expected the ASX to reach that mark this month. Poll Will the ASX make it through 6000 points this time around? Yes, momentum is in the market and April is usually a strong month.49% No, the 6000-level is a barrier too high at the moment. Maybe later in the year.28% No, valuations are well stretched already and we'll see a big plunge next. No 6000 this year.23% Total votes: 1574 Poll closed 13 Apr, 2017 Disclaimer: These polls are not scientific and reflect the opinion only of visitors who have chosen to participate. Back to top 12:31pm Well, this is unlikely to strengthen faith in the ABS: the Australian Bureau of Statistics said some figures concerning under-utilisation rates were incorrect in today's employment data, but that the errors should not affect the headline numbers. Figures that reported under-employed people were incorrect in tables published on the bureau's website, a spokesperson for the bureau told Reuters by phone. "It shouldn't affect the headline figures," she said. That may have caused the short blip in the Aussie, which took the currency nearly back to the level it was at before the jobs data was released. It wouldn't be the first time ABS employment numbers are raising eyebrows. The September numbers, for example, surprised economists as full-time employment plunged by the most in over five years, while part-time employment soared, and the jobless rate fell to a three-year low, thanks to male labour market participation plummeting. "Today's employment report ... was a dog's dinner," said Stephen Walters from the Australian Institute of Company Directors.  And CBA economist John Peters seconded, "The mixed September labour force report with the huge size of some of the reported moves raises a degree of scepticism about the results." 12:20pm A second booster shot has taken the Aussie dollar further away from the thtee-month low it hit just yesterday. The currency initially jumped early this morning after Donald Trump talked down the US dollar in an interview with the WSJ, calling it too strong and saying that he would prefer rates to remain low. That put pressure on the greenback, taking the Aussie back into US75¢-territory after it fell as low as US74.73¢ yesterday, its lowest since mid-January. The next leg up came from the surprisingly strong local employment data, which showed the economy created 60.9k new jobs, all of them full-time too. "The greenback is likely to remain under pressure as traders absorb Trump's dovish comments and continue to doubt the Fed," said ThinkMarkets senior analyst Matt Simpson. "If geopolitical tensions reside then we think AUD is more than capable of clawing its way back above US76¢ and perhaps staying there for more than two minutes." 11:54am Also just out, the Reserve Bank has become more concerned about the surge in household debt and a rise in interest only loans that is making the financial system vulnerable to a correction in property prices or rising interest rates.   In its semi-annual health check of the financial system, the RBA issued its strongest warning yet that rampant debt fuelled property speculation, spurred on by tax policies and surging house prices would amplify financial shocks and inflict pain on the entire economy. "While it is not possible to know what level of overall household indebtedness is sustainable, a highly indebted household sector is likely to be more sensitive to declines in income and wealth and may respond by reducing consumption sharply," the Reserve said in its 52-page Financial Stability Review. The report comes as the regulators have responded to surging house prices by doubling down on lending limits and loan underwriting oversight to prevent a further build up of risks posed by an overheated property market. The bank said a surge in house prices had led to an increase in "the willingness to pay more for a given property and leading to an overall increase in household indebtedness." The most disturbing line in the RBAs financial stability review pic.twitter.com/OKDailgD4F— Johnny Shapiro (@johnnyshap) April 13, 2017 In past reports, the Reserve Bank has sought comfort from the fact that, on aggregate households are 17 per cent ahead of their mortgage repayments. But it has now recognised that these aggregate figures "mask a significant variation across borrowers". The available data suggests that one third of borrowers - typically borrowers that have recently take out a loan or are on low incomes – has "either no accrued buffer or a buffer of less than one month's repayments." Investment loans which had concentrated in the hands of already highly indebted households "could induce a more pronounced cycle in housing prices than would otherwise occur, amplifying the size of a subsequent downswing in housing prices," the Reserve Bank said. 11:47am A few reactions on Twitter to the surprising strength in jobs; some scepticism around the reliability of the ABS numbers, which have in the past been all over the shop: ABS says 74,500 full time jobs were created in the month - or more than 2400 a day.

The number of new jobs was triple what economists had expected, and in even better news the new positions were all full-time, and then some. Altogether 74,500 full-time jobs were created, while 13,600 part-time jobs were lost. The participation rate came in at 64.8 per cent, up from February's 64.6 per cent. The Aussie dollar bounced on the data, rising about a quarter of a cent to the day's high of US75.70¢. Back to top 11:27am We mentioned Trump jawboning the US dollar in his WSJ interview overnight, but there was more in the interview. He also did an about-face on the Fed chair, saying he had not ruled out reappointment of Janet Yellen to a new four-year term as head of the US central bank as he considers his choices. Trump was asked if Yellen was "toast" when her term expires in February, a question that reflected a widespread assumption that he would put his own stamp on the monetary authority rather than rely on former President Barack Obama's choice to run the Fed. Trump replied with his most explicit comments about the Fed since taking office, saying that Yellen was "not toast," that he had "respect" for her, and that he would prefer the Fed to keep interests rates low. That's not what Trump said on the campaign trail last year: "I have nothing against Janet Yellen whatsoever, she's very capable person. But she's not a Republican," Trump said. "When her time is up I would most likely replace her because of the fact it would be appropriate." On rates, he talked from both extremes - criticising Yellen as a political hack who kept interest rates low to help the Obama administration, but also saying that as a businessman he liked to borrow cheap. Though rates are now rising under Yellen they remain low by historic standards. Yellen and other policymakers have emphasised that rates will rise only gradually in the months ahead, and that monetary policy would remain loose for perhaps years to come. Yellen is "the safest dovish choice" for Trump, said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist for Standish Mellon Asset Management in Boston and a former top Fed economist. The Fed said it would not comment on Trump's remarks. Yellen, who like Trump turned 70 last summer, has said little about the subject other than that she intended to serve out her current four year term. Trump will have a chance to appoint five of the seven members of the Fed's Washington-based Board of Governors, including a currently open job of vice-chair in charge of financial supervision. For President Trump, lower or slower-growing interest rates could make it easier to pay for any infrastructure program he proposes, and slow what has been a steady rise in the US dollar that makes exports more expensive and hurts manufacturers. All of a sudden back in the President's favour: Janet Yellen. Photo: Andrew Harrer 10:58am The largest acquisition by a Chinese government entity of Australian assets has been given the green light, with the Foreign Investment Review Board recommending the $US2.5 billion purchase of Rio Tinto's suite of NSW coal assets. The buyer is Yancoal Australia, which is 78 per cent owned by Yanzhou Coal Mining Co of Hong Kong, which is in turn controlled by an arm of the Chinese government. Chinese bids to acquire Australian assets have been controversial, with a string of planned acquisitions - from Ausgrid to the Kidman rural empire -  blocked. "FIRB approval is a positive step forward for Yancoal, its shareholders and the Hunter Valley, demonstrating the Australian Government's support for continued investment into the local resources sector," said Reinhold Schmidt, the chief executive of the miner said in a statement. "Yancoal ...[looks] forward to continuing to grow our operations."  Yancoal sells around 25 million tonnes of coal annually produced at its Australian mines, which will more than double to an estimated 51 million tonnes once the deal is concluded.

The acquisition includes Marcs' and David Lawrence's existing inventory, brand names and intellectual property but does not include lease liabilities and staff obligations. Marcs' and David Lawrence's parent company, M Webster Holdings, collapsed on February 2 owing about $30 million to creditors including owner Malcolm Webster, a secured creditor. Myer's chief merchandise and customer officer Daniel Bracken told the AFR that Myer stepped in about a week ago after it became clear that no buyer could be found and the brands would be wound up. The Marcs brand heads to Myer. Photo: Tamara Dean 10:31am Shares have opened sharply lower, led down by steep falls in miners after the iron ore price collapsed overnight. The ASX is down 0.6 per cent at 5899.8, on track for its first day in the red in five sessions. Overnight trading displayed elements of a risk-off stance from investors, said CMC chief market strategist Michael McCarthy. "Gold and bonds rallied, shares and industrial commodities were marked down and volatility indicators rose. The trimming of risk positions comes against a background of rising geo-political tensions and the start of the US company reporting season." Fortescue is the biggest loser in the to 200, slumping 7.3 per cent, while heavyweight BHP is the biggest single drag on the index, falling 3.75 per cent. Telstra remains under pressure, losing another 1.5 per cent after TPG announced it will spend close to $2 billion to build a competing 4G mobile network. But there are plenty of winners too, as investors rotate into defensive stocks such as consumer staples Wesfarmers and Woolies, up 0.6 per cent and 0.3 per cent respectively, or healthcare such as CSL. 10:11am Fortescue shares are being hammered in early trade, following an overnight plunge in the iron ore price. Adding to pressure, the miner reported lower iron ore shipments for the fiscal third- quarter, with its cash costs also rising for the first time in 13 quarters, due to the impact of wet weather. The Pilbara miner shipped 39.6 million tonnes of iron ore in the three months to March 31, down 6 per cent from the 42 million tonnes a year earlier, and also down 6 per cent decline on the second-quarter. Cash costs, at $US13.06 per wet metric tonne, were down 12 per cent from a year earlier but rose 4 per cent from the second quarter. The miner also said it expects the iron ore price to fall further, to between $US60 and $US65 a tonne, as imports to China continue to rise. Fortescue shares are down 7 per cent at $5.49.

The benchmark Nikkei 225 declined 1.14 percent, while the Topix also fell 1.14 percent. Banks, financial institutions, trading houses and major exporters were all lower. The dollar fetched about 108.85 yen, with the Japanese currency strengthening from levels over 111 reached earlier in the week. Among major exporters, Toyota shares fell 1.59 percent, Mitsubishi Electric declined 1.49 percent and Sony was down 1.04 percent. The strength in the yen corresponded with broad declines in the dollar, following President Donald Trump's remarks to the Wall Street Journal that the greenback was getting "too strong." That pushed the dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, lower from levels near 100.80 to about 100.06 on Thursday at 11:13 a.m. HK/SIN. "With political tensions remaining high and Trump's call for a lower dollar, traders are more likely to take notice of bad news over good to keep pressure on the dollar and support the yen," said ThinkMarkets' senior market analyst Matt Simpson in a note. In the interview with the Journal, Trump also reversed a crucial campaign promise and said his administration will not label China a currency manipulator in a report due this week. "As most knew all along, if China was manipulating its currency, it was in Trump's favor, not vice versa. The renminbi has appreciated against its trading partners by 40 percent over the past dozen years and continues to do so today," analysts at Singapore's DBS Bank said in a note. In South Korea, the Kospi traded up 0.22 percent, after the Bank of Korea kept its base rate unchanged at 1.25 percent on Thursday. In its policy statement, the South Korean central bank said global economic recovery has continued to expand; it added it will maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance. show chapters What's behind the US market's overreaction?    8 Hours Ago | 02:46 The Korean won strengthened against the greenback on Thursday, trading at 1,129.10 at 11:23 a.m. HK/SIN, climbing from an earlier low of 1,137.90. In Australia, the ASX 200 traded down 0.85 percent, with the materials sector down by 3.08 percent. Major resources producers were notably lower, with Rio Tinto down 4.73 percent, Fortescue down by 6.86 percent and BHP Billiton lower by 4.3 percent. Major Australian banking stocks as well as energy names were also lower. The Australian dollar traded higher against the greenback at $0.7576, up from a previous low of $0.7515. Earlier in the day, the Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed seasonally adjusted employment Down Under rose by nearly 61,000 jobs from February to March, beating a Reuters forecast of 20,000. Economists reckon the strength of the jobs report will please the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). "We think the RBA would be pleased with the strength in employment in today's numbers, although the stubbornly high unemployment rate will remain a source of concern," said Felicity Emmett, senior economist at ANZ. She added, " With spare capacity in the labor market taking longer than expected to be worked off, and the resulting dampening impact on wages growth, we remain comfortable with our view that the RBA is likely to be on hold for an extended period." show chapters Outlook for China's exports    4 Hours Ago | 02:23 Markets in Greater China traded mostly higher. Mainland Chinese markets rose, with the Shanghai composite up 0.12 percent and the Shenzhen composite higher by 0.5 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was fractionally lower by 0.09 percent. Taiwan's Taiex rose 0.22 percent. Chinese trade data released Thursday showed exports rose 16.4 percent in March, beating a Reuters forecast of 3.2 percent, reversing a decline of 1.3 percent in February. Imports rose 20.3 percent, down from a surge of 38.1 percent in the previous month but still beat expectations of 18 percent uptick by analysts. The yuan strengthened against the dollar; the on-shore yuan traded at 6.8789 against the greenback, while the off-shore yuan fetched 6.8746. In corporate news, Western Digital warned that troubled Japanese conglomerate Toshiba will breach a joint venture contract if it sells its memory chip unit. Toshiba is looking to spin off its memory business in order to cover billions in losses incurred by its U.S. nuclear arm, Westinghouse. Toshiba shares were lower by 2.67 percent. Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific announced several changes in top management, with Chief Operating Officer Rupert Hogg due to replace current Chief Executive Ivan Chu on May 1. The company said in a press release that Chu would be taking on the role of chairman at John Swire & Sons to focus on opportunities in mainland China. The airline posted losses in March, the first time the company has reported annual losses since the 2008 financial crisis. Cathay Pacific shares rose 2.2 percent in late-morning trade. Oil prices also fell, after data from the Energy Information Administration showed a build up in U.S. inventories. Reuters reported the EIA report showed stockpiles at the U.S. crude hub at Cushing, Oklahoma, rose 276,000 barrels in the week. Symbol Name Price   Change %Change NIKKEI --- HSI --- ASX 200 --- SHANGHAI --- KOSPI --- CNBC 100 --- Brent fell 0.18 percent to $55.76 a barrel, while U.S. crude was down 0.19 percent at $53.01. Meanwhile, Singapore's trade-reliant economy shrank 1.9 percent in the first quarter from the previous three months on an annualized basis, weighed by contractions in manufacturing and services, preliminary data showed on Thursday. Separately, Singapore's central bank left monetary policy steady on Thursday in a widely expected decision. Stateside, U.S. equities were lower across the board. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 0.29 percent, or 56.44 points, to close at 20,591.86, the S&P 500 fell 0.38 percent, or 8.85, to end at 2,344.93 and the Nasdaq dropped 0.52 percent, or 30.61 points, to finish at 5,836.16. U.S. markets were waiting on earnings announcements from several major U.S. financials, including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. The banks were expected to report results on Thursday ET.

Now deep slumber is a coveted state achieved with gadgets, apps, gizmos and classes Penelope Green Wednesday 12 April 2017 23:00 BST Click to follow Indy/Life At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab, the digital futurist playground, David Rose is investigating swaddling, bedtime stories and hammocks, as well as lavender oil and cocoons. Rose, a researcher, an inventor-entrepreneur and the author of “Enchanted Objects: Design, Human Desire and the Internet of Things,” and his colleagues have been road-testing weighted blankets to induce a swaddling sensation and listening to recordings of Icelandic fairy tales – all research into an ideal sleep environment that may culminate in a nap pod, or, as he said, “some new furniture form.” “For me, it’s a swinging bed on a screened porch in northwestern Wisconsin,” he said. “You can hear the loons and the wind through the fir trees, and there’s the weight of 10 blankets on top of me because it’s a cold night. We’re trying a bunch of interventions.” Meanwhile, at the University of California, Berkeley, Matthew P. Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology and the director of the Sleep and Neuroimaging Laboratory there, is working on direct current stimulation as a cure for sleeplessness in the ageing brain. Dr Walker is also sifting through the millions of hours of human sleep data he has received from Sense, a delicately lovely polycarbonate globe designed to look like the National Stadium in Beijing that measures air quality and other intangibles in your bedroom, then suggests tweaks to help you sleep better. A Deep Rest “class” at Inscape, a meditation studio in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan (Alex Welsh/NYT) “I’ve got a mission,” he said. “I want to reunite humanity with the sleep it is so bereft of.” Sense is the first product made by Hello Inc., a technology company started by James Proud, a British entrepreneur, for which Dr Walker is the chief scientist. In Paris, Hugo Mercier, a computer science engineer, has invested in sound waves. He has raised over $10m ($8m) to create a headband that uses them to induce sleep. The product, called Dreem, has been beta-tested on 500 people (out of a pool of 6,500 applicants, Mercier said) and will be ready for sale this summer. Read more How much sleep people need depending on how old they are That is when Ben Olsen, an Australian entrepreneur, hopes to introduce Thim, a gadget you wear on your finger that uses sound to startle you awake every three minutes for an hour, just before you go to sleep. Sleep disruptions, apparently, can cure sleep disruption (and Olsen, like all good sleep entrepreneurs, has the research to prove it). It is his second sleep contraption. His first, the Re-Timer, a pair of goggles fitted with tiny green-blue lights that shine back into your eyes, aims to reset your body’s clock. He said that since 2012, he had sold 30,000 pairs in 40 countries. For years, studies upon studies have shown how bad sleep weakens the immune system, impairs learning and memory, contributes to depression and other mood and mental disorders, as well as obesity, diabetes, cancer and an early death. (Sedated sleep – hello Ambien – has been shown to be as deleterious as poor sleep.) Sense, a delicately lovely polycarbonate globe designed to look like the National Stadium in Beijing that measures air quality and other intangibles in your bedroom, and then suggests tweaks to help you sleep better The federal Centres for Disease Control and Prevention calls sleeplessness a public health concern. Good sleep helps brain plasticity, studies in mice have shown; poor sleep will make you fat and sad, and then will kill you. It is also expensive: Last year, the Rand Corporation published a study that calculated the business loss of poor sleep in the United States at $411 billion – a gross domestic product loss of 2.28 percent. Companies now fight “presenteeism,” a neologism that describes the lacklustre performance of foggy-brained, sleep-deprived employees, with sleep programs like Sleepio, an online sleep coach, and sleep fairs, like the one hosted last month in Manhattan by Nancy H Rothstein, director of Circadian Corporate Sleep Programs and otherwise known as the Sleep Ambassador, for LinkedIn. For the last few years, Rothstein has been designing sleep education and training programs for a number of Fortune 500 companies. At the LinkedIn sleep fair, she taught attendees how to make a bed (use hospital corners, please) and gave out analogue alarm clocks. (It was her former husband’s snoring, she said, that led her to a career as a sleep evangelist.) The worst jobs for your health + show all The worst jobs for your health 1/10 10.

Time spent sitting: 67 If sleep used to be the new sex, as Marian Salzman, a trend spotter and chief executive of Havas PR North America, proclaimed 10 years ago, today it is a measure of success – a skill to be cultivated and nourished – as a “human potential enhancer,” as one West Coast entrepreneur told me, and life extender. “Sleep is the single most effective thing you can do to reset your brain and body,” Dr Walker of UC Berkeley said. “We have a saying in medicine: what gets measured, gets managed.” Sleep entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley and beyond have poured into the sleep space, as branders like to say – a $32bn market in 2012 – formerly inhabited by old-style mattress and pharmaceutical companies. “I can see sleep being another weapon in competitive parenting and career-building,” Salzman said. “If you want your child to succeed, do you have to buy them these sleep devices? Sleep is personal, it’s class, not mass, and now the sleep industry is based on technical services, customised for me. It’s a bizarre marriage of high tech and low tech. Chamomile tea is going to have a resurgence, as the antithesis to the whole pharma thing.” The Re-Timer, a pair of goggles fitted with tiny green-blue lights that shine back into your eyes, and aims to reset your body’s clock (NYT) The familiar paradigm of success used to centre on the narrative of the short sleeper: Corporate titans and world leaders – like Martha Stewart and the last two US presidents – counted abbreviated rest as proof of their prowess. It turns out that short sleepers, as they are known, may have a genetic mutation, as Arianna Huffington pointed out in her 2016 book, The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life One Night at a Time. (It’s worth noting that George W Bush, formerly a sleep outlier among his presidential peers for clocking in around nine hours of nightly shut-eye, along with a daily nap, is newly popular.) The US Army has proclaimed sleep a pillar of peak soldier performance. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, who used to take a sleeping bag to work when he was a lowly computer programmer, has said that his eight hours of sleep each night were good for his stockholders. Huffington’s new company, Thrive Global, whose first-round investors include the internet entrepreneur Sean Parker and the venture capital firm Greycroft Partners, is working with Accenture, JP Morgan Chase and Uber, among other companies, on anti-burnout programming, which educates their employees on the importance of sleep. Aetna, the healthcare company, is paying its workers up to $500 a year if they can prove they have slept for seven hours or more for 20 days in a row. But the growing pile of apps, gizmos and gurus – some from unlikely corners – has led to “pandemonium in the bedroom,” Rothstein said. In 2015, the actor Jeff Bridges made a spoken-word album, Dreaming With Jeff, a project for Squarespace, that reached No 2 on Billboard’s New Age chart and raised $280,000 for the No Kid Hungry campaign, for which he is the national spokesman. He collaborated with Keefus Ciancia, the composer and music producer, on a truly weird collection of quasi-bedtime stories, musings about death and also a humming song, with Bridges’ familiar gruff voice and all manner of ambient sounds that many listeners found more alarming than sleep-inducing. “I don’t know where this is leading,” Bridges said the other day, “but I’m steeping myself in the subject. We’re working on something called Sleep Club, which will be sort of a hub for all things sleep related.” Dreaming With Jeff made me anxious, as did Sleep With Me, a podcast by Drew Ackerman, a gravelly voiced librarian in San Francisco, whose “boring bedtime stories” are designed to cure insomnia and are downloaded at a rate of 1.3m a month, as The New Yorker reported last year. I’m more drawn to the thousands of “songs” in Spotify’s Sleep Sound Library, particularly “full gutters” and “office air-conditioners,” and I have a white noise machine. But recently, desperately, I craved a more substantial intervention, perhaps a cure for the 3am fretting that has plagued me for years. Mercier sent me his Dreem headset, a weighty crown of rubber and wire that he warned would be a tad uncomfortable. The finished product, which will cost about $400, he said, will be much lighter and slimmer. But it wasn’t the heft of the thing that had me pulling it off each night. It freaked me out that it was reading – and interfering with – my brain waves, a process I would rather not outsource. I was just as wary of the Re-Timer goggles $299, which make for a goofy/spooky selfie in a darkened room. My eye sockets glowed a deep fluorescent green, and terrified the cat. The Ghost Pillow, $85, has “patent-pending thermo-sensitivity technology” designed to keep your head cool. It is wildly comfy, but when I read what it is made from, a polyurethane foam, I lost sleep. I bought a Good Night Light LED Sleep bulb, $28, which comes with its own “patented technology” to support your body’s melatonin production. I can’t tell if that’s what happened, but since the bulb is too dim for my middle-aged eyes, I struggled to read my go-to sleep aid, a worn copy of The Pursuit of Love, by Nancy Mitford, and knocked off a good half-hour earlier than usual. I was up again at 3am, however, as my new Sense pod alerted me the next day, through an app on my phone. And again at 5am, when the cat swatted the pod off the night stand and it glowed red in protest. “There was a noise disturbance,” the app explained. My so-called sleep summary, as provided by Sense, was both compelling and off-putting. Why is my air quality “not ideal”? And how comfortable am I sharing my sleep habits with a Silicon Valley start-up? Rothstein, the sleep ambassador, is less bothered by privacy concerns than by the temptation to wakefulness that phone interfaces pose. And nearly every gizmo seemed to have one. “I’d like to have a survey done to show how many people are also reading their texts while they’re tracking their sleep,” Rothstein said. “If you want to improve your sleep, you have to make some changes. Your Fitbit and your Apple Watch are not going to do it for you. We’ve lost the simplicity of sleep. All this writing, all these websites, all this stuff. I’m thinking, Just sleep. I want to say: ‘Shh. Make it dark, quiet and cool. Take a bath.’” Read more Chinese surgeon pictured sleeping after 28-hour shift called hero Boost your beauty sleep with an overnight mask Analysing the way children sleep could help us to understand autism Inside the secret plane bedrooms where pilots sleep on flights Rothstein taught me her relaxation recipe, a practice that mixed gratitude with body awareness and breathing. Start with your toes, she said, and thank your body parts for their hard work. (My favourite: “Knees, I know it’s not always easy for you. You can rest now.”) Still, the best sleep I’ve had in weeks cost $22, and lasted 33 minutes. It was a Deep Rest “class” at Inscape, a meditation studio in the Chelsea neighbourhood of Manhattan designed by Winka Dubbeldam, the sought-after Dutch architect, to evoke the temple at Burning Man, and other esoteric spaces, and created by Khajak Keledjian, a founder, with his brother Haro, of Intermix, which they sold to the Gap for $130 million in 2013. Keledjian, a meditator, aims to make the practice both secular and modern: a “mindful luxury,” he said. Though there are human “facilitators” in each class, who gently touch the feet of snoring attendees if they get too loud, the practice is guided by a recording made by a female Australian member of Keledjian’s company. “We call her ‘Skye,’” he said. It was lunchtime on a rainy Tuesday, and I settled onto a soft mat outfitted with a bolster, a pillow and a cosy fleece blanket. “Skye” urged me to stay awake, and then delivered a script like Rothstein’s, in mellifluous antipodean tones. I drifted once or twice, and from the muffled snorts of the other attendees, they did too. That night, I slept until dawn. © New York Times More about: Sleep Health Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 59.44 points, or 0.29 percent, to 20,591.86. The S&P 500 lost 8.85 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,344.93. The Nasdaq Composite Index decreased 30.61 points, or 0.52 percent, to 5,836.16. The White House has accused Russia of trying to cover up the suspected chemical weapon attack in Syria, though U.S. President Donald Trump has said the United States will not launch a ground war in the Mideast country, according to Market Watch.

Airtel, controlled by billionaire Sunil Bharti Mittal, said that Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.’s Dhan Dhana Dhan plan -- which loosely translates to money, money, money in Hindi -- violates the spirit of the regulator’s directive and "essentially continues with a similar plan now masquerading under a different name." “This is a classic example of old wine in a new bottle,” Airtel’s spokesman said in a response to a text message. “The industry is in a very weak position and continues to bleed. With a weakened financial position companies will find it difficult to raise the capital to invest and roll out broadband networks.” The latest battle showcases the struggle to keep customers in the world’s second-largest mobile phone market where intense competition has prompted Vodafone Group Plc to combine its Indian unit with Idea Cellular Ltd. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India on Thursday “advised” billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Jio to stop a plan where customers who signed up for its unlimited Prime service at 303 rupees ($4.7) a month would get the first three months free. Five days later Jio started a program offering 90 days of service to clients for an additional 6 rupees.

According to the FBI, losses from BEC attacks have spiraled out of control, increasing by 1300 percent in the last 18 months. Webinar attendees will learn why BEC attacks bypass existing email security layers, as well as the top three ways to spot the identity deception that enables these attacks.

Utilities, phone companies and other high-dividend stocks were among the biggest gainers. Bond prices rose, sending yields lower. "The market is kind of on hold until we start getting earnings reports and you start to read the body language on what managements are saying," said Thomas Martin, portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta.

The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note fell to 2.25 percent from 2.32 percent late Tuesday. That's its lowest yield since November. "That's indicative of people, once more, taking that opinion of being risk-off, or not willing to make a bet that equity prices are going to be up because of higher earnings to be reported here for the first quarter," said Terry DuFrene, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Companies are due to begin disclosing their latest quarterly results over the next few weeks, beginning on Thursday with several big banks.

The stock fell the most among companies in the S&P 500, shedding $5.86 to $64.61. Industrials sector stocks were the biggest decliner in the S&P 500.

The stock lost $4.05 to $46.29. Other laggards in the sector included United Rentals, which slid $4.80, or 3.8 percent, to $121.13, and Rockwell Automation, which shed $5.88, or 3.8 percent, to $150.23. Investors bid up shares in Blackberry after arbitrators awarded the smartphone maker $814.9 million to resolve a dispute with Qualcomm over royalty overpayments. The stock gained $1.23, or 16 percent, to $8.93. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed. In Europe, Germany's DAX rose 0.1 percent, while France's CAC 40 dipped less than 0.1 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.2 percent.

Thursday, 13th April 2017 Twitter Facebook RSS Home Top Stories Local Africa International Business Opinion & Analysis Crime & Courts Entertainment Sport Advertise Cotton farmers seek favourable prices Shabanie get their man Wall Street slips as geopolitical risks gather, earnings loom April 13, 2017 Costa Mano International President Trump NEW YORK. – US stocks edged lower yesterday as investors assessed uncertainty stemming from rising geopolitical tensions and the upcoming corporate earnings season. The United States launched missiles at a Syrian airfield last week to retaliate a deadly chemical attack on civilians. The strikes pushed President Donald Trump, who came to power in January calling for warmer ties with Syria’s ally Russia, and his administration into confrontation with Moscow. Also, Chinese President Xi Jinping called on the US for a peaceful resolution with North Korea, which has warned it would launch a nuclear attack if provoked by the United States, as a US Navy strike group headed toward the western Pacific. The S&P 500 fell below its 50-day moving average, while the price of gold and VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose to their highest levels since November. At 10:57 am ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 52.9 points, or 0,26 percent, at 20,598.4, the S&P 500 was down 7.27 points, or 0,31 percent, at 2,346.51 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 19.45 points, or 0,33 percent, at 5,847.32. Earnings are likely to be the next catalyst for the market. The big banks, which have outperformed in a post-election rally since November, are of particular interest as investors fret over valuations amid a lack of clarity on Trump’s ability to deliver on his pro-growth policies of tax and regulatory cuts. President Xi Jinping Financials were the worst hit yesterday. The S&P 500 financial index .SPSY tumbled 0,91 percent, setting it up to post the fourth straight day of decline. “Technically, we are due for a breather and if the earnings season disappoints, it could provide the correction that we need,” said Josh Jalinski, president of Jalinski Advisory Group. JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report results today, which will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower. Utilities .SPLRCU, real estate .SPLRCR and consumer staples .SPLRCS, defensive sectors with slow but predictable growth, rose. Chipmaker Qualcomm dropped 2,8 percent to $53.81 after it was asked to refund Canada’s BlackBerry $814,9 million in an arbitration settlement. Delta Air Lines was up 3,5 percent at $46,90, boosted by a quarterly profit beat. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,869 to 846. On the Nasdaq, 1,832 issues fell and 776 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed nine 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 40 highs and 24 lows. -Reuters.

Trump said in a Wall Street Journal interview that the dollar "was getting too strong," though he also said he would like to see interest rates stay low. The dollar, which has risen along with prospects for higher rates, hurts profits at US multinationals when it strengthens. "Markets don't like uncertainty" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. "This just kind of added another wild card into the mix in a way, whether there will be actions taken to keep the dollar from strengthening further." Investors sought shelter in defensive shares and other low-risk assets. Industrials and materials were the biggest drags on the market along with financials, while utilities, staples and telecommunications gave the S&P 500 its biggest lift. The S&P financial index was down 0.9 percent a day ahead of results from three major banks in what will mark the start of the corporate earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings to have risen 10 percent for all S&P 500 companies in the first quarter, Thomson Reuters data shows. The materials and industrials indexes both ended more than 1 percent lower on the day. The S&P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average, a closely watched indicator of the intermediate-term trend, for the first time since Nov. 8. At the same time, gold and the CBOE Volatility index, Wall Street's fear gauge, rose. Rising US tensions with Russia, North Korea and Syria after U.S missile strikes in Syria last week and the moving of US warships toward the Korean Peninsula have kept investors cautious. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 59.44 points, or 0.29 percent, to 20,591.86, the S&P 500 lost 8.85 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,344.93 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 30.61 points, or 0.52 percent, to 5,836.16. Investors are concerned these developments could distract Trump from pursuing pro-business policies such as tax cuts, simpler regulations and higher infrastructure spending, promises that have powered Wall Street to record highs since his election in November. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan are due to report results on Thursday, the last trading day of the week ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Delta Air Lines closed down 0.5 percent at $45.05 despite a better-than-expected quarterly profit and an upbeat forecast for current-quarter passenger unit revenue. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 51 new highs and 42 new lows. About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, compared with the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.     Copyright Reuters, 2017 Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Mail Print the author Shoaib Ur Rehman Siddiqui Previous Energy losses lead TSX lower; BlackBerry jumps to 1-year high Next Dollar, Treasury yields, stocks fall on Trump currency comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

With an updated view on the major banking industry, more concerns from earlier this year can be addressed. Currently, there are concerns in the industry over a still-slow economy and policy uncertainty, which can weigh on loan growth, as well as higher rates affecting mortgage origination volumes. However, there is a positive side. Higher rates are helping net interest margins, credit quality remains excellent and capital return is expected to be higher again in this year’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test process. As a result, one key analyst thinks that first-quarter results will not be mind-blowing, but instead believes estimates are still biased upward as more rate hikes get built in, deposit betas remain low and credit loss/provision levels prove lower-for-longer. After considering the current climate for banking stocks, Jefferies picked out a couple of its top ideas going forward. Although Jefferies is positive on these stocks, what might happen is still up in the air until they report Thursday morning. 24/7 Wall St. has included the consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters, a recent trading history and a little color for each major bank. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C): The consensus estimates call for $1.24 in earnings per share (EPS), as well as $17.83 in revenue. Shares were last seen at $58.60 on Wednesday. The consensus analyst price target is $64.74. The stock has a 52-week trading range of $38.31 to $62.53. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM): The analysts’ consensus estimates are EPS of $1.52 and $24.88 billion in revenue. Shares were recently trading at $85.43, with a consensus price target is $91.22. The stock has a 52-week range of $57.05 to $93.98. Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC): The consensus analyst estimates call for EPS of $0.97 and $22.3 billion in revenue. Wells Fargo was trading at $53.42. The consensus price target is $59.07. The 52-week trading range is $43.55 to $59.99.

She may be the dove he needs, analysts say By Greg Robb Published: Apr 12, 2017 5:42 p.m. ET Share Reappointing Fed chief not likely to overreact to Trump’s stimulus plans By GregRobb Senior economics reporter Reuters President Donald Trump may have changed his mind about Janet Yellen. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen is the dove that President Donald Trump needs to achieve his economic goals, central bank experts said Wednesday as they contemplated the apparent reversal in his stance. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said he had respect for Yellen and said she was “not toast” when her term helming the central bank ends next year. “I do like a low-interest rate policy, I have to be honest with you,” Trump said in the interview. That’s not what Trump said last year: “I have nothing against Janet Yellen whatsoever, she’s very capable person. But she’s not a Republican,” Trump said. “When her time is up I would most likely replace because of the fact it would be appropriate.” Economists said Trump’s ambitious goals for tax reform and infrastructure spending could provide a strong does of fiscal stimulus. The economy is already growing about as fast as it can without sparking inflation. So having a hawk on the Fed might lead to rapid rate hikes. But Yellen has shown over the past four years that she favors a gradual approach and might take a more wait-and-see attitude. Yellen is “the safest dovish choice” for Trump, said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist for Standish Mellon Asset Management in Boston and a former top Fed economist. One way around a collision between the Fed and the Trump White House is to have “a relatively accommodative Federal Reserve,” and Yellen is probably “the most market friendly person to deliver that,” Reinhart said. “People appreciate that Yellen’s dovishness is situational. She is not one to do anything to ultimately threaten the Fed’s pursuit of 2% inflation,” he said. Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI, said it was still unlikely that Trump will end up offering Yellen a second term. Trump will just avoid appointing “outright hawks” to the Fed board of governors, he said. In an interview with MarketWatch last month, Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said Trump was, at heart, a low-interest-rate guy, despite the comments in the campaign. Trump used just those words in the interview published Wednesday. Reinhart said the biggest hurdle to a second term for Yellen would be the reaction from Senate Republicans, many of whom favor having the Fed follow a simple policy rule. Guha said it might be hard for Trump to find a new Fed chief who favors following a rule but isn’t hawkish. “This is because most conventional policy rules...already call for a materially more hawkish path for rates than the Fed currently indicates is likely to be warranted,” he said in a note to clients. Jim Glassman, chief economist for commercial banking at J.P. Morgan Chase, said that there is a lot of respect for Yellen in financial markets and continuity would be “worth a lot.” No matter what, Trump’s comments have completely changed the contest to be the next Fed chief, Reinhart said. “Now every candidate is going to be compared with how dovish they will be relative to Yellen,” he said. Guha said this raises the risk for the bond market that Trump’s nominations to the Fed may not be hawkish or independent enough.

Bloomberg3:44 UP NEXT Mark 2016 as the latest Year of the Stock Picker that wasn't. Active funds stumbled through another brutal year, with barely 1 in 3 large-cap managers able to beat the S&P 500 (.SPX), according to figures released Wednesday by S&P Dow Jones Indices. The news got worse farther down the scale, with 89.4 percent of mid-cap managers falling short and 85.5 percent of small-cap managers missing. Quotes in the article SPX Corp SPXC ▼ 23.05 -0.75 -3.15% 360 Capital Group TGP ▼ 0.9550 -0.0100 -1.04% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 85.40 -0.33 -0.38% AdChoices Things didn't get better over longer time frames either, with most managers falling short over 1-, 3-, 5-, 10- and 15-year spans. The numbers come amid a pitched market debate over the benefits of active against passive management, and seemingly annual predictions that stock-picking finally will prevail. Active managers oversee funds for which they move in and out of individual stocks, utilizing a variety of strategies, while passive funds track indexes and don't employ professional managers. Active funds generally carry much higher fees. Investors have been shoveling money into passive strategies. Exchange-traded funds, most of which track indexes, saw record inflows of cash during the first quarter on both the stock and bond side. In 2016, passive funds attracted a net $508.4 billion while active suffered $340.1 billion in outflows, according to Morningstar. "Its been a dismal backdrop in a dismal environment for active. The numbers prove that," said Nick Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex. "Does that mean that environment will last forever? Markets always go in cycles." Colas believes a decline in correlations, or the tendency of stocks to move in unison that has been pronounced during the current bull market, will benefit active managers looking to capitalize on pricing discrepancies. But the latest report on active management performance, in the closely watched SPIVA U.S. Scorecard from S&P, paints an even bleaker picture over the long term. For the first time, the scorecard tracked 15-year performance to capture what it considers a "complete market cycle." In that period, 92.2 percent of large-cap managers missed their marks, while the number was 95.4 percent for mid-caps and 93.2 percent for small-caps. It's probably no wonder, then, that more than 58 percent of U.S. equity funds either folded or merged during the 15-year time frame. To be sure, the scorecard is sometimes discounted because S&P sells index products. However, the underperformance of active jibes at least in a broad sense with measures from other sources on Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, reported that active managers actually have gotten off to a stronger start in 2017, but the beat rate for large-cap is barely better than half at 52 percent. Advocates of active management stress that investors need to know what factors to look for in managers, including performance, strategy and market conditions. Bob Doll, senior portfolio manager at Nuveen Asset Management, said market conditions are conducive this year for his side of Wall Street. Among them: the likelihood that small-cap stocks will outperform this year, that international will outperform the U.S., and that value stocks are topping growth, by a wide margin. "Among these factors are the tailwinds that enable active managers, given their portfolio construction, to win, and we're heading into that environment," he said in a video presentation for clients. "So this should be a good year." Investors who want the possibility of getting outsized returns need to screen managers for various qualities, said Steve Deschenes, product management and analytics director at Capital Group, which runs American Funds and manages more than $1.4 trillion in assets. Among desirable qualities are lower fees and managers who own the investments they are endorsing for clients, he said. "Once you incorporate reasonable screens that any reasonable advisor and certainly most practitioners employ, you can drastically improve your success rate," Deschenes said. "It doesn't really matter if 20 percent of managers beat the index. What matters is, can you identify the 20 percent and take advantage of that identification in your portfolio?" Indeed, performance among different strategies has differed considerably, though all have still fallen considerably short of market benchmarks. Over the past three years, for instance, just 4.4 percent of large-cap growth managers have outperformed, while the number is 11.4 percent for large-cap value. The best performance over the three-year span was for multi-cap value funds, which had a 17.8 percent beat rate.

"Nothing seems to be happening or not happening as fast as people would like it to happen," said Peter Coleman, the head trader at Convergex. Other traditional haven assets rose, building on gains from Tuesday' session. Gold futures for June delivery rose 0.2 percent to $1,276.60 per barrel, while the dollar hit its lowest level since Nov. 17 against the Japanese yen. "There's a lot of uncertainty that's really hard to model. That's why you're seeing this give-and-take [in stocks] and the uptick in volatility," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Moscow on Wednesday and received a barrage of criticism from several Russian officials. Ahead of a meeting with Tillerson, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that he wanted to know what the real intentions of the U.S. administration are, following its missile strikes in Syria. All that said, stocks have held their ground this week. The three major indexes are just marginally lower for the week. "We are concerned about Syria and Russia, ... but at the same time we have a very resilient market," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. "That could change if one of these geopolitical hotspots heats up, and there's no way to fully price that in." Geopolitical tensions have been brewing ahead of a highly anticipated earnings seasons. Earnings are expected to have grown around 10 percent in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales, meanwhile, are expected to have grown the most since 2011. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are scheduled to report Thursday morning. Delta Air Lines, meanwhile, posted better-than-expected results, sending its stock higher in the premarket. Investors were also trying to get a sense of the Trump administration's priorities. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday he wants to tackle health care reform before implementing new tax policy. "I have to do healthcare first, I want to do it first to really do it right," Trump said. Stocks rallied after Trump was elected in part because of the prospects of lower taxes, deregulation and fiscal policy. "The market has known this for a while. He didn't say anything new," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. "The question is how far along health care is, because depending on what they get done there, they'll know what kind of tax reform they can get." Financials were among the worst decliners as U.S. Treasury yields fell. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF was last trading about 1.5 percent lower. The financials led the post-election market rally on promises of pro-growth policies but were trading lower for the year so far on Wednesday. Boeing and Caterpillar had the greatest negative impact on the Dow, which fell more than 50 points below its 50-day moving average, a level it has not closed under since Nov. 7.

Posted 12 Apr 2017 19:30 Updated 13 Apr 2017 06:30 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the Manhattan borough of New York, New York, U.S., April 4, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks eased on Wednesday and the S&P 500 closed below a key technical level for the first time since Election Day, pressured by lingering geopolitical concerns and President Donald Trump's comments on the dollar and interest rates. Trump said in a Wall Street Journal interview that the dollar "was getting too strong," though he also said he would like to see interest rates stay low. The dollar, which has risen along with prospects for higher rates, hurts profits at U.S. multinationals when it strengthens. "Markets don't like uncertainty," said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. "This just kind of added another wild card into the mix in a way, whether there will be actions taken to keep the dollar from strengthening further." Investors sought shelter in defensive shares and other low-risk assets. Industrials and materials were the biggest drags on the market along with financials, while utilities, staples and telecommunications gave the S&P 500 its biggest lift. The S&P financial index was down 0.9 percent a day ahead of results from three major banks in what will mark the start of the corporate earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings to have risen 10 percent for all S&P 500 companies in the first quarter, Thomson Reuters data shows. The materials and industrials indexes both ended more than 1 percent lower on the day. In a sign that further weakness may be ahead, the S&P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 8. The CBOE Volatility index , Wall Street's fear gauge, extended recent gains, a day after it closed above 15 for the first time since the election. Rising U.S. tensions with Russia, North Korea and Syria after U.S missile strikes in Syria last week and the moving of U.S. warships toward the Korean Peninsula have kept investors cautious. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 59.44 points, or 0.29 percent, to 20,591.86, the S&P 500 lost 8.85 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,344.93 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 30.61 points, or 0.52 percent, to 5,836.16. Investors are concerned these developments could distract Trump from pursuing pro-business policies such as tax cuts, simpler regulations and higher infrastructure spending, promises that have powered Wall Street to record highs since his election in November. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan are due to report results on Thursday, the last trading day of the week ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Delta Air Lines closed down 0.5 percent at US$45.05 despite a better-than-expected quarterly profit and an upbeat forecast for current-quarter passenger unit revenue. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 51 new highs and 42 new lows. About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

She previously worked for the Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones as an editor and a reporter. Follow @nishagopalanhk Facebook Twitter Email Print Share April 12, 2017 4:00 PM EDT TOSHIBA CORP -11.10 At Closing, April 13th 210.10 JPY BLACKROCK INC -2.61 At Closing, April 12th 381.44 USD In a country where government bailouts are common and with an alluring semiconductor unit that could net billions, Toshiba Corp. will probably stay in business even as it reels from record losses and the bankruptcy of its Westinghouse Electric nuclear energy unit. But a more pressing worry for investors is that with negative shareholder equity of 225.7 billion yen ($2.1 billion) for the third quarter, one of Japan Inc.'s fastest-fading stars is headed straight for another demotion -- out of blue-chip status and into a much less liquid section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It's going to be goodbye BlackRock Inc., and hello Mrs. Watanabe. If Toshiba's shareholder equity stays negative for the fourth quarter ended March 31 -- and there's a big chance it did -- it loses its Topix listing, which of course may happen anyway if it keeps missing results reporting deadlines. The Other Side of the Looking Glass The value of Toshiba shareholders' equity just turned negative Source: Bloomberg Note: Shown net of equity attributed to non-controlling interests. Being relegated to the so-called second section of the TSE means a less liquid universe of investors, devoid of exchange-traded and passive-index funds. The second section's free float market capitalization is less than 1 percent of the Topix, and according to Travis Lundy, an analyst who publishes on Smartkarma, Toshiba could see between 12 and 15 percent of its free float shareholder base, which consists of passive investors in Topix index funds, disappear from the register. Although the Japanese company's biggest owner currently is activist hedge fund Effissimo Capital Management Pte, which disclosed Friday it boosted its stake to 9.8 percent, Toshiba has historically been a favorite of more staid institutions, like BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Big and Boring Toshiba's top shareholders include global funds like Capital Group, BlackRock and JPMorgan Source: Bloomberg Note: GPIF is Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund; Effissimo is a hedge fund set up by former colleagues of Japanese activist investor Yoshiaki Murakami. Unlike Sharp Corp., whose travails saw it also moved to the second section, a foreign rescue of Toshiba is probably not on the cards. But equally, the company's warning Tuesday that it may not be able to continue as a going concern because of losses from its Westinghouse Electric nuclear business needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Toshiba, which traces its roots to 1875 as Japan's first manufacturer of telegraph equipment, will likely be the recipient of some sort of government bailout, or at least the offer of one. That was the case with Sharp, before Foxconn Technology Group's buyout, and Tokyo Electric Power Co. in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. And while authorities in Tokyo aren't keen for the Chinese to buy Toshiba's chip business, the unit will have plenty of other suitors. Toshiba projected annual loss 1.01 trillion yen In the meantime, Toshiba's inevitable slide into share market obscurity should concern investors. Large companies with negative shareholder equity aren't unheard of in the West, with names like McDonald's Corp. and Air France-KLM in the club. The big difference is most are actually making money. As a second-section member, Toshiba can expect more retail investor participation, and increased stock volatility. Reduced liquidity will make it harder, and costlier, to raise funds. Plus there's the prestige, or lack of it. A 142-year-old company, and it's come to this. Whichever way you cut it, the outlook doesn't look good.

She may be the dove he needs, analysts say By Greg Robb Published: Apr 12, 2017 5:42 p.m. ET Share Reappointing Fed chief not likely to overreact to Trump’s stimulus plans By GregRobb Senior economics reporter Reuters President Donald Trump may have changed his mind about Janet Yellen. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen is the dove that President Donald Trump needs to achieve his economic goals, central bank experts said Wednesday as they contemplated the apparent reversal in his stance. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said he had respect for Yellen and said she was “not toast” when her term helming the central bank ends next year. “I do like a low-interest rate policy, I have to be honest with you,” Trump said in the interview. That’s not what Trump said last year: “I have nothing against Janet Yellen whatsoever, she’s very capable person. But she’s not a Republican,” Trump said. “When her time is up I would most likely replace because of the fact it would be appropriate.” Economists said Trump’s ambitious goals for tax reform and infrastructure spending could provide a strong does of fiscal stimulus. The economy is already growing about as fast as it can without sparking inflation. So having a hawk on the Fed might lead to rapid rate hikes. But Yellen has shown over the past four years that she favors a gradual approach and might take a more wait-and-see attitude. Yellen is “the safest dovish choice” for Trump, said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist for Standish Mellon Asset Management in Boston and a former top Fed economist. One way around a collision between the Fed and the Trump White House is to have “a relatively accommodative Federal Reserve,” and Yellen is probably “the most market friendly person to deliver that,” Reinhart said. “People appreciate that Yellen’s dovishness is situational. She is not one to do anything to ultimately threaten the Fed’s pursuit of 2% inflation,” he said. Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI, said it was still unlikely that Trump will end up offering Yellen a second term. Trump will just avoid appointing “outright hawks” to the Fed board of governors, he said. In an interview with MarketWatch last month, Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said Trump was, at heart, a low-interest-rate guy, despite the comments in the campaign. Trump used just those words in the interview published Wednesday. Reinhart said the biggest hurdle to a second term for Yellen would be the reaction from Senate Republicans, many of whom favor having the Fed follow a simple policy rule. Guha said it might be hard for Trump to find a new Fed chief who favors following a rule but isn’t hawkish. “This is because most conventional policy rules...already call for a materially more hawkish path for rates than the Fed currently indicates is likely to be warranted,” he said in a note to clients. Jim Glassman, chief economist for commercial banking at J.P. Morgan Chase, said that there is a lot of respect for Yellen in financial markets and continuity would be “worth a lot.” No matter what, Trump’s comments have completely changed the contest to be the next Fed chief, Reinhart said. “Now every candidate is going to be compared with how dovish they will be relative to Yellen,” he said. Guha said this raises the risk for the bond market that Trump’s nominations to the Fed may not be hawkish or independent enough. More from MarketWatch Thyroid Cancer: Link to Household Products?

Trump said in a Wall Street Journal interview that the dollar "was getting too strong," though he also said he would like to see interest rates stay low. The dollar, which has risen along with prospects for higher rates, hurts profits at U.S. multinationals when it strengthens. "Markets don't like uncertainty" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. "This just kind of added another wild card into the mix in a way, whether there will be actions taken to keep the dollar from strengthening further." Investors sought shelter in defensive shares and other low-risk assets. Industrials and materials were the biggest drags on the market along with financials, while utilities, staples and telecommunications gave the S&P 500 its biggest lift. The S&P financial index was down 0.9 percent a day ahead of results from three major banks in what will mark the start of the corporate earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings to have risen 10 percent for all S&P 500 companies in the first quarter, Thomson Reuters data shows. The materials and industrials indexes both ended more than 1 percent lower on the day. The S&P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average, a closely watched indicator of the intermediate-term trend, for the first time since Nov. 8. At the same time, gold and the CBOE Volatility index, Wall Street's fear gauge, rose. Rising U.S. tensions with Russia, North Korea and Syria after U.S missile strikes in Syria last week and the moving of U.S. warships toward the Korean Peninsula have kept investors cautious. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 59.44 points, or 0.29 percent, to 20,591.86, the S&P 500 lost 8.85 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,344.93 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 30.61 points, or 0.52 percent, to 5,836.16. Investors are concerned these developments could distract Trump from pursuing pro-business policies such as tax cuts, simpler regulations and higher infrastructure spending, promises that have powered Wall Street to record highs since his election in November. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan are due to report results on Thursday, the last trading day of the week ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Delta Air Lines closed down 0.5 percent at $45.05 despite a better-than-expected quarterly profit and an upbeat forecast for current-quarter passenger unit revenue. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 51 new highs and 42 new lows. About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

With the drop on the day, the major averages added to the modest losses posted in the previous session. The major averages ended the day in the red but off their worst levels of the day. The Dow dipped 59.44 points or 0.3 percent to 20,591.86, the Nasdaq slid 30.61 points or 0.5 percent to 5,836.16 and the S&P 500 fell 8.85 points or 0.4 percent to 2,344.93. The modest weakness on Wall Street came amid lingering geopolitical concerns as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. On the U.S. economic front, the Labor Department released a report showing an unexpected decline in import prices in the month of March. The Labor Department said import prices dipped by 0.2 percent in March after climbing by a revised 0.4 percent in February. The decrease came as a surprise to economists, who had expected import prices to inch up by 0.1 percent compared to the 0.2 percent increase originally reported for the previous month. Meanwhile, the report said export prices rose by 0.2 percent in March following a 0.3 percent increase in February. Export prices had been expected to tick up by 0.1 percent. The economic calendar picks up in the coming days, including with the release of some key data while the markets are closed on Friday. Reports on retail sales, producer and consumer prices, and import and export prices may attract attention later this week. On the earnings front, financial giants Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) are due to report their quarterly results on Thursday. Steel stocks showed a substantial move to the downside on the day, dragging the NYSE Arca Steel Index down by 4.7 percent. With the drop, the index fell to its lowest closing level in over three months. Considerable weakness was also visible among railroad stocks, as reflected by 2 percent slump by the Dow Jones Railroads Index. Greenbrier (GBX) and Trinity Industries (TRN) turned in two of the sector's worst performances. Oil service, semiconductor and trucking stocks also saw notable weakness, moving lower along with most of the other major sectors. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slumped by 1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced by 0.9 percent. The major European markets also finished the day mixed. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index edged down by 0.2 percent, the German DAX Index inched up by 0.1 percent and the French CAC 40 Index closed just above the unchanged line. In the bond market, treasuries ended the day roughly flat following the rally seen in the previous session. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, edged down by less than a basis point to 2.296 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Unhappy Campers: The 10 Most Miserable Nations on Earth Feeling Groovy: The 10 Countries With the Best Health Care The Ten Largest Economies In Africa Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories The Smokehouse Of NY Recalls Smoked Fish Products AERI's Rocket Hits Target, ENTL Gets FDA Nod, NOVN Jumps On Positive Trial Data European Shares Poised For Weak Start As Trump Talks Down Dollar China's Exports Rebound, Imports Growth Slows In March Singapore Keeps Monetary Policy Unchanged Food Delivery Robots Debut In San Francisco Asian Markets Mostly Lower Gainers & Losers Of Apr.12: ADPT, NBIX, NOVN, PLX, ALBO...

 STOCKS DIP: Here's what you need to know Elena Holodny Apr. 12, 2017, 4:00 PM 883 facebook linkedin twitter email print Stoyan Nenov/Reuters Stocks started the morning off in the red and never cracked into the green. All major indices finished down. Notably, this is the first time since election week the Dow and the S&P have closed below their 50-day moving, according to CNBC's Carl Quintanilla. First up, the scoreboard: Dow: 20,591.86, -59.44, (-0.29%) S&P 500: 2,344.93, -8.85, (-0.38%) Nasdaq: 5,836.16, -30.61, (-0.52%) US 10-year yield: 2.264%, -0.051 WTI crude oil: $52.90, -0.50, -0.94% 1. The new director of the Office of Management and Budget said Trump's promise to eliminate America's $20 trillion problem was "hyperbole." "It's fairly safe to assume that was hyperbole," Mulvaney told CNBC's John Harwood. "I'm not going to be able to pay off $20 trillion worth of debt in four years. I'd be being dishonest with you if I said that I could." 2. Trump said the US dollar is too strong partially because of him. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said: "I think our dollar is getting too strong, and partially that’s my fault because people have confidence in me. But that’s hurting — that will hurt ultimately." 3. Chris Christie asked the Trump administration to help stop the United Airlines fiasco from happening again. "As you are aware, every day passengers are 'bumped off' flights under authority given to United Airlines under 14 CFR Part 250. The practice has become unconscionable by United and is abusing passengers coming into Newark Airport and around the nation without cause," Christie wrote in a letter to the Secretary of Transpiration Elaine Chao. 4. The Bank of Canada held rates again at 0.5%. "Global economic growth is strengthening and becoming more broadly-based than the Bank had expected in its January Monetary Policy Report, although there is still considerable uncertainty about the outlook," the bank said in the accompanying statement. 5. Even doctors are getting priced out of San Francisco's housing market. Medical practitioners such as anesthesiologists and surgeons occupy the top nine spots in the Bureau of Labor Statistics' ranking of the highest-paying jobs in America. But by comparing doctors' annual median salary to the median house price in San Francisco, Trulia found only 41.6% of homes to be affordable even for them. 6. The rand climbed after thousands of South Africans gathered to protest against the president. The currency was up by 2.1% at 13.5226 in late afternoon trade ET.  7. The rally in infrastructure stocks has stalled. Infrastructure stocks soared after Trump's election win, with the S&P 500 Materials sector gaining nearly 13% before topping out at the beginning of March. However, all of these stocks have given up a portion of their post-election gains. 8. A top trader at Credit Suisse just quit to take a role at JPMorgan. Matt Mallgrave, head of US equity flow trading at Credit Suisse, resigned today, according to people familiar with the matter. He is set to join JPMorgan, the people said. ADDITIONALLY: Nomura on South Africa's political crisis: "this is not a 'normal' sentiment shock, nor a brief negative to be reversed shortly after." Fischer's secret speech shows the Fed has learned nothing from its leak scandal. There are a few simple ways Trump could cause Obamacare to "explode." David Einhorn accused GM of sabotaging him. China appears to be making a key concession on North Korea. Trump's budget chief suggests a government shutdown wouldn't be that bad.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    More than eight years after it started, bitcoin reportedly isn’t living up to early hype as the payment system of the future. As The Wall Street Journal recently reported: “The virtual currency still feels more virtual than real.” Bitcoin is a virtual currency that can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government, Reuters reported. The currency's anonymity has however made it popular with drug dealers, money launderers and organised crime groups, meaning governments and the financial establishment have been slow to embrace it since the first trade in 2009. The currency’s value hit record levels in 2017, trading at $1,145 on Wednesday, a fivefold increase in a year, amid growing interest globally. Bitcoin “has failed to emerge as a mainstream payment method among consumers. The Securities and Exchange Commission denied two applications last month for bitcoin-related funds, nixing an avenue for widespread investor adoption that could have boosted bitcoin’s relevance and profile,” the Journal explained. “It doesn’t feel like it’s going in the right direction,” Brian Hoffman, chief executive of OB1, which runs an online marketplace called OpenBazaar that accepts bitcoin, told the Journal. Bitcoin has been slow to gain endorsements from any major economic gurus. If anything, it has drawn criticism. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has said bitcoin "is going nowhere... There is nothing behind a bitcoin, and I think if it was big, the governments would stop it." (Newsmax wire services contributed to this report).   Related Stories: Ed Moy: Bitcoin and the Re-democratization of Money Ben Bernanke: Bitcoin Has 'Serious Problems' FT: The Bitcoin Magic Is Losing Its Midas Touch Telegraph's Evans-Pritchard: Central Banks Beat Bitcoin At Own Game © 2017 Newsmax Finance.

Industrials and materials were the biggest drags along with financials, while utilities, staples and telecommunications gave the S&P 500 its biggest lift. The S&P financial index was down 0.7 percent a day before three major banks are due to report results in what will be the start of the corporate earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings to have risen 10 percent in the first quarter, Thomson Reuters data shows. "Short term, it's more policy driven than it is earnings driven," said Mark Lamkin, chief executive of Lamkin Wealth Management in Louisville, Kentucky. But, he said, "Eventually the market always follows earnings. If we get closer to that double-digit gain, we'll stay fully invested. If that surprises to the light side, we'll get more defensive." The United States launched missiles at a Syrian airfield last week to retaliate for a deadly gas attack on civilians. The strikes pushed President Donald Trump, who came to power in January calling for warmer ties with Syria's ally Russia, and his administration into confrontation with Moscow. Investors are concerned that these developments could distract Trump from pursuing pro-business policies such as tax cuts, simpler regulations and higher infrastructure spending, promises that have powered Wall Street to record highs since his election in November.

By: Bloomberg | Published: April 13, 2017 12:16 AM Airtel said that it hopes the regulator will act against the offer. (Reuters) Bharti Airtel Ltd., India’s biggest mobile-phone service provider, has asked the telecom regulator to intervene after the country’s newest operator started an offer to lure customers that was similar to a previous program stopped by authorities. Airtel, controlled by billionaire Sunil Bharti Mittal, said that Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.’s Dhan Dhana Dhan plan — which loosely translates to money, money, money in Hindi — violates the spirit of the regulator’s directive and “essentially continues with a similar plan now masquerading under a different name.” “This is a classic example of old wine in a new bottle,” Airtel’s spokesman said in a response to a text message. “The industry is in a very weak position and continues to bleed. With a weakened financial position companies will find it difficult to raise the capital to invest and roll out broadband networks.” You may also like to watch: The latest battle showcases the struggle to keep customers in the world’s second-largest mobile phone market where intense competition has prompted Vodafone Group Plc to combine its Indian unit with Idea Cellular Ltd. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India on Thursday “advised” billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Jio to stop a plan where customers who signed up for its unlimited Prime service at 303 rupees ($4.7) a month would get the first three months free. Five days later Jio started a program offering 90 days of service to clients for an additional 6 rupees. “Essentially, the offer seems broadly similar,” to the one the regulator halted, Viju George, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Indian unit, wrote in a report on Wednesday. “If criteria for the determination of unfair pricing aggression are not identified or enforced, RJio could probably continue to get away even as it desists from free offers in the future.” Airtel said that it hopes the regulator will act against the offer. RS Sharma, chairman of the regulator did not answer four calls to his mobile phone and didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. Jio didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. Jio, which has more than 72 million Prime subscribers, stormed into India’s crowded mobile operator market by offering free services for a period that was extended until March 31.

Performance actually got worse over longer time frames, with more than 90 percent missing benchmarks over a 15-year period. Active managers are hoping the climate is changing to their benefit. Jeff Cox | @JeffCoxCNBCcom 12 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Active hedge fund managers investing in passive funds    Tuesday, 11 Apr 2017 | 4:41 PM ET | 01:23 Mark 2016 as the latest Year of the Stock Picker that wasn't. Active funds stumbled through another brutal year, with barely 1 in 3 large-cap managers able to beat the S&P 500, according to figures released Wednesday by S&P Dow Jones Indices. The news got worse farther down the scale, with 89.4 percent of mid-cap managers falling short and 85.5 percent of small-cap managers missing. Things didn't get better over longer time frames either, with most managers falling short over 1-, 3-, 5-, 10- and 15-year spans. The numbers come amid a pitched market debate over the benefits of active against passive management, and seemingly annual predictions that stock-picking finally will prevail. Active managers oversee funds for which they move in and out of individual stocks, utilizing a variety of strategies, while passive funds track indexes and don't employ professional managers. Active funds generally carry much higher fees. Investors have been shoveling money into passive strategies. Exchange-traded funds, most of which track indexes, saw record inflows of cash during the first quarter on both the stock and bond side. In 2016, passive funds attracted a net $508.4 billion while active suffered $340.1 billion in outflows, according to Morningstar. "Its been a dismal backdrop in a dismal environment for active. The numbers prove that," said Nick Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex. "Does that mean that environment will last forever? Markets always go in cycles." Colas believes a decline in correlations, or the tendency of stocks to move in unison that has been pronounced during the current bull market, will benefit active managers looking to capitalize on pricing discrepancies. Timothy A. Clary | AFP | Getty Images A pedestrian stands on the steps of Federal Hall in the rain outside the the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). But the latest report on active management performance, in the closely watched SPIVA U.S. Scorecard from S&P, paints an even bleaker picture over the long term. For the first time, the scorecard tracked 15-year performance to capture what it considers a "complete market cycle." In that period, 92.2 percent of large-cap managers missed their marks, while the number was 95.4 percent for mid-caps and 93.2 percent for small-caps. It's probably no wonder, then, that more than 58 percent of U.S. equity funds either folded or merged during the 15-year time frame. To be sure, the scorecard is sometimes discounted because S&P sells index products. However, the underperformance of active jibes at least in a broad sense with measures from other sources on Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, reported that active managers actually have gotten off to a stronger start in 2017, but the beat rate for large-cap is barely better than half at 52 percent. Advocates of active management stress that investors need to know what factors to look for in managers, including performance, strategy and market conditions. Bob Doll, senior portfolio manager at Nuveen Asset Management, said market conditions are conducive this year for his side of Wall Street. Among them: the likelihood that small-cap stocks will outperform this year, that international will outperform the U.S., and that value stocks are topping growth, by a wide margin. "Among these factors are the tailwinds that enable active managers, given their portfolio construction, to win, and we're heading into that environment," he said in a video presentation for clients. "So this should be a good year." show chapters The passive active debate    Tuesday, 4 Apr 2017 | 10:24 PM ET | 02:07 Investors who want the possibility of getting outsized returns need to screen managers for various qualities, said Steve Deschenes, product management and analytics director at Capital Group, which runs American Funds and manages more than $1.4 trillion in assets. Among desirable qualities are lower fees and managers who own the investments they are endorsing for clients, he said. "Once you incorporate reasonable screens that any reasonable advisor and certainly most practitioners employ, you can drastically improve your success rate," Deschenes said. "It doesn't really matter if 20 percent of managers beat the index. What matters is, can you identify the 20 percent and take advantage of that identification in your portfolio?" Indeed, performance among different strategies has differed considerably, though all have still fallen considerably short of market benchmarks. Over the past three years, for instance, just 4.4 percent of large-cap growth managers have outperformed, while the number is 11.4 percent for large-cap value. The best performance over the three-year span was for multi-cap value funds, which had a 17.8 percent beat rate. Here's a look at how all fund categories performed: Correction: An earlier version mischaracterized the percentage of managers who beat the S&P 500.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Apr 12, 2017 at 1:11PM Few things are more important when it comes to identifying a great bank to invest in than efficiency. But as a review of the most efficient big bank in the United States proves, this doesn't necessarily mean that highly efficient banks spend the least amount of money on expenses. The bank I'm referring to is PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), a $366 billion regional bank headquartered in Pittsburgh. In 2016, its efficiency ratio, which measures the percent of revenue spent on expenses, came in at 52.5%. The average among big banks, meanwhile, was 62%, or nearly 10 percentage points higher. William Demchak, the chairman and CEO of PNC Financial. Image source; PNC Financial. This gives PNC Financial a major advantage. It means that a larger share of its revenue falls to the bottom line and is therefore available to reward shareholders, be it through an increase in retained earnings, dividends, and/or buybacks. There's also reason to believe that efficient banks are better at minimizing loan defaults. This is because less efficient banks have an incentive to make up for the lost ground by reaching for yield (and therefore risk) in their loan portfolios. This increases the revenue an inefficient bank earns from its loans, as less creditworthy borrowers pay higher interest rates, but it raises the likelihood of defaults on those loans in the future. This is why there are few metrics more important for bank investors to be familiar with than the efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing a bank's noninterest expenses by its net revenue. Most banks target a ratio below 60%, but PNC Financial's is obviously much lower. It's tempting to think that PNC accomplished this by driving down expenses. We are, after all, talking about efficiency. But if you dig deeper into how PNC Financial has separated itself from the pack, it's clear that expenses aren't the main driver. You can see this by looking at how much PNC Financial spends on expenses relative to its size. Last year, it spent the equivalent of 2.59% of its assets on operating costs. That's not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but there are multiple banks that come in below it, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup. Bank Expenses as a Percent of Assets (2016) PNC Financial 2.59% Bank of America 2.51% Citigroup 2.31% JPMorgan Chase 2.24% Data source: Regulatory filings, author calculations. Keep in mind that all three of these banks have higher efficiency ratios than PNC Financial – meaning they're less efficient. Bank of America comes in at 66%, Citigroup at 59%, and JPMorgan Chase at 58%. So, if expenses aren't the main driver of efficiency, what is? The answer is: revenue. Take a look at the table below which compares how much revenue these same four banks earn as a percent of assets. Bank Revenue as a Percent of Assets (2016) PNC Financial 4.92% Citigroup 3.90% JPMorgan Chase 3.84% Bank of America 3.83% Data source: Regulatory filings, author calculations. As you can see, while PNC Financial may spend more than these other banks do on expenses on a size-adjusted basis, it more than makes up for doing so by generating more revenue per dollar of assets. In sum, the efficiency ratio should be one of the principal metrics that investors consider before buying a bank stock. But delivering on a low ratio is, counterintuitively, more about driving the top line than it is about saving on the bottom line.   John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America.

Airtel, controlled by billionaire Sunil Bharti Mittal, said that Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.'s Dhan Dhana Dhan plan -- which loosely translates to money, money, money in Hindi -- violates the spirit of the regulator's directive and "essentially continues with a similar plan now masquerading under a different name." "This is a classic example of old wine in a new bottle," Airtel's spokesman said in a response to a text message. "The industry is in a very weak position and continues to bleed. With a weakened financial position companies will find it difficult to raise the capital to invest and roll out broadband networks." The latest battle showcases the struggle to keep customers in the world's second-largest mobile phone market where intense competition has prompted Vodafone Group Plc to combine its Indian unit with Idea Cellular Ltd. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India on Thursday "advised" billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Jio to stop a plan where customers who signed up for its unlimited Prime service at 303 rupees ($4.7) a month would get the first three months free. Five days later Jio started a program offering 90 days of service to clients for an additional 6 rupees. "Essentially, the offer seems broadly similar," to the one the regulator halted,  Viju George, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Indian unit, wrote in a report on Wednesday. "If criteria for the determination of unfair pricing aggression are not identified or enforced, RJio could probably continue to get away even as it desists from free offers in the future." Airtel said that it hopes the regulator will act against the offer. R.S. Sharma, chairman of the regulator did not answer four calls to his mobile phone and didn't respond to an email seeking comment. Jio didn't respond to an email seeking comment. Jio, which has more than 72 million Prime subscribers,  stormed into India's crowded mobile operator market by offering free services for a period that was extended until March 31. Rival operators were forced to slash prices to match Jio, in order to retain subscribers.
