Investors would be wise to wait before buying shares of JPMorgan Chase. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jun 5, 2017 at 4:20PM JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is one of the best big banks in the country, but does that mean its stock is a buy right now? Not necessarily. To be clear, there's a lot to like about JPMorgan Chase from the perspective of an investor. This shines through loud and clear when you look at its stock chart over the past year compared to the S&P 500. Shares of the nation's biggest bank by assets have outperformed the large-cap stock index by 12 percentage points since June of last year. This alone is impressive. But making it even more so is the fact that the S&P 500 has performed pretty well itself, up 16% over this stretch. Yet, that still pales in comparison to JPMorgan Chase's 28% gain. JPM data by YCharts. There are two primary explanations for this surge. In the first case, the unexpected outcome of last year's presidential election led investors to assume that banks would soon make more money. On the campaign trail, after all, Donald Trump promised to reduce corporate income taxes and ease regulations in the financial services industry, both of which would allow more of JPMorgan Chase's revenue to fall to the bottom line. In the second case, as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, assuming that it does so, that would translate into higher net interest income at JPMorgan Chase. Earlier this year, its chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said that the New York-based bank should see its full-year net interest income, the difference between its yield on earning assets and its cost of funds, increase by $4 billion compared to 2016. And that's assuming rates don't rise any further from here, which they could. The net result is that analysts, commentators, and investors widely assume that JPMorgan Chase's shares should continue to climb. Of the 29 analysts who have rated the bank's stock and are tracked by Yahoo! Finance, 17 of them rate its shares either a buy or a strong buy. Meanwhile, 11 rate it a hold, while only one recommends that investors should sell JPMorgan Chase's stock. Recommendation Number of Analyst Ratings Strong buy 5 Buy 12 Hold 11 Sell 1 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Analysts' general optimism toward JPMorgan Chase also comes through in their consensus price target. The average analyst has a $94.13 target on JPMorgan Chase, which implies a 13% upside from today's price of $83.18. All of this seems to bode well for the bank. Yet, I'd caution investors to tread carefully in this space. As I've already noted, JPMorgan Chase's shares have rallied since the presidential election on the banks of hopes for tax reform and regulatory relief, both of which seem to have ground to a halt over the past few months. Moreover, with the market in general at towering heights, it doesn't seem unreasonable to think that a correction could soon be in order. When that would happen is anybody's guess, but the landscape is littered with catalysts given the chaos and confusion in the nation's capital. In short, while I think JPMorgan Chase's stock is a solid investment for any investor's portfolio, I see little harm in waiting for a potential correction in its share price before diving in.

Source: Snap JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth lowered his price target for Snap Inc to $18. The previous price target that the analyst had for SNAP stock was $20. The stock’s closing price on Friday, June 2, 2017 was $21.06. Anmuth’s reasons for lowering JPMorgan’s price target for Snap Inc have to do with being careful. The analyst believes that the camera company won’t bring in as much revenue off of its Spectacles smartglasses as previously expected. The JPMorgan analyst is expecting Snap Inc to sell 429,000 units of its smartglasses for $56 million in revenue. This is a 53% decline from the previous estimate, which had SNAP selling 915,00 units for $119 million in revenue. He is also expecting the company to have trouble with ad revenue and slowing DAU growth. The update from Anmuth also includes changes to estimated earnings for fiscal year 2017. He is expecting losses of 68 cents in fiscal 2017, 44 cents in fiscal 2018 and 13 cents in fiscal 2019. Previous estimates had SNAP reporting losses of 65 cents in fiscal 2017 and 34 cents fiscal 2018, and a gain of 11 cents in fiscal 2019, reports StreetInsider.com. Wall Street’s estimate consensus for Snap Inc has the company reporting losses per share of 57 for fiscal 2017. Analysts are also estimating losses per share of 34 cents for fiscal 2018. Snap Inc last released its earnings report on May 11, 2017. The company didn’t do as well as expected, with revenue coming in 5% below estimates. SNAP stock was down 2% as of Monday morning and is down 15% year-to-date.

In a note to investors Monday, JPMorgan lowered its price target 10% to $18 from $20 while maintaining its neutral rating. The bank is downgrading its price target based in part on fewer people flocking to the platform. Thanks to competition from Facebook, users are not expected to join Snapchat as fast as previously expected. JPMorgan estimates only 8 million users will join Snapchat in the second quarter of 2017, instead of the 10 million that were previously expected. Snap also isn't expected to show a profit until 2020, according to JPMorgan. The company saw strong ad spending growth around this time last year related to the Olympics and US election, but those were one-time events and aren't expected to be replaced this year. Spectacles, Snap's video-capturing glasses, debuted in the EU this week, but aren't expected to sell well enough to impact Snap's bottom line. JPMorgan cut their revenue estimates from Spectacles nearly in half, from $119 million in 2017 to $56 million. These downsides are not surprising to hear from JPMorgan, given that the bank has been bearish on Snap since it went public. JPMorgan received the third-biggest share of stock after it helped underwrite the company's IPO in March. Shares of Snap are down 15.64% since its IPO, and were down 1.4% in early trading on Monday. Click here for a live chart of SNAP...

The controversy over Goldman Sachs Asset Management's purchase of Venezuelan government bonds (really Petroleos de Venezuela SA bonds) from Venezuela's government (really from a small broker acting on behalf of Venezuela's central bank) has gone on longer than Goldman probably expected, given that Goldman apparently didn't think about it at all: Internally, the purchase didn’t receive heightened scrutiny. The two co-heads of the unit, GSAM, were informed only after the trade had been completed, the people said. The trade didn’t reach Goldman’s firmwide standards committee, which often vets deals that carry potential blowback, they added. An ensuing uproar over that trade, which critics say extends a financial lifeline to Venezuela’s embattled government, caught top executives at Goldman off guard. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s "compliance and legal staff are reviewing the purchase" to see "how the process can be improved," but you can see how they missed this. It's controversial for Goldman to buy controversial stuff; but GSAM isn't quite Goldman. It manages money on behalf of customers; it bought the bonds with their money, not shareholder money. Its decisions aren't, in some sense, made on behalf of Goldman Sachs; they're made on behalf of GSAM's customers. Of course those decisions are made by Goldman employees in Goldman offices, not by the customers, but still, there is some deniability there. (Disclosure: I used to work at Goldman.) There is deniability for the customers too: Sure they own and benefit from the Venezuelan bonds, but they didn't decide to buy them; Goldman did. Somehow Venezuelan bonds are owned without anyone fully taking the responsibility of owning them. Elsewhere in deniability, Ricardo Hausmann wrote last month about the moral taint of buying Venezuela's "Hunger Bonds." His argument is not quite that people shouldn't buy Venezuelan bonds. That would be too radical: Emerging-market bond funds almost have to invest in Venezuelan bonds. "The returns of the JP Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI+) are heavily influenced by what happens in Venezuela," because Venezuela's bonds make up a lot of the yield and the price volatility of the index. Emerging-markets managers can't just walk away from Venezuela; they "currently spend a disproportionate share of their time 'getting the Venezuelan call right,' because their bonuses are based on their over-performance relative to the index – of which Venezuela is the main driver." And investors can't just walk away from emerging-markets bond funds: Clearly, this would punish other countries that are innocent bystanders in the Venezuelan mess. There must be a better way. There is. The solution is to demand that JPMorgan immediately exclude Venezuela from the emerging market bond indexes it calculates, thereby freeing fund managers from the need to compare their performance with hunger bonds. Over time, JPMorgan should introduce a Decent Emerging Markets index, which would save you from moral anguish by ensuring that only countries adhering to minimal standards of respect for their citizens are included. The assumption here is that investment managers, and individual investors, cannot be expected to make moral decisions about investing for themselves, not when an index lurks in the background. (Others disagree; here is a story about Venezuelan investors who wrestle with the moral issues of owning Venezuelan government bonds.) Morality, on this theory, is a matter for index providers to judge. Investors -- index funds, yes, but also active funds that benchmark to an index -- are bound to follow the index, so if anyone is going to make a moral decision about what bonds to avoid, it is the index provider. I am not sure the index providers would agree! JPMorgan is not in the business of saving you from moral anguish. An index is just a list. Venezuela is an emerging market. It has bonds. Its bonds are emerging-markets bonds. If you are writing a list of emerging-markets bonds, you could quite sensibly put Venezuelan bonds on that list. What is the problem? But one thing that we talk about a lot around here is the human construction of investment indexes. The central idea of indexing, of passive investing, is that you own the entire universe of assets rather than making choices about what to buy. But in practice it's never that simple. Most actual indexes aren't really "the entire universe of assets"; they're a particular subset of that universe, U.S. large-cap stocks or emerging-market bonds or whatever. And even within that subset, the membership criteria have to be defined by a human, with some room for judgment calls. And increasingly judgments by index constructors are overtaking judgments by investors in importance: If investors give up their agency to index providers -- if the index providers are the only people actually making decisions about governance or profitability or morality -- then the index providers had better make good decisions.  The future of passive. The central idea of indexing, of passive investing, is that you own the entire universe of assets rather than making choices about what to buy, and also it's cheap. I mean: You just buy all the stocks on the list, and then you stop. There's no need to hire brilliant analysts and portfolio managers and pay them millions of dollars to pick stocks. There are some pretty significant economies of scale: One person can pick all the stocks for a $40 billion index fund as easily as for a $40 million index fund, and doesn't need to be paid 1,000 times as much. So it is not that surprising that BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. combine for 83 percent of the U.S. market for exchange-traded funds. ETFs are mostly passive vehicles, passive investors want low fees, and scale is how you get low fees. But there's still another 17 percent for smaller ETF providers to fight over, and this Bloomberg Markets article details their approaches. Here is my favorite, from Deutsche Asset Management, which uses the traditional financial-industry marketing approach of clothing metaphors: “It’s like talking to your tailor rather than someone who wants to sell you a suit,” says Reinhard Bellet, the company’s head of passive asset management and Bassett’s boss in Frankfurt. “You cannot just issue a product and say, ‘Good luck!’ You have to be there, and you have to be a partner of the client, and I think that’s the future of passive: providing service.” See, it's bespoke! I mean arguably providing service is the past of active management; arguably investors have concluded that actually they were overpaying for service and what they really want is to be handed a cheap broad market index and be left alone. But obviously that is not true of all ETFs, or all ETF investors: Many investors want narrowly focused ETFs with lots of trading opportunities -- active management by other means -- and providers are happy to give it to them. Elsewhere in niche ETFs, I wrote on Friday about Dani Burger's "cat" index, and the need (or lack thereof) for a human-legible economic intuition underlying a factor. About a dozen people reminded me of Robert Mercer's line in Sebastian Mallaby's "More Money Than God": “Some signals that make no intuitive sense do indeed work.” Indeed, it is the nonintuitive signals that often prove the most lucrative for Renaissance. “The signals that we have been trading without interruption for fifteen years make no sense,” Mercer explains. “Otherwise someone else would have found them.” Perhaps there is still hope for the cat factor. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. Central banks seem to love thinking and writing about bitcoins and blockchains, which I guess makes sense. If you are a central bank, your basic job is to keep an electronic list of who has dollars or pounds or whatever, so you might be particularly interested in new ways of keeping electronic lists of who has money. There is not usually a lot of breaking news in Keeping Lists of Money Quarterly, so it's understandable that the blockchain stuff has caught the eye of a lot of central bankers. But the blockchain is not an obvious fit for central banks. The point of a blockchain is to decentralize the keeping of ledgers of assets. Central banks have "central" right in the name. I once said: "the central bank issues the money; it could just keep a list of how much money everyone has, and that could be the official list, and that would be that. You don't need a blockchain."  But here is Simon Scorer at the Bank of England's Bank Underground blog with what I think is the most sensible thing about blockchains I've read from a central bank. In particular, Scorer thinks that the main benefit of using a blockchain "is the high level of operational resilience it might offer by avoiding a single point of failure": This resilience comes at a cost: you only get the full resilience benefits if you’re willing to allow multiple parties (i.e. transaction validators) to manage transactional data; which raises significant privacy challenges. The main solutions are "to not include sensitive data on the shared ledger," which "may limit the extent of any resiliency benefits" (if the shared ledger doesn't include actual transaction details, it's not really usefully shared), or to include the data but fully encrypt it, which "presents a significant challenge in asking a group of participants to agree on the validity of transactions, without allowing them to see the full details."  Elsewhere in blockchains: Possible bitcoin unicorn! Coinbase Inc., is in talks with potential investors on a new round of funding at a valuation of more than $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. It is unclear which investors are committing to the round, which was described as targeting around $100 million or more. That would represent the largest funding round on record for venture-backed bitcoin companies. And: "The number of job adverts on LinkedIn for blockchain-related positions has more than trebled in the past year."  Elsewhere in central banking. Here is "(Why) Do Central Banks Care About Their Profits?" by Igor Goncharov and Vasso Ioannidou of Lancaster University and Martin Schmalz of the University of Michigan: We document that central banks are significantly more likely to report slightly positive profits than slightly negative profits. The discontinuity in the profit distribution is (i) more pronounced amid greater political or public pressure, the public’s receptiveness to more extreme political views, and agency frictions arising from governor career concerns, but absent when no such factors are present, and (ii) correlated with more lenient monetary policy inputs and greater inflation. "The discontinuity is unlikely to be a mechanical byproduct of the central banking business model," they write, "and more likely the result of imperfect de facto independence of the central bank." The more worried the bank is about its independence, the more pressure there is on it to say "well, at least we are profitable." Elsewhere: "Have the Swiss National Bank’s currency interventions actually been good for Switzerland?"  John Paulson. Of all the problems to have, the problem of client withdrawals leaving your hedge fund with just $2 billion in client money to go with $8 billion of your personal money is the least bad problem. Oh I know, I know, people think it's a problem for John Paulson, who at his peak "oversaw $38 billion -- half of which belonged to outside investors."  “As outside assets continue to erode, the running question for Paulson becomes more forceful: Why doesn’t he just convert to a family office?” said David Tawil, the founder of Maglan Capital LP, a New York based hedge fund that specializes in event-driven strategies. “But to get the firm back on the rails, I don’t think is impossible.” But the central fact is that he is still running $8 billion of his own money, which means that he has $8 billion of his own money, which means that his problem is better than anything that has ever happened to almost anyone else on Earth.  Management methods. One possibly out-of-consensus belief that I have is that there are not a lot of classic supervillain scenes at modern public companies. A popular view of the financial crisis, for instance, is that there was a meeting in an executive dining room at Goldman Sachs where the head trader said "let's trick our clients into buying bad mortgages so we can profit from the coming crisis," and then the CEO said "yes and then we can take everyone's houses," and then the general counsel said "also I just want to add that this is a crime and I love it," and then they cackled and tossed around wads of cash, and that if prosecutors could just find the videotape of that meeting then we could finally achieve justice and put the crisis behind us. I do not think that happened. I think that most of the time, when a company does a bad thing, it is the result of a series of smaller local decisions that were understandable in their own terms, that most people don't knowingly choose to do bad stuff, and that when they do, they are shamefaced about it and don't go around gloating with each other. People who work at big corporations -- even banks! -- are, in my experience, people, and explicit self-aware evil seems to be unusual among people everywhere. But Charles Duhigg notes that Mylan NV's EpiPen, which was hugely controversial last year for how expensive it is, remains just as expensive. And he reports that, starting in 2014, Mylan executives "began warning Mylan’s top leaders that the price increases seemed like unethical profiteering at the expense of sick children and adults." And that one of those top leaders was chairman Robert Coury, and that this happened: Mr. Coury replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment. Ah. Yes. What? For some reason I imagine him keeping the middle fingers up throughout what sounds like a fairly long tirade. You know how boards of directors sometimes go into executive session? Maybe Mylan's sometimes goes into Double Extended Middle Finger Session, in which everyone just vents about their critics. Mylan says that "any allegations of disregard for consumers who need these lifesaving drugs, government officials, regulators or any other of our valued stakeholders are patently false." Elsewhere, Ronald Barusch argues that "Investors concerned about governance and shareholder control should think twice about investing in companies organized under Dutch law," like Mylan: In the case of Mylan, a group of pension funds launched a campaign earlier this week to unseat six members of Mylan’s board over executive pay issues. But it isn’t likely to have much of an impact. As the company’s proxy statement explains, under Dutch law and the company’s charter, shareholders don’t have a right to replace directors at annual meetings. Directors are appointed “from a binding nomination proposed by the Mylan Board.” In other words, shareholders have no right to a say in who gets nominated. They can vote no on the board’s nominees, but it takes a whopping 2/3 of the shares voting at the meeting to defeat a nominee. Even if shareholders could muster up enough votes, the board just makes more “binding nominations” for election. Presumably the binding nominations are made in a Double Extended Middle Finger Session of the nominating committee. People are worried about unicorns. Here is a story about Palmer Luckey, who founded and sold virtual-reality unicorn Oculus VR to Facebook Inc., "was pressured to leave Facebook months after news spread that he had secretly donated to an organization dedicated to spreading anti-Hillary Clinton internet memes," and is now working on a new startup, to be funded by Peter Thiel, that will make a virtual border wall. Also he likes cosplay and collects decommissioned missile silos. "A person who knows him described Mr. Luckey as a casual 'prepper,' someone who prepares for societal collapse," and really who among us is not at least casually preparing for societal collapse?  Things happen.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe By James Mahoney A couple of years ago, I learned a startling statistic: The unemployment rate for individuals with some form of autism – often called the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) – is estimated to be between 80 to 90 percent. While it’s shameful and disheartening that any subset of people would face such a challenge, what’s even more startling about that statistic is that many of these individuals are simply brilliant people–highly educated, highly capable, detail-oriented, yet unemployed. JPMorgan Chase "I firmly believe that companies could always benefit from having employees who see things in an unconventional way, which is something to remember any time an individual on the spectrum is seeking a job." James Mahoney, Executive Director and Head of Autism at Work for JPMorgan Chase But my employer JPMorgan Chase, like many successful organizations, looks at situations like this one and sees opportunity. Because of our size and continued growth, we have an almost constant need for talented employees – especially in technology-related fields. We thought that perhaps this could become a new untapped pool of talent. And it has: Since rolling out our initiative, Autism at Work, a program focused on hiring employees with Autism, we have hired more than 30 individuals who have ASD and we anticipate hiring hundreds more across the globe over the coming years. Autism manifests itself in many different forms; no two autistic individuals face the same exact challenges. To quote Melanie, a Columbus-based Chase employee whose daughter is autistic: “If you’ve met one person with autism, you’ve met one person with autism.” These challenges may explain why unemployment for this community is so high. Melanie explained that just getting past an interview can be difficult, especially if the interviewer is unaware of the applicant’s ASD. Her high-functioning daughter rocks back and forth and side-to-side, stutters, frequently says ‘um’ and has difficulty making eye contact. “I taught her to say, ‘Hi. I’m Billie and I have autism spectrum disorder. Just so you know I’m not weird or quirky.’” Through partnerships with organizations that have more experience in working with individuals with ASD, we are learning to look beyond the traditional interview process to find highly qualified employees. We work closely with senior leaders across the firm to identify roles that would benefit from the talents of ASD adults and ensure we provide an inclusive work environment for these employees to thrive. The embracement of this untapped workforce allows our company to benefit from the unique blend of talents provided by these detail-oriented, rule-bound, logical and independent-thinking individuals. And it is paying off: Many studies show that the performance of autistic individuals in certain functions exceeds their peers without autism. Jon, a quality assurance analyst at Chase, said his strongest attribute is to assess situations and come up with the best possible solutions in order to make them more organized and more efficient. “I would encourage anyone on the spectrum to embrace what makes them different and see it as their greatest strength,” he said. “I firmly believe that companies could always benefit from having employees who see things in an unconventional way, which is something to remember any time an individual on the spectrum is seeking a job.” He said the Autism At Work program opens a door for those “who may not be the best at traditional interviews, to show off their unique skills in a workplace environment. Some people on the spectrum simply are not given a chance to shine through conventional means. This program is a great way to facilitate that.” The success of Jon and others confirm that their skillset simply requires an environment in which to contribute and thrive. And that provides a winning solution for all of us. James Mahoney is an executive director and head of Autism at Work for JPMorgan Chase. In this role, he oversees the program to identify roles for which people on the autism spectrum would add high value, as well as develop candidate pipelines and ensure best practices for ongoing support. James has been with the firm 5 years, serving in a variety of roles, most recently as chief quality officer for Mortgage Banking Technology. Prior to joining JPMC, he held various leadership positions in the technology and business sectors, spanning a career of nearly three decades.

Subscribe By Tishin Donkersley With no business plan or working capital, it can be hard to build a business. However a driven work ethic, unending passion, and some family recipes, Lisa and Vincente Gutierrez opened their food truck business, Dos Hermanos Taco Truck, and rolled right into entrepreneurship. JPMorgan Chase However a driven work ethic, unending passion, and some family recipes, Lisa and Vincente Gutierrez opened their food truck business, Dos Hermanos Taco Truck, and rolled right into entrepreneurship. The couple met at a restaurant where Lisa was the manager and Vincente was the line cook. Together they had dreams of owning their own business and creating jobs. On a whim, they decided to buy a food truck from their friend, borrowed pots and pans from friends and family, and launched their food truck with recipes from Vincente’s family from Oaxaca, Mexico. “In 2012, we just opened the business and the community supported us and loved the food,” Lisa said. JPMorgan Chase “In 2012, we just opened the business and the community supported us and loved the food,” Lisa said. As their business began to grow, Lisa needed to build her entrepreneurial skills and find ways to expand the business. Lisa turned to the Columbus Economic & Community Development Institute (ECDI). The non-profit economic development organization helped provide Lisa with a place to park their truck, access to a prep kitchen, and offered affordable classes to help market the business. “I had no idea about mobile food vending, how to write a business plan, social media or how to make a logo,” Lisa said. “They had a women’s business center attached and I got my business hat on!” In 2015, Lisa was accepted to the Entrepreneur Exchange Program, funded by the SBA ScaleUp America initiative. This nine-month program is a community-focused initiative where business firms can grow by leveraging, networking, and complimenting the existing resources and expertise in their areas. JPMorgan Chase “I had no idea about mobile food vending, how to write a business plan, social media or how to make a logo,” Lisa said. “They had a women’s business center attached and I got my business hat on!” Through the program, Lisa was able to leverage her networking opportunities to expand their business that included two food carts and became vendors at sport stadiums and local hot spots. “The ECDI made our business credible. We were noticed by the North Market and they wanted to bring in authentic Mexican cuisine – we were one of three businesses chosen. [Most importantly,] I knew having that restaurant in the market would break the cycle of not being able to create jobs,” Lisa said. Through heavy social media marketing, word-of-mouth and expansion, Dos Hermanos became a recognizable brand. “We are in the Ohio State stadium serving tacos on game days for football and soccer, and serve as a pop-up restaurant at JPMorgan Chase’s McCoy Center. Being in front of these large crowds and companies make us credible,” Lisa said. JPMorgan Chase “We are in the Ohio State stadium serving tacos on game days for football and soccer, and serve as a pop-up restaurant at JPMorgan Chase’s McCoy Center. Being in front of these large crowds and companies make us credible,” Lisa said. When it was finally time to get a loan to expand her business, the network she’d developed in the community was helpful. “Just by talking to the small business bankers and connecting with Chase it had really helped our small business grow,” Lisa said. While their dreams of owning a business and creating jobs are coming to fruition, there are always unexpected twists and turns as an entrepreneur. “I was surprised by how much it took to run the business. I was the cashier and taking the orders and I couldn’t foresee myself not being on the truck however, as we stated to grow I couldn’t be everywhere. I needed to let go and put people in different roles, and they were amazing. The strength in our staff and empowering them has allowed us to continue to grow the business. [Each day I say] wow! I’m surrounded by a bunch of talented people,” Lisa said.

Photographer: Alessia Pierdomenico/Bloomberg Pacific Investment Management Co. said that it’s neutral on Italian bonds on the conviction that the yields were too low to compensate for the nation’s mounting political risks. The reduction marks a shift for the $1.5 trillion asset manager, which had been overweight in recent years. It now maintains a neutral exposure to peripheral European assets. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc say the odds of Italy facing snap elections as early as autumn have risen, with the U.S. bank predicting an increase in the nation’s bond yields in such a case. A growing number of investors and strategists have warned Italy could be the epicenter of Europe’s next political tremor as the rising popularity of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement fuels concerns about an electoral upset. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is recommending yield-seeking clients to look for opportunities outside Italy, while Deutsche Bank AG has exited one of its positions in the nation’s debt against French counterparts. “Getting paid 2 percent on the 10-year bond to fund Italy doesn’t look attractive to me,” Andrew Balls, Pimco’s chief investment officer for global fixed income, said during a press briefing in London last week. “Our baseline isn’t that Italy is going to leave the euro zone, but it doesn’t seem a crazy idea that it could happen or market can significantly increase the pricing for Italy exit. The probability that things go wrong, it’s too high.” The extra yield on Italian 10-year government bonds over German bunds has climbed to 198 basis points from a four-month low of 169 basis points reached May 23 as investors priced in the risk of an early vote. Electoral Law Last week, Italy’s main political parties moved closer to an agreement on drafting a new electoral law. A deal would remove any hindrance to snap elections, eliminating the need to wait for scheduled elections in early 2018. The Five Star Movement, which is neck-and-neck with ex-Premier Matteo Renzi’s Democratic Party with about 30 percent of voters’ support in the latest electoral polls, has pledged to hold a referendum on Italy’s euro membership if it leads the country’s next government. “The earlier the vote, the stronger the widening impact” on bond spreads, JPMorgan economist Marco Protopapa wrote in a June 1 note to clients. “We believe the probability of 2017 elections has moved to well above 50 percent.” Volatility in Italian and peripheral assets may increase in coming weeks amid headlines and electoral polls, strategists at Barclays said in a note to clients on June 2. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up A snap vote in Italy could coincide with the European Central Bank signaling a tapering of its asset-purchase program, boosting upward pressure on the country’s debt yields. In such a case, Pimco’s Balls sees the risk that Italy would need to ask for support from the European Stability Mechanism, the vehicle created during the European sovereign crisis to offer financial backstop to peripheral countries. “It’s not our base scenario but it doesn’t seem terribly unlikely,” said Balls. Given the risks, investors should seek opportunities elsewhere, he added. Currencies and debt in emerging markets such as Mexico, Brazil, India and Indonesia are attractive, according to Pimco. “Don’t be trapped in your local market,” said Balls. “Go global. You don’t have to try hard to find something that looks better than Italy. We have been running more emerging-market foreign-exchange risk. We see pretty good opportunities there.” (A previous version of this story corrected the headline and lead to say that Pimco has shifted to neutral on Italian bonds, rather than exiting them entirely.)

JPM maintained its neutral rating. The company is worried about competition, slower scaling and a lack of profit. Todd Haselton | @robotodd Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 11:09 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES Getty Images Signage for Snap Inc., parent company of Snapchat, adorns the front of the New York Stock Exchange in New York City. JPMorgan cut its 2017 share price target for Snap from $20 to $18 on Monday, sending shares lower by more than 2 percent. In a note to investors, JPMorgan maintained its neutral rating for the parent of social media site Snapchat. While "engagement is strong" on the site, JPMorgan said it has several concerns, including the company's ability to scale its advertising business. It also said it's less bullish on Snapchat's ability to add users, fears competition from Facebook and is concerned about Snapchat's lack of profit. JPMorgan said it doesn't expect Snap to post a profit until 2020. Snap's first earnings report last month failed to meet Wall Street's revenue estimates — despite increasing revenue from $38.8 million to $150 million year over year. It also reported a loss of $2.31 a share, sending the stock tumbling to just cents above its $17 IPO price. On Monday, it was trading at $20.66. JPMorgan also said it is more conservative on the future of Spectacles, Snapchat's smart sunglasses. JPMorgan revised its expected unit sales of Spectacles to around 429,000 in 2017, driving about $56 million in revenue, compared with original projections of 915,000 units and $119 million in revenue. Finally, the investor note warned that Snap's expiring share lockup on July 29 "could create greater volatility and weigh on Snap shares ahead of and after late July" when an estimated 70-80 percent of Snap shares open up for sale. Disclosure: NBC Universal, the parent company of CNBC, is an investor in Snap. Correction: This story was revised to correct that the JPMorgan note was sent Monday.

In a statement today, Royal Mail confirmed the partial disposal of its property holdings at Nine Elms, Battersea, with two plots being sold comprising 32% of the 8.35 developable acres at the site. READ: Royal Mail shares up as it raises £101mln in cash from sale of two Nine Elms development plots Analysts at JPMorgan Cazenove noted that, on a gross basis, the £101mln cash disposal price implies nearly £38mln an acre, broadly in-line with their valuation. In a note to clients, they added: “Net of the guided reinvestment and assumed transactions costs (5% of gross), this falls to just under £28m/acre or a 30% discount to our base case.” They added that that discount downside, of just over £30mln in total, would roughly offset comparable estimated upside from the speculated disposal of Mount Pleasant. JPMorgan kept an ‘overweight’ stance on Royal Mail with a target price of 565p.  Property disposals are not that material for Royal Mail Deutsche Bank analyst Andy Chu, meanwhile, pointed out that, while helpful, in his view, property disposals are not that material for Royal Mail. In a note to clients, the analyst said: “We expect property disposals at RMG but perhaps a little surprised given the softening London property market and that the company does not need the cash given its strong balance sheet. That said it makes strategic sense.” He added: “We are of the view that there is a not a lot of hidden property value in RMG and as this disposal highlights, some of the proceeds are required for investment to help maximise future sales proceeds.” But he noted: “A cumulative net proceeds figure of £114mln including this transaction is not material vs. a market cap of £4.4bn.” Deutsche Bank retains a ‘hold’ rating and 450p price target on Royal Mail shares. £30mln of proceeds to be reinvested into infrastructure works at Nine Elms Meanwhile Liberum Capital analyst Gerald Khoo noted that Royal Mail intends to reinvest £30m of the proceeds into infrastructure works to support both the sold plots and other future developments. He pointed out: “If we deduct the infrastructure investment from the proceeds (our valuation is net of such investment), and apply the same valuation to the rest of the plot, the implied valuation is slightly below our valuation (£222mln vs. £251mln) although this is not material on a per share basis (3p per share difference).” The Liberum analyst repeated a ‘sell’ stance on Royal Mail with a 400p price target. In lunchtime trading, Royal Mail shares were 0.8%, or 3.6p higher at 442.7p.

First conducted by the Federal Reserve in 2009 to increase confidence in the system, bankers say the tests have morphed into a mysterious, laborious and time-consuming process from what was once a straightforward exam of financial strength. The outcome determines how much capital banks must hold, and how they can use what is left. But getting a passing grade can be tough. JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest U.S. bank, calls on hundreds of employees to work on stress test submissions each year. Morgan Stanley, the sixth largest, submits a file of over 25,000 pages. Reducing the tests’ complexity and frequency could not only save man-hours, but help the U.S. economy by stimulating more lending, bankers and lobbyists said in recent interviews. "While we believe that stress-testing is the best way to gauge capital adequacy, we also believe that a fresh look at how stress-testing is conducted could produce significant benefits for economic growth," said Greg Baer, president of industry trade group The Clearing House Association. Bankers have been making their case in meetings with legislators, in reports sent to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is stewarding the financial overhaul by the Republican administration, and in public comments to investors and securities analysts. Easing up on stress tests could significantly boost returns. For example, Nomura Instinet analyst Steven Chubak estimates JPMorgan could increase annual profits by about $2.5 billion, or 10 percent, under a more relaxed framework. There are more than a few skeptics pushing back on the industry's pleas. Hawkish regulators and former regulators oppose the idea of lightening stress tests too much. "As proposals for regulatory change swirl about, it is crucial that the strong capital regime be maintained, especially as it applies to the most systemically important banks,” former Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo, who led regulatory matters, said in April. “Neither regulators nor legislators should agree to changes that would effectively weaken that regime." Consumer advocates, anti-Wall Street groups and influential lawmakers such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, have also fought any loosening of bank regulations, arguing the industry would embrace reckless practices again. While bond investors and ratings agencies are happy to see robust capital levels, stock investors are clamoring for banks to boost share buybacks and dividends. Wall Street analysts have been asking what banks would do with unleashed capital, and the picture is mixed. JPMorgan has said it would like to extend more credit to small businesses and home buyers if the government eases up on lending restrictions. Citigroup Inc, in contrast, has emphasized buying back stock because its shares are trading for less than the company is worth. The industry's stress-test offensive is happening as Washington re-examines financial reforms, in what will likely be a lengthy and heated debate. The Treasury Department is expected to release its first in a series of reports on overhauling regulations early this week, while House Republicans are scheduled to vote on their own financial regulatory reform bill. Despite assurances by Trump that rules will be rewritten, there appears to be insufficient support in Congress. At least eight Senate Democrats would be needed to pass any broad law rewrite, which is unlikely. However, the Fed has broad discretion to make changes to the stress tests. POOR EXECUTION When it comes to the stress tests, bankers argue that the goal is noble, but the execution is poor. For instance, the Fed scores loan portfolios for losses under hypothetical economic catastrophes but does not explain its methodology, which changes year-to-year. Even if banks pass numerically, they can fail for "qualitative" problems like risk management. And, in their own calculations, lenders cannot consider steps they would take to conserve capital, something bankers describe as irrational. "The world will end three times over, but you need to factor in the fact that you probably paid dividends in that time, and you wouldn't shrink your balance sheet, and you would continue to pursue mergers and acquisitions," one executive said. Bankers say they sweat through every year's process, worried they will miss unseen hurdles. The uncertainty causes them to lend less than they otherwise would, they argue. The Fed has resisted any wholesale reimagining of stress tests, and major revisions are unlikely until new Fed governors are confirmed. Three board seats including the supervisory post are open. But there are signs the Fed could become more accommodative. For instance, banks will receive "more guidance" on qualitative matters when stress test results are announced on June 22, Fed Governor Jerome Powell said on Thursday. Bankers are hoping bigger changes will happen before the Fed issues instructions for the 2018 stress tests early next year.

A bank that appealed a Scranton order to condemn a run-down yet picturesque vacant home in Green Ridge no longer has any involvement with the property, a city official said. JPMorgan Chase, the mortgage/lien holder of the abandoned home at 1021 Richmont St., had appealed in January a city order to raze the building. At that time, the Scranton Housing Appeals Board heard from an attorney for JPMorgan Chase, who said the bank planned to bring the home up to code. However, because the bank did not own the home, the attorney asked for a delay of six to nine months for the bank to try to obtain title to the property, which likely would require court approval. The appeals board decided to revisit the matter in 60 days. Those two months lapsed in late March, and city officials planned to ask the bank to return to the Housing Appeals Board in mid-June to give an update, said city Licensing, Inspections and Permits Director Patrick Hinton. “They were supposed to come back within 60 days,” Hinton said. However, JPMorgan Chase last week told the city that the bank no longer has any involvement with the house, but could not divulge any more information about ownership, Hinton said. Efforts to reach a JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman were unsuccessful. The Housing Appeals Board still may discuss the situation at its next meeting, possibly June 12, Hinton said. Last fall, the city moved to demolish the abandoned home, but waited when residents pushed to save the property, nicknamed “Castle House” for its cone-capped turret. Purchased by Russian artist Elena Flerova in 2002, the house — which has not been occupied in many years — fell into disrepair. Efforts by the city and bank to contact Flerova have been unsuccessful. Art gallery sites say Flerova, born in 1943, is a Jewish artist from Moscow who, after immigrating to the United States in the 1990s, created a body of paintings of Jewish religious ceremonies and scenes. Efforts by The Times-Tribune to locate Flerova have been unsuccessful.

And even as polls have tightened in the week ahead of Thursday’s vote, a Labour majority would still stun financial markets. While Prime Minister Theresa May is leading a campaign that’s less business-friendly than past Tory candidates’, Jeremy Corbyn has pulled his party leftward, with promises to nationalize railways and raise wages and taxes. At the same time, unlike the Tories, Labour has vowed to retain the benefits of the EU single market -- a desire shared by most companies and investors. In the final days before the election, May and Corbyn have traded blows over each other’s records on countering terrorism, as recent attacks in London and Manchester turned the focus from Brexit to security. Polls have called for increasingly narrow margins for the Tories amid a series of political missteps by May, with the latest  one by Survation/GMB ended Saturday showing just a one-percentage point lead. Equity markets have a lot on the line: The FTSE 100 rallied to an intraday record high last week as perceived certainty over the vote’s outcome helped shift the focus to Europe’s economic recovery and solid earnings. “More dramatic swings might be expected in the event of an unlikely Labour victory, but Brexit would continue to cast a pall,” Alastair Gunn and Rhys Petheram, fund managers at Jupiter Asset Management, wrote in a note. Here are the sectors and stocks to look out for in case of a Labour upset: LOSERS  Domestic Companies In addition to higher political uncertainty, a Labour comeback is expected to push down sterling, making imports more expensive for domestic producers and squeezing consumption -- which is why U.K. mid-caps tend to underperform when the pound is weak. With Labour proposing to raise the minimum wage and strengthen workers’ bargaining power, companies with a large local staff -- transport players such as IAG SA , EasyJet Plc and Interserve Plc, as well as retailers such as Next Plc and J Sainsbury Plc -- will take a hit, JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note.  Nationalization Targets: Royal Mail, Railways  Corbyn has pledged to re-nationalize Royal Mail Plc, as well as rail companies when the franchises expire. This could spell trouble for FirstGroup Plc and National Express Group Plc, which offer transit services, according to JPMorgan. Financial Industry, Especially RBS  Unsurprisingly, the populist Corbyn is no fan of big banks. He’s vowed to separate investment and retail banking and extend the Stamp Duty Reserve Tax to a wider range of assets. One particular stock to watch is Royal Bank of Scotland Plc: the Labour Party said it will launch a consultation on breaking up the lender to create new local public banks. Defense  When asked about his position on Trident, Britain’s nuclear weapon system, Corbyn has equivocated -- though his party’s manifesto endorses renewal after his opposition was overruled in a party vote. Not renewing the system could potentially remove a large stream of business for BAE Systems Plc, said Sandy Morris, an analyst at Jefferies LLC. M&A  Both major parties are calling for greater scrutiny of takeovers, with Labour vowing to make sure critical companies have a clear plan to protect workers and pensioners in case of a merger. Thomas Seidl, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, warned it would be negative for U.K. equities, and would “strip out any remaining M&A premium on the stocks.”  Utilities Higher power bills are another target that have united May and Corbyn, but according to Citigroup Inc., the latter’s plan is even harsher for utilities. The Labour Party has proposed an immediate 1,000-pound ($1,293) cap on average household energy bills annually before transitioning to a fairer system, as well as creating public energy and water companies and regaining control of energy supply networks.  Pennon Group Plc, Severn Trent Plc, SSE Plc and Centrica Plc are among companies that may be hurt, JPMorgan said. U.K.-focused utilities have already slid after the Tories also pledged to cap energy costs, before recovering amid a lack of clarity. Companies including Centrica, SSE and National Grid will plunge at least 10 percent in the case of a Labour-led government, Deutsche Bank AG said in a Tuesday report. WINNERS  Exporters and Global Corporations While the stock market may take a hit amid the initial shock, the FTSE 100’s resilience after Brexit shows there’s a silver lining in currency weakness. A drop in sterling makes exports more competitive and boosts overseas earnings in pound terms. Click here for a guide to understanding U.K. election polls. Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up Of course, Brexit is still the dominant issue for the campaign -- and for most U.K. companies. With the Tories outright backing an exit from the single market in their manifesto, some analysts say a weakening of the party may help pave the way for a better deal with the EU. A smaller Tory majority or even a Labour-led government may actually be better for risk assets in the medium term, according to Morgan Stanley. “Better checks and balances against a hard Brexit could be possible” in case of a hung parliament, Ken Odeluga, a market analyst at brokerage City Index wrote in a note. “If Labour wins, a softer Brexit would still be likelier, and the market has made plain that it prefers soft to hard.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The troubled lender has been exploring ways to bolster its cash and short-term funds and held discussions about its options with the European Central Bank in recent days, according to a person familiar with the situation. A meeting in Frankfurt with the ECB planned for Tuesday was canceled after the talks, the person said. It’s not clear if additional liquidity was granted. The ECB is “perfectly informed” of the bank’s situation, a spokesman for Popular said by phone Tuesday, declining to comment on the specific discussions. Spanish newspaper Expansion earlier reported the meeting was canceled. Popular’s shares have plunged to the lowest in almost three decades and its bonds have tumbled, increasing pressure on Chairman Saracho to shore up the balance sheet, burdened by more than $40 billion of soured property loans. So far, Saracho has failed to find a buyer for the ailing firm. “Events are coming to a head at Popular,” said Roger Francis, an analyst at Mizuho International Plc in London. “There’s still a chance that the bank gets enough time to sell more assets or attracts a bid from another bank, but fear of the downside is escalating and a critical moment seems to be approaching.” In a sign of growing concern, the cost of insuring Banco Popular’s senior bonds against losses for three months jumped to 720 basis points on Monday, according to data from CMA. The contracts, which were quoted for the first time last week, were at 646 basis points on Tuesday. Short-dated swaps still cost more than longer-term contracts, another sign of stress. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. The shares dropped as much as 11 percent on Tuesday and closed 6.2 percent lower at 31.7 euro cents in Madrid, valuing the bank at 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion). What’s Next for Troubled Spanish Lender Popular: QuickTake Q&A Popular had considered seeking oversight from central bank officials to guide the board’s decisions should it fail to obtain the extra funds, the person familiar said earlier. Commercial banks can obtain loans from the ECB by pledging collateral such as their own debt, or other assets, like pools of mortgages. In exceptional situations, national central banks in the euro area can provide credit to solvent but cash-strapped financial institutions through what’s called emergency liquidity assistance. Popular set aside 5.7 billion euros last year to cover losses for items including loans, real estate and excess interest charged to mortgage clients. Its losses left the company with one of the lowest common equity tier 1 ratios among European banks, at 8.17 percent. That measure of financial strength slumped to 7.33 percent in the first quarter. Chairman Ousted The losses prompted the bank to oust Chairman Angel Ron -- who had led the company for more than a decade -- and turn to Saracho, who previously headed JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Europe, Middle East and Africa business. His mandate was to stabilize the lender and put an end to the losses. Under Ron, Popular declined to take state aid five years ago when a stress test uncovered a capital shortfall. Instead, it wound up tapping investors for funds three times, raising a total of 5.5 billion euros. The lender may need a further 3 billion euros to 4 billion euros to offset possible losses, Algebris Investments CEO Davide Serra said Monday. Spain turned to the European Union in 2012 for 41 billion euros to rescue its weakest lenders. At the time, banks’ mounting real-estate losses were undermining confidence in the country’s government bonds, aggravating the region’s sovereign-debt crisis. This time, the troubles are so far limited to Popular. Read more: Spain’s Zombie Bank Lurches Toward Uncertain Fate After Loss The most important market news of the day.

The lender is also in talks to sell its U.S. unit TotalBank to Chile’s Banco de Credito e Inversiones, people with knowledge of the matter said in April. The unit could be valued at about $500 million, they said. In a letter to staff on Friday afternoon, Saracho said the bank has a number of alternatives, while telling Popular directors that it’s important to remain calm.

Rapkin, who was previously with JPMorgan Chase & Co, will work alongside David Kostel and Steve Schwartz to grow Credit Suisse's franchise in healthcare services, the memo said. He will be based in New York and will start in early September. Last year, two of Credit Suisse's healthcare managing directors, Stuart Smith and Michael Muntner, left for boutique investment bank Centerview Partners. Credit Suisse has been rapidly scaling up its healthcare franchise in recent years, making five senior level hires since 2015. Its healthcare team has been on some of the biggest deals in the sector so far this year, at a time when healthcare M&A has slowed considerably due to political uncertainty. Some of the deals Credit Suisse has advised on include inVentiv Health's $7.4 billion merger with INC Research Holdings Inc, Johnson & Johnson's $30 billion acquisition of Actelion, and Fresenius SE & Co's $4.3 billion acquisition of Akorn Inc.

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who in December agreed to exit a minority-owned Chinese investment-banking joint venture, said the U.S. bank is seeking to find a new structure that would eventually give it full control. “My longer-term dream is that we have, we own, 100 percent of something,” Dimon, 61, said yesterday in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Stephen Engle in Beijing. The CEO said he’ll be patient in negotiations with Chinese regulators. The process “is complicated, so we respect that and we tell them what we’d like and hope it’ll happen.” JPMorgan moved to sell its stake in JPMorgan First Capital Securities late last year after six years in the venture. Its partner, First Capital Securities Co., was to buy out JPMorgan from its one-third stake for 307 million yuan (USD44 million at the time), the Chinese firm said in December. Since UBS Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. established Chinese joint ventures more than a decade ago, foreign banks have struggled to challenge local players. One competitive disadvantage is that Chinese rules limit them to minority stakes, reducing their sway over key decisions. China has made “huge progress” on market reforms, Dimon said, adding that he would like to increase his firm’s businesses in the nation. The firm’s businesses in China include corporate banking and stakes in a fund manager and in a commodities futures joint venture, according to the bank’s China website. JPMorgan said in February that it won approval to underwrite corporate bond sales in China’s interbank market. The issue of control contributed to JPMorgan’s decision to sell its stake in the First Capital venture, whose business included equity and debt underwriting and mergers advisory. “Joint ventures by nature have sloppy corporate governance,” Dimon said. Any new venture structure would have to allow JPMorgan “a certain amount of management control,” he said. China’s government in November said it’s committed to letting overseas banks own bigger stakes in securities and fund-management joint ventures in the country. The rule limiting offshore ownership to 49 percent will gradually be relaxed, the Ministry of Finance said at the time, adding that foreign investors’ participation can boost the industry’s competitiveness and global influence. Dimon said his bank would consider setting up a business in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, without providing more specifics. The Shanghai FTZ is studying allowing foreign investments in financial institutions to exceed current caps, Zheng Yang, the city’s financial services office director, said in June last year, without giving a timetable for any changes. As China’s leaders remain on track with financial and trade reforms, Dimon said he sees full yuan convertibility in the next five to 10 years. “Twenty years from now, they will house 35 percent of the Fortune 3000 and we should go for that,” Dimon said. “They’ve made huge progress in reforms, financial reforms, market reforms.” When asked if he intended to stay on Donald Trump’s business advisory council after the U.S. president announced his intention to pull his country out of the Paris climate pact, Dimon said: “I am an American patriot and I want to help the president of the United States,” adding that he didn’t want to “overreact” to the issue. On Friday, Dimon said he “absolutely” disagreed with Trump’s administration on the issue, but said there was a responsibility to engage elected officials “to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people’s lives and protect our environment.” Trump’s call on Paris prompted Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger and Tesla Inc. founder Elon Musk to withdraw from a presidential jobs panel.

 The biggest risk to the global economy, according to PIMCO Ciro Scotti, The Fiscal Times Jun. 5, 2017, 7:06 PM 2,190 facebook linkedin twitter email print NEW YORK - MARCH 17: Traders work the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on March 17, 2008 in New York City. Stocks have been volatile on Wall Street following news of JP Morgan Chase acquisition of Bear, Stearns & Co, for $2 a share, with help of $30 billion in financing of Bear, Stearns assets from the U.S. Federal Reserve. (Photo by Michael Nagle/Getty Images) Michael Nagle/Getty Images What is the biggest risk to the global economy on the horizon? According to the recent forum on worldwide markets hosted by the investment firm Pimco, it is not the planet-wide trade war that was feared when candidate Donald Trump talked about canceling agreements, bailing out of the World Trade Organization and slapping tariffs on imports from countries accused of cheating. Instead, it’s a face-off between America and one of its largest trading partners, China. The forum in May featured speakers such as former House Speaker and Trump supporter Newt Gingrich, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and former U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke. Distilling what was said, a Pimco report released last week offered this: “Perhaps the central risk scenario is not the outbreak of a global trade war with the U.S. unilaterally withdrawing from the World Trade Organization (WTO), but rather a high-stakes bilateral trade renegotiation between the U.S. and China outside of the WTO dispute settlement forum, a process U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer calls ‘derogation.’” Certainly, the American-Sino relationship has become ever more complicated in the Age of Trump. Even as the president and his chief strategist Steve Bannon move the U.S. toward “America First” and “economic nationalism,” China is trying to position itself as a champion of economic globalization. Wikimedia Commons In January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Chinese President Xi Jinping made his bid to fill the gap seemingly being vacated by the about-to-be inaugurated American president. “That a leader of the People’s Republic of China can stake a claim to the mantle of leadership in the realm of free trade speaks to the unforeseen, even surreal alteration of the global order in recent months,” The New York Times wrote. Last week, Xi followed up on his quest to be taken seriously as the most powerful voice for globalization by reaffirming China’s commitment to the Paris climate change agreement. “As the Trump administration has stepped back from America’s traditional role of dominance on trade and development, China has filled the vacuum, expanding its ever-growing footprint across the globe on everything from new roads and ports to bank loans and energy projects,” an AP story said, pointing to Beijing’s creation of a competitor to the World Bank. In addition, by abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement negotiated by the Obama administration, President Trump may have contributed to China’s expanding hegemony in Asia. So how big a threat is the prospect of a trade confrontation between the U.S. and China? As the Pimco report pointed out, “China … runs a large bilateral trade surplus with the U.S., so it would have an incentive to bargain as it would face a threat of lost access to the U.S. market.” On the other hand, it said, America “would be vulnerable as well to a Chinese response against U.S. companies, as well as to the risk that China devalues the yuan and/or unloads its massive holdings of U.S. Treasuries.” Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Carlos Barria/Reuters At the same time, the White House needs Beijing’s influence to keep a lid on the nuclear ambitions of the rogue regime in North Korea, and Trump and Xi seemed to have forged a personal relationship in their meeting at Mar-a-Lago in April. “In sum,” Pimco said, “we see a left-tail risk that a China-U.S. trade renegotiation could turn inflammatory, with risk of miscalculation on both sides and the attendant negative externalities rippling through the global economy and financial markets.” Still, Pimco cautioned, the Trump administration is still in its early days and there are few details about what an “America First” trade policy actually entails. It said corporate tax reform, infrastructure spending, and “trade deals that open markets, protect intellectual property and encourage firms to invest in the U.S.” could all be a plus for growth. But while the takeaway from the Pimco forum was that a global trade war is unlikely, others are not so sure, especially in light of the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris accords. Jeff Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, suggested to CNN Money that other countries could eventually use a carbon tariff on U.S. goods to retaliate against America for withdrawing from the 195-nation agreement. The tariff might rise in relation to the amount of carbon emitted in the making of a product. "If any country introduces a carbon tariff, there's a risk other countries could impose restrictions of their own," Chief Economist Gregor Irwin of the risk advisory firm Global Counsel told CNN Money. "You just risk getting embroiled in a good old-fashioned trade war." This story was originally published by  The Fiscal Times.

JPMorgan Private Bank's Steven Rees and Neuberger Berman's Erik Knutzen have different ideas about how to invest in this environment. Rees likes tech and energy, while Knutzen is rotating into U.S. small caps and European equities. Michelle Fox | @MFoxCNBC Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 4:53 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Market expert: We're not concerned about tech valuations    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 2:15 PM ET | 04:26 With the U.S. stock market trading near record levels, two experts had different ideas about how to best invest their money. JPMorgan Private Bank's Steven Rees, who is the firm's global head of equity strategy, still likes technology. He believes the more than 20 percent rally this year is "more than justified." The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite traded 0.1 percent lower on Monday afternoon after reaching an all-time intraday high earlier in the session. "If you look at it relative to the growth that it offers on a P/E to growth perspective, it actually trades at a discount to the market," Rees said in an interview with "Power Lunch." "So we're not concerned about valuations. We're very happy with the earnings trends that we've seen across the sector." That doesn't mean he'd buy everything. Instead, he would be more selective. For Erik Knutzen, multi-asset chief investment officer at Neuberger Berman, the run-up in tech is "a little overdone." "We would rather move to where we can take advantage of a global economic growth upturn with some better valuations," he told "Power Lunch." He's trimming exposure to U.S. large cap stocks and shifting allocations to U.S. small caps and European equities. He also likes dividend stocks, especially as interest rates rise and volatility increases. "Stocks that pay you a higher percentage of their return in dividends, where you generate higher income, allows you to reinvest at better levels and at higher interest rates," Knutzen explained. One sector that has been hit this year is energy, thanks to concern about oil prices. However, that is another area where Rees would buy selective stocks on the pullback. "Our view is that oil prices remain in a range, and I think if that happens you could still see very good profits for some of the companies, particularly E&Ps with low cost of production, that the market right now is just totally discounting," he noted. Oil prices fell on Monday after top crude exporter Saudi Arabia and other Arab states cut ties with Qatar, raising concerns about a global deal to reduce oil production. —CNBC'S Fred Imbert and Reuters contributed to this report.

The firm sees Snap being weighed down by a lack of profit until 2020. The firm kept its "neutral" rating on Snap and cut the stock's price target to $18 from $20. Shares of Snap were trading down 3.6% to $20.33 in early afternoon trading on Monday.  Engagement on the app is "strong" with 166 million users spending an average of 30 minutes per day on the app and ad revenue should grow 133% in 2017, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in the note. However, the company has only been working toward monetization for bout two years and has "significant work" to do on its ad business.  This month, Snap is rolling out its self-serve, no-fee ad manager for purchasing video ads, as well as a Mobile Dashboard to track your ad performance from your phone and a Business Manager tool to help organize ad initiatives with a team. Previously, companies had to buy ads on Snapchat through the company' sales team or third-party ad tools that often charged a fee. These new tools are encouraging and should help more small businesses set up campaigns on Snapchat, but they're also just launching, meaning they will take time to gain traction, Anmuth noted. In addition, Snap will not have as much quality-control over ads on its platform and that could alienate its users.  Seasonality also has to be taken into account, JPMorgan said. While the second quarter is seasonally strong and should see revenue of $188 million, the third quarter has tough comps with the $15 million to $20 million in non-recurring Olympics and political revenue from the 2016 third quarter.  The 2016 fourth quarter benefited from the NFL partnership and active political climate, but this year's fourth quarter should get similar boosts, Anmuth said. However, JPMorgan is still cutting its fourth quarter revenue estimates by 15% due to depressed outlook for Spectacle sales.  Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like Wall Street Is Now Betting a Mind-Blowing $1 Billion That Snapchat Is a Big Disappointment People are really short the tech upstart.

"My longer-term dream is that we have, we own, 100 percent of something," Dimon, 61, said Monday in an interview with Bloomberg Television's Stephen Engle in Beijing. The CEO said he'll be patient in negotiations with Chinese regulators. The process "is complicated, so we respect that and we tell them what we'd like and hope it'll happen." JPMorgan moved to sell its stake in JPMorgan First Capital Securities late last year after six years in the venture. Its partner, First Capital Securities Co., was to buy out JPMorgan from its one-third stake for 307 million yuan ($44 million at the time), the Chinese firm said in December. Since UBS Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. established Chinese joint ventures more than a decade ago, foreign banks have struggled to challenge local players. One competitive disadvantage is that Chinese rules limit them to minority stakes, reducing their sway over key decisions. Bloomberg News China has made "huge progress" on market reforms, Dimon said, adding that he would like to increase his firm's businesses in the nation. The firm's businesses in China include corporate banking and stakes in a fund manager and in a commodities futures joint venture, according to the bank's China website. JPMorgan said in February that it won approval to underwrite corporate bond sales in China's interbank market. The issue of control contributed to JPMorgan's decision to sell its stake in the First Capital venture, whose business included equity and debt underwriting and mergers advisory. "Joint ventures by nature have sloppy corporate governance," Dimon said. Any new venture structure would have to allow JPMorgan "a certain amount of management control," he said. China's government in November said it's committed to letting overseas banks own bigger stakes in securities and fund-management joint ventures in the country. The rule limiting offshore ownership to 49 percent will gradually be relaxed, the Ministry of Finance said at the time, adding that foreign investors' participation can boost the industry's competitiveness and global influence. Dimon said his bank would consider setting up a business in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, without providing more specifics. The Shanghai FTZ is studying allowing foreign investments in financial institutions to exceed current caps, Zheng Yang, the city's financial services office director, said in June last year, without giving a timetable for any changes. As China's leaders remain on track with financial and trade reforms, Dimon said he sees full yuan convertibility in the next five to 10 years. "Twenty years from now, they will house 35 percent of the Fortune 3000 and we should go for that," Dimon said. "They've made huge progress in reforms, financial reforms, market reforms." When asked if he intended to stay on Donald Trump's business advisory council after the U.S. president announced his intention to pull his country out of the Paris climate pact, Dimon said: "I am an American patriot and I want to help the president of the United States," adding that he didn't want to "overreact" to the issue. On Friday, Dimon said he "absolutely" disagreed with Trump's administration on the issue, but said there was a responsibility to engage elected officials "to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment." Trump's call on Paris prompted Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger and Tesla Inc. founder Elon Musk to withdraw from a presidential jobs panel.

Despite a recovering economy and relatively low unemployment, much of America’s physical infrastructure is in a state of extended disrepair. This is an accepted fact on both sides of the aisle and will require a mutual commitment to action to fix it. JPMorgan Chase Despite a recovering economy and relatively low unemployment, much of America’s physical infrastructure is in a state of extended disrepair. But while the need for increased investment in infrastructure is clear, what is often less recognized is that infrastructure goes well beyond the traditional image of trains, highways, bridges, airports, and ports. Local infrastructure is crucial for healthy communities to thrive and broadens the view of where resources are needed: transit to link neighborhoods to business and job centers; affordable housing units for workers; access to clean water and reliable electricity; and internet connectivity. All are necessary components to create an environment rich with opportunities for its citizens, and without them residents suffer. For instance, linking dislocated neighborhoods to job centers can provide tremendous employment opportunity for residents, but has proven a lingering problem to solve, and it is one that disproportionately—though not surprisingly—tends to affect low-income residents more. In fact, recent data from the JPMorgan Chase Institute1  found that Detroit residents made nearly 72 percent of their retail transactions outside their “20-minute neighborhood,” and that low-income residents had to travel 15 percent farther than high-income residents. Smart infrastructure investments that encourage growth and increase opportunity can clearly help address the shared economic challenges of our communities. Leaders in Washington, working closely alongside the country’s mayors and governors, can be the catalysts for a bipartisan, collaborative investment in America’s infrastructure that engages the business and nonprofit communities. There are already important examples of this collaborative approach at work that can help inspire new thinking: The M1 Railway The M1 Railway in Detroit, which JPMorgan Chase supports as part of its $100 million investment in the city, links Detroit’s downtown with surrounding neighborhoods and shows how infrastructure development can create economic opportunity in distressed areas. In addition to providing a much needed boost for Detroit’s public transit infrastructure, it also connects neighborhood residents to downtown jobs, and has helped spur development of new retail spaces along the M1 corridor, encouraging entrepreneurs and small business owners to locate in a high-traffic area. CDFIS Support for Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) in Detroit, such as Invest Detroit and Capital Impact Partners, is fueling the development of new housing and retail centers in neighborhoods across the city, giving residents the chance to live, shop, and work locally instead of venturing far outside their neighborhood. PRO Neighborhoods PRO Neighborhoods – JPMorgan Chase’s $125 million, five-year initiative focused on neighborhood revitalization – works with local and regional organizations around the country to invest in sustainable projects, including local retail centers along transit corridors and accessible affordable housing. NatureVest NatureVest, an initiative managed by The Nature Conservancy and supported by JPMorgan Chase, is helping cities such as Washington, D.C. accelerate their use of green infrastructure to manage storm-water runoff by developing policy standards and financing tools that attract private capital to support these projects—creating both environmental and social benefits. Recently, NatureVest began working in Detroit to provide green infrastructure services to local businesses and technical assistance to the city as they develop the policy foundation needed to make green infrastructure investments durable. All of these examples show that in order for investments in infrastructure to be most effective, they have to extend past the shoulder of a highway or the piling of a bridge. We need to make sound, long-term commitments that help disconnected neighborhoods link more closely with available jobs and services, and we must provide support for communities to develop their own business districts and retail opportunities. Successful infrastructure programs that are designed to have a positive impact on communities are not built with a one- or even five-year window in mind; rather they are established to have an impact for decades. To develop an effective approach to this comprehensive national infrastructure investment, we need to constantly evaluate whether the strategies that incorporate local input as well as regional impact set the conditions for long-term economic growth. We need the business community to come together to create urgency around this issue, and to bring its unique capabilities to the table to strengthen the underlying systems required to deliver and sustain progress. Doing so will enable us to address our infrastructure needs at every level, and help expand the pathways to opportunity for communities around the world.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Economists for Hassett By Ben White and Aubree Eliza Weaver 06/05/2017 08:00 AM EDT FIRST LOOK: ECONOMISTS FOR HASSETT — A group of 44 economists from across the political spectrum is sending a letter to the Hill this morning in support of the nomination of AEI’s Kevin Hassett to be chair of President Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers. The signers include 14 former CEA Chairs, two former Fed Chairs and three deans. The list includes many leading conservative economists but also some major progressive names including Dean Baker and Jared Bernstein and former Obama administration CEA chairs Jason Furman, Austan Goolsbee and Alan Krueger. Story Continued Below From the letter: “While we disagree on many issues, as economists we all agree that the Nation would be well served if Kevin Hassett is confirmed … [W]e all believe that the formulation of economic policy would be advanced by the analysis and advice that Dr. Hassett would bring to the table” Full letter. INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF DRAMA — POLITICO’s Josh Dawsey and Ben White: “[White House chief of staff Reince Priebus] is a dead man walking, according to senior White House officials, advisers and others close to the president. Aides have begun speculating about his next job. … Yet he continues to show up for work every day as the chief-of-staff, even as headlines say he will be fired — if not today, then tomorrow or next week. “His greatest job security: There are few takers for what might be an unworkable gig. … Interviews with a dozen Trump officials and advisers suggest few expect Priebus to be long for the West Wing. A Trump adviser said the president has made no secret of his plans to remove Priebus and is in regular communication with a group of outside advisers about who could replace him. COHN FOR CHIEF? — “Even Priebus critics admit Trump makes the job difficult for him — and would be unlikely to accept a strong chief of staff, ruling out a number of people who might want the job. “Trump has asked a number of associates what they think of replacing Priebus with his top economic adviser Gary Cohn, who is close to Kushner and who, as a Democrat, would have a hard time wrangling Republicans on Capitol Hill. “Cohn is a hard-charging personality viewed as willing to impose significant discipline on a West Wing staff known for navigating around Priebus and free-lancing outside their main policy areas. But Cohn, along with other outside candidates, is likely to demand assurances from Trump before accepting the chief of staff job” Read more. CEOS COOL ON TRUMP — ICYMI my piece from Saturday with Annie Karni: “The relationship between corporate America and Donald Trump’s White House has chilled. The regular parades of business titans into the West Wing are gone. A gathering of executives led by Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman initially planned for [this] week fell apart amid scheduling conflicts. “Chief executives and senior corporate lobbyists are also dismayed that the administration’s big Capitol Hill agenda — including repealing Obamacare and passing massive tax cuts — appears stalled. And the White House is now engaged in a very public fight with itself over how and when to raise the debt limit, a terrifying prospect for Wall Street and the rest of corporate America” Read more. WELCOME TO INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK — WaPo's John Wagner: “Trump will seek to put a spotlight on his vows to privatize the nation's air traffic control system and spur $1 trillion in new investment in roads, waterways and other infrastructure with a weeklong series of events starting Monday at the White House. “The events — billed as 'infrastructure week' — are part of a stepped-up effort since the president's return a week ago from his first foreign trip to show that the White House remains focused on its agenda, despite cascading headlines about investigations into his administration's ties to Russia” Read more. WALL STREET’S GRIM VIEW ON DC — Goldman’s Alec Phillips: “Political setbacks, a lack of consensus on policy priorities, the distraction of fiscal deadlines, and the prolonged consideration of health legislation have delayed consideration of tax reform and diminished expectations of major policy changes more generally “This looks likely to continue for another few months, in our view. Health legislation looks likely to take until at least July to resolve, and will probably end with a piecemeal approach … Fiscal deadlines will crowd the agenda again in Q3, including a debt limit debate as early as next month.” MORE THAN COMEY THIS WEEK — ABA’s Rob Nichols in his first Medium post: “As Washington focuses on former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony this week, something else will be happening in the nation’s capital that will have a far greater impact on the U.S. economy. “Congress and the administration will both take initial steps to fix regulatory rules that are hurting banks’ ability to serve their customers and communities … As soon as this week, the Treasury Department is due to release a much-anticipated report on potential reforms to bank regulation … Meanwhile, on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, Congress is moving forward on its own reform package” Read more. CRISIS IN GULF RELATIONS — Reuters: “Saudi Arabia broke diplomatic relations and all land sea and air contacts with fellow Gulf Arab state Qatar on Monday, saying the move was necessary to protect the kingdom from what it described as terrorism and extremism. “The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt also cut ties with Qatar on Monday. Saudi Arabia's official state news agency, citing an official source, said the kingdom had decided to sever diplomatic and consular relations with Qatar ‘proceeding from the exercise of its sovereign right guaranteed by international law and the protection of national security from the dangers of terrorism and extremism’.” Read more.

Lot on deck including the need to lift the debt ceiling … House expected to vote Thursday on the CHOICE ACT 2.0 which should pass now that it doesn’t include Durbin amendment repeal.

This threatens to limit the immediate employment options available for them upon graduation and may impede economic growth overall. See why JPMorgan Chase is dedicated to providing more American teens with quality summer jobs: http://politi.co/2ruHGEv ** MERKEL VS TRUMP — In a remarkable piece drawing on private notes from the recent G-7 meeting, Der Spiegel writes that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s “aim is that of creating an alliance against Trump. If she can't convince the U.S. president, her approach will be that of trying to isolate him. “In Taormina, it was six countries against one. Should Trump not reverse course, she is hoping that the G-20 in Hamburg in July will end 19:1. Whether she will be successful is unclear.” Read more. NO REAL PLAN ON INFRASTRUCTURE? — NYT’s Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Kate Kelly: “Trump will lay out a vision this coming week for sharply curtailing the federal government’s funding of the nation’s infrastructure … But the actual details of the initiative are unsettled, and a more intricate blueprint is still weeks or even months from completion. What the president will offer instead over the coming days, his advisers said, are the contours of a plan … “Mr. Cohn acknowledged that the White House did not have a detailed proposal ready to release. He said, for example, that no decision had been made on whether the infrastructure plan would ultimately be married to a tax measure. ‘It’s undetermined yet,’ Mr. Cohn said. ‘It may come before. It may come during. It may come after.’” Read more. FIRST “POST-RATIONALIST PRESIDENT”? — Larry Summers in the FT: “We may have our first post-rational president. Mr Trump has rejected the view of modern science on global climate change, has embraced economic forecasts and trade theories outside the range of reputable opinion, and relied on the idea of alternative facts rather than evidence-based truth.” Read more. LONDON ATTACKS SEND POUND DOWN — Bloomberg’s Adam Haigh: “The pound slipped after a terror attack in London and the yen held gains that came Friday in the wake of a weaker-than expected U.S. employment report. Stocks headed for a mixed start in Asia. “As investors weigh the implications of the latest terror incident at a popular London nightlife spot, the reaction in the British currency was muted. The euro was near its highest this year and the yen remained stronger they rallied at the end of last week after reports showed wage growth and hiring strength in the American labor market came in below forecasts.” Read more. WORLD BANK SEES GLOBAL ECONOMY GROWING 2.7 PERCENT — AP’s Paul Wiseman: “The world economy will pick up speed this year and next, helped by steadier commodity prices and a pickup in global trade, the World Bank said Sunday. The anti-poverty agency predicts 2.7 percent growth this year and 2.9 percent in 2018, improving on 2016's 2.4 percent expansion. “The bank sees the U.S. economy growing 2.1 percent this year, up from 1.6 percent in 2016, and the 19-country eurozone expanding 1.7 percent, down a notch from 1.8 percent. Japan is expected to grow 1.5 percent, fastest pace since 2013 and up from 1 percent last year. China's deceleration will continue - from 6.7 percent growth last year to 6.5 percent in 2017 to 6.3 percent in 2018” Read more. DEUTSCHE BANK IGNORES TRUMP/RUSSIA QUERY — Reuters’ Tom Sims: “Germany's largest bank has failed to respond to a request from Democrats on a U.S. House of Representatives panel for details about U.S. President Donald Trump's possible ties to Russia, a Democratic staffer said on Sunday. “Several Democrats on the U.S. House Financial Services Committee sent a letter last month to John Cryan, Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Bank, seeking details that might show if Trump's loans for his real estate business were backed by the Russian government. The letter asked for details of internal reviews of Trump's transactions and gave the prominent German bank until Friday to respond” Read more. FRESH DOUBT RAISED OVER FED RATE RISE — FT’s Robin Wigglesworth: “A growing number of investors and analysts are questioning whether a widely-expected US interest rate increase at the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting is warranted in the face of subdued inflation and signs of weaker economic growth. “Minutes from the last central bank meeting indicate that policymakers are planning to tighten monetary policy again at the June 14 [FOMC] gathering, and financial markets are pricing in a 90 per cent probability of a quarter-point rate increase … However, US economic data have undershot forecasts. The implied probability of a Fed interest rate increase on June 14 and the Citi Economic Surprise Index … have diverged markedly since the beginning of May.” Read more. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CONCERNED ABOUT U.S. FIRMS OFFERING VENEZUELA A FINANCIAL ‘LIFELINE’ — Reuters’ Matt Spetalnick and Girish Gupta: “The Trump administration is concerned about any action by U.S. companies that provides a financial lifeline to Venezuela's government, senior White House officials told Reuters, after Goldman Sachs Group Inc came under fire for purchasing $2.8 billion of state oil company bonds at a steep discount. “Venezuela’s political opposition and some U.S. lawmakers have condemned the purchase of so-called ‘hunger bonds’ as a way to prop up President Nicolas Maduro's cash-strapped government, accused of being behind food shortages affecting millions of Venezuelans in a worsening crisis. The New York-based investment bank said last week that it never transacted directly with Venezuelan authorities when it bought the bonds of oil firm PDVSA for pennies on the dollar.” Read more. AG TRADER HIRES JPMORGAN — FT’s Neil Hume, Arash Massoudi and James Fontanella-Khan: “Bunge, the US grain trader that is fending off takeover interest from Switzerland’s Glencore, has bolstered its defences with the appointment of advisers. The New York-listed company is working with JPMorgan Chase and law firm Shearman & Sterling as it seeks to remain independent. “Bunge, which signalled earlier this year that it was willing to be part of tie-ups in the sector, has said it is not in ‘business combinations’ discussions with Glencore and has refused to comment further. The unexpected approach from Glencore, caught company off-guard, as it had been focused on a partnership or merger with the miner’s agricultural arm, rather than a sale” Read more. ** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Tackling the teen unemployment crisis is a priority for cities across the United States. “It’s a moral and economic crisis that too many young people graduate high school without clear pathways to good jobs,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase’s Summer Youth Employment Program has enhanced skill-based and career-specific job opportunities for young people all across the country. This commitment, combined with other local support, has created nearly 50,000 summer jobs for teens and is expanding to 19 cities this summer —putting teens on a path to greater economic opportunity.

Photographer: Christophe Morin/BloombergMore JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon, who in December agreed to exit a minority-owned Chinese investment-banking joint venture, said the U.S. bank is seeking to find a new structure that would eventually give it full control. “My longer-term dream is that we have, we own, 100 percent of something,” Dimon, 61, said Monday in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Stephen Engle in Beijing. The CEO said he’ll be patient in negotiations with Chinese regulators. The process “is complicated, so we respect that and we tell them what we’d like and hope it’ll happen.” More from Bloomberg.com: Saudi-led Alliance Moves to Blockade Qatar Over Iran Tensions JPMorgan moved to sell its stake in JPMorgan First Capital Securities late last year after six years in the venture. Its partner, First Capital Securities Co., was to buy out JPMorgan from its one-third stake for 307 million yuan ($44 million at the time), the Chinese firm said in December. Since UBS Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. established Chinese joint ventures more than a decade ago, foreign banks have struggled to challenge local players. One competitive disadvantage is that Chinese rules limit them to minority stakes, reducing their sway over key decisions. China has made “huge progress” on market reforms, Dimon said, adding that he would like to increase his firm’s businesses in the nation.

The bank said in February that it won approval to underwrite corporate bond sales in China’s interbank market. Dimon said JPMorgan would consider setting up a business in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, without providing more specifics. As China’s leaders remain on track with financial and trade reforms, Dimon said he sees full yuan convertibility in the next five to 10 years. “Twenty years from now, they will house 35 percent of the Fortune 3000 and we should go for that,” Dimon said. “They’ve made huge progress in reforms, financial reforms, market reforms.” Updates with comments starting in second paragraph.

The French Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) granted on 2 June 2017 visa number 17-252 for a prospectus which consists of an English-language registration document filed with the AMF on 11 May 2017 under number I.17-042, an English-language securities note and an English and French-language summary of the prospectus (included in the securities note).      (Logo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/518717/ALD_Logo.jpg ) The indicative offering price range (the "Offering Price range") is set between €14.20 to €17.40 per share. The first day of trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris is expected to be 16 June 2017 on as-if and-when delivered basis. Mike Masterson, CEO of ALD, said: "This IPO marks an important step in ALD's development. Over the past few years, our group has recorded solid and continued growth, and we have constantly invested in the development of new, innovative solutions for our clients and partners. Thanks to our robust business model, our dedicated and experienced teams and our global footprint, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver profitable growth in line with the Group's vision: to be at the forefront of change in the mobility sector." STRUCTURE OF THE GLOBAL OFFERING The Offered Shares are being offered as part of the Global Offering consisting of: an international offering (the "International Offering") primarily to institutional investors, which will be composed of: a private placement in France; and an international private placement in certain other countries, including in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A ("Rule 144A") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and outside of the United States in reliance on Regulation S ("Regulation S") under the Securities Act; and a public offering in France, by way of an open price offer (offre à prix ouvert) (the "French Public Offering"). At least 10% of the total number of shares offered in the Global Offering, prior exercise of the over-allotment option (the "Over-Allotment Option"), will be allocated to the French Public Offering provided there is sufficient demand. If demand in the French Public Offering is less than 10% of the Offered Shares in the Global Offering (excluding the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option), the remaining Firm Shares not allocated to the French Public Offering will be allocated under the International Offering. Purchase orders will be categorized by the number of shares requested:    • A1 orders: between 10 and 200 shares (included);    • A2 orders: more than 200 shares. The A1 orders will benefit from preferential treatment as compared to the A2 orders in the event that all A orders cannot be satisfied in their entirety. It is further specified that each order should be placed for a minimum number of 10 shares. SIZE OF THE GLOBAL OFFERING The Global Offering consists of 80,820,728 existing shares sold by the Selling Shareholder, which number may be increased to a maximum of 92,943,837 shares sold by Selling Shareholder in the event of the exercise in full of the Over-Allotment Option. The stabilizing manager, on behalf of the underwriters, has been granted an option to purchase additional existing shares sold by the Selling Shareholder that represent up to 15% of the Firm Shares, ie a maximum of 12,123,109 Offered Shares. Including overallotment option, the total size of the Global Offering is between approximately €1,320 million and €1,617 million. STABILIZATION J.P. Morgan Securities PLC (or any entity acting on its behalf), acting as stabilizing manager on behalf of the underwriters, may (but is under no obligation to) carry any and all stabilization operations deemed useful aiming to support ALD's share price in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, in particular the provisions of EU Parliament and Council Regulation 596/2014 of 16 April 2014 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 of 8 March 2016. There is, however, no obligation for the stabilizing manager to undertake such transactions and such transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time and without warning. Stabilization transactions are intended to support the market price of the shares and may support a price higher than that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. In the event that the stabilizing manager undertakes stabilization transactions, such transactions may take place at any time during 30 calendar days following the determination of the Offering Price, or any time between 15 June 2017 and 14 July 2017, according to the indicative timetable. The stabilizing manager will ensure that the public and the competent market regulators are informed in accordance with Article 5.5 of the Regulation and Article 6 of the Delegated Regulation. Therefore, during the stabilization period, the persons designated as responsible ensure adequate public disclosure of the details of all stabilization transactions no later than the end of the seventh daily market session following the date of such transactions. The Joint Global Coordinators, Joint Lead Managers and Joint Bookrunners, on behalf of the underwriters, may decide to over-allot up to the number of shares covered by the Over-Allotment Option increased, as the case may be, by a number of shares representing 5% of the aggregate amount of the Offering, in accordance with Article 8 (b) of the Delegated Regulation. In compliance with Article 7.1 of the Delegated Regulation, stabilization transactions may not be effected at a price greater than the Offering Price. THE INDICATIVE OFFERING PRICE RANGE For information purposes, the indicative Offering Price range is set between €14.20 and €17.40 per share. This price range for the Offering is indicative only and the Offering Price may be set outside of this range. The indicative Offering Price range may be modified at any time up to and including the date of the determination of the Offering Price. In the event that the high end of the indicative Offering Price range is increased, or in the event that the Offering Price is set above the high end of the indicative Offering Price range, the closing date of the French Public Offering will be deferred or a new offering period will be opened, as applicable, so that there are at least two market days between the press release announcing such change and the revised closing date of the French Public Offering. Purchase orders placed in connection with the French Public Offering prior to the date of such press release will be maintained unless they are expressly revoked prior to or on the revised closing date of the French Public Offering. The Offering Price may be fixed below the indicative Offering Price range without restriction or the low end of the indicative Offering Price range may be lowered without restriction, provided that there is no material impact on the other terms and conditions of the Offering. INDICATIVE TIMETABLE FOR THE GLOBAL OFFERING The offering period for the French Public Offering will open on 5 June 2017 and is expected to close on 14 June 2017 at 5:00 PM (Paris time) for orders made at the branches of financial institutions and 8:00 PM (Paris time) for orders placed online. The offering period for the International Offering will open on 5 June 2017 and is expected to close on 15 June 2017 at 1:00 PM (Paris time), subject to early closing or extension. Orders made by retail investors via the Internet in the French Public Offering will be revocable, via the Internet, until the closing of the French Public Offering (on 14 June 2017 at 8:00 PM, Paris time). Individuals are responsible for liaising with their respective financial intermediaries in order to confirm whether the orders submitted by other means are revocable and if so under what conditions (including whether orders submitted via the Internet can be revoked by means other than via the Internet). Any order issued in the context of the International Offering can be revoked through the Joint Global Coordinators, and Joint Bookrunners listed below having received the relevant order until until 15 June 2017 at 1:00 PM (Paris time), unless the offering period is closed early or postponed. The Offering Price is expected to be determined on 15 June 2017. Trading of the shares is expected to start on 16 June 2017, on the regulated market of Euronext Paris under the ticker symbol "ALD AIW (as-if-and-when-delivered") until the settlement date. The date of the settlement and delivery of the Offering is expected to occur on 19 June 2017, provided that the Offering Price is determined on 15 June 2017. Trading of the shares is expected to start on 20 June 2017 on the regulated market of Euronext Paris on a listing line called "ALD". REASONS FOR THE OFFERING The listing of the shares on Euronext Paris is intended to enable ALD to gain visibility and reputation in the mobility ecosystem as well as to access to new means of financing and to increase its capacity to accelerate its development and to seize new growth opportunities in both the corporate and B2C markets. The Selling Shareholder will receive the net proceeds from the sale of the Firm Shares and, if the Over-Allotment Option is exercised, from the sale of the Offered Shares.

The nomination followed a Trump tweet blaming Democrats for a slow rate of nominees' approvals, despite Republicans controlling the Senate and few named nominations. Leslie Shaffer | @LeslieShaffer1 Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 9:38 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images Joseph Otting, then-CEO of OneWest Bank, smiles during a public meeting held by the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in Los Angeles, California, U.S., on Thursday, Feb. 26, 2015. White House plans nominations to key posts, including comptroller of the currency The Trump administration announced plans for long-delayed nominations to key posts, including tapping former One West CEO Joseph Otting for comptroller of the currency. Otting, whose name first began being floated for the role back in March, worked closely with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at One West, which Mnuchin purchased in 2009. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is an independent agency within the Treasury and is responsible for overseeing the nation's biggest banks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. The position is expected to play a significant role in carrying out U.S. President Donald Trump's promise to roll back regulations — including doing a "number" on the sweeping law known as Dodd-Frank that was implemented following the 2008 financial crisis. Senate confirmation is required for the role. Trump has received criticism for moving slowly on a series of senior political appointments, a delay he used a tweet on Monday to blame on Democrats in Congress, despite Republicans controlling both the House and Senate. Donald J. Trump‏: .@foxandfriends Dems are taking forever to approve my people, including Ambassadors. They are nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS! Want approvals. Trump has formally nominated 63 of the 559 positions which require Senate confirmation, with 39 confirmed, 16 awaiting nominations and 441 lacking any nominee, according to the Partnership for Public Service. Those totals didn't appear to include the nine planned nominations announced late Monday. Other planned nominations announced on Tuesday included Owen West, a former marine and a Goldman Sachs alum, to be the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low intensity conflict. David Pekoske, a former vice commandant with the U.S. Coast Guard, was tapped to be the assistant secretary of homeland security, with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Brian Allen Benczkowski, a partner at the Washington, DC office of law firm Kirkland & Ellis, was tapped for the role of assistant attorney general for the criminal division at the Department of Justice, the press release said. Steven Bradbury, a litigation partner at Dechert LLP in Washington, DC, was tapped for the role of general counsel of transportation. —Ylan Mui contributed to this article.

(HLF), Snap Inc (SNAP) and Incyte Corporation (INCY) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks INCY, HLF and SNAP stock each got the new trading week started on the wrong foot By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Jun 5, 2017, 4:49 pm EDT     Popular Posts: 5 Top Stocks to Buy in June 8 No-Brainer Retirement Stocks to Buy Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock When This Happens Recent Posts: Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Isn’t an On-Demand Video Play, Yet, But Give it Time Why Snap Inc (SNAP), Duluth Holdings Inc (DLTH) and Cenovus Energy Inc (USA) (CVE) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks 5 Budgeting Tips That Will Help You Survive After Graduation View All Posts Traders didn’t start the new trading week quite in the same bullish mood they were in when they wrapped up last week’s trading. Although the market poked its head into positive territory a couple of times on Monday, by the time the closing bell rang, the S&P 500 was at 2,436.10, down 0.12%. That kind of setback would have been plenty palatable relative to the losses Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF), Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) and Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) dished out today, however. Here’s a look at what upended each name. Snap Inc (SNAP) Not that analyst doubts about the future of Snapchat parent Snap are anything new, but there is something about seeing them in print that can spook investors. JPMorgan did the deed today, lowering its price target on SNAP from $20 to $18, and simultaneously establishing a neutral rating on the stock. Analyst Doug Anmuth is concerned that the company could struggle to monetize its user base, and may not be able to turn any sort of a profit until 2020. Anmuth thinks the year-over-year comparisons for the upcoming quarterly report will roll in 20% weaker as the Olympics and a heated race for President kept users glued to the platform in mid-2016. Snap stock was only down 4.2% following the release of the pessimistic opinion. But, with today’s setback, SNAP shares are also down 30% from March’s post-IPO peak, and still fighting what appears to be a losing battle. Incyte Corporation (INCY) On the surface, the data Incyte presented this weekend at the annual ASCO conference is compelling. The combination of its enzyme inhibitor epacadostat and Keytruda, from Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), had an overall response rate of 35%. That’s statistically significant enough to get the Food and Drug Administration’s nod of approval. A closer look at the data, however, isn’t quite as encouraging to INCY shareholders. For whatever reasons, Incyte excluded the trial data for three patients in the study, and the study is already suspiciously small at only 43 patients. The information for those other three individuals existed. Incyte just chose not to incorporate it into its presentation. 10 Stocks to Buy Before They Go and Finally Join the Rally INCY shareholders understandably interpreted it as a red flag, sending the stock to a loss of 5.7% for Monday’s session. Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) Finally, vitamin and supplement outfit Herbalife saw its stock dip 6.6% after the company culled its revenue outlook for the quarter currently underway. For its second fiscal quarter ending this month, Herbalife now expects to report growth of between only 2% and 6%. Though the company also upped its Q2 profit forecast from a range of 88 cents to $1.08 per share to a range of between 95 cents and $1.15 per share of HLF, activist investor and Herbalife bear Bill Ackman was quick to chime in, pointing out the fact that the lowered guidance comes after raised guidance from May 4, and after a handful of insiders sold their sizable stakes. He’s not making an accusation, but it certainly doesn’t look good. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Social media often gives users the chance to review restaurants, products or businesses, but the tables have turned and now analysts are reviewing a couple of these stocks. 24/7 Wall St. had the chance to review these analyst reports that are moving some social media stocks on Monday, and we have included some of the highlights. JPMorgan cut its price target for Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) to $18 from $20. The reasoning behind this cut is a decelerating ad business in the third quarter. The firm believes that Snap will have a slower-than-expected pace for scaling its ad platform. This is the result of Snap’s new products, including self-serve Snap ads, which could take some time to gain traction. At the same time, daily active user additions are expected to drop to 8 million from 10 million for the second half of the year due to increased competition from Facebook. However, what could really hurt Snap, is its lockup expiration of about 70% to 80% of Snap shares, coming in late July, which could drop shares before the lockup and after. Snap’s Spectacles are also expected to be have a softer reception than previously thought. Shares of Snap were trading down 1.9% at $20.69 on Monday, with a consensus analyst price target of $21.10 and a 52-week range of $17.59 to $29.44. Merrill Lynch upgraded Yelp Inc. (NYSE: YELP) to a Buy rating from Neutral and raised its price objective to $37 from $35, implying upside of nearly 30% from the previous closing price. The brokerage firm saw this as a rare multiple expansion opportunity in this bull market. The firm noted that lower revenue guidance may have obscured the fact that user activity and new customer adds stabilized in the first quarter. The risk versus reward is favorable, with the stock trading at 10 times EBITDA. Again Merrill Lynch pointed out that this is one of the rare multiple expansion opportunities (historically) in the sector. Shares of Yelp were last seen up 2.9% at $29.62, with a consensus price target of $31.47 and a 52-week range of $25.93 to $43.41.

It's brand valuation nudged up by 5% to $143 billion. Amazon has been on fire over the past year and its brand value surged by 41% to hit $139 billion. Google's brand is associated with innovative research, self-driving cars and helpful online services like Google Drive, Google Docs and Google Maps. Apple's brand value nudged up by 3% to $235 billion, helping it retain the No. 2 position in the ranking. But the brand has lost some shine since 2015 when it topped the BrandZ ranking. By Alanna Petroff LONDON (CNNMoney) -- China now has one of the world's most valuable brands. Shenzhen-based tech firm Tencent has broken into a ranking of the top 10 most valuable brands published by BrandZ. The annual ranking is typically dominated by American companies with global reach, making the inclusion of a Chinese firm notable. Tencent specializes in popular online games, apps, instant messaging services and online payments. It boasts a market capitalization of $330 billion, making it worth more than America's most valuable bank: JPMorgan Chase. Here's a round-up of the world's 10 most valuable brands: 1. Google Google is still the most valuable brand in the world; a title it has retained for seven out of the past 11 years. It's brand value -- worth just over $245 billion -- increased by 7% from 2016. The company has transformed itself from a simple search engine to an all-encompassing lifestyle brand, said Doreen Wang, Global Head of BrandZ. Google's brand is associated with innovative research, self-driving cars and helpful online services like Google Drive, Google Docs and Google Maps. Bonus: The company consistently ranks as one of the world's best employers. 2. Apple Apple's brand value nudged up by 3% to $235 billion, helping it retain the No. 2 position in the ranking. But the brand has lost some shine since 2015 when it topped the BrandZ ranking. Wang said Apple's "innovation speed over the last year is not perceived to be as fast as Google or Amazon." BrandZ's ranking relies heavily on consumer perceptions. If people can't see that Apple is being innovative, its brand value will suffer. 3. Microsoft Microsoft has landed in the third slot for three years running. It's brand valuation nudged up by 5% to $143 billion. "The key word is Microsoft Cloud," said Wang, who said the success of the company's cloud and business services helped improve consumer perceptions. Microsoft generates nearly a third of its revenue and almost 40% of its operating profits from its "Intelligent Cloud" line of businesses. Investors are clearly happy with the company: Shares have shot up by about 16% since the start of the year. 4. Amazon Amazon has been on fire over the past year and its brand value surged by 41% to hit $139 billion. "Wherever the consumers go, Amazon is going," said Wang. "At this moment, that is the right strategy." The retail giant offers a wide range of services: online shopping, grocery delivery, cloud computing and entertainment are just the tip of the iceberg. It's continuing to develop artificial intelligence services and its personal digital assistant, Alexa. Investors have taken notice too, bidding up shares by 34% since the start of the year. 5. Facebook The Facebook brand continues to perform well, despite scandals over fake news and violent events streamed live on its platform. Users think of Facebook as "friendly" and "helpful," said Wang. This has helped convince advertisers to move onto the platform, and users don't seem to mind the growth in advertised content, she said. Facebook's brand value shot up by 27% over the past year to hit $130 billion. 6. AT&T Telecom giant AT&T has appeared in the ranking for seven consecutive years and its brand has increased in value by 65% over that period. It's now worth $115 billion. "It's becoming a more dynamic brand and increasing communications with consumers," said Wang. The company is trying to close an acquisition of CNN's parent company, Time Warner, that is worth about $109 billion including debt. If the purchase goes ahead, it would be one of the biggest takeovers of all time. 7. Visa Visa is an American company with a name that's recognized around the world. The company's brand value increased 10% to hit $111 billion this year. The brand got a particularly big boost after Costco ended its relationship with American Express last year in favor of a new one with Visa and Citigroup. Millions of former Costco AmEx cards were subsequently transferred to Visa and Citi. 8. Tencent Led by its media-shy CEO, "Pony" Ma Huateng, Tencent is huge in China, where its messaging platform WeChat is used for everything from texting to booking karaoke sessions. BrandZ said that increased used of WeChat helped to propel Tencent into the top 10 for the first time. Its brand value jumped 27% to $108 billion. The only other Chinese firm to have cracked the top 10 is China Mobile, but it's hasn't appeared on the list since 2013. Tencent is hoping to avoid that same fate by expanding globally. It announced plans last month to set up an artificial intelligence research lab in Seattle. "Right now they're very aggressive in going beyond China," said Wang. 9. IBM IBM has been included in the ranking since it started in 2006. This year the brand has been valued at $102 billion, up 18% from last year. The company has helped boost its consumer appeal through the development of the artificial intelligence mascot Watson. "Watson is the face of the company's transformation," said Wang. 10. McDonald's McDonald's is the only truly non-tech company to be featured in the top 10 ranking this year. The brand has received a boost by introducing more healthy food options. It's also offering more locally-inspired options in places like China and India, said Wang. "McDonald's has been doing pretty well compared to the other fast food restaurants," she said.

Quotes in the article Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 72.03 -0.35 -0.48% Snap Inc SNAP ▼ 18.55 -0.97 -4.97% Alphabet Inc GOOGL ▼ 967.00 -2.00 -0.21% Facebook Inc FB ▲ 153.46 +0.35 +0.23% Stock analysts who cover the company now see Snap posting wider losses for this year and next than they expected three months ago, the latest data from Yahoo Finance shows. Most recently, JPMorgan cut its 2017 price target on Snap to $18 from $20 on Monday. What's more, the company's shares slid in last week — even as the broader market for tech stocks rose — after an influential internet report released Wednesday showed just how big a challenge Snap faces in the online ad market. If Snap can't innovate fast enough to stay ahead of Facebook (FB) and other much-larger rivals, the company may find itself trying to generate growth out of an ever-smaller slice of the digital ad pie. Taken together, the latest news on the company suggests that investors who are betting on Snap shares will see more of the bumpy ride that's followed its early March IPO. The shares, which closed Friday at just over $21 a share, have traded as high as $29.44 and as low as $17.59. It was at $20.68 on Monday morning. The risks in owning Snap shares aren't news to anyone who read it's pre-IPO financial documents. Load Error The owner of Snapchat has never come close to making a profit and said plainly that it "may never achieve or maintain profitability." The stock will also be under more pressure this summer as the lockup on roughly three-quarters of its shares expires in late July. © Provided by CNBC Wider losses seen for this year and 2018 But a look at the average estimate of analysts shows that Wall Street is expecting even deeper losses now than at the time of Snap's IPO. As of late Friday, the company was expected to lose 57 cents a share this year, a much wider than the loss of 44 cents expected in early March, and worse than the 51 cent loss seen just 30 days ago. The trend is the same for Snap's 2018 losses, which are now forecast at 34 cents a share, or about a third wider than the 26 cents projected three months ago. And those numbers exclude the costs of stock-based compensation, which continue to be significant at the company. In the first quarter, for example, those charges were $2 billion, or 13 times revenue of $150 million, driven higher by the company's IPO. The bad news in Mary Meeker's annual internet trends report Meanwhile, Snap shares have been slipping even while the Nasdaq composite index climbed to new highs. The drop came after Mary Meeker, the former Wall Street analyst who now tracks the web for the marquee venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, released her annual internet trends report on Wednesday. According to Meeker, Facebook and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL) captured 85 percent of the growth in online ad revenue last year. That suggests online advertising is fast becoming a duopoly that will leave little room for smaller rivals like Snap. Snapchat is seen capturing less than 1 percent of online ad revenue this year, according to the research firm eMarketer. And the shift to mobile video ads that Facebook and Google are dominating is attracting other rivals. Add Microsoft to the list of companies aping Snapchat features Last Thursday, Microsoft's (MSFT) Skype unit rolled out new features meant to bolster its image as a fun place for people to hang out together online. Skype's updates include a tool for sharing videos that is similar to the stories tool from Snapchat. Skype users can now also paste emojis and short pieces of animation, known as gifs, into their photos and videos. Those kinds of tools have proven so popular with Snapchat users that Facebook (FB) aped them earlier this year and made them available to users of its Instagram service. In April, Facebook said Instagram's stories feature had 200 million users — more than Snapchat's total user base of 166 million. That push dented Snap's user growth in the first quarter, prompting investors to sell off its shares by more than 20 percent in one day. Still, the shares bounced back after several large hedge funds said they were buyers of the stock. And Snap hasn't been standing still. It said this week it began shipping its Spectacles glasses to Europe. That product can be used to take pictures and view digital elements superimposed upon real-life scenes, a function called augmented reality or AR. The glasses have yet to contribute meaningfully to Snap's revenue. If Snap wants to keep boosting its number of users and ad revenue, it likely will need more innovation to stay ahead of a growing list of competitors — which now includes Microsoft. Otherwise, Snapchat may find itself encircled by other, larger predators on the hunt for the same game. Disclosure: NBC Universal, the parent company of CNBC, is an investor in Snap.

HOME LOCAL POLITICS INTERVIEWS WORLD SPORTS COLUMNS EDITORIAL MY TAPROBANA RED CARPET CEYLON POLITICS TALKING CRICKET MINORITY PERSPECTIVES MY SERENDIB SCI / TECH ENTERTAINMENT GALLERY BIZARRE Features Mosaic Lite Hello Look Horoscope PRINT EDITION News Columns Sport Focus Interviews FT Opinion E-PAPER CONTACT Asian markets mostly lower after London attack   👤  2422 readers have read this article ! By 2017-06-06 Markets in Asia closed mostly lower on Monday following an attack in central London over the weekend and as oil prices gained sharply after four countries snapped diplomatic ties with Qatar. Oil prices rose on the back of news that Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt had severed diplomatic ties with Qatar. Saudi Arabia said it had cut ties with Qatar due to reasons related to terrorism, Reuters reported. Brent crude gained 0.86 per cent to trade at $50.38 a barrel and US West Texas International (WTI) crude added 0.9 per cent at $48.08. Natural gas futures for July also rose by 1.13 per cent to $3.032 per million British thermal units. Qatar is one of the world's largest producers of natural gas. In the weekend incident in London, attackers first drove into pedestrians on London Bridge, then headed to Borough Market before being shot by police. At least seven were killed following the attack. Twelve individuals have already been arrested, the Metropolitan Police said. The impact of the most recent London attack, however, is likely to have a 'very limited' on the markets, JPMorgan Asset Management's Chief Asia Market Strategist Tai Hui told CNBC. "If you look at various attacks in the past six to nine months in Europe or other parts of the world, their impact or the impression on the market tends to be very limited, if at all," Tai said. "Obviously, if that does steer towards a change in the political landscape in the UK for the election this week ... (in the) next several quarters, obviously that might have a marginal market impact," he added. The British pound traded as low as $1.2845 compared to levels around $1.2879 seen before the weekend. Cable traded at $1.2874 at 2:25 p.m. HK/SIN. The attack over the weekend would mostly have a 'minimal' impact on the pound's trajectory, Nomura G10 FX Strategist Peter Dragicevich told CNBC. "I think the bigger focus is obviously the election on Thursday in the UK. There is still a lot of uncertainty around which party will win. The polls do still suggest a majority for the Conservatives, but clearly the probability has declined with the narrowing in the polls," Dragicevich said. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 was marginally lower, closing down 0.03 per cent or 6.46 points at 20,170.82. South Korea's benchmark Kospi index finished the session 0.13 per cent or 3.1 points down at 2,368.62. The ASX 200 shed 0.57 per cent or 33.214 points to close at 5,754.9, driven largely by weakness in major financial stocks. Markets in China were mixed despite the positive read from the May Caixin services PMI, with the Hang Seng Index down 0.41 per cent at 3:00 p.m. HK/SIN. The Shanghai Composite closed 0.45 per cent or 14.0138 points down at 3,091.5262 while the Shenzhen Composite finished higher by 0.689 per cent or 12.3292 points at 1,800.9325. The Caixin services PMI came in at 52.8, compared to the 51.5 figure seen last month. This month's services PMI reflected that growth in the sector grew the quickest in four months. New Zealand markets are closed for a holiday. Shares of Japanese automakers were mostly lower on the strength of the yen, with Toyota falling 2.04 per cent to close at 5,968 yen a stock. The company had announced over the weekend it had sold its shares in Tesla after the end of a partnership to develop electric cars.

"Following" : "Follow"}} June 05, 2017 3:39pm   Comments Share: President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change accord has certainly resulted in a backlash from corporate America. Despite some evidence pointing to the accord as being a "bad deal" for American taxpayers and workers, CEOs including Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA)'s Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS)'s Bob Iger decided to cut ties with the president. Instead of sending a public message of severing ties with the president over the White House's stance on the accords, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM)'s CEO Jamie Dimon made it clear it is necessary for him to stay on as an adviser to the president so his voice is better heard. "I am an American patriot," Dimon told Bloomberg from the sidelines of the JPMorgan Global China Summit in Beijing. "I want to help the president of the United States." Dimon went on to criticize Musk and Iger who essentially quit the advisory board over one single issue. Dimon added that he is in favor of a carbon tax but also acknowledged this represents a tax on consumers. Also, the executive believes that a reason to remain in the Paris accord is to show a sign of good faith to the international community and signal America remains a team player in global initiatives. The executive also expressed his confidence in the White House's ongoing trade talks with China and the administration's pledge to create both free and fair trade agreements with many partners.

Since the concept of a shopping destination on state-owned marshland was first green-lit in 2003, the mall has encountered many problems. Two earlier developers gave up on the project, formerly known as "Xanadu." Now, Triple Five is looking to raise $2.8 billion to finance the final phases of construction. More than half of the funding will be arranged privately through  J.P. Morgan Chase. The remaining $1.1 billion is expected to  come from the sale of tax-free, unrated, government bonds. For that bond sale, two preliminary offering memoranda are now in circulation: one is for an $800 million bond package backed by payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT); the other is for a $300 million bond package backed by sales tax receipts generated after American Dream opens. The bonds are being sold by the Public Finance Authority of Wisconsin, which is serving as a middleman between the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority and investors. The documents — over 1,800 pages of them — disclose a wide array of risks that potential investors will have to consider. Transit is one. Roads and trains are both already heavily congested and could get worse: According to the PILOT bond memo, “The difficulty, expense, unfamiliarity and time-consuming nature of these transportation options, especially for persons carrying numerous purchases, may present a special risk." An even greater challenge may be the seeming end of America’s love affair with malls. A study by Credit Suisse recently suggested 20 to 25 percent of U.S. malls could close by 2022. “To the extent that these trends continue and have a material adverse effect on the American Dream Project, tenants and customers of the American Dream Project may find the American Dream Project less attractive, which may have a material adverse effect on the generation of sales taxes and on the operating income of the American Dream Project,” the offering memo states. If the mall fails to meet revenue projections, bond investors will have little recourse: their claims can be made only after the J.P. Morgan lenders have been compensated. Sixty-nine percent of American Dream's 2.9 million square feet of space has been leased to tenants like Saks, Lord & Taylor, and Primark. There will also be a Nickelodeon amusement park and a DreamWorks water park. Still, says Lisa Washburn, a credit research analyst for Municipal Market Analytics, the project should give any investor pause. “I still remain skeptical about the ability for success for the project generally and specifically very concerned about the risks to bondholders,” she said. Triple Five expects American Dream to open in early 2019. Also Seen In... Part of Mall Madness. Malls are in trouble. But New Jersey is helping a private developer finish the stalled American Dream mall, next to the NJ Turnpike. WNYC, NJ Spotlight and Bloomberg Businessweek examine what’s gone wrong -- and what could go right.

Share:  Email    Link Here        Facebook        Twitter        LinkedIn        Google Plus Widgets by: Rob Chrisman RESCAP Legal News; June Fed Rate Hike Odds Jun 5 2017, 9:02AM The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) published a Press Release announcing an update to the Cybersecurity Assessment Tool. Capital Markets Despite the arguably weak payroll number, the Fed Funds futures market (a way of gauging what all the smart folks think the probability is) increased their probability of a June hike to 93%. The 10 year continues to rally, and we are at the lowest yields since early November. The Trump "reflation trade" - $1 trillion on infrastructure plus tax breaks - continues to deflate, at least as far as bonds are concerned. Friday, after the employment data, we had a nice treasury rally following the weaker than expected payrolls report as the 10-year note led the market higher, price-wise, and rates dropped with the 10-year yield dropping to 2.14%. (If employment is not strong, inflation is not an issue, so rates shouldn't go up, right?) And so on Friday the 10-year note price improved .5 and closed with a yield of 2.16% whereas the 5-year and agency MBS prices improved about .250 depending on coupon and maturity. But it's a new week as we head into June. From overseas, scheduled news-wise, are two central bank decisions on Tuesday and Thursday. Also on Thursday is the UK general election - another election to talk about! Skipping over today (see next paragraph), tomorrow we'll have the JOLTS job openings figure, Wednesday is the MBA apps data from last week, Thursday is initial jobless claims, and Friday the 9th is...not much. This morning isn't much either. We've had some 2nd tier productivity (unchanged in 1st quarter) and unit labor costs (+2.2%). Coming up later are some factory-orders numbers and ISM numbers. We launch the week with rates a smidge higher versus Friday's closing levels. As a proxy for rates in general, the 10-year's yield is 2.18% and agency MBS prices are worse nearly .125. Bank News "Bigger is better" with some things, right? For those that think it applies to banks, and for those who like lists, S&P Global Market Intelligence finds the largest US banks by assets as of the end of Q1 in order were: JPMorgan ($2.55T); Bank of America ($2.24T); Wells Fargo ($1.95T), Citigroup ($1.82T), US Bancorp ($450B); PNC ($371B), TD Group ($371B), Capital One ($349B), Bank of New York Mellon ($338B), and HSBC North America ($295B). People's Intermountain Bank ($1.7B, UT) will acquire Town & Country Bank ($135mm, UT) for about $20.9mm in cash (35%) and stock (65%). Doolin Security Savings Bank ($48mm, OH) will combine with Belpre Savings Bank ($48mm, WV) in a merger of equals. In nearby Indiana Horizon Bank ($3.2B) will acquire Lafayette Community Bank ($172mm) for about $32mm in cash (10%) and stock (90%) or about 1.66x tangible book. And banks don't only have to buy banks, right? Peapack-Gladstone Bank ($4.0B, NJ) will acquire asset manager Murphy Capital Management Inc. (NJ) with its $850mm in assets under management. Things aren't always rosy of course. Regulators closed Fayette County Bank ($34mm, IL) and sold it to United Fidelity Bank ($574mm, IN) under a purchase and assumption agreement. (United picks up one branch, all the deposits, and about 84% of the assets.) Banks are where the money is... but what if you don't have much? SmartAsset did a study that considered affordability and livability factors to find the best cities for people who earn the U.S. median salary of $55,000. Legal Updates Clem Ziroli Jr., President of First Mortgage Corporation, reports that on May 18, 2017 attorneys for the corporation argued in U.S. District Court proceedings in Minnesota that claims by the RESCAP Liquidating Trust for $24.5M should be mostly dismissed, and that the remaining claims were overstated by 90%. RESCAP is the successor to the bankrupt unit of General Motors Acceptance Corporation's RFC, which was a dominant figure in the 2008 financial meltdown. "RESCAP lodged claims of breach of warranty and representation at loan origination for loans dating back to 1999. First Mortgage argued that all claims for 93 of 169 loans should be dismissed for being brought after a 6-year Statute of Limitations had passed. First Mortgage also argued that all claims for another 46 loans should be dismissed because the damages claimed were actually caused by a superseding cause such as RFC voluntarily agreeing to a short sale or a loan modification. Then, First Mortgage also argued that RFC's actions to elect to do non-judicial foreclosure for 45 loans was a further basis for dismissing all but 6 of the 169 loans. "Then, with respect to RESCAP's $1.4M claims for those last 6 loans, First Mortgage argued that RESCAP's claims were overstated by 90%, relying upon an August 2014 decision from the same courthouse about the same dispute against another RESCAP defendant which said, 'In May 2012, RFC declared bankruptcy in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The dozens of lawsuits against RFC involved a balance of more than $100 billion in original loan principal. And because RFC extended a promise to repurchase faulty loans and investments as part of its offerings, RFC had already spent millions of dollars repurchasing investments and loans. After RFC declared bankruptcy, investors and other interested parties filed hundreds of proofs of claim. Ultimately, the bankruptcy court approved a global settlement of over $10 billion to resolve the claims against RFC. The settlement assigned the rights and interests of RFC to the ResCap Liquidating Trust.' "The judge said First Mortgage may file its motions together with similar motions by the other RESCAP defendants, but must wait for expert discovery to be completed. That may be as early as Thanksgiving. First Mortgage is committed to continuing this fight." The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued Bulletin 2017-18: Violations of Laws and Regulations. The updated policy and procedures are effective on July 1, 2017 and apply to examinations of all national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies. With these changes, the OCC aims to increase the effectiveness of its process for handling violations of laws and regulations.

Paul Clifford from Simplifile: "In the absence of digital collaboration between lenders and settlement agents, issuing separate Closing Disclosures (CDs) for the buyer and seller will continue to cause headaches for lenders, as this approach increases the likelihood of compliance missteps. The settlement agent is often the entity driving the creation of the seller form (usually with the intent of protecting the seller's information). There needs to be a mechanism in place to ensure that information is being exchanged securely and in a timely manner to avoid disclosure delivery snafus and prolonged post-closing follow-ups that can lead to serious Know Before You Owe rule violations. Simplifile's Collaboration platform for lenders and settlement agents supports real-time communication and automated notifications to alert both parties of changes to either the buyer or seller CD, thus ensuring that both forms match and that revised disclosures are reissued to each party in a timely manner."

Since the concept of a shopping destination on state-owned marshland was first green-lit in 2003, the mall has encountered many problems. Two earlier developers gave up on the project, formerly known as "Xanadu." Now, Triple Five is looking to raise $2.8 billion to finance the final phases of construction. More than half of the funding will be arranged privately through  J.P. Morgan Chase. The remaining $1.1 billion is expected to  come from the sale of tax-free, unrated, government bonds. For that bond sale, two preliminary offering memoranda are now in circulation: one is for an $800 million bond package backed by payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT); the other is for a $300 million bond package backed by sales tax receipts generated after American Dream opens. The bonds are being sold by the Public Finance Authority of Wisconsin, which is serving as a middleman between the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority and investors. The documents — over 1,800 pages of them — disclose a wide array of risks that potential investors will have to consider. Transit is one. Roads and trains are both already heavily congested and could get worse: According to the PILOT bond memo, “The difficulty, expense, unfamiliarity and time-consuming nature of these transportation options, especially for persons carrying numerous purchases, may present a special risk." An even greater challenge may be the seeming end of America’s love affair with malls. A study by Credit Suisse recently suggested 20 to 25 percent of U.S. malls could close by 2022. “To the extent that these trends continue and have a material adverse effect on the American Dream Project, tenants and customers of the American Dream Project may find the American Dream Project less attractive, which may have a material adverse effect on the generation of sales taxes and on the operating income of the American Dream Project,” the offering memo states. If the mall fails to meet revenue projections, bond investors will have little recourse: their claims can be made only after the J.P. Morgan lenders have been compensated. Sixty-nine percent of American Dream's 2.9 million square feet of space has been leased to tenants like Saks, Lord & Taylor, and Primark. There will also be a Nickelodeon amusement park and a DreamWorks water park. Still, says Lisa Washburn, a credit research analyst for Municipal Market Analytics, the project should give any investor pause. “I still remain skeptical about the ability for success for the project generally and specifically very concerned about the risks to bondholders,” she said. Triple Five expects American Dream to open in early 2019. Also Seen In... Part of Mall Madness. Malls are in trouble. But New Jersey is helping a private developer finish the stalled American Dream mall, next to the NJ Turnpike. WNYC, NJ Spotlight and Bloomberg Businessweek examine what’s gone wrong -- and what could go right.

Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) starts today. Instead, Pacific Crest recommends investors buy Alphabet (GOOGL) shares instead.

Yahoo Finance June 5, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Welcome to Money Basics, Yahoo Finance’s new personal finance series offering quick explanations for some of the most important terms involving your money. When you hear that people like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon are “worth millions,” do you wonder how much you’re worth? It’s a pretty simple formula to find out. Your net worth is the value of everything you own minus everything you owe. A simple formula First, add up everything you owe. These are called liabilities. Liabilities include things like mortgages, car loans, credit cards, student loans, medical bills and back taxes. Next add up everything you own. These are called assets. Assets include things like your investments, life insurance, fine jewelry and the market value of a home or a car. So, now you’ve got two numbers. Subtract your liabilities from your assets, and that gives you your net worth. A positive number means you own more than you owe—and that’s a great thing! A negative number means you owe more than you own, but don’t panic. You’re not alone. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, one in seven households has either zero or negative net worth. Hey, nice net worth!More What it means It could mean you need to work on your budgeting or cut back on expenses. It could also mean you’re young and haven’t had much time since graduating college to really tackle your student loans. Either way, once you know your net worth, you can really focus on improving it. It’s good to calculate your net worth every once in a while. Every time you check your net worth your goal should be for it to be higher than it was the last time you checked. That’s an indicator of good financial health. Knowing your net worth is a good first step to taking control of your money. • What is a credit report anyway? • What is APR? • What’s the Dow Jones? • What’s the NASDAQ?   Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

Primarily, the action will be focused around Washington and other global capitals for a look ahead on how the economy is shaping up. Neither rain nor sleet nor a real bummer of a May jobs report could derail the market last week, so it will be interesting to see how investors react to this week's news. Christophe Morin | Bloomberg | Getty Images Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co. The business perspective Tuesday might turn out to be the most interesting day of the week. That's when the Business Roundtable will release its 2017 CEO Economic Outlook survey that will provide clues on what the titans of industry think about the road ahead. The survey will indicate what plans companies have for capital spending, their expectations for sales and whether they will be hiring. Last Friday's nonfarm payrolls report, which showed growth of just 138,000, cast doubt on how robust the employment climate will be. In addition to Tuesday's presentation, the roundtable on Wednesday will talk about the job "skills gap," or the difficulty employers are having finding workers qualified for open positions. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon leads the group and will be joined Wednesday by Ginni Romerty of IBM, Wes Bush of Northrop Grumman and Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta. On the legislative front Meanwhile, Congress and President Donald Trump will have a full slate of items to consider with far-reaching consequences. The highlight of the week is an expected vote on the Financial Choice Act, a measure that would roll back reforms to the banking industry made after the financial crisis and the Great Recession. Among other things, the bill would limit the government's ability to declare big institutions "too big to fail" and would cut annual stress tests to every two years. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also would face substantial changes, and likely would change restrictions banks face on trading for their own benefit. Bank stocks were the big winners after Trump's election, surging nearly 30 percent at one point. However, their fortunes have changed lately and they're down as a group nearly 9 percent over the last three months. Anadolu Agency | Getty Images Former FBI director, James Comey. The Russia probe Not that the markets seem to care, but there remains this small matter in Washington over allegations that Trump campaign principals had improper contact with Russia. This week could provide some real drama in that regard. The big day will be Thursday, when former FBI Director James Comey will testify. None of this Russia business has had a tangible effect on the markets so far. But if Comey comes into that room with some type of smoking gun regarding collusion, or efforts by Trump to get Comey to back off on the investigation while he ran the bureau, that might make investors finally care about instability in the White House. Busy week for the economy The beginning of the month means we start another round of economic data, and there's a ton of it ahead. A quick glance: Monday: Nonfarm productivity, unit labor costs, ISM non-manufacturing, factory orders and durable goods. Tuesday: Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, a preferred indicator for Fed policy makers. Wednesday: Consumer credit Thursday: Quarterly services survey, an under-the-radar indicator that can influence GDP outlook for economists. Friday: Wholesale inventories. In addition, the European Central Bank on Thursday will issue its latest statement on monetary policy. And UK elections will take place the same day; an upset of Prime Minister Theresa May most certainly would carry reverberations. A final word Though there was much chattering about Friday's jobs report, the stock market actually rose during the session, which seems counterintuitive for such an important indicator. Or maybe not. Voya Global Perspectives offers this take on why the market actually liked the anemic job growth: I refer to it as "Goldilocks" since it is not too hot and not too cold to force the Fed to change course at their June FOMC meeting where I expect a 25 basis point rate hike. The modest report likely gives the Fed room to pause through the next few meetings. Very market friendly indeed. Investing's a funny game. Here's to a big week ahead!

They are paying growing attention to climate risks. Risks aside, businesses are also reacting to evolving social attitudes and consumption patterns. Consumers are increasingly sustainability-conscious. Robin Hu President Donald Trump finally fulfilled his campaign bluster to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement.Predictably, the global condemnation was immediate, and resounding. In a stinging rebuke, French president Emmanuel Macron derided Mr Trump’s decision and mimicked the latter by calling for the world to “make our planet great again”.  His Elysée speech in English was unprecedented for a French president, underscoring his disapproval. European Union leaders rejected Mr Trump’s suggestion to renegotiate the Paris accord.  Premier Li Keqiang vowed that China would uphold its Paris pledge.  India, the third-largest polluter behind China and America, promised to stay the course; Prime Minister Narendra Modi described failure to act on climate change “morally criminal”.  Here at home, Singapore reaffirmed its commitment to the pact. But political leaders were not alone in their dismay.  Industry’s titans led corporates in expressing solidarity. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney boss Bob Iger quit their White House advisory roles.  Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein was stirred to use his inaugural tweet to express disappointment.  CEOs of top companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Salesforce, BlackRock, JPMorgan, Cargill, Dow Chemical and General Electric echoed criticisms.  Even oil majors Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and BP voiced support for the Paris deal, just before Mr Trump’s announcement. Climate change, sustainable development – sustainability – these are not mere corporate buzzwords.  That corporate giants were emphatic in disapproving Mr Trump’s decision stridently exhibits their conviction: sustainability is not only fundamental to Earth’s survival, but also essential for commercial success. Climate change, man-made and caused by growing greenhouse gas emissions, is real.  And its effects pose real threats to businesses.  Supply chains are disrupted when climate change-triggered freak weather events, like floods, hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts and blizzards, wreak devastating havoc on factories, infrastructure and crops. The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions attributes US$15 billion (S$21 billion) to US$20 billion of losses directly to a single event – Thailand’s 2011 flooding.  Honda reckons that it lost over US$250 million when floods destroyed its vehicle plants.  HP blames more than half of its 7 per cent revenue decline, in 2011’s fourth quarter, on a hard disk shortage caused by the floods. Insurer Lloyd’s forked out US$2.2 billion in claims, its third-biggest loss in its history In Paris, countries had pledged to cap global temperature rise to below 2 deg C above pre-industrial levels, while targeting a 1.5 deg C limit.  Putting this into context, NASA data indicates that 2016 was the warmest year ever, with temperatures more than 1 deg C above pre-industrial times.  Sixteen of the 17 hottest years were after 2000, since record-keeping started in the 19th century. We may not feel a ½ deg C increase, but it makes a monumental difference.  It will engender reduced crop yield, greater droughts and higher sea levels.  A recent scientific study, published in Earth System Dynamics, indicated that with a 2 versus a 1.5 deg C increase, crop yields will be twice reduced in tropics like Central America and West Africa. In America, as the Risky Business Project highlights, a warming climate means that the Midwest will probably face crop yield loss of up to 19 per cent by mid-century and 63 per cent by end-century.  This will distress agricultural supply chains, cause significant unemployment and harm food security.  The Midwest accounts for two-thirds of America’s corn and soybean production.  As of 2012, it comprises over 520,000 farms worth an annual US$135.6 billion. The impetus for companies to take action is clear.  They are paying growing attention to climate risks.  The Carbon Disclosure Project reported that its “supply chain” membership grew 20 per cent from 2015 to 2016.  It counts 89 members like L’Oréal, Nestlé, Unilever, Toyota and BMW, which harness their nearly US$3 trillion procurement budget to request emissions-related data from over 8,200 suppliers. Risks aside, businesses are reacting to evolving social attitudes and consumption patterns.  Consumers are increasingly sustainability-conscious.  A 2015 Nielsen survey found that for consumers willing to pay a premium, sustainability reasons registered 10 to 13 percentage points higher than all respondents’ averages.  Millennials constituted 72 per cent of those accepting of higher prices.  But lest we think it is only younger generations who care, 51 per cent of baby boomers were prepared to pay extra, seven percentage points higher from the previous year.  Unilever reported that in 2014, its sustainability brands grew twice as fast as others, contributing half of its entire portfolio’s growth.  While government can lead the sustainability charge with accords and legislation, industry must therefore play a driving role.  MSCI data shows that the world’s largest companies’ market capitalisation was a whopping US$35 trillion, twice America’s 2015 gross domestic product.  With their behemoth size, the related risks and opportunities, corporates cannot turn a blind eye to sustainability. Sustainability has also been core throughout Singapore’s history.  Our government launched the Garden City programme in 1967, just two years after independence.  Trees were planted, streets scrubbed, the Singapore River cleaned and anti-pollution laws enacted.  Today, we are indeed a city in a garden. But sustainability is more than a clean environment.  The Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB) makes this clear.  To achieve a sustainable nation, three mutually-reliant pillars must be reinforced: an active economy providing jobs; a beautiful society where inclusive communities have a high quality of living; and a cool and clean environment enabling a thriving country. Today, June 5, marks World Environment Day, an appropriate opportunity to reflect on this shared vision. Whether government, citizens or industry; we have a collective responsibility for achieving sustainability.  Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong summarised this in the SSB, “We will build a green economy, nudging our businesses into doing good while also doing well.  We also encourage civic participation for an active and gracious community… It is our duty and responsibility to build on their (our pioneers’) legacy, to make Singapore even greener and more liveable, and to work with others to build better cities and a healthier planet, for ourselves and future generations.” The writer is Head of the Sustainability and Stewardship Group at Temasek International.

Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... The standard progressive narrative tells us that corporate influence is why we can’t have nice things. But a “nearly united corporate front” of Big Business, according to the New York Times, sided with the left and tried to persuade President Trump to keep the U.S. in the Paris climate pact. The CEO of oil giant ExxonMobil wrote a personal appeal to Trump. Thirty other corporate chieftains, including those from Dow Chemical, JP Morgan Chase and General Electric, took out a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal, counseling Trump that  “Our business interests are best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced response to reducing global GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions.” A second full-page ad was spearheaded by major tech companies including Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft. After Trump’s announcement, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein (pictured) published his first tweet ever, condemning the move as “a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world.” Even major coal companies like Peabody and Cloud Peak urged Trump to stay in the agreement, fearing lost government support for expensive “carbon capture” technology and lost access to foreign markets.  Many of these outfits are bêtes noires to the left, understandably. They include fossil fuel producers that have harmed the environment, Wall Street institutions that have exacerbated economic inequality, and corporations that have practiced extreme tax avoidance. Yet when it came to an issue of critical importance to the fate of the planet, these corporations fought on the right side of history. Progressives should take note, as they need all the help they can get. After Trump’s colossal snub, the battle to the save the planet will likely play a bigger role in our upcoming elections than ever before. But that doesn’t guarantee an electoral boon for Democrats. Clear majorities of voters accept the scientific consensus warning us of an overheating world. Yet specific proposals for action inevitably attract fierce counterattacks, raising fears of lost jobs and higher energy costs. Climate warriors could use reinforcements, credible surrogates who can neutralize economic scare tactics. For example, Trump justified his pullout on economic grounds, claiming that by 2040, “the cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income, and in many cases, much worse than that.” He was citing a flimsy study commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce – a fierce opponent of Paris pact, proving how out of step it is with the businesses it purports to represent. The Washington Post’s fact-checking unit explained how the authors skewed their findings to please their client: “the study assumed a scenario that no policy analyst expects — that the United States takes drastic steps to meet the Obama pledge of a 26 to 28 percent reduction in emissions by 2025. Moreover, the study did not consider possible benefits from reducing climate change.” But all holding up a copy of the Washington Post gets you these days is a knee-jerk cry of “fake news.” Far more useful to the climate cause would be legions of CEOs loudly declaring – in TV ads, YouTube videos, protest marches and candidate endorsements – that their bottom lines will be far better off with American leadership on the climate than with American retreat. Most corporations are more amoral than immoral. They may not love government regulation, but they crave regulatory certainty. They can’t survive without long-term planning and investment. In turn, they are not served by climate science denial and delusional talking points. They need a clear-eyed view of what the future holds, and a regulatory regime that allows them to still earn a profit. That doesn’t make them natural progressive allies. But it does make them reality-based. And the broadest possible anti-Trump coalition can be built on a commitment to reality-based governing. Nurturing such close cooperation between progressive activists and corporate titans is not so simple. Their political agendas diverge in a host of other areas including taxes, regulation, labor rights and even the particulars of climate protections. If progressives are too dependent on corporations, then corporations could dictate the Democratic Party agenda and thwart the ambitions of the party’s populist wing. However, those committed to a single-payer health-care system, a $15 minimum wage, a cap on bank size and stiff taxes on the top 1 percent need not shelve their agenda to form a climate coalition with Corporate America. Partners on one issue often joust over another. But populist progressives would have to shelve some of their most pointed anti-corporate rhetoric. If the word “corporate” is constantly used as a toxic epithet, then a corporate endorsement has diminished value. Right-wing populists can more easily characterize the business support as proof of insidious globalism designed to crush small business, family farms and individual consumers. Instead of painting with broad brushes, progressives should be more surgical when targeting bad corporate behavior, so productive alliances with corporations can be forged when opportunity knocks. Progressives have become accustomed to viewing corporations as multi-tentacled monsters, swamping Washington with dark money and suffocating hope for policies that would serve the public good. But the corporate response to Paris should prompt a reassessment. Sometimes the progressive and corporate agendas overlap. When they do, take advantage.

That is one of the lessons to be learned from the whirlwind of allegations, legal actions and official investigations into the 2008 deal that “saved” British bank Barclays from looming catastrophe at the height of the global financial crisis. In September of that year, Lehman Brothers, the blue-blood Wall Street bank, had gone bust; Bear Stearns, another venerable New York institution, had been taken over in a fire sale by JP Morgan Chase. Banks around the world were looking anxiously at their balance sheets, and their shareholders’ pockets, for reassurance that they were not the next domino to fall. In the UK, there were already grim noises about Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and Halifax / Bank of Scotland. All were deemed to be vulnerable to the dramatic falls in asset values prompted by the collapse of US sub-prime real estate. In fact, those three were just days away from being effectively taken over by the British government in a £500 billion bailout that saved their historic names but at the price of their independence. They, and the British taxpayer are still feeling the financial repercussions today. Of the two other big names of British banking — HSBC and Barclays — the former was deemed to be relatively insulated against the worst effects of the American collapse. With its big Asian balance sheet and comparatively small US exposure, HSBC could stand on its own. The same was not true of Barclays. It was already under such pressure that a few months earlier it had agreed a capital injection underwritten by Qatar Holding, a subsidiary of the Arabian Gulf state’s sovereign wealth fund, its then Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al-Thani, and Temasek, the Singapore wealth fund, in exchange for £4.5 billion of ordinary shares in Barclays. But in the financial hurricane, that was not enough, and a short time later Barclays again went to the Gulf for help: To Qatar, again, and also this time to Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital, for a total of £7.3 billion of debt and quasi-equity instruments. It is this second round of financial help that has led to Barclays’ current predicament. The UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO), its most aggressive financial investigator, is examining allegations that this deal was accompanied by inducements and loans totaling £2.4 billion to Qatar to compensate the country for the losses it had sustained on the first capital injection. That would be contrary to British law and could result in charges of criminal corporate activity against the bank and senior executives involved in the deals. The bank and executives have denied wrongdoing but the SFO has delayed a decision on whether to proceed with criminal charges until the middle of next month. Simultaneously, Barclays is being sued by PCP Partners, a private equity company involved in the fundraising and run by Amanda Staveley, a well-known financier in Gulf circles. She is claiming that there was deceit in the dealings between Barclays and the Gulf investors and wants £721 million plus interest she says she is owed by the bank. Barclays is believed to be contesting the case. The legal firestorm has come at a sensitive time for UK-Qatar relations. In the post-Brexit uncertainty, Britain does not want to alienate any big investor, but especially Qatar, which has sunk £35 billion into UK assets, including trophies like London’s Shard skyscraper, the iconic department store Harrods and landmark hotels like Claridge’s. Barclays got what it wanted in 2008, but the bank, and the UK might not like the eventual price.     Daily Times Company Financials Investor Information Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Copyright © 2017 Daily Times

The companies experienced a drop of 5,436 approved petitions (37 per cent) in 2016 as compared to previous year, a report by the National Foundation for American Policy - a Washington-based non-profit thin-tank said. It said the 9,356 new H-1B petitions for the top seven Indian-based companies approved in fiscal 2016 represent only 0.006 per cent of the US labour force. "While the threat of job loss has long been exaggerated by critics, it reaches illogical proportions when discussing fewer than 10,000 workers in an economy that employs 160 million workers nationwide," the National Foundation for American Policy said in a statement after releasing the report. TCS According to the report, the number of approved new H-1B petitions for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) declined by 56 percent from FY 2015 to FY 2016, from 4,674 to 2,040, a drop of 2,634. Wipro For Wipro, the petitions declined by 52 per cent between FY 2015 and FY 2016, a drop of 1,605, going from 3,079 to 1,474 approved petitions for initial employment during those years. Infosys For Infosys, it declined by 16 per cent (or 454 petitions), with 2,376 approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in FY 2016, compared to 2,830 in FY 2015, said the report, which based its research on government data. "The drop in new H-1B visas for Indian-based companies, which is expected to continue when data are released on cases filed in April 2017 for FY 2018 start dates, is due to industry trends toward digital services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, which require fewer workers, and a choice by companies to rely less on visas and to build up their domestic workforces in the US," the report said.   Trump impact "H-1B petitions approved for initial employment in FY 2016 were filed by employers in April 2016, which means the drop in H-B visa use by these companies is not due to Donald Trump's election. "In the past, US policymakers have used the number of visas going to Indian-based companies as a political or policy reason to propose new immigration restrictions and to not raise the low annual supply of H-1B visas, which has been exhausted every year for the past 15 fiscal years," said NFAP executive director Stuart Anderson, former head of policy at the Immigration and Naturalisation Service under President George W Bush. Top companies Among the top companies with new H-1B petitions approved in 2016 were Cognizant (3,949), Infosys (2,376), TCS (2,040), Accenture (1,889), IBM (1,608), Wipro (1,474), Amazon (1,416), Tech Mahindra (1,228), CapGemini (1,164), Microsoft (1,145), HCL America (1,041), Intel (1,030), Deloitte (985), Google (924), Larsen &Toubro (870), PricewaterhouseCoopers (713), Ernst & Young (649), Apple (631), Syntel (583), Facebook (472), Oracle (427), Cisco (380), Mindtree (327), Goldman Sachs (287), UST Global (283), JPMorganChase (271), IGATE (255), Stanford (221), Yahoo! (206) and KPMG (198). An analysis of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data on FY 2016 H-1B petitions shows, similar to FY 2015, approximately 25,000 different US employers hired at least one high-skilled foreign national on a new H-1B petition in 2016. Manufacturing companies Employers in manufacturing include Tesla Motors with 108 approved new H-1B petitions and Cummins with 197. Uber had 121 approved H-1B petitions in FY 2016, eBay 115, and the Mayo Clinic 111. Unemployment rate in US National Foundation for American Policy said the April 2017 unemployment rate in the US for "computer and mathematical science" occupations was 2.5 per cent - a very low rate, even lower than the 4.4 per cent for "all occupations," according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The unemployment rate for "architecture and engineering" occupations is even lower at 2.1 per cent, it said, adding this illustrates a disconnect between reality and claims that high-skilled foreign nationals are preventing US workers from pursuing careers in tech fields. Jobs in IT According to Code.org, Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicates there will be "1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants who can fill them by 2020...and there are more than 500,000 open computing jobs nationwide." An analysis by Glassdoor shows 9 of the 10 highest paying majors for US students 5 years out of college are in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields, the report said. The report disputed the figures of the Trump Administration that about 80 per cent of the H-1B workers are paid less than the median wage in their fields. "This statistic is misleading as it relies on a Department of Labor database that includes multiple applications for the same individuals since a new filing is generally required when an H-1B professional moves to a new area," the report said. "That means it "double or triple counts anyone who works in more than one geographic location (primarily younger workers sent to multiple offices)." Moreover, it may not reflect what employers actually pay individual workers, only the minimum required to be listed for government filing purposes. Salary The median salary in 2015 for H-1B computer-related recipients who have worked about three years (listed as "continuing employment" in DHS data) was about USD7,000 higher than the median salary in the industry," the report said.The foundation argued that H-1B temporary visas are important as they are typically the only practical way a high-skilled foreign national working abroad or an international student educated in the United States can work longterm in America. At US universities, 77 per cent of the full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and 71 per cent in computer science are international students. H-1B Visa Reforms to increase the labor mobility of H-1B visas, raise the employment-based green card quota and eliminate the per country limit would be welcome but are not currently on the agenda. New restrictions on high-skilled immigration are more likely, it said. "In today's global economy, companies and high-skilled professionals possess many options," said Anderson.

The companies experienced a drop of 5,436 approved petitions (37 per cent) in 2016 as compared to the previous year, a report by the National Foundation for American Policy — a Washington-based non-profit think-tank said. It said, the 9,356 new H-1B petitions for the top seven Indian-based companies approved in fiscal 2016 represent only 0.006 per cent of the US labour force. “While the threat of job loss has long been exaggerated by critics, it reaches illogical proportions when discussing fewer than 10,000 workers in an economy that employs 160 million workers nationwide,” the National Foundation for American Policy said in a statement after releasing the report. According to the report, the number of approved new H-1B petitions for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) declined by 56 per cent from FY 2015 to FY 2016, from 4,674 to 2,040, a drop of 2,634. For Wipro, the petitions declined by 52 per cent between FY 2015 and FY 2016, a drop of 1,605, going from 3,079 to 1,474 approved petitions for initial employment during those years. For Infosys, it declined by 16 per cent (or 454 petitions), with 2,376 approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in FY 2016, compared to 2,830 in FY 2015, said the report, which based its research from government data. “The drop in new H-1B visas for Indian-based companies, which is expected to continue when data are released on cases filed in April 2017 for FY 2018 start dates, is due to industry trends toward digital services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, which require fewer workers, and a choice by companies to rely less on visas and to build up their domestic workforces in the US,” the report said. “H-1B petitions approved for initial employment in FY 2016 were filed by employers in April 2016, which means the drop in H-B visa use by these companies is not due to Donald Trump’s election. “In the past, US policymakers have used the number of visas going to Indian-based companies as a political or policy reason to propose new immigration restrictions and to not raise the low annual supply of H-1B visas, which has been exhausted every year for the past 15 fiscal years,” said NFAP executive director Stuart Anderson, former head of policy at the Immigration and Naturalisation Service under President George W Bush. Among the top companies with new H-1B petitions approved in 2016 were Cognizant (3,949), Infosys (2,376), TCS (2,040), Accenture (1,889), IBM (1,608), Wipro (1,474), Amazon (1,416), Tech Mahindra (1,228), CapGemini (1,164), Microsoft (1,145), HCL America (1,041), Intel (1,030), Deloitte (985), Google (924), Larsen &Toubro (870), PricewaterhouseCoopers (713), Ernst & Young (649), Apple (631), Syntel (583), Facebook (472), Oracle (427), Cisco (380), Mindtree (327), Goldman Sachs (287), UST Global (283), JPMorganChase (271), IGATE (255), Stanford (221), Yahoo! (206) and KPMG (198). An analysis of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data on FY 2016 H-1B petitions shows, similar to FY 2015, approximately 25,000 different US employers hired at least one high-skilled foreign national on a new H-1B petition in 2016. Employers in manufacturing include Tesla Motors with 108 approved new H-1B petitions and Cummins with 197. Uber had 121 approved H-1B petitions in FY 2016, eBay 115, and the Mayo Clinic 111. The National Foundation for American Policy said the April 2017 unemployment rate in the US for “computer and mathematical science” occupations was 2.5 per cent — a very low rate, even lower than the 4.4 per cent for “all occupations,” according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The unemployment rate for “architecture and engineering” occupations is even lower at 2.1 per cent, it said, adding this illustrates a disconnect between reality and claims that high-skilled foreign nationals are preventing US workers from pursuing careers in tech fields. According to Code.org, Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate there will be “1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants who can fill them by 2020...and there are more than 500,000 open computing jobs nationwide.” An analysis by Glassdoor shows 9 of the 10 highest paying majors for US students 5 years out of college are in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, the report said. The report disputed the figures of the Trump Administration that about 80 per cent of the H-1B workers are paid less than the median wage in their fields. “This statistic is misleading as it relies on a Department of Labor database that includes multiple applications for the same individuals, since a new filing is generally required when an H-1B professional moves to a new area,” the report said. “That means it “double or triple counts anyone who works in more than one geographic location (primarily younger workers sent to multiple offices).” Moreover, it may not reflect what employers actually pay individual workers, only the minimum required to be listed for government filing purposes. The median salary in 2015 for H-1B computer-related recipients who have worked about three years (listed as “continuing employment” in DHS data) was about $7,000 higher than the median salary in the industry,” the report said. The foundation argued that H-1B temporary visas are important as they are typically the only practical way a high-skilled foreign national working abroad or an international student educated in the US can work longterm in America. At US universities, 77 per cent of the full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and 71 per cent in computer science are international students. Reforms to increase the labour mobility of H-1B visas, raise the employment-based green card quota and eliminate the per country limit would be welcome but are not currently on the agenda. New restrictions on highskilled immigration are more likely, it said. “In today’s global economy, companies and high-skilled professionals possess many options,” said Anderson. “The US should maintain an openness toward high-skilled immigration or those options likely will not be in America,” he added.

By Jesse Hamilton / Bloomberg News WASHINGTON — Joseph Otting, a former lieutenant of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s at OneWest Bank, has been tapped to lead a U.S. regulator that oversees more than 1,000 lenders — including Wall Street giants. President Donald Trump plans to nominate Otting to run the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the White House said in a statement Monday evening. If confirmed by the Senate, he will play a central role in trying to ease financial rules that the administration blames for stunting economic growth. The appointment would mark a reversal in roles for Otting, as the OCC regulated OneWest when he was the bank’s chief executive officer. The selection continues Trump’s predilection for filling government jobs with former finance executives, even though he routinely criticized the industry on the campaign trail. Otting’s confirmation would give Mnuchin a key ally in changing the regulatory tone in Washington by dialing back aggressive scrutiny of banks. OneWest, based in Pasadena, Calif., was the reincarnation of failed mortgage lender IndyMac Bancorp. Mnuchin and a group of investors that included hedge fund titans George Soros and John Paulson bought the company in 2009 through a government auction. OneWest named Otting CEO in October 2010, with then-chairman Mnuchin praising his knowledge of the Southern California market. After CIT Group Inc. acquired OneWest in 2014, Otting served as co-president for a few months before being replaced. Otting will probably face a similar hammering from Senate Democrats over OneWest’s business practices to what Mnuchin endured during his conformation process. The bank, created after IndyMac’s collapse during the 2008 financial crisis, seized properties from tens of thousands of homeowners, foreclosures that some Democrats have called unfair and improper. As CEO, Otting arguably had more involvement in the company’s day-to-day operations than Mnuchin did as chairman. In 2011, OneWest was involved in an enforcement action in which the government ordered mortgage services to review whether their foreclosure practices were appropriate. It took four years — most of Otting’s tenure — for the company to satisfy the concerns of the OCC and other banking regulators. If he takes over the OCC, Otting will run an independent agency within the Treasury Department that supervises the banking units of major financial firms, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. Otting would be the first comptroller in decades without an advanced degree, with the agency’s most recent heads all holding law degrees. His biographical information often lists him as a graduate of the “School of Credit and Financial Management at Dartmouth College,” which is a continuing-education program for financial executives that operated on the campus of the New Hampshire university, but isn’t actually affiliated with the Ivy League school. Records from the school, which is currently run for two weeks each year by the National Association of Credit Management, confirm he graduated in 1992 when he was a mid-level manager at Union Bank in Beverly Hills, Calif.   Most Read Appointed county councilman’s youth, connections criticized MARYSVILLE — Nate Nehring’s youth and political ties were objects of curiosity… Jun 7th, 2017 by Noah Haglund Vote here for the high school athletes of the year Here are the seniors nominated for Boys Athlete of the Year and… Jun 8th, 2017 by Herald Staff Ribbon-cutting ceremony set for WSU building in north Everett EVERETT — An open house is planned for Aug. 15 for the… Jun 7th, 2017 by Jim Davis Woman uses app to track man suspected of stealing from her LAKE STEVENS — A 26-year-old woman discovered her Jeep had been broken… Jun 7th, 2017 by Caitlin Tompkins DUI suspected in Lake Stevens head-on collision; 2 injured LAKE STEVENS — Deputies with the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office investigated an… Jun 7th, 2017 by Herald Staff © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

WASHINGTON: Top seven India-based outsourcing companies in the US received fewer H-1B visas in 2016 as compared to 2015, and as a group their numbers dropped 37 per cent, according to a new report. The companies experienced a drop of 5,436 approved petitions (37 per cent) in 2016 as compared to previous year, a report by the National Foundation for American Policy - a Washington-based non-profit think-tank said.

"The United States should maintain an openness toward high-skilled immigration or those options likely will not be in America," he added.

File photo Top seven India-based outsourcing companies in the US received fewer H-1B visas in 2016 as compared to 2015, and as a group their numbers dropped 37 per cent, according to a new report. The companies experienced a drop of 5,436 approved petitions (37 per cent) in 2016 as compared to previous year, a report by the National Foundation for American Policy – a Washington-based non-profit think-tank said. It said, the 9,356 new H-1B petitions for the top seven Indian-based companies approved in fiscal 2016 represent only 0.006 per cent of the US labour force. "While the threat of job loss has long been exaggerated by critics, it reaches illogical proportions when discussing fewer than 10,000 workers in an economy that employs 160 million workers nationwide," the National Foundation for American Policy said in a statement after releasing the report. According to the report, the number of approved new H-1B petitions for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) declined by 56 per cent from FY 2015 to FY 2016, from 4,674 to 2,040, a drop of 2,634. For Wipro, the petitions declined by 52 per cent between FY 2015 and FY 2016, a drop of 1,605, going from 3,079 to 1,474 approved petitions for initial employment during those years. For Infosys, it declined by 16 per cent (or 454 petitions), with 2,376 approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in FY 2016, compared to 2,830 in FY 2015, said the report, which based its research from government data. "The drop in new H-1B visas for Indian-based companies, which is expected to continue when data are released on cases filed in April 2017 for FY 2018 start dates, is due to industry trends toward digital services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, which require fewer workers, and a choice by companies to rely less on visas and to build up their domestic workforces in the US," the report said. "H-1B petitions approved for initial employment in FY 2016 were filed by employers in April 2016, which means the drop in H-B visa use by these companies is not due to Donald Trump's election. "In the past, US policymakers have used the number of visas going to Indian-based companies as a political or policy reason to propose new immigration restrictions and to not raise the low annual supply of H-1B visas, which has been exhausted every year for the past 15 fiscal years," said NFAP executive director Stuart Anderson, former head of policy at the Immigration and Naturalisation Service under President George W Bush. Among the top companies with new H-1B petitions approved in 2016 were Cognizant (3,949), Infosys (2,376), TCS (2,040), Accenture (1,889), IBM (1,608), Wipro (1,474), Amazon (1,416), Tech Mahindra (1,228), CapGemini (1,164), Microsoft (1,145), HCL America (1,041), Intel (1,030), Deloitte (985), Google (924), Larsen &Toubro (870), PricewaterhouseCoopers (713), Ernst & Young (649), Apple (631), Syntel (583), Facebook (472), Oracle (427), Cisco (380), Mindtree (327), Goldman Sachs (287), UST Global (283), JPMorganChase (271), IGATE (255), Stanford (221), Yahoo! (206) and KPMG (198). An analysis of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data on FY 2016 H-1B petitions shows, similar to FY 2015, approximately 25,000 different US employers hired at least one high-skilled foreign national on a new H-1B petition in 2016. Employers in manufacturing include Tesla Motors with 108 approved new H-1B petitions and Cummins with 197. Uber had 121 approved H-1B petitions in FY 2016, eBay 115, and the Mayo Clinic 111. National Foundation for American Policy said the April 2017 unemployment rate in the US for "computer and mathematical science" occupations was 2.5 per cent – a very low rate, even lower than the 4.4 per cent for "all occupations," according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The unemployment rate for "architecture and engineering" occupations is even lower at 2.1 per cent, it said, adding this illustrates a disconnect between reality and claims that high-skilled foreign nationals are preventing US workers from pursuing careers in tech fields. According to Code.org, Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate there will be "1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants who can fill them by 2020…and there are more than 500,000 open computing jobs nationwide." An analysis by Glassdoor shows 9 of the 10 highest paying majors for US students 5 years out of college are in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, the report said. The report disputed the figures of the Trump Administration that about 80 per cent of the H-1B workers are paid less than the median wage in their fields. "This statistic is misleading as it relies on a Department of Labor database that includes multiple applications for the same individuals, since a new filing is generally required when an H-1B professional moves to a new area," the report said. "That means it "double or triple counts anyone who works in more than one geographic location (primarily younger workers sent to multiple offices)." Moreover, it may not reflect what employers actually pay individual workers, only the minimum required to be listed for government filing purposes. The median salary in 2015 for H-1B computer-related recipients who have worked about three years (listed as "continuing employment" in DHS data) was about USD7,000 higher than the median salary in the industry," the report said. The foundation argued that H-1B temporary visas are important as they are typically the only practical way a high-skilled foreign national working abroad or an international student educated in the United States can work longterm in America. At US universities, 77 per cent of the full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and 71 per cent in computer science are international students. Reforms to increase the labor mobility of H-1B visas, raise the employment-based green card quota and eliminate the per country limit would be welcome but are not currently on the agenda. New restrictions on highskilled immigration are more likely, it said. "In today's global economy, companies and high-skilled professionals possess many options," said Anderson. "The United States should maintain an openness toward high-skilled immigration or those options likely will not be in America," he added.

It said, the 9,356 new H1B petitions for the top seven Indian-based companies approved in fiscal 2016 represent only 0.006% of the US labour force. “While the threat of job loss has long been exaggerated by critics, it reaches illogical proportions when discussing fewer than 10,000 workers in an economy that employs 160 million workers nationwide,” the National Foundation for American Policy said in a statement after releasing the report. According to the report, the number of approved new H1B petitions for Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) declined by 56% from FY15 to FY16, from 4,674 to 2,040, a drop of 2,634. For Wipro, the petitions declined by 52% between FY15 and FY16, a drop of 1,605, going from 3,079 to 1,474 approved petitions for initial employment during those years. For Infosys, it declined by 16% (or 454 petitions), with 2,376 approved H1B petitions for initial employment in FY16, compared to 2,830 in FY15, said the report, which based its research from government data. Also read: PM Modi to raise H1B visa issue with Donald Trump during US visit, says Sushma Swaraj “The drop in new H-1B visas for Indian-based companies, which is expected to continue when data are released on cases filed in April 2017 for FY 2018 start dates, is due to industry trends toward digital services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, which require fewer workers, and a choice by companies to rely less on visas and to build up their domestic workforces in the US,” the report said. “H-1B petitions approved for initial employment in FY 2016 were filed by employers in April 2016, which means the drop in H-B visa use by these companies is not due to Donald Trump’s election. “In the past, US policymakers have used the number of visas going to Indian-based companies as a political or policy reason to propose new immigration restrictions and to not raise the low annual supply of H-1B visas, which has been exhausted every year for the past 15 fiscal years,” said NFAP executive director Stuart Anderson, former head of policy at the Immigration and Naturalisation Service under president George W Bush. Among the top companies with new H1B petitions approved in 2016 were Cognizant (3,949), Infosys (2,376), TCS (2,040), Accenture (1,889), IBM (1,608), Wipro (1,474), Amazon (1,416), Tech Mahindra (1,228), CapGemini (1,164), Microsoft (1,145), HCL America (1,041), Intel (1,030), Deloitte (985), Google (924), Larsen & Toubro (870), PricewaterhouseCoopers (713), Ernst & Young (649), Apple (631), Syntel (583), Facebook (472), Oracle (427), Cisco (380), Mindtree (327), Goldman Sachs (287), UST Global (283), JPMorganChase (271), IGATE (255), Stanford (221), Yahoo! (206) and KPMG (198). An analysis of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data on FY16 H1B petitions shows, similar to FY15, approximately 25,000 different US employers hired at least one high-skilled foreign national on a new H1B petition in 2016. Employers in manufacturing include Tesla Motors with 108 approved new H1B petitions and Cummins with 197. Uber had 121 approved H1B petitions in FY16, eBay 115, and the Mayo Clinic 111. National Foundation for American Policy said the April 2017 unemployment rate in the US for “computer and mathematical science” occupations was 2.5%—a very low rate, even lower than the 4.4% for “all occupations,” according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The unemployment rate for “architecture and engineering” occupations is even lower at 2.1%, it said, adding this illustrates a disconnect between reality and claims that high-skilled foreign nationals are preventing US workers from pursuing careers in tech fields. According to Code.org, Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate there will be “1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants who can fill them by 2020…and there are more than 500,000 open computing jobs nationwide.” An analysis by Glassdoor shows 9 of the 10 highest paying majors for US students 5 years out of college are in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, the report said. The report disputed the figures of the Trump Administration that about 80% of the H1B workers are paid less than the median wage in their fields. “This statistic is misleading as it relies on a Department of Labor database that includes multiple applications for the same individuals, since a new filing is generally required when an H-1B professional moves to a new area,” the report said. “That means it “double or triple counts anyone who works in more than one geographic location (primarily younger workers sent to multiple offices).” Moreover, it may not reflect what employers actually pay individual workers, only the minimum required to be listed for government filing purposes. The median salary in 2015 for H1B computer-related recipients who have worked about three years (listed as “continuing employment” in DHS data) was about USD7,000 higher than the median salary in the industry,” the report said. The foundation argued that H1B temporary visas are important as they are typically the only practical way a high-skilled foreign national working abroad or an international student educated in the United States can work longterm in America. At US universities, 77% of the full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and 71% in computer science are international students. Reforms to increase the labour mobility of H1B visas, raise the employment-based green card quota and eliminate the per country limit would be welcome but are not currently on the agenda. New restrictions on high-skilled immigration are more likely, it said. “In today’s global economy, companies and high-skilled professionals possess many options,” said Anderson. “The United States should maintain an openness toward high-skilled immigration or those options likely will not be in America,” he added.

By RyanTracy WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump will nominate Joseph Otting to a post overseeing federally chartered banks, a move that would place a former banker in a key role as the Trump team reviews financial regulatory policies. The White House announced late Monday it intends to nominate Otting to be comptroller of the currency. The Senate will have to confirm him, a process that could take months. He had previously been reported as a candidate for the job and would replace Keith Noreika, the acting comptroller. The Trump administration installed Noreika about a month ago to replace former President Barack Obama’s comptroller. Not much is known about Otting’s regulatory views. But he is expected to adopt a similar tone to other Trump administration officials, who have called for a review of banking rules they say went too far under Obama and are curbing legitimate lending. The comptroller oversees most of the largest federally chartered U.S. banks, including Citigroup Inc. C, +1.45%   , Bank of America Corp. BAC, +1.53%   and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +1.28%  . The position marshals a force of hundreds of examiners stationed inside big banks, giving the comptroller significant sway over the regulatory tone that supervisors take with financial firms.

"While the threat of job loss has long been exaggerated by critics, it reaches illogical proportions when discussing fewer than 10,000 workers in an economy that employs 160 million workers nationwide," the National Foundation for American Policy said in a statement after releasing the report. According to the report, the number of approved new H-1B petitions for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) declined by 56 percent from FY 2015 to FY 2016, from 4,674 to 2,040, a drop of 2,634. For Wipro, the petitions declined by 52 per cent between FY 2015 and FY 2016, a drop of 1,605, going from 3,079 to 1,474 approved petitions for initial employment during those years. For Infosys, it declined by 16 per cent (or 454 petitions), with 2,376 approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in FY 2016, compared to 2,830 in FY 2015, said the report, which based its research from government data. "The drop in new H-1B visas for Indian-based companies, which is expected to continue when data are released on cases filed in April 2017 for FY 2018 start dates, is due to industry trends toward digital services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, which require fewer workers, and a choice by companies to rely less on visas and to build up their domestic workforces in the US," the report said. "H-1B petitions approved for initial employment in FY 2016 were filed by employers in April 2016, which means the drop in H-B visa use by these companies is not due to Donald Trump's election. "In the past, US policymakers have used the number of visas going to Indian-based companies as a political or policy reason to propose new immigration restrictions and to not raise the low annual supply of H-1B visas, which has been exhausted every year for the past 15 fiscal years," said NFAP executive director Stuart Anderson, former head of policy at the Immigration and Naturalisation Service under President George W Bush. Among the top companies with new H-1B petitions approved in 2016 were Cognizant (3,949), Infosys (2,376), TCS (2,040), Accenture (1,889), IBM (1,608), Wipro (1,474), Amazon (1,416), Tech Mahindra (1,228), CapGemini (1,164), Microsoft (1,145), HCL America (1,041), Intel (1,030), Deloitte (985), Google (924), Larsen &Toubro (870), PricewaterhouseCoopers (713), Ernst & Young (649), Apple (631), Syntel (583), Facebook (472), Oracle (427), Cisco (380), Mindtree (327), Goldman Sachs (287), UST Global (283), JPMorganChase (271), IGATE (255), Stanford (221), Yahoo! (206) and KPMG (198). An analysis of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data on FY 2016 H-1B petitions shows, similar to FY 2015, approximately 25,000 different US employers hired at least one high-skilled foreign national on a new H-1B petition in 2016. Employers in manufacturing include Tesla Motors with 108 approved new H-1B petitions and Cummins with 197. Uber had 121 approved H-1B petitions in FY 2016, eBay 115, and the Mayo Clinic 111. National Foundation for American Policy said the April 2017 unemployment rate in the US for "computer and mathematical science" occupations was 2.5 per cent a very low rate, even lower than the 4.4 per cent for "all occupations," according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The unemployment rate for "architecture and engineering" occupations is even lower at 2.1 per cent, it said, adding this illustrates a disconnect between reality and claims that high-skilled foreign nationals are preventing US workers from pursuing careers in tech fields. According to Code.org, Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate there will be "1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants who can fill them by 2020 and there are more than 500,000 open computing jobs nationwide." An analysis by Glassdoor shows 9 of the 10 highest paying majors for US students 5 years out of college are in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, the report said. The report disputed the figures of the Trump Administration that about 80 per cent of the H-1B workers are paid less than the median wage in their fields. "This statistic is misleading as it relies on a Department of Labor database that includes multiple applications for the same individuals, since a new filing is generally required when an H-1B professional moves to a new area," the report said. "That means it "double or triple counts anyone who works in more than one geographic location (primarily younger workers sent to multiple offices)." Moreover, it may not reflect what employers actually pay individual workers, only the minimum required to be listed for government filing purposes. The median salary in 2015 for H-1B computer-related recipients who have worked about three years (listed as "continuing employment" in DHS data) was about USD7,000 higher than the median salary in the industry," the report said. The foundation argued that H-1B temporary visas are important as they are typically the only practical way a high-skilled foreign national working abroad or an international student educated in the United States can work longterm in America. At US universities, 77 per cent of the full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and 71 per cent in computer science are international students. Reforms to increase the labor mobility of H-1B visas, raise the employment-based green card quota and eliminate the per country limit would be welcome but are not currently on the agenda. New restrictions on highskilled immigration are more likely, it said. "In today's global economy, companies and high-skilled professionals possess many options," said Anderson. "The United States should maintain an openness toward high-skilled immigration or those options likely will not be in America," he added.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.1pc at the close, halting a two-session gain. Markets are closed for a public holiday in a number of European countries including Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Greece and Ireland. The Stoxx oil & gas sector fell 0.6pc after dropping 1.3pc on Friday, its biggest decline since April. The sector is down 6.6pc this year, the worst performance among industry groups in Europe. Investors should be cautious about equity markets following recent sharp gains and as red flags start to appear, JPMorgan equity strategists including Mislav Matejka and Emmanuel Cau wrote in a note, citing mixed US macro indicators among other effects. Wall Street was slightly lower in late morning trading on Monday as Apple dragged down all the three major indexes following a rating cut and ahead of its developer conference. The iPhone maker's stock was down 0.80pc at $154.28 after brokerage Pacific Crest downgraded it to "sector weight" from "overweight". Investors appeared to have shrugged off weekend attacks in London that came just days before Britain's general election on Thursday. Opinion polls in the past week have put Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives ahead, though with a narrowing lead over the Labour opposition. US stocks continue to hover at record levels, helped by a strong first-quarter corporate earnings season.

Those brave enough to invest in the Wild West of tech are the ones making a killing. While the record-breaking rally in bitcoin has captivated markets, demand for other digital coins is surging as companies raise millions in minutes, or even seconds, from investors wanting in on the next big tech startup. Last week it took 30 seconds for Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich to issue about $35 million of basic attention token, the unit of exchange in a blockchain-based advertising platform built on top of the company’s Brave browser. Digital tokens tied to the blockchain platform issued this year have more than doubled in price on average since trading started, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tech startups are increasingly selling coins that can be used on their projects instead of resorting to traditional financing methods such as venture capital. The sector isn’t for the fainthearted. The apps and websites behind most of these tokens are still only in development stage. Most are sold for pennies on the dollar and volatility can be extreme. TaaS, a closed-end fund dedicated to blockchain markets, had the coins it sold this year double in price in five weeks, and then fall 35 percent in two days. But if you can stomach the risk, the rewards have been substantial. Coins from the 15 ICOs this year for which data is available have risen by an average of over 100 percent, while shares sold in initial public offerings in the U.S. this year have gained 13 percent on average since they started trading. “There’s been overwhelming demand for coins,” said Ron Quaranta, chairman of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance. “Sure, a lot of it is based on speculation and traders looking to make a quick gain, but there’s also a fundamental driver, which is the anticipation that the digital-currency market is maturing.” Forty-four coins have been issued this year, according to blockchain research website Smith & Crown. Not all trade immediately after the auctions since some have vesting periods. The tokens with the biggest gain, a 500 percent jump since it started trading on March 30, was issued by Edgeless, which is building a decentralized gambling platform. That sale wasn’t open to U.S.-based investors since the company isn’t licensed to operate in the U.S. Prediction market platform Gnosis sold the highest valued tokens this year. The GNO token started trading at $52 on May 1 and has more than quadrupled. Even with growing acceptance of blockchain from companies ranging from Toyota Motor Corp. to JPMorgan Chase & Co., some advocates of the technology say they’re cautious of the digital tokens because of the exuberance sweeping through the cryptocurrency world. “It seems like a fad, and as a professional investor, it’s not what we do,” said David Dunn, president of Kingsbridge Wealth Management, who first bought bitcoin in 2014 and has invested in blockchain-related companies. “I’d rather invest in the companies using the technology themselves. The speculators might end up being right, and this becomes a solid investment because of the power of the technology, but we’re not at that stage.” Token sales like the one for Gnosis, which catapulted the company’s market capitalization to over $300 million without it even having a product, or Eich’s BAT coin, which was over in seconds, have raised some eyebrows. Still, the token market will probably continue to grow at least in the near future, said Nick Tomaino, principal at San Francisco-based venture-capital firm Runa Capital, who also runs The Control blog, which tracks digital currencies. More than $100 million of coins has been raised this year, surpassing total sales last year, while total issuance is expected to jump to about $600 million, according to Tomaino. “There’s a lot of hype, and a lot of money being raised because it’s so easy for anyone to create these coins without having to deal with any third parties, and it’s so easy for people to buy them,” Tomaino said. “It can’t be stopped.” Filed under: Currency Print Email Gmail Related Mt.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 6 June 2017 Gao Capital to help investors find right quant funds SINGAPORE: The burgeoning field of computer-driven investing has grown so large and complex that a Singapore family office has decided you need a quant to find the right quants. Multi-family office Gao Capital plans to open Asia’s first independent research service for investors that’s focused exclusively on funds employing quantitative models. Gao Capital’s research has involved scrutinising the funds’ correlations to market moves and to one another, as well as risk and volatility measures. “We want to be the stamp of approval for quant funds,” said Chauwei Yak, who co-founded Gao Capital in 2008 in New York before moving to Singapore two years later. “Our aim is to help people find the right quant fund for their portfolio.” Strategies employing quantitative models, devoid of emotion and human foibles, have surged in popularity worldwide as investment firms seek a technological edge to revive flagging returns and attract investors. Quantitative strategies have beaten their human counterparts three of the past four years and many racked up gains last year after accurately predicting outcomes to political events such as the Brexit vote and the US presidential election. Investors put US$4.6bil into quantitative strategies worldwide during the first quarter while pulling US$5.5bil from hedge funds overall, according to data provider Hedge Fund Research Inc. More than 50% of investors planning to add at least one computer-driven strategy to their portfolio, according to a Deutsche Bank AG global survey published in March. As more funds proliferate to take advantage of investor demand for such strategies, one challenge is to identify managers that truly use computer-driven models. In sifting through hundreds of funds, Yak has found that not all quant funds are what they claim to be. “We found managers who say they run a quant fund, but do all the strategy on Excel,” said Yak, a former investment banker at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS Group AG. Another claiming to be a high-frequency fund did all its trading in the morning. “That’s not high-frequency trading. Their system didn’t match their strategy.” Gao Capital has about US$600mil invested in quant funds, with the money coming from the relatives of the firm’s four partners and other wealthy families and institutional investors. The research platform will mark an expansion into advising other clients on picking funds and analysing how they fit into investors’ overall strategy.

Adio, who spoke at the investigative hearing of the Abdulrazak Namdas-led Adhoc Committee investigating the $17 billion allegedly stolen from undeclared crude oil and liquefied gas sale in the international market, however, asked to withdraw a submission earlier made to the committee by the agency.  He explained that NEITI based the submission on inadequate information, resulting in major errors in figures presented in the document. This was as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) was not able to tell the committee why only $7 billion out of $42.7 billion proceeds of crude oil sale between 2010 and 2014 was made available to the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for sharing between tiers of government during the three-year period. Also at the hearing, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) admitted submitting grossly inadequate information of a shortfall of $14 billion of crude proceeds for the period under review to the committee. NNPC’s Chief Operating Officer (COO), Bello Rabiu, tried providing explanation to what the committee said were incomplete details of crude sales in which over 200 million barrels could not be unaccounted for in 2011. Rabiu apologised and promised to provide an updated report while he denied complicity in the wrong document. During the hearing, it was also discovered that N660.9 million was lost during the same period from crude oil-related taxes due to the inability of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to carry out due diligence on the NNPC and it’s subsidiaries. CBN’s claim that it has no knowledge of details of payments on crude oil sales into its accounts with JP Morgan Chase, New York, was summarily dismissed by NNPC which disclosed that details about quantity and period of lifting of crude were always made available to the apex bank. Jack Ukitetu, who represented CBN at the hearing, said the bank only warehouses accounts of government agencies and, as such, do not have the capacity to have details of payments made into the accounts. He further explained that the apex bank has no control over such accounts and added that it can only act on mandates given by the owners of the accounts for disbursement in which category the $42.7 billion proceed fell into. On its part, the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) said it has no capacity to adequately ascertain the total crude oil lifted for export. Deputy Controller of Tariff and Trade, Ayalogu Anthony, who spoke on behalf of NCS, said the agency does not have a vessel that can be used for monitoring, lifting and loading of crude into vessels. According to him, personnel of the NCS can only witness lifting and loading when invited by the oil companies. “We can only depend on declarations on manifest submitted by companies and we issue certificate of clearance, but, we don’t issue clearance for vessels we don’t participate in their inspection,” he said.

Well, that's going to take a lot longer than anticipated and the many investors who piled into the so-called Trump trade have gotten out. Now, they're piling into Europe. Over the span of just four weeks, hedge funds and other large speculators have amassed the biggest bullish wager on the euro in more than six years, according to Bloomberg News' Andrea Wong. Bets the common currency will strengthen outnumbered wagers for it to weaken by 72,869 contracts in the week through May 30, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show, the most since May 2011. Morgan Stanley strategist no longer sees the euro falling to parity with the dollar, writing in a report Monday that they now expect it to rise to $1.18 this year from $1.1279 on Friday. The firm also boosted its euro area growth forecasts. The European Central Bank meets Thursday, and the 60 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News are split on whether policy makers will remove their easing bias on interest rates, according to Bloomberg News' Alessandro Speciale and Andre Tartar. Amid a recovery that appears stronger by the day, the Governing Council may use the gathering to have its first formal discussion on what an exit from extraordinary stimulus might look like. "Some of the policies that were put in place to fend off deflation risks and financial fragmentation are no longer needed and so can be dialed down slowly,” the Morgan Stanley strategist said. SPEAKING OF CROWDED TRADES Can anything stop emerging markets? Last week, investors added $1.3 billion to exchange-traded funds that buy developing-nation stocks and bonds, extending the longest winning streak in more than a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Inflows exceeded $16 billion over the past 13 weeks, and fund assets have grown $24.6 billion this year, compared with $23.5 billion in all of 2016. In a report released Sunday, the World Bank kept its outlook for the global economy unchanged, forecasting a modest pickup in growth despite uncertainty about monetary policy and the risk of a surge in protectionism, according to Bloomberg News' Andrew Mayeda. The development lender projects the world economy will grow by 2.7 percent this year and 2.9 percent the next, the same as its January forecast. MEXICO'S PESO RECOVERS TRUMP INDUCED LOSSES As if on cue, Mexico’s peso led gains among the world’s most traded currencies on Monday as President Enrique Pena Nieto’s party forged ahead in the election for governor of the country’s largest state. The closely fought vote tilted in favor of candidate Alfredo del Mazo, signaling the ruling PRI will keep a stronghold vital to winning the presidential election next year. The peso jumped as much as 1.91 percent, briefly touching 18.3230, a level not seen since before the U.S. election in November, according to Srinivasan Sivabalan and Isabella Cota. Investors are relieved that there is a clear margin of victory in the election that was seen as too close to call, said Richard Segal, an analyst at Manulife Asset Management. The momentum of the peso's recovery that started in January is continuing as the worst-case scenario investors expected on the North American Free Trade Agreement hasn’t materialized, he said. The peso is one of the currencies favored by Morgan Stanley in its report. VOLATILITY IS VOLATILE Given the slew of terrorist attacks in Europe, geopolitical strife from the Middle East to Asia and U.S. policy uncertainty, it's understandable that investors scratching their heads about a drop in volatility this year. Investors have conjured up myriad theories to make sense of historic lows in market volatility across asset classes despite such strong headwinds, citing everything from soaring assets in passively-managed vehicles to the rise of social media, according to Bloomberg News' Sid Verma and Luke Kawa. It's actually not that hard to understand, according to JPMorgan strategists. Subdued measures of volatility are just a reflection of "a very low supply of economic surprises currently," the strategists write in a recent note to clients. But even though the CBOE Volatility Index closed at its lowest level since 1993 on Friday, a gauge of VIX swings rose in four out of the past five weeks, reaching a record high relative to the measure of equity turbulence. With the VIX down more than 30 percent this year through the end of last week, investors have been using options to bet on volatility, according to Bloomberg News' Cecile Vannucci. The number of contracts wagering on a resurgence of market turmoil has reached its highest level since October relative to those calling for a drop in price movements. IT'S INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK! President Donald Trump kicked off a week-long push for his infrastructure plans with a proposal to hand over control of the U.S. air-traffic control system to a non-profit corporation. It may not sound like much, but the infrastructure play is one area of the Trump trade that has held up fairly well. Take the 19,000 municipal bonds tracked in the S&P Municipal Bond Infrastructure Index, which mainly consists of investment-grade fixed-income securities related to transportation and utilities. The gauge has climbed 4.25 percent this year through Friday, compared with a 2.57 percent gain in the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index. It's a similar story in equities, where the S&P Global Infrastructure Index has outperformed the MSCI All-Country World Index, albeit by a slim margin. Just last month, Blackstone Group LP, the world’s biggest private equity manager, said it's eyeing more than $100 billion in infrastructure investments. The area has gained renewed attention as Trump’s administration vows to direct more private money toward improving roads, bridges and airports. The asset class also fits the bill for liability-driven investors in the U.S. and abroad seeking current income amid near-zero interest rates and negative yields elsewhere in fixed income, according to Bloomberg News' Melissa Mittelman. TEA LEAVES In a few hours the Reserve Bank of Australia is forecast to say that policy makers decided to hold their benchmark interest rate at 1.5 percent -- for now. Since the RBA’s last policy decision on May 2, market bets on a rate cut by the end of this year have doubled, according to Bloomberg News' James Thornhill. While that chance is still only about 20 percent, traders see Australia as one of just two developed economies where cuts are possible in the coming year after data during May pointed to anemic growth in the first quarter. Strategists at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a note that they expect a "reasonably positive" tone to the statement, strengthened by a likely upgrade to the discussion around the labor market. That may be tempered, according to the RBC strategists, by an acknowledgement of some weakening in housing and the likelihood of a soft first-quarter GDP print due Wednesday.

JPMorgan buys Dublin building for 1,000 staff Impact on banks from Britain's vote to leave the EU Bankers meet UK PM Theresa May as they plan own Brexit JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jamie Dimon, who in December agreed to exit a minority-owned Chinese investment-banking joint venture, said the US bank is seeking to find a new structure that would eventually give it full control. “My longer-term dream is that we have, we own, 100 per cent of something,” Dimon, 61, said Monday in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Stephen Engle in Beijing. The CEO said he’ll be patient in negotiations with Chinese regulators. The process “is complicated, so we respect that and we tell them what we’d like and hope it’ll happen.” JPMorgan moved to sell its stake in JPMorgan First Capital Securities late last year after six years in the venture. Its partner, First Capital Securities, was to buy out JPMorgan from its one-third stake for 307 million yuan ($44 million at the time), the Chinese firm said in December. Since UBS Group and Goldman Sachs Group established Chinese joint ventures more than a decade ago, foreign banks have struggled to challenge local players. One competitive disadvantage is that Chinese rules limit them to minority stakes, reducing their sway over key decisions. China has made “huge progress” on market reforms, Dimon said, adding that he would like to increase his firm’s businesses in the nation. The firm’s businesses in China include corporate banking and stakes in a fund manager and in a commodities futures joint venture, according to the bank’s China website. JPMorgan said in February that it won approval to underwrite corporate bond sales in China’s interbank market. The issue of control contributed to JPMorgan’s decision to sell its stake in the First Capital venture, whose business included equity and debt underwriting and mergers advisory. “Joint ventures by nature have sloppy corporate governance,” Dimon said. Any new venture structure would have to allow JPMorgan “a certain amount of management control,” he said.    China’s government in November said it’s committed to letting overseas banks own bigger stakes in securities and fund-management joint ventures in the country. The rule limiting offshore ownership to 49 per cent will gradually be relaxed, the Ministry of Finance said at the time, adding that foreign investors’ participation can boost the industry’s competitiveness and global influence. Dimon said his bank would consider setting up a business in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone (FTZ), without providing more specifics. The Shanghai FTZ is studying allowing foreign investments in financial institutions to exceed current caps, Zheng Yang, the city’s financial services office director, said in June last year.

We know this because chief executive Lloyd Blankfein took to Twitter for the first time ever to repudiate President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris accord on climate change. Previously, he had gone public in opposition to the president's proposed ban on travel to the United States from certain Muslim-majority nations. What, then, are we to make of Goldman Sachs fund managers' recent secondary-market purchase, at a steep discount, of $2.8 billion worth of bonds issued by the state-owned oil company of Venezuela; that is to say, the same government that guns down pro-democracy protesters on a near-daily basis and otherwise subjects its people to vast corruption and economic privation? VIDEOS TOP JOBS Well, the first thing to be said is that the transaction was a really sweet deal for Goldman and its clients. The firm paid only $865 million for the securities, a near-70 percent markdown from face value reflective of Venezuela's parlous finances. Of course, Goldman's fund will be entitled to $2.8 billion in 2022, when the bonds mature, and meanwhile gets 19 percent annual interest, a cool $756 million. The second thing to say is what a terrible deal this is for the people of Venezuela, since on the other end of the transaction, ultimately, stands the Venezuelan central bank — which held the bonds and sold them to Goldman via a little-known intermediary. The cash Caracas reaped will help President Nicolás Maduro survive the (very) short-term, or even remain in power long enough to pay back Goldman in 2022, necessarily by imposing more brutal austerity on his people. Yes, the opposition might be in power by then; leaders pledged to stiff Goldman if it is. But the firm would probably break even under any scenario short of total debt repudiation, which would not be in a future democracy's own interest. No wonder former Venezuelan planning minister Ricardo Hausmann, now teaching at Harvard University, calls them "hunger bonds." To be sure, Goldman was trying to keep pace in the emerging market bond market — to meet such standards as the JPMorgan Chase Emerging Market Bond Index, of which Venezuela's official debt is a highly remunerative component. But that simply shows Wall Street as a whole needs to rethink dealing in this utterly illegitimate regime's obligations the same way it deals in, say, democratic Chile's, or even the debt of more responsible undemocratic countries. Even among the world's odious regimes, Venezuela is a special case; Hausmann has suggested the financial community could collectively curb incentives to do deals such as Goldman's by removing Venezuelan bonds from market indexes. If Goldman Sachs and the rest of Wall Street really want a reputation for social responsibility, they will eagerly seek alternatives to business as usual with Caracas.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR OPINION Jennifer Rubin: The other shoes start falling Dana Milbank: Tongue-tied testimony in defense of Trump Bagley Cartoon: Trump's Charitable Giving Letter: President has no vision for the future E.J.

Here are practical steps that business leaders can take to bridge the gap and take climate action. [Photo: Unsplash user Filip Bunkens] By Pavithra Mohan7 minute Read President Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement last week makes the U.S. one of just three countries the world over—the other two being Syria and Nicaragua—to opt out of the 31-page pact to take steps to reduce the effects of climate change. His decision puts the onus ion state governments and the private sector to bridge the gap and take action on climate change. advertisement Related: The rebel alliance begins: Governors of New York, California, Washington form a coalition to fight climate change But this is nothing new: As Michael Bloomberg stressed in a statement, the U.S. leading the charge in climate action had little to do with the federal government. He said:  “In the U.S., emission levels are determined far more by cities, states, and businesses than they are by our federal government,” he said. “Over the past decade, the U.S. has led the world in emission reductions—and our federal government had very little to do with it. It happened because of leadership from cities, public opposition to coal plants, and market forces that have made cleaner sources of energy—including solar and wind—cheaper than coal.” Here are some of the ways in which companies and business leaders can stay the course, with or without the support of the powers that be. Disengage—Or Stay Engaged And Be Vocal Following Trump’s decision to withdraw from the climate deal, Elon Musk has stepped down from the president’s advisory council, as has Disney CEO Bob Iger. Still remaining, however, are the likes of Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, and IBM CEO Ginni Rometty. “There’s going to be a groundswell of pressure on CEOs to step down from that advisory council,” Oxfam climate and energy director Heather Coleman says. “This decision is a pivot point.” Coleman also noted that the private sector is often “beat up” as conscientious consumers pin their hopes on businesses when the government is ineffective. “There’s a lot of anger that people feel toward the U.S. government, and toward it not taking action, that is being displaced and put on the [private sector],” Coleman says. “And so these companies understand that the more the U.S. government stalls on this issue, the more pressure they’re going to get.” Many business leaders have already been vocal about their feelings: Thirty CEOs—including the leadership of unlikely corporate allies like JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley—expressed their support of the Paris climate deal in the form of a letter last month. Others, like Exxon CEO Darren Woods, personally implored Trump not to withdraw from the climate deal. Since last week’s decision, countless CEOs have come forward to denounce Trump’s decision. Kevin Moss, the director of the World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Business Center—which works with the private sector to develop sustainability strategies—says that while it’s important for CEOs to show disagreement by choosing to no longer engage with Trump, as Musk and Iger have, there can be value in sticking around if you are vocal. “The one thing that’s not helpful is when companies stay engaged and stay quiet,” he says. “The important thing to do is make a statement by disengaging, or make a statement by staying inside and engaging and being forthright.” advertisement Set Science-Based Targets Addressing climate change is critical for the planet, yes, but it’s also good for business. “From the perspective of a business, the fundamentals remain the same,” Moss said. “Acting on climate change reduces costs and risks in a couple of different ways, and acting on climate change creates business opportunity.” What some companies are already doing is setting emission reduction targets grounded in science, with the objective of keeping the rise in global temperature to below two degrees Celsius higher than in pre-industrial times. The initiative—a partnership between WRI, CDP, the World Wide Fund for Nature, and the United Nations Global Compact—already boasts 269 companies, with two to three new companies signing up each week, according to Moss. As we’ve written before, companies often set reduction goals that don’t take into account actual science, which means they may not be doing as much as they think they are. With science-based targets, Coleman says, companies are not “arbitrarily making greenhouse gas reduction goals,” but instead are making an informed decision based on “how does this actually add up to the broader whole.” Nigel Topping, the CEO of the We Mean Business coalition, said that nearly 600 companies boasting more than $8.1 trillion in annual revenue have committed to climate action as part of a We Mean Business campaign. Included in that count is Walmart, which saved $1 billion in the last fiscal year by implementing a science-based target (Walmart’s CEO Doug McMillon has decided to remain on Trump’s advisory council). And last week, Topping says, HPEnterprise became the first company to introduce a science-based supply chain goal; its target is to cut back on carbon emissions by 100 million metric tons of carbon by 2025—the equivalent of eliminating 21 million cars from the road for a full year. Mark Barteau, the director of the University of Michigan’s energy institute, notes that this type of accountability will be crucial if companies want to reach the goals laid out in the Paris agreement. “If they’re really committed to trying to meet the Paris numbers on their own, I think having independent validation that they’re doing that is going to be important—otherwise it’s just going to look like the usual corporate propaganda and greenwashing,” he says. Introduce Carbon Pricing One way to incentivize the adoption of renewable energy sources—particularly when there’s little support from the government—is by imposing a carbon tax of sorts, or charging companies for the emission of CO2. “In many industries, there’s been a conversation happening for awhile on whether or not there’s going to be a price on carbon,” Coleman says. “Some companies have established an internal price on carbon in anticipation of regulatory action.” But as Coleman points out, the companies that are likely to do this are those in the geographic areas where carbon pricing might be imposed on a state level. advertisement As Barteau points out, if energy payback is a concern—that is, how long it takes to get a return on the initial energy investment— carbon pricing can help paint a clearer picture of energy efficiency. “That’s a fairly simple way to evaluate or take account of the carbon emissions, the carbon footprint impact, without redoing the whole way investment decisions are made,” he says. Make Sure Consumers Hear You Perhaps one of the most important things businesses can do is to ensure customers and employees understand the value of acting on climate change, and that it does not take away from their livelihood. “Many present a false choice between jobs and doing the right thing for the environment,” says Patrick Maloney, founder and CEO of smart home and clean energy company Inspire. “But the solar and wind industries are each creating jobs at a rate 12 times faster than that of the rest of the U.S. economy, and the solar industry today is responsible for more than twice as many jobs as the coal industry.” As Stephen Comello, Stanford’s Sustainable Energy Initiative director, points out, coal isn’t going to make a big comeback as a result of Trump’s decision. “What is eating the lunch of coal?” he says. “It’s natural gas. It’s cheap, it’s more efficient, it’s easier to move around . . . That’s not going to change.” In fact, according to a CBS news news report, two U.S. coal companies opted for staying in the Paris Accord with the hopes that it would foster U.S. coal sales to emerging markets that still want the fuel. Either way, Comello says it’s unlikely that coal will make a comeback.  “Carbon capture and sequestration is a pretty promising technology, but it’s been a promising technology for years,” he says. “The capital costs involved are so high. If you really were prudent about your dollars, as either a business or a government, you wouldn’t really invest in carbon capture because it is so costly. It isn’t proven. Why, if I had a billion dollars would I put that at risk to do an R&D project with carbon capture, versus actually deploying solar and wind, which is already approved technology at scale?” In his statement, Bloomberg pledged to uphold the objectives of the climate deal, regardless of the withdrawal, even committing $15 million to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, which will go toward helping other countries meet the terms of the agreement. With so many leaders and businesses speaking out, chances are consumers will hear the message loud and clear—even if the White House refuses to.

The value of ethereum is currently 30 times higher than the $8 price level it had on January 1. Read more Alternative cryptocurrency ether reaches rarefied air On Monday, the cryptocurrency was trading slightly off its record high, at $247.16 as of 1:00 pm GMT. According to industry website CryptoCompare, much of the trading volume in ethereum at the moment - around 38 percent - is coming from South Korea. It said there is increased rising interest from other regions as well. Ethereum’s total market cap currently stands at $21 billion. "All major Asian exchanges, including ours, are currently overwhelmed by the sudden growth in our client base and trading activity," Aurelien Menant, founder, and CEO of Gatecoin, a regulated bitcoin and ethereum exchange located in Hong Kong, told CNBC. "Specifically, requests for more ether trading pairs seem to be a common theme," he added. Among other factors boosting the digital currency’s price is the support from financial and technological communities. A group called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) was recently founded to connect large companies like Microsoft and JP Morgan to technology vendors. It will allow them to work on projects using the blockchain technology.

There has also been a surge in initial coin offerings (ICO) which is a new way for crypto start-ups to raise money. These ICOs have been worth tens of millions of dollars, and while many of the companies are based on the ethereum blockchain, that could help boost its price. An open-source computing platform ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by Russian cryptocurrency researcher and programmer Vitalik Buterin. Last week Buterin met Russian President Vladimir Putin at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. They had a brief conversation with Putin saying Russia’s future lies in developing the digital economy.

The company recognises it needs alternative strategies for some of the assets, particularly gas-focused operations, Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie told reporters on Monday in Tokyo. The were multiple potential owners of the assets spread across the states of Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana, he said. “We are in regular dialogue with those natural owners as to whether or not we can form more collaboration to allow us to share facilities, to drill longer wells and therefore have higher-productivity wells,” Mackenzie said. “However, they may have a value of what we hold that’s significantly in excess of our estimates based on what we know we can do.” Melbourne-based BHP would be prepared to discuss potential sales of US shale assets, which were acquired in about $20 billion (Dh73.4 billion) of deals in 2011 and were too costly and poorly timed, Mackenzie said last month. The producer has previously flagged its intention to sell parts of a Texas gasfield and a potential exit from its Fayetteville shale gas assets in Arkansas. Assets in the Delaware Basin would appear to be a “strong strategic fit” for Anadarko Petroleum Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co analysts wrote in a note last month. Tom Ward, co-founder of Chesapeake Energy Corp, said in an April interview he may be interested in reviewing the Fayetteville operations with new company Mach Resources. “We are reducing our footprint and long-term aspirations for our shale business and moving back to creating more options for growth in our conventional business,” Mackenzie told reporters. BHP’s entry into shale is among decisions that have drawn criticism from billionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, which has also attacked BHP over failed exploration and poorly timed share buy-backs, which the fund contends have destroyed $40 billion in value. Elliott has proposed a spin-off of all US oil and gas assets and last month called for an independent review of BHP’s $22.5 billion petroleum division. “We are continually reviewing the fit, the shape and the strategy of our petroleum business at board level and in regular discussion with our major shareholders,” Mackenzie said in Tokyo. BHP, the world’s biggest miner, examines all parts of its portfolio, and goes “way beyond what has been brought to our attention by Elliott,” he said. Mackenzie, who met with Elliott representatives in Barcelona last month, declined to say whether he plans to hold further talks in future with the fund.

Search Watch Live Home Vote 2017 UK Brexit Trump World Business Tech Entertainment Offbeat Weather Growth in Britain's services sector unexpectedly slows in May The fall will revive fears the UK economy is continuing to lose momentum after a solid performance in the wake of the Brexit vote. 12:22, UK, Monday 05 June 2017 Image: Economic activity in Britain's services sector cooled in May Twitter Facebook Google+ Whats App Mail By Ian King, Sky News Business Presenter Activity in the UK's services sector - which accounts for four-fifths of the UK economy - slowed sharply last month, according to new figures. The closely watched Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) survey by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute for Procurement and Supply (CIPS) reported a reading of 53.8 in May - down from the nine-month high of 55.8 in April. Anything above 50 represents growth and anything below that a contraction. The figure, which was sharply lower than the 55 that had been forecast by City economists, was the weakest since February and will revive fears that the UK economy is continuing to lose momentum following a stronger than expected performance in the wake of the Brexit vote last year. :: Surge in exports boosts UK manufacturing It was a slowdown in the services sector that was largely responsible for the lacklustre 0.2% growth in the UK economy during the first three months of the year - down from the 0.7% achieved during the final three months of 2016. The poor showing in May was partly responsible for a slowdown in the pace at which new orders are growing which, according to those taking part in the survey, were due to both weakness in consumer spending and a delay in decision-making ahead of the General Election. Duncan Brock, director of customer relationships at CIPS, said: "It was clear that slower new business growth let the side down, impacted by caution around the General Election, and a tightening of purse strings. "Not even stiff competition between businesses absorbing higher prices for food and the effects of the National Living Wage could tempt consumers to spend. "Though optimism for the future was slightly elevated, compared with April, an overall weakening since the start of 2017 shows how vulnerable the sector can be under pressure as a new government waits in the wings." The figures follow news last week of a similar slowdown in activity in the manufacturing sector and means that construction was the only sector that saw growth in activity in May. The Composite PMI, which takes into account the manufacturing and services sectors (but not construction), gave a reading of 54.4 - down from 56.2 last month and the weakest reading since September last year. Allan Monks, economist at investment bank JP Morgan Chase, said this was "consistent with a sustained slide to sub-trend growth this year". He added: "The survey is now only a point above where we would expect based on our 1.5% (annualised) second quarter GDP forecast." However, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, insisted the figures were not as bad as they seemed, thanks to a solid performance in April. He said: "Despite slower growth in May, the surveys indicate that the economy has regained some momentum in the second quarter. "The three PMI surveys are running at levels that are historically consistent with GDP growing at a robust 0.5% rate, albeit with the slowing in May posing some downside risks to the near-term outlook."

When first established over 80 years ago, the foundation worked largely out of Detroit and Dearborn, and played a large part in contributing to the Motor City’s economic and cultural legacy. The foundation moved to New York in 1953, but while it maintained close ties to its home, it was easy to question whether there was much of a connection between Ford Motor Co. and the philanthropy that launched as a result of the company’s rapid success. Furthermore, as one looks back, the foundation’s move east was a signal of Detroit’s slow decline. By many accounts, Detroit was the richest U.S. city in 1950, but its economic might had peaked. The rest, as they say, is history, as Detroit became the poster child of the Rust Belt’s struggles and later, the continued loss of manufacturing jobs to offshoring and automation. While urbanization surges across the U.S., Detroit is still losing population. Through the struggles and crises, the foundation claimed it still maintained close ties to Detroit, and has supported programs to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars – and filling much needed gap’s as the city’s civic leadership was often unwilling or unable to find a way to turn around the city’s cratering fortune. Now, according to several news accounts, the foundation is returning to the city. Crain’s reported last week that a Detroit office will open in order to manage Detroit-based programs, including an affordable housing initiative, locally instead of remotely. In total, the foundation operates various Detroit-based initiatives with a total budget of approximately $15 million, the most of any U.S. city in which its programs operate. Detroit still faces a long uphill climb in its quest to regain just a sliver of the economic momentum that showered it during much of the twentieth century. But the evidence suggests that the city has finally bottomed out – with its bankruptcy symbolizing the city’s hard fall and fitful recovery. The proximity of several top universities, a sturdy manufacturing base, its bountiful cultural options and relatively low cost of living makes the city an attractive prospect. JPMorgan Chase is one organization that has invested tens of millions of dollars in various social enterprise programs, a risk the bank says has been largely successful. Urban farms and tech startups are among the various new ventures that show promise as this city of 680,000 tries to punch its ticket to revitalization. But for Detroit to rebound, the entire city needs a lift. Much of the effort has been centered on downtown and the Woodward Corridor. Yes, the Detroit Pistons will be back downtown, and even Michigan’s Albanian-Americans are contributing to good times in Motor City again. But there is more to Detroit than the stretch of town from the waterfront to I-94. Many neighborhoods in Detroit have been left out of Detroit’s rebirth. Could having the brainpower of the Ford Foundation help? There is hope, as after all, the foundation itself is recalibrating how it operates. Earlier this year, its executives made the surprise announcement that $1 billion, or $1 in $12 of its endowment, was diverted into a fund that seeks to accelerate mission-related investing over the next decade. The foundation believes impact investing is the way forward; such a paradigm shift could benefit Detroit in the near future as well.

More videos The unknown recession Australia may have enjoyed more than 25 years without a recession, but as Peter Martin explains, it's been a close run thing. The so-called partial indicators released by the Bureau of Statistics ahead of Wednesday's national accounts have company profits climbing 6 per cent during the March quarter and wages only 0.3 per cent. The wage measure is affected by both record-low wage growth and a drop in the number of hours worked. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Deutsche Australia chief economist Adam Boyton says that in real terms "wages and salaries are falling''.  Mining profits jumped 13 per cent in the quarter and non-mining profits 2.4 per cent. Retail profits were up 4.9 per cent, manufacturing profits up 2.4 per cent, utilities profits up 2.1 per cent, and wholesale profits down 5.8 per cent and finance industry profits down 2.8 per cent. JPMorgan analyst Tom Kennedy said that, although strong, the March quarter boost in company profits would have little impact on real gross domestic product as it was mainly the result of a boost in prices rather than a boost in volumes. Commodity prices had since since swung hard in the opposite direction. Advertisement Wage growth was so weak that the savings rate would have to fall further if consumption growth was to remain healthy. "In real terms, wages and salaries are falling, something that fits with generally downbeat views on the Australian consumer," Deutsche Australia chief economist Adam Boyton said. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The quarterly rise was led by a 13 per cent increase in mining company profits on the back of a strong run in coal and iron-ore prices at the time. Photo: Robert Rough On balance the partial indicators are regarded as positive for Wednesday's March quarter GDP, with few economists continuing to forecast a negative number. The bureau's measure of inventories grew by a bigger than expected 1.2 per cent in the quarter due largely to buildup of iron ore and coal stocks as shipments were delayed by bad weather and the Chinese New Year. While the boost in inventories is expected to add 0.4 percentage points to GDP, the hit to exports is expected to subtract 0.6 points.

The price is up over 2,800 percent year-to-date. Korea is driving ethereum trade. Continued interest in the underlying blockchain behind ethereum has led to support from big companies such as Microsoft. Arjun Kharpal | @ArjunKharpal Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 3:49 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Ethereum hits another record high, marking a more than 2,800% rally this year    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 10:10 AM ET | 00:54 Ethereum, an alternative cryptocurrency to bitcoin, hit a fresh record high on Sunday, amid continued interest in the digital asset space and increased trade from Asia. On Sunday, ethereum traded at an all-time high of $250.41, according to data from industry website CoinDesk. This is up 2,839 percent from the $8.52 handle it had on January 1. Ethereum was trading at around $246.62 on Monday morning, slightly off its record high. Ether is the name of the cryptocurrency which runs on the ethereum blockchain, which is the technology that underpins the digital coin. But ethereum is often used as shorthand for the digital currency as well. What's behind the rally? Ethereum has been designed to support so-called smart contract applications. A smart contract is a computer program that can automatically execute the terms of a contract when certain conditions are met. It's this practical use of ethereum which has excited many large corporates and investors, and led to the rally. But there are a number of other reasons supporting the price. These include: A group called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) was recently founded to connect large companies to technology vendors in order to work on projects using the blockchain. Companies involved in the launch include JPMorgan, Microsoft and Intel. A further 86 companies were recently added to the alliance, helping to give legitimacy to the technology. There's been a surge in initial coin offerings (ICO) which is a new way for cryptocurrency start-ups to raise money. These ICOs have been worth tens of millions of dollars and many of the companies are based on the ethereum blockchain, which means that it would utilize ether tokens, helping to boost the price. Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, recently met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Industry publication The Cointelegraph reports that Putin and Buterin discussed the application of the technology in the country. Cryptocurrency experts said further regulation and government intervention could help the price of bitcoin and ethereum. South Korea driving trade Much of the trading volume in ethereum at the moment — around 38 percent — is coming from South Korea, according to industry website CryptoCompare with rising interest from other regions. "All major Asian exchanges, including ours, are currently overwhelmed by the sudden growth in our client base and trading activity," Aurelien Menant, founder and CEO of Gatecoin, a regulated bitcoin and ethereum exchange based in Hong Kong, told CNBC by email. "Specifically, requests for more ether trading pairs seems to be a common theme," Menant added, highlighting the growing interest for traders based in a number of countries.

Those brave enough to invest in the Wild West of tech are the ones making a killing. PHOTO: BLOOMBERG [MADRID] Forget US stocks and emerging-market assets, even ignore bitcoin. Those brave enough to invest in the Wild West of tech are the ones making a killing. While the record-breaking rally in bitcoin has captivated markets, demand for other digital coins is surging as companies raise millions in minutes, or even seconds, from investors wanting in on the next big tech startup. Last week it took 30 seconds for Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich to issue about US$35 million of basic attention token, the unit of exchange in a blockchain-based advertising platform built on top of the company's Brave browser. Digital tokens tied to the blockchain platform issued this year have more than doubled in price on average since trading started, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tech startups are increasingly selling coins that can be used on their projects instead of resorting to traditional financing methods such as venture capital. The sector isn't for the fainthearted. The apps and websites behind most of these tokens are still only in development stage. Most are sold for pennies on the dollar and volatility can be extreme. TaaS, a closed-end fund dedicated to blockchain markets, had the coins it sold this year double in price in five weeks, and then fall 35 per cent in two days. Powered by GET.com sentifi.com Market voices on: But if you can stomach the risk, the rewards have been substantial. Coins from the 15 ICOs this year for which data is available have risen by an average of over 100 percent, while shares sold in initial public offerings in the U.S. this year have gained 13 percent on average since they started trading. SEE ALSO: Bitcoin mania infects Japan stock market's smaller listings "There's been overwhelming demand for coins," said Ron Quaranta, chairman of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance. "Sure, a lot of it is based on speculation and traders looking to make a quick gain, but there's also a fundamental driver, which is the anticipation that the digital-currency market is maturing." Forty-four coins have been issued this year, according to blockchain research website Smith & Crown. Not all trade immediately after the auctions since some have vesting periods. The tokens with the biggest gain, a 500 per cent jump since it started trading on March 30, was issued by Edgeless, which is building a decentralized gambling platform. That sale wasn't open to US-based investors since the company isn't licensed to operate in the US. Prediction market platform Gnosis sold the highest valued tokens this year. The GNO token started trading at US$52 on May 1 and has more than quadrupled. Even with growing acceptance of blockchain from companies ranging from Toyota Motor Corp to JPMorgan Chase & Co, some advocates of the technology say they're cautious of the digital tokens because of the exuberance sweeping through the cryptocurrency world. "It seems like a fad, and as a professional investor, it's not what we do," said David Dunn, president of Kingsbridge Wealth Management, who first bought bitcoin in 2014 and has invested in blockchain-related companies. "I'd rather invest in the companies using the technology themselves. The speculators might end up being right, and this becomes a solid investment because of the power of the technology, but we're not at that stage." Token sales like the one for Gnosis, which catapulted the company's market capitalization to over US$300 million without it even having a product, or Eich's BAT coin, which was over in seconds, have raised some eyebrows. Still, the token market will probably continue to grow at least in the near future, said Nick Tomaino, principal at San Francisco-based venture-capital firm Runa Capital, who also runs The Control blog, which tracks digital currencies. More than US$100 million of coins has been raised this year, surpassing total sales last year, while total issuance is expected to jump to about $600 million, according to Mr Tomaino. "There's a lot of hype, and a lot of money being raised because it's so easy for anyone to create these coins without having to deal with any third parties, and it's so easy for people to buy them," Mr Tomaino said. "It can't be stopped."

U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpsaid on Thursday that he has decided to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, a landmark global pact to fight climate change. (Xinhua/Mike Theiler) By Peter Mertz DENVER, the United States, June 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of withdrawal from the Paris Accord has caused a firestorm at home and led to big companies' revolt, analysts said. "It goes against smart, profitable economics, smart international policy, against American global leadership, and against ethical and moral stewardship of our planet," said Washington, D.C. political insider David B. Richardson, an attorney who worked on Capitol Hill in the 1980s. The withdrawal from the world's pre-eminent climate control agreement - signed in Paris in 2015 by 197 countries - met with widespread and growing disdain from American businesses. Leaving the Paris agreement "has no benefit other than pandering to the conservative movement's ideological opposition to multilateralism and environmental regulation," wrote Ben Adler Saturday in a Washington Post article. America's 45th president narrowly won the 2016 election with a pro-business "Make America Strong" theme. But when he ignored even conservative, pro-fossil fuel burning oil giants ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, who supported the Paris Agreement, he walked into a minefield, political pundits told Xinhua. Since the president's announcement of withdrawal Thursday, a number of famous American business jumped away from offering support to his decision. On Friday, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank wrote in the Baltimore Sun, "I disagree with the decision to exit the Paris Accord." "Sustainability has always been part of our DNA: it's integral to how we live and work and is essential to our environment," Plank wrote. Ironically, Plank praised Trump's pro-business approach in February, words that were criticized by other business leaders. On Thursday, it was Elon Musk of Tesla and Disney CEO Bob Iger who stepped down from Trump's business advisory councils to protest the decision to withdraw from the Paris climate deal. "Protecting our planet and driving economic growth are critical to our future, and they aren't mutually exclusive," Iger said on Twitter. "I deeply disagree with the decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement," he added. Musk, 45, whose net worth is 15.2 billion U.S. dollars, has founded and co-founded companies such as SpaceX, Tesla, OpenAI, Neuralink, and SolarCity. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," said Musk, in an announcement Thursday he would leave Trump's council. Trump created the business advisory group last December before taking office. It last met in February, and includes American business heavyweights Blackstone Group, PepsiCo, JPMorgan, and Chase & Co. Several members of this 17-member council stepped down or resigned due to controversial Trump policies, but since the Paris announcement they are leaving in droves. In addition, CEO Tim Cook of Apple, Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical Co., and Travis Kalanick of Uber Technologies Inc. jumped ship in the past few days. On Thursday, other business giants such as Salesforce, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg used social media to express their disappointment. Even those who announced to continue to serve on Trump's council, such as BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Larry Fink also expressed different opinions. In a statement, Fink said he disagreed with the decision to leave the Paris Agreement calling it "a critical step forward in addressing climate change." Fink's company is the world's largest asset manager with 5.4 trillion U.S. Dollars under management. "I am a strong believer that our industry needs to have a voice with governments around the world," he said. Automobile giant General Motors announced Thursday it would stay on the president's forum, but Ford said in a statement Thursday, "climate change is real." "We remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities," Ford said in a statement. The No. 2 U.S. car maker declined to say if it would stay on the president's council.   | PRINT | RSS SINA English is the English-language destination for news and information about China.

The label had become somewhat anachronistic during the 2008 global financial crisis when it was developed countries that bore the brunt – and, more importantly, were the source – of the severe banking and macroeconomic woes that wreaked havoc on the world economy. As China’s aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus hauled the global economy out of recession, and as the leading emerging markets proved remarkably resilient to the financial mayhem in the United States and Europe, many fund managers and investors began to rethink their asset allocation process, and their perceptions of sovereign risk more generally. Jerome Booth, a prominent investor and one of the most authoritative commentators on emerging markets, went so far as to say that many developing economies had become “safe havens” because of their much lighter debt burdens, significant economic clout and, in many cases, stronger creditworthiness. Booth noted that the main difference between developing nations and their advanced counterparts was that in emerging markets, the risks were already priced in. In advanced economies, on the other hand, investors never bothered to price in the risks because they perceived developed nations as more or less risk-free. These risks, moreover, were as much – if not more – political as they were economic. In other words, investors had been underpricing (or simply ignoring) political risks in advanced economies, particularly in Europe. Fast-forward eight years, and based on the distinction between developed and developing economies favoured by Booth, the term “emerging markets” has almost certainly been rendered obsolete. Over the past year or so, the pendulum of political risk has swung even further in the direction of advanced economies. Just in the past week, cracks in the 60-year-old transatlantic alliance have widened significantly following US President Donald Trump’s decision to pull America out of the Paris accord on climate change. In Britain, meanwhile, the pound is once again under strain as opinion polls show a much tighter race between the country’s two main parties ahead of a crucial parliamentary election on Thursday. And in Italy, the next big test of populist sentiment in Europe, there is now talk of an early election in the autumn. Make no mistake, investors and traders are far more concerned about political developments in the US and Europe than in Brazil and Turkey. Emerging markets show strong growth potential, but are vulnerable to global ripples Just as importantly, the emerging-market asset class as a whole has weathered the effects of last year’s political shocks in Britain and the US with relative ease – admittedly partly because broader sentiment has held up remarkably well. At a time when there is speculation that Trump could even be impeached, emerging markets continue to enjoy a surge in capital inflows. According to JPMorgan, investors poured a further US$2.6 billion into emerging-market bond and equity funds in the week to May 31, bringing this year’s cumulative inflows to more than US$75 billion, compared with US$44 billion for the whole of 2016. Investors are also treating some of the sovereign and corporate bonds of emerging markets as a safer proposition than the debt of developed economies. The five-year credit default swap spreads – a type of insurance against the risk of default by a particular country or company – of China, Indonesia and Hungary are lower than those of Italy and Portugal. More tellingly, spreads on high-yield (or non-investment-grade) emerging-market corporate bonds, as measured by the high-yield component of JPMorgan’s benchmark emerging-market corporate bond index , are tighter than their US equivalents, mainly because of the dramatic compression in the spreads on Asian and emerging European high-yield debt. Investors and traders are far more concerned about political developments in the US and Europe than in Brazil and Turkey Yet just because the term “emerging markets” is no longer appropriate does not mean that emerging markets should be treated as safe havens. While the credit quality of many emerging markets is stronger than that of many developed economies, the argument that developing nations can somehow decouple from their advanced peers does not stand up to scrutiny. The sharp sell-off in emerging markets during the summer of 2013 following the Federal Reserve’s unexpected decision to start winding down its programme of quantitative easing is a reminder of how sensitive the asset class is to financial conditions in developed markets. Just as importantly, when China sneezes, the world catches a cold. As the International Monetary Fund recently noted, financial spillovers from the world’s second-largest economy by market exchange rates to the rest of the world “are on the rise”.

"It goes against smart, profitable economics, smart international policy, against American global leadership, and against ethical and moral stewardship of our planet," said Washington, D.C. political insider David B. Richardson. The withdrawal from the world's pre-eminent climate control agreement -- signed in Paris in 2015 by 197 countries -- met with widespread and growing disdain from American businesses, Xinhua reported. Leaving the Paris agreement "has no benefit other than pandering to the conservative movement's ideological opposition to multilateralism and environmental regulation," wrote Ben Adler Saturday in a Washington Post article. US 45th president narrowly won the 2016 election with a pro-business "Make America Strong" theme. But when he ignored even conservative, pro-fossil fuel burning oil giants ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, who supported the Paris Agreement, he walked into a minefield, political pundits said. Since the president's announcement of withdrawal on Thursday, a number of famous American business jumped away from offering support to his decision. On Friday, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank wrote in the Baltimore Sun, "I disagree with the decision to exit the Paris Accord." "Sustainability has always been part of our DNA: it's integral to how we live and work and is essential to our environment," Plank wrote. Ironically, Plank praised Trump's pro-business approach in February, words that were criticized by other business leaders. On Thursday, it was Elon Musk of Tesla and Disney CEO Bob Iger who stepped down from Trump's business advisory councils to protest the decision to withdraw from the Paris climate deal. "Protecting our planet and driving economic growth are critical to our future, and they aren't mutually exclusive," Iger said on Twitter. "I deeply disagree with the decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement," he added. Musk, 45, whose net worth is $15.2 billion, has founded and co-founded companies such as SpaceX, Tesla, OpenAI, Neuralink, and SolarCity. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," said Musk. Trump created the business advisory group last December before taking office. It last met in February, and includes American business heavyweights Blackstone Group, PepsiCo, JPMorgan, and Chase & Co. Several members of this 17-member council stepped down or resigned due to controversial Trump policies, but since the Paris announcement they are leaving in droves. In addition, CEO Tim Cook of Apple, Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical Co., and Travis Kalanick of Uber Technologies Inc. jumped ship in the past few days. On Thursday, other business giants such as Salesforce, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg used social media to express their disappointment. Even those who announced to continue to serve on Trump's council, such as BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Larry Fink also expressed different opinions. Fink said he disagreed with the decision to leave the Paris Agreement calling it "a critical step forward in addressing climate change." Fink's company is the world's largest asset manager with $5.4 trillion under management. "I am a strong believer that our industry needs to have a voice with governments around the world," he said. Automobile giant General Motors announced on Thursday it would stay on the president's forum, but Ford said in a statement Thursday, "climate change is real." "We remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities," Ford said in a statement. The numbner two US car maker declined to say if it would stay on the president's council. --IANS qd/ (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Bond yields on China’s onshore market have risen back to their levels of late 2014, driven by the rebound in inflation and commodity prices in November and December, and accelerated since March as interbank rates surged and the regulator cracked down on arbitrage and risky lending practises. Yields on benchmark 10-year Chinese government bonds is now up about 100 basis points to above 3.65 per cent from its low in late October, and corporate bond yields are on average up by about 200 basis points. Onshore Chinese yuan, meanwhile, has touched its highest level at above 6.75 yuan against the US dollar in nearly seven months, after China’s central bank set the yuan midpoint at the strongest point since November, in a strong show of force against short sellers. “Yuan bears will either go into hibernation or take to the sidelines licking their wounds for the foreseeable future,” said Stephen Innes, senior trader at Oanda. While both corporate and government bond yields are at their highest since 2014, Chen Long, China economist at Gavekal Dragonomics, says the sell off is not over yet, and neither is the financial crackdown. “Bad news for sellers of bonds could be good news for buyers of them. The recent rise in yields could well make the onshore bond market attractive for investors who believe the country is still headed for a structural slowdown in growth and inflation in coming years,” Chen wrote in a research note on Tuesday. “China’s sovereign and quasi-sovereign bonds could be a great longer-term macro trade if their yields decline over time along with economic growth – a trajectory that both Japan and South Korea have followed,” he added. Moody’s downgraded Chinese government bonds from A1 to Aa3 on Wednesday on long-standing concerns about declining potential growth and rising economy-wide debt, but managed to upgrade China’s outlook to stable from negative. “While lower growth and rising debt may not be good for China, they can be quite good news for fixed-income investors, especially in a market where most sovereign debt is in local currency and most of the players are domestic,” Chen wrote in the note. “Japan also suffered from declining growth, rising debt, and multiple downgrades by international ratings agencies – but Japanese government bonds have been a fantastic investment, with yields declining steadily over the past 15 years. Foreign investors now own 10 per cent of the Japanese government bond market.” Foreign investors reduced their holdings of Chinese onshore bonds in late 2015 and early 2016, and they now stand at 802 billion yuan (US$117 billion), accounting for 1.6 per cent of the market, a ratio that has not changed much over the past year as the market itself expanded rapidly. One of foreign asset managers’ biggest concerns about China over the past 18 months has been the tightening up of capital controls... The Bond Connect programme should ease some of those worries Chen Long, China economist, Gavekal Dragonomics Investment wise, Chen said the formal announcement of Hong Kong’s planned Bond Connect scheme between Hong Kong and the mainland , which it is hoped will attract more international investors to trade on China’s onshore bond market, free of quotas, should help the market expand. “One of foreign asset managers’ biggest concerns about China over the past 18 months has been the tightening up of capital controls. The Bond Connect programme should ease some of those worries, as Hong Kong’s commitment to free capital mobility has great credibility, and the free operation of the two Stock Connect programmes [between Shanghai and Shenzhen, and Hong Kong] has set a good precedent,” he wrote in the note. According to Goldman Sachs’ analysis, China bonds could account for 10 per cent of emerging market benchmark indices, and 6 per cent of global benchmarks by 2021. “Bond inclusions are more likely to start materialising in 2018, with the JP Morgan’s Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets index potentially kicking off the globalisation process of China bonds, followed by Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate and Citi’s WGBI by 2019-2020,” said Goldman Sachs. The inclusion into global bond indices will attract US$250 billion of inflows to China’s bond market over the next five years, the report predicts. However, there are still some unfavourable issues facing China’s onshore debt market, which are keeping international index providers from including China in the benchmarks, the report said. The first concern comes from registration, or market access. “There are several steps, forms and requirements that are needed to register for the China interbank bond market (CIBM) and the process may take several months for some investors. “Feedback from investors suggests they would like a more streamlined process, applications in one place, filling in a single form, and a faster turnaround time from the agent banks and authorities involved in CIBM registration,” the report said. While the CIBM rules do not restrict repatriation, many investors say they were also worried about the likely continued existence of “soft” capital controls, especially when outflow pressure is high, the report noted. Other concerns include market liquidity and settlement cycle.

"It goes against smart, profitable economics, smart international policy, against American global leadership, and against ethical and moral stewardship of our planet," said Washington, D.C. political insider David B. Richardson, an attorney who worked on Capitol Hill in the 1980s. The withdrawal from the world's pre-eminent climate control agreement - signed in Paris in 2015 by 197 countries - met with widespread and growing disdain from American businesses. Leaving the Paris agreement "has no benefit other than pandering to the conservative movement's ideological opposition to multilateralism and environmental regulation," wrote Ben Adler Saturday in a Washington Post article. America's 45th president narrowly won the 2016 election with a pro-business "Make America Strong" theme. But when he ignored even conservative, pro-fossil fuel burning oil giants ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, who supported the Paris Agreement, he walked into a minefield, political pundits told Xinhua. Since the president's announcement of withdrawal Thursday, a number of famous American business jumped away from offering support to his decision. On Friday, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank wrote in the Baltimore Sun, "I disagree with the decision to exit the Paris Accord." "Sustainability has always been part of our DNA: it's integral to how we live and work and is essential to our environment," Plank wrote. Ironically, Plank praised Trump's pro-business approach in February, words that were criticized by other business leaders. On Thursday, it was Elon Musk of Tesla and Disney CEO Bob Iger who stepped down from Trump's business advisory councils to protest the decision to withdraw from the Paris climate deal. "Protecting our planet and driving economic growth are critical to our future, and they aren't mutually exclusive," Iger said on Twitter. "I deeply disagree with the decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement," he added. Musk, 45, whose net worth is 15.2 billion U.S. dollars, has founded and co-founded companies such as SpaceX, Tesla, OpenAI, Neuralink, and SolarCity. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," said Musk, in an announcement Thursday he would leave Trump's council. Trump created the business advisory group last December before taking office. It last met in February, and includes American business heavyweights Blackstone Group, PepsiCo, JPMorgan, and Chase & Co. Several members of this 17-member council stepped down or resigned due to controversial Trump policies, but since the Paris announcement they are leaving in droves. In addition, CEO Tim Cook of Apple, Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical Co., and Travis Kalanick of Uber Technologies Inc. jumped ship in the past few days. On Thursday, other business giants such as Salesforce, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg used social media to express their disappointment. Even those who announced to continue to serve on Trump's council, such as BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Larry Fink also expressed different opinions. In a statement, Fink said he disagreed with the decision to leave the Paris Agreement calling it "a critical step forward in addressing climate change." Fink's company is the world's largest asset manager with 5.4 trillion U.S. Dollars under management. "I am a strong believer that our industry needs to have a voice with governments around the world," he said. Automobile giant General Motors announced Thursday it would stay on the president's forum, but Ford said in a statement Thursday, "climate change is real." "We remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities," Ford said in a statement. The No. 2 U.S. car maker declined to say if it would stay on the president's council.

Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell: Blackstone Group — The private-equity firm offered about $2 billion to buy out Finland-based real estate company Sponda. That represents a nearly 21 percent premium for Sponda shareholders, and the company's board has recommended that shareholders accept the offer. Herbalife – Herbalife raised its current-quarter profit forecast to 95 cents to $1.15 per share from a prior 88 cents to $1.08 a share range. The nutritional supplements maker did say it expects sales to fall by more than six percent as its transitions to new Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rules. It also said 90 percent of its U.S. sales in May were documented consumer purchases, exceeding the 80 percent threshold laid out in its agreement with the FTC. Forestar Group – D.R. Horton has submitted a bid to buy 75 percent of the residential land developer for $16.25 per share, and keep Forestar as a publicly traded company. That price is 14 percent above the price of an existing deal that would see Forestar bought by Starwood Capital Group. Apple, Amazon – The two companies will join a bid by Apple supplier Foxconn for Toshiba's semiconductor business, according to a report in Japan's Nikkei business daily. Separately, Apple – which opens its World Wide Developers Conference today – was downgraded from "overweight" to "sector weight" at Pacific Crest, saying upside from the upcoming iPhone 8 is priced in, while risks are not. EBay – The stock was upgraded to "outperform" from "neutral" at Credit Suisse, which points to platform changes and product innovation among factors that give the company several paths to earnings growth. Deutsche Bank — The bank did not respond to a request from House Democrats seeking information about possible ties between Russia and President Donald Trump, according to a Democratic staffer. Time Warner – Time Warner shares could jump 20 percent due to the lift provided by the success of the "Wonder Woman" movie, according to Barron's. The magazine said Time Warner could be a winning trade on its own, or when its expected merger with AT&T is completed, since AT&T shares have a history of rising after deals are consummated. Facebook — Facebook said it is aiming to make its platform a "hostile environment" for terrorists, in a statement made after the weekend terror attacks in London. Tesla — Toyota said over the weekend that it had sold all its shares in the electric car maker by the end of 2016, after holding a three percent stake that originally cost the company $50 million. Dollar Tree – Dollar Tree is being sued by discount retailer Dollar Express for allegedly driving it out of business. Dollar Express was formed from stores that Family Dollar and Dollar Tree sold to win approval for their takeover deal. Dollar Express accuses the company of using confidential information to open new stores near the divested locations. Sony – Sony announced the release of the first title from its new unit focusing on smartphone games. Users in Japan can now sign up for a mobile version of "Everybody's Golf," a longtime staple of its PlayStation platform. Gigamon – Gigamon is set to explore a sale, according to a Reuters report. The maker of network monitoring software has been pushed by stakeholder and activist hedge fund Elliott Management to explore alternatives that include a sale. Elliott holds a 15.3 percent stake in Gigamon. Bunge – Bunge has hired JPMorgan Chase and Shearman & Sterling to help it defend against takeovers, according to the Financial Times. The paper said the grain processing company – which rejected overtures from Glencore recently – wants to remain independent. Gap – Gap was upgraded to "outperform" from "perform" at Oppenheimer, saying current strength in earnings and profit margins for the apparel retailer is not reflected in the stock's price. Pandora – The New York Post reports that Verizon is considering a $100 million investment in the streaming music service, stemming from interest in data from Pandora users.
