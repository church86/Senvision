 The startup that was supposed to be the first tech IPO of 2017 pulled a shady move on some of its own bankers Portia Crowe Jan. 25, 2017, 4:03 PM 13,402 facebook linkedin twitter email print AppDynamics CEO David Wadhwani.Dan Frommer, Business Insider It looks like AppDynamics' last-minute deal to sell itself to Cisco — rather than go public as planned — was a surprise to more people than just investors. Some of the bankers working on the initial public offering, or IPO, were kept out of the loop until "moments before" the press release, according to Bloomberg's Alex Sherman and Alex Barinka. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan were the lead banks on the IPO, according to an SEC filing, with Barclays, UBS, Wells Fargo, William Blair, and JMP Securities also acting as underwriters. But AppDynamics hired the boutique bank Qatalyst to work on a sale behind the scenes, according to the the report. During the IPO roadshow they held late-night meetings in hotel rooms after underwriters and investors had left for the day, Bloomberg reported. Fortune's Erin Griffith reports that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs advised on the sale along with Qatalyst. While Cisco has been interested in a deal with AppDynamics for months, Fortune reports that it wasn't until late last week that the company decided to go after a merger "aggressively." Qatalyst founder Frank Quattrone is a long-time adviser to Cisco, which frequently acquires companies. It's worth noting Cisco has made this sort of play before. Back in 1999, the company paid about $7 billion to buy Cerent shortly before that company was to go public. Credit Suisse First Boston, whose head of technology at the time was Quattrone, advised on that sale.

 US STOCKS-Wall St little changed as earnings, GDP data disappoint Reuters Jan. 27, 2017, 1:01 PM 99 facebook linkedin twitter email print * Fourth-quarter GDP up 1.9 pct vs. est. 2.2 pct * Starbucks lower after cutting revenue forecast * Chevron down after profit falls short of estimates * All three major indexes on track to post weekly gains * Indexes down: Dow 0.04 pct, S&P 0.10 pct, Nasdaq 0.02 pct (Updates to early afternoon) By Tanya Agrawal Jan 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street was little changed on Friday as investors paused after a recent rally following underwhelming corporate earnings and gross domestic product data. U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter, with GDP rising at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists and the 3.5 percent growth pace logged in the third quarter. Chevron fell 2.2 percent to $113.98 after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts' expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes. The Nasdaq was weighed down by Starbucks, whose shares dropped 3.6 percent to $56.34 after the world's biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. "Earnings have really just been fine," said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in San Francisco. "They haven't been too hot, nor have there been any concerns or cautionary flags raised. I think fine might not be enough in the near term and there is a growing concern that while the numbers have been good, the forward guidance have been just okay." However, the Dow stayed above 20,000 for the third straight day, after breaching the milestone for the first time on Wednesday as the post-election rally reignited. All three major indexes were also on track to post weekly gains. Still, investors retreated to a wait-and-see mode as they sought more clarity on President Donald Trump's policies and the new administration's ability to clear legislature hurdles in its quest to reduce regulation and cut taxes. "There's definitely a gap between expectations and reality. I think the new administration has probably until the summer time to show some forward momentum and progress on getting policy changed and implemented through Congress." said Lyon. At 12:35 p.m. ET (1735 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 8.74 points, or 0.04 percent, at 20,092.17. The S&P 500 was down 2.47 points, or 0.10 percent, at 2,294.21 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.91 points, or 0.02 percent, at 5,654.27. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the energy index's 0.99 percent fall leading the decliners. Microsoft rose 2.3 percent to $65.72, while Intel gained 1.4 percent to $38.09 after the two companies reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. However, Google parent Alphabet was down 0.8 percent at $850.35 after it posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates. American Airlines fell 5 percent to $47.10 after the No. 1 U.S. airline by passenger traffic reported a fall in profit. Colgate-Palmolive fell 5.9 percent to $64.20 after the personal products maker's fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,768 to 1,047. On the Nasdaq, 1,628 issues fell and 1,075 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 24 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 23 new lows.

Nigeria seizes $1.2 bn oil bloc, says will prosecute Shell, Eni - Irish Sun Issue 028/15 Irish Sun        http://www.irishsun.com   Ireland News Breaking International News Breaking Business News Europe Sports News Dublin News Economics News Belfast News Breaking Internet News Web Site Development News Healthcare News Ireland News Utilities News Nigeria seizes $1.2 bn oil bloc, says will prosecute Shell, Eni PanArmenian.Net Saturday 28th January, 2017 PanARMENIAN.Net - Nigeria is seizing back one of Africa's richest oil blocs and will prosecute petroleum giants Shell and Eni in a $1.2 billion corruption scandal that has drawn investigators from the United States, Italy, France, Switzerland and Holland, The Associated Press reports citing a Nigerian Federal High Court document. The court on Thursday, January 26 ceded control of Oil Prospecting License 245 to the government while the West African country's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission investigates and prosecutes suspects in the "Malabu Oil scam," according to a statement from the commission. The commission's petition to the court says Dutch-British corporation Shell and Italian Agip - now Eni - bought the bloc in 2011 knowing the transaction was "fraught with fraud" and that the $1.2 billion payment to former petroleum minister Dan Etete and his allies was a bribe. The state oil company got only $210 million from the deal. The government is preparing further charges of "conspiracy, bribery, official corruption and money-laundering" against Shell and Eni, the petition says. Criminal charges already have been filed against both companies and several executives in an Italian court in Milan. "This is historic. Generations of Nigerians have been robbed of life-saving services while oil men have grown rich at their expense," said Simon Taylor of the anti-corruption body Global Witness. "Companies and their investors must understand they can no longer do backdoor deals with corrupt officials without paying a hefty price." Eni has not received notification of the court order, spokesman Roberto Carlo Albini told The Associated Press. "Eni denies any wrongdoing," he said. Shell Nigeria spokesman Bamidele Olugbenga Odugbesan said he had no comment. The oil companies paid the $1.2 billion into a Nigerian government escrow account at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase, and former justice minister Mohammed Bello Adoke authorized its distribution. The commission last month filed charges of fraud and money laundering against Etete, Adoke and businessman Aliyu Abubakar. The petition says Nigeria's former military dictator Gen. Sani Abacha and Etete used front men to form Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd. and illegally awarded themselves OPL 245. After Abacha's mysterious death in 1998, the company directors and shareholding was fraudulently altered to divest Abacha's son, Mohammed, it says. The Malabu bloc was seized by the government once before, by the civilian government of Olusegun Obasanjo in 2001. Malabu Oil sued and an out of court agreement returned the bloc to the company.

Featured Story Brexit dampens predictions of Irish growth DUBLIN, Ireland - The Central Bank has cut down the growth forecast for this year despite the country showing resilience to Brexit. This is due to the fact that risks lie ahead as hard Brexit deal looms large.  Moreover, Irish-owned manufacturing industries had witnessed a slackening of demand even before the sharp slump in the Sterling. According to the Central Bank, it has received 100 inquiries from U.K.-based banks and investment funds that were considering relocation to somewhere else in the EU. It has been revealed that Barclays Bank had decided that Dublin will be its main hub inside the EU after Brexit.  The bank also plans on adding about 150 staff to its operations here, in case U.K.-based finance companies lose easy access to the EU market.  This however, could lead to a rise in house prices, as foreign employees seek homes in Ireland. Chief economist at the Central Bank has noted that an influx of foreign bank personnel could affect house prices because there is a shortage of supply.  Ireland would need more than 25,000 new homes a year to meet demand. The Chief Economist said that the outlook for the Irish economy was a “mixed bag” as more jobs and wage increases would raise domestic demands, despite risks from a hard Brexit deal. The bank cut its GDP forecast to 3.3 percent from 3.6 percent because of the effect of slower global growth on Irish exports.  The bank further predicts growth to slow to 3 percent in 2018. The chief economist noted that it was “implausible” for the Irish economy to fare worse than U.K. under a hard Brexit.  Meanwhile, Barclays is making its contingency plans so it can continue serving EU clients in the case that Theresa May fails to strike a deal preserving London’s access to EU’s markets. Barclays has hired staff for positions of senior managers, derivatives specialists, currency traders, compliance and human resources staff in Dublin. Additionally, Merrion Capital reported that it is more cautious of stocks overall because of the huge rally by stock markets after the election of Donald Trump.  According to the company, U.S. tax cuts could lead to a rise in earnings of U.S. companies, however, Trump’s ‘America First’ policy may lead to higher tariffs.

The industrial average has now risen 9 percent since Election Day. Stronger U.S. economic data and optimism about Trump's business policy, among other factors, have pushed not only the Dow, but also the other major averages and small-cap stocks, higher in that time. President-elect Donald Trump speaks at the Wisconsin State Fair Exposition Center in 2016. Shannon Stapleton | Reuters But risk factors like rising valuations, a potentially strengthening dollar, and climbing interest rates could knock markets back down in the short term, experts said. Stocks have endured a sluggish period since mid-December after the initial post-election rally wore off. Rising — and Sustained — Confidence Experts said Trump's proposals, including corporate tax cuts, repatriation of cash overseas, deregulation and infrastructure spending, give investors enough hope for rising corporate earnings that the Trump enthusiasm may continue well into his administration. "The market is perceiving this as a business-friendly administration that is coming into office for the next four years. It wouldn't take much to give earnings a real boost. I think that's where the market is coming from and I think it will continue," said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. While the Dow components are considerably less industrial than they used to be, most of the companies have a lot to gain from Trump's plans. He wants to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and has touted that plan in meetings with business executives since he took office. Trump will try to give companies incentives to bring cash back to the United States. Apple, for example, has $216 billion parked abroad. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase would benefit from looser financial regulations, while Exxon Mobil and Chevron could get boosts from easier energy production rules. Trump has already signaled he will be friendly to the oil and gas industry, as on Tuesday he signed executive orders to advance the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. Consumer Spending Caterpillar and Boeing may see big benefits from infrastructure spending. Income tax cuts could push more consumer money to companies such as Walt Disney, Nike, and McDonald's. Those are just some examples of how Trump's proposals could help Dow component companies at a time when U.S. economic data has shown improvement. "I think that all of this together has encouraged investors, given them some semblance of hope," said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at Boston Private Wealth. Still, market watchers said Trump administration policies could get derailed in ways that may quash market optimism. Some plans may not get "enacted with the same order of magnitude as expected" or not get passed "soon enough" to sustain the excitement, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. For instance, some congressional conservatives have expressed misgivings about the spending binge that Trump has proposed. He has also brought infrastructure up only sparingly since he took office.

While key Republicans in Congress have supported Trump's corporate and personal tax cuts, it remains to be seen if they can pass his desired 15 percent business rate. Even if Trump achieves all of his desired policies, the market could see a pullback before it starts climbing again, strategists added. Major averages fell last month after the Federal Reserve hiked the federal funds rate by a quarter point. The Dow also retreated more than once recently after approaching the 20K mark. Still, strategists said that if the expectations for Trump's pro-business White House become reality, earnings could get enough of a boost to keep pushing stocks higher.
