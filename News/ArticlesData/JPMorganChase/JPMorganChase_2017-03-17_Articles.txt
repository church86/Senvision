The bitcoin exchange, Coin.mx, was linked to an investigation of a data breach at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, revealed in 2014, that exposed more than 83 million accounts. Pastor Trevon Gross, 47, and programmer Yuri Lebedev, 39, were convicted of conspiracy and bribery charges by a jury in Manhattan federal court after a week of deliberations, according to a spokesman for federal prosecutors. Lebedev was also convicted of wire fraud and bank fraud. Henry Klingeman, Gross's attorney, said in an email that he would seek an order overturning the verdict, "and - if and when the time comes - a fair and lenient sentence." Eric Creizman, a lawyer for Lebedev, had no immediate comment. Prosecutors charged that Lebedev helped arrange bribes to Gross, including $150,000 in donations to his church. In exchange, they say, Gross helped the operator of Coin.mx, Anthony Murgio, take over a small credit union Gross ran from his church. Murgio used the credit union to evade scrutiny of banks wary of processing payments involving the virtual currency, prosecutors say. Lebedev was accused of working for Coin.mx through a front called "Collectables Club." Over the course of a four-week trial, lawyers for Lebedev and Gross tried to paint a different picture, saying their clients did not know that Murgio was running an illegal operation and never acted with corrupt intent. The trial followed a probe rooted in the JPMorgan data breach, which lead to charges against nine people. Gross, Lebedev and Murgio were not accused of hacking. But prosecutors said Coin.mx was owned by an Israeli who was behind the breach, Gery Shalon. Prosecutors say Shalon, together with Maryland-born Joshua Samuel Aaron, orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of information from more than 100 million people. Prosecutors said they carried out the hacks to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with promotional emails. Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein have pleaded not guilty. Murgio pleaded guilty to charges related to Coin.mx in January. He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 16.

');//--> } Home Wealth Management Speaking Book Contact MIB: Simon Lack on Investors Responsibility in Hedge Funds March 14, 2017 10:00am by Barry Ritholtz This week on our Masters in Business radio podcast, we speak with Simon Lack of SL Advisors, and author of The Hedge Fund Mirage: The Illusion of Big Money and Why It’s Too Good to Be True. Lack previously sat on JPMorgan’s investment committee, allocating over $1 billion to hedge fund managers. He founded the JPMorgan Incubator Funds, two private equity vehicles that took economic stakes in emerging hedge fund managers. We discuss the challenges of finding those rare managers who generate alpha. Lack’s experience seeding hedge funds for JPMorgan has left him with the conclusion that being a general partner with most hedge funds is much more lucrative than being a limited partner (i.e., investor). Lack places the blame for poor hedge fund performance squarely on the investor class — noting that these are not mom and pop investors putting $10,000 into an ETF, but very sophisticated institutional investors deploying billions of dollars on behalf of pensions, endowments, and family offices. A consistent lack of knowledge exists among these investors, and an excessive willingness to chase last year’s hot fund is a regular problem. All of the books discussed can be found here. You can hear the show on Bloomberg Radio, or stream/download the full show, including the podcast extras, on iTunes, SoundCloud and on Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts can be found on iTunes, Soundcloud, and Bloomberg.

The bitcoin exchange, Coin.mx, was linked to an investigation of a data breach at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, revealed in 2014, that exposed more than 83 million accounts. Pastor Trevon Gross, 47, and programmer Yuri Lebedev, 39, were convicted of conspiracy and bribery charges by a jury in Manhattan federal court after a week of deliberations, according to a spokesman for federal prosecutors. Lebedev was also convicted of wire fraud and bank fraud. Eric Creizman, a lawyer for Lebedev, confirmed the verdict and had no immediate comment. Henry Klingeman, who represents Gross, could not immediately be reached. Prosecutors charged that Lebedev helped arrange bribes to Gross, including $150,000 in donations to his church. In exchange, they say, Gross helped the operator of Coin.mx, Anthony Murgio, take over a small credit union Gross ran from his church. Murgio used the credit union to evade scrutiny of banks wary of processing payments involving the virtual currency, prosecutors say. Lebedev was accused of working for Coin.mx through a front called "Collectables Club." Over the course of a four-week trial, lawyers for Lebedev and Gross tried to paint a different picture, saying their clients did not know that Murgio was running an illegal operation and never acted with corrupt intent. The trial followed a probe rooted in the JPMorgan data breach, which lead to charges against nine people. Gross, Lebedev and Murgio were not accused of hacking. But prosecutors said Coin.mx was owned by an Israeli who was behind the breach, Gery Shalon. Prosecutors say Shalon, together with Maryland-born Joshua Samuel Aaron, orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of information from more than 100 million people. Prosecutors said they carried out the hacks to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with promotional emails. Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein have pleaded not guilty. Murgio pleaded guilty to charges related to Coin.mx in January. He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 16.

Subscribe By Ami Albernaz Business credit is much more than a fix for cash flow challenges—it's a strategic tool that successful companies rely on to grow and thrive. The key is recognizing early enough when you need it, leaving time to secure the funds. JPMorgan Chase Using outdated or inefficient technology or equipment can erode your team's productivity and put you at a disadvantage against competitors. To help you better anticipate a future credit need, here are four examples of when securing financing can strengthen a business. 1. Meeting demand is a strain If you're too busy to go after all your sales opportunities or provide existing customers with top-notch service, you may need to expand your capacity. Tapping financing could help you buy extra inventory, hire additional staff, upgrade order-taking technology or take other steps to increase your throughput. You could be gaining new customers while better serving existing ones, leading to a positive feedback loop of strong word-of-mouth. 2. The cash cushion is getting thin The average business owner's cash reserves would over just 27 days of their typical expenses, according to a recent JPMorgan Chase & Co. Institute report. "If a small business has only that much cash, that's a good indicator that they should look for financing," says Larry Conley, Senior Vice President and national specialty finance manager at JPMorgan Chase. An adequate buffer can help you weather downturns, pay unexpected expenses and take advantage of opportunities such as vendor discounts. Conley recommends seeking a line of credit or a business credit card to complement the cash reserve and extend the buffer to at least 90 days. 3. Your credit card or line of credit balances are consistently high Carrying high balances on your business credit accounts may hurt your company's credit rating. For example, if your business has a $100,000 line of credit, and your balance is consistently above $40,000, it may be a sign that you need a long-term financing solution. Taking out a term loan of $40,000 and using the line of credit to cover other expenses that arise could make the debt easier to manage, according to Conley. You would pay off the term loan in predictable, fixed payments over time. Seeking an alternate credit source can also be useful if you're carrying high-interest debt, since it may allow you to pay down the debt at a lower rate. Consider talking with your lender to find an additional credit source to help you better manage your debt. 4. Your business tools can't keep up Using outdated or inefficient technology or equipment can erode your team's productivity and put you at a disadvantage against competitors. If you're experiencing outages, breakdowns or slowing systems performance, consider whether upgrades could improve quality or output. A number of financing options are available for equipment purchases that allow you to reap productivity gains while conserving cash. The efficiency boost from new tools may also offset the cost of buying them. Having a clear purpose for capital and taking a proactive approach to obtaining it can help your business grow and compete. Working with a banker who understands your business can help you find the right financing option for your needs.

Subscribe With a number of major public projects well underway, Detroit's planners and lenders have renewed focus on the role of small business development in the city's ongoing revitalization. Now the next step of putting these lessons to work nationwide is taking shape. The famous urban planning pioneer Jane Jacobs knew well that such comeback stories are built block by block, with diverse and stable communities creating a contagious vitality that could spread street by street, neighbor by neighbor, to form a diverse and thriving city. Vibrant local businesses are these blocks' bedrock. But building these strong communities hinges on local businesses that can help them grow, and that's no easy feat. Difficulty accessing capital, business networks, and understanding of steps required to create a successful business can be daunting to would-be business owners. However, collaborations like Detroit's Entrepreneurs of Color Fund, can address each of these factors on behalf of the burgeoning businesses they serve. JPMorgan Chase With a number of major public projects well underway, Detroit's planners and lenders have renewed focus on the role of small business development in the city's ongoing revitalization. Now the next step of putting these lessons to work nationwide is taking shape. A case study of one such business in Detroit is the House of Pure Vin, a wine store nestled in the thick of downtown. During its first 120 days in operation, the store's three female African-American founders have seen a steady uptick in business. And, like many similar small businesses across the city, their success stems from extensive pre-opening planning and support from outside entities. The support the founders experienced is varied and multifaceted; it's an example of a new small business development system working effectively, and is a model that cities around the US can strive to replicate. Jane Jacobs knew well that comeback stories are built block by block, street by street, neighbor by neighbor, to form a diverse and thriving city. The founders got their start at a retail boot camp offered by Tech Town, Detroit's preeminent business accelerator and incubator. Their boot camp experience helped them qualify for the initial phase of the Detroit Development Fund's (DDF) newly established Entrepreneurs of Color Fund, a $6.5 millionlending program with financial backing from the JPMorgan Chase & Co. foundation and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. But the EOC Fund is just one project backed by the DDF: in its role as a certified community development financial institution (CDFI) the Fund makes loans to countless small businesses and serves as advisor to a wide variety of entrepreneurs. "We felt they needed some assistance in addition to the retail boot camp," DDF President Ray Waters explained. "We sent them to another business partner of ours called Lifeline Business Consulting… for fine tuning the business plan and their projections." There, the team received guidance from seasoned retail veterans in tackling challenges such as the store build out and integrating a point of sale system. DDF helped House of Pure Vin budget as accurately as possible, and when inevitable overages arose, they leveraged their funding network, pulling in another CDFI for an additional investment. The ability of new businesses to kickstart a local economy is anecdotally clear, but is also supported by US jobs data. A recent US Census-guided study found that while first-year businesses account for only 3% of total US employment, they are responsible for 20% of annual hiring activity—startups are more reliable job creators than larger legacy companies that employ more people but hire less frequently. In other words, these entities are crucial for growth and generating new jobs. However, these jobs are rarely created by minority business owners: A recent paper published at University of Michigan points out that minorities have a disproportionately low rate of entrepreneurship, which is another small business challenge that alternative support structures are equipped to address. "One of our goals is to try to bring more African-American owned companies to downtown," Ray Waters, the president of the DDF, explained. "There is a banding together of the local businesses that are close together." The House of Pure Vin founders see this spirit constantly. "We always partner with different entities in order to expand our reach and expand our consumer audience and provide relevancy," one of the founders, Regina Gaines, explained. "This venture has broken barriers, and I can't really put a segment on our customer base." The store does joint promotions with the Woodhouse Day Spa next door; a nearby synagogue places Hebrew wine orders; restaurant Downtown Louie's around the corner allows customers to cork wines at the restaurant; Wright and Company is a post-tasting meal hotspot; and the David Klein Gallery places big orders for openings. This model holds promise for other cities grappling with revitalization efforts. Through alternative funding partnerships, underserved entrepreneurial spirits can blossom into new opportunities across a depressed area. As JPMorgan Chase's $100 million commitment to Detroit progresses, the impact is clear—both in the city itself and in other cities taking notice. "I think there's a conscious effort here that could exist in other cities if certain service providers can partner with alternative lending organizations," Waters said. "There is an access to capital for small business, and particularly minority-owned businesses. The capital's out there, it's about getting access and being loan ready." And soon a lot of small businesses will have ample occasion to position themselves for support. In October 2015, JPMorgan Chase announced a $125 million commitment called Partnerships for Raising Opportunity in Neighborhoods (PRO Neighborhoods). This five-year initiative seeks to replicate the success experienced in Detroit, broadening the company's scope in cities across the country—and recently announced a series of regional collaborations to help develop inclusive neighborhoods in Detroit, Chicago, Atlanta, New York, and Miami. It's an exciting time for community-centric development, and the effects of this approach will soon be enjoyed by residents in a host of cities. A wine store in Detroit is just the beginning; the pairing of smart finance and community support will soon be on the rise in countless growing neighborhoods.

Subscribe By Ami Albernaz Every company is a tech company these days, no matter what business you're in, says Noah Wintroub, Vice Chairman of JPMorgan Chase. And every company is affected by tech innovations. JPMorgan Chase You can run your business from anywhere using mobile tools, cloud services and a bevy of workspace options. As founder of JPMorgan's internet and digital media business, Wintroub is in a position to know— he's also been behind the IPOs of major U.S. tech companies. He's seen up close how the rapid-fire evolution of the web, mobile tech and social media affects how you start, build and run a company. Wintroub cited the following examples to entrepreneurs at a recent Chase for Business conference in New York: File-sharing, messaging and project management software are making employees more productive and responsive. Point-of-sale systems, website analytics and other data sources now offer up rich information about your customers' habits and preferences. Mobile phones let you market to your customers in new ways. "There's never been a better time to start a small business," Wintroub says. Startups can build their companies around new technologies, disrupting established companies and sometimes even industries. At the same time, long-time businesses can find new ways to compete if they're willing to adapt. These tips from Wintroub can help you use technology to your business' advantage. 1. Polish your online presence Get a leg up by continually improving your digital presence. Use your website and social media platforms to showcase your business and your brand. In this on-demand world, would-be customers expect to find your offerings and do business with you at any time. The impression you make online may make or break your chance to earn their business. 2. Open up customer interactions The free flow of information online means "your customer is evolving, and who you're talking to is changing," Wintroub says. You can really expand your pool of potential customers by showcasing products on your website and selling them online. Social media also gives you a way to get your message to more prospects through storytelling and direct promotion. Just be sure you're using it to listen to your customers and prospects, and that you understand who they are and what they want. 3. Rethink your workspace You can run your business from anywhere using mobile tools, cloud services and a bevy of workspace options. So, find the space and setup that work best for you and your business. For example, co-working spaces can let you slash overhead expenses—and maybe even create a built-in community of peer entrepreneurs. Use communications technologies to enable employees to work from home while lowering your real estate costs. 4. Dig into your data The data you harness from website analytics, customer relationship management software and other tools can help you make smarter business decisions, Wintroub says. Use this technology to learn more about your customers, sharpen your sales forecasts and gain other insights that give you an edge on your competitors. Along with the analytics features included in commonly used software and services, explore the free and low-cost tools that are currently available. While using technology to help you grow and improve your business, stay attuned to changes within your industry that could require quick adjustments to your offerings or operations. "Innovation has to be a persistent state," Wintroub says. "If you don't disrupt, someone will do it for you." Learn more about how technology is helping to shape small businesses here.

A selloff in equities is now more likely than not, because investors are now underestimating the chances of disruption when France holds presidential elections that start next month, according to JPMorgan Chase’s Marko Kolanovic. The bank’s global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy in New York says declines of roughly 5 percent for the S&P 500 Index would make shares worth buying. Kolanovic’s call comes fresh on the heels of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which cut its outlook for global stocks this week, and a warning from Allianz Global Investors that equity valuations are becoming stretched. The defeat in this week’s Dutch elections of anti-immigration candidate Geert Wilders is being seen as a blow to populist political leaders, especially France’s Marine Le Pen. Investors should reduce positions in U.S. equities and buy cheaper emerging-market stocks, Kolanovic said in an email to clients Thursday. He also says American stocks will be attractive in the longer term, especially for patient investors ready to wait for a better entry point to buy. “Further complacency may set in in the aftermath of the Dutch elections,” Kolanovic wrote. “There will be an increase of uncertainty related to French elections. Near-term, market weakness is more likely than not.” Futures on the S&P 500 were little changed as of 7:31 a.m. New York time on Friday, with the index on course for a seventh weekly advance in eight. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up The Dutch vote attracted an unusual level of global scrutiny as it comes before France’s presidential election. Far-right candidate Le Pen, who is seeking to take France out of the euro zone and stop immigration, is polling at about 27 percent for the first round on April 23 though she’s projected to lose to independent Emmanuel Macron by more than 20 points in the runoff. Volatility bets for the Euro Stoxx 50 Index slipped this week, trading near their lowest levels since July 2014. The bond market seems to be more concerned. The extra yield investors demand to hold French government debt rather than German notes remains elevated, even if it has declined from the recent peak.

MSNBC's Rachel Maddow host of "The Rachel Maddow Show" was at the center of the political media Tuesday, March 14, 2017, with a story on Trump's tax returns propelled by social media. The White House pushed back even before the release of the documents Tuesday night, saying that publishing the information was illegal. Leaked pages of President Donald Trump’s 2005 tax return offer no new details about his foreign income and business dealings but highlight a tax he’s vowed to abolish. The alternative minimum tax, or AMT, was responsible for 80 percent of Trump’s 2005 federal income tax bill of $38.4 million, on income of $152.7 million. That’s a “startlingly” large proportion, said Alexander Popovich, a wealth adviser at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s private bank. “It’s very strange -- usually, the AMT is not going to cause anywhere near such a difference,” Popovich said. Trump has contravened 40 years of tradition by declining to release his tax returns, so the two pages of his 2005 return, which veteran tax journalist David Cay Johnston presented on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” Tuesday, offer a rare -- but limited -- peek into the president’s finances. Among the items on view: Trump got hit with a tax that in recent years has affected increasing numbers of well-off, but not necessarily wealthy, Americans. The AMT was introduced to taxpayers in 1970 as a way to prevent high-earning households from winnowing down or zeroing out their federal income-tax bills. The tax works by taking away personal and dependent exemptions, as well as various itemized deductions, including those for state and local taxes. Other deductions are capped. It’s triggered by almost two dozen factors, including losses, depreciation, stock options and exemptions for children. State Taxes As inflation boosted incomes, the AMT has captured a larger number of taxpayers -- including roughly 30 percent of households with cash income between $200,000 and $500,000, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based policy group. Higher state and local taxes in states like California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts -- which can’t be deducted under the AMT -- have helped stir complaints about the tax. Trump and House Republicans have both formally called for abolishing it as part of their planned tax overhaul. The tax will raise about $35 billion this year, about 2.2 percent of all individual income tax revenue, according to the Tax Policy Center. “The AMT created this incredibly complicated formula to try to compensate for all of the deductions that are built in on the other side of the tax piece,” Senator James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said Wednesday. Democrats are wary of scrapping it. “I’m an advocate of the AMT,” New York Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said. It’s unclear what caused Trump to have to pay the AMT. The large bill “raises more questions than it answers,” said Leonard Burman, co-founder of the Tax Policy Center. “For the vast majority of people, the AMT is only a portion of their tax liability -- just a supplement to their regular taxes.” Trump’s Documents The leaked documents show that Trump and his wife, Melania, paid $5.3 million in federal income tax and more than $31 million in AMT. The combined $38.4 million tax bill gave the Trumps a federal tax rate of about 25 percent. It’s not clear that absent the AMT, they would have paid only a 3.5 percent rate, because of differences in the way deductions are treated by the AMT and regular income tax. It’s unusual that the Trumps were caught by a tax that predominantly hits earners in the $400,000 to $1.2 million gross income range, said Popovich of JPMorgan Chase. Far wealthier taxpayers can typically avoid its effects because capital gains income -- a mainstay for the top 0.1 percent -- largely escapes the AMT. Chuck Collins, a scholar at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, said he assumed that a reported loss of $103 million on Trump’s 2005 return, combined with depreciation for real estate, “probably” triggered the alternative levy. “The AMT tends to catch people who have paper losses,” he said. Depreciation Cited In a statement released Tuesday night before the MSNBC broadcast, the White House cited a “large-scale depreciation for construction,” but didn’t elaborate. Burman said the loss may have been carried over from 1995, when Trump reported a $916 million loss on his New York state tax return, according to documents that were leaked to the New York Times last October. Taxpayers are allowed to “carry forward” losses that they can’t fully use in a given year because they don’t have enough taxable income. Bloomberg reported in October that the $916 million loss probably stemmed from Trump’s use of a now-banished tax provision that allowed investors to turn canceled debt into personal losses for the purposes of reducing their federal tax bills.  “Whoever leaked the two pages didn’t release the supporting schedules to the return, which would show how and why the AMT was triggered,” Burman said. “There could be things on the full tax return that might tell us something about the nature and structure of his businesses and income that triggered the tax.” Prior Year However, the two pages from 2005 may well provide a clue about something else: Trump’s federal tax bill for 2004. The document lists estimated tax payments of $13,291,993 that Trump made in 2005 -- and under federal rules in place at the time, those payments had to total 110 percent of his 2004 tax liability. That means Trump probably had a federal tax liability of roughly $12.1 million in 2004, according to Matthew Morris, a tax attorney at law firm Bowditch & Dewey LLP, who reviewed the 2005 document and made the calculations. It’s also possible that the estimated tax payments were overpayments, but that seems unlikely, Morris said. --With assistance from Sahil Kapur To contact the reporter on this story: Lynnley Browning in New York at lbrowning4@bloomberg.net.

The results from its client survey conducted on the opening day of the conference show big time investors are still bullish on equity markets but view the upcoming European elections and the unpredictable presidency of Donald Trump as major market risks. Together those two risks account for about 80% of responses.  The three major European elections are in The Netherlands (March 15), France (first round on April 23), and Germany (September 24). Much of the focus was on French election fears surrounding far right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen. While only 22% of investors think that Le Pen will win, it's important to remember that investors also did not expect Donald Trump to win the US election or for the UK to vote to leave the European Union. JPMorgan notes, rising populism and nationalism have investors on edge (emphasis ours): Recent electoral outcomes have centered around fears about the economic future, and voter demographics supporting the nationalist movements have been similar for the Brexit vote, U.S. and French elections, with noncollege-educated segments of the population favoring nationalist candidates. The classical divide between the right and left is now less relevant. The big divide is on globalization, between the winners and losers. Additionally, investors "overwhelmingly" prefer stocks over bonds and in particular, developing market equities, followed by emerging market equities, which investors feel have more room to run than domestic stocks.  On global growth:  "Expectations for higher growth remain muted with only 17% indicating that the global economy could grow by more than 3%, compared with 34% indicating 2.75% to 3.0% growth, 27% indicating 2.5% to 2.75% growth and 19% indicating 2.25 to 2.5% growth." On the domestic front: "45% of those surveyed expect the S&P 500 to end the year at 2,500 or higher, while 38% expect the S&P 500 to end the year in the current 2,300 to 2,500 range. Only 17% expect a U.S. equity market correction and only 7% believe that the correction would be significantly below 2,100."

So too are large regional banks such as US Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. as well as investment banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Think a little smaller, though, and growth-focused lenders with value potential do exist -- like Western Alliance Bancorp. The Phoenix-based bank already surged 34 percent since Nov. 8 in the post-election rally, and analysts reckon it could gain another 12 percent over the next year. There are plenty of reasons for their optimism. With some $17 billion in assets, Western Alliance operates in Arizona, California and Nevada -- specifically in areas with population growth and household income that's slated to be higher than the national average: The bank's focus on providing commercial loans to industries such as hospitality, non-profits, life sciences, health care and technology is paying off. Loan growth was 18.6 percent in 2016 and roughly 20 percent on a compounded annual basis since 2005. It's also particularly sensitive to rising rates: a 100 basis-point increase (we're currently half the way there) is expected to bump its net interest income roughly 6 percent higher.  There's another way Western Alliance can grow: The bank is primed to make an acquisition, in part because it hasn't been spending capital on dividends or share buybacks. Its rich valuation -- at a price-to-tangible-book-value multiple of 3.4 -- gives it one of the strongest currencies with which to pounce.  Rivals with footprints in California, Colorado or the Pacific Northwest make geographic sense. But Western Alliance Bancorp should only settle for targets that add to both earnings and profitability, according to Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP's Brad Milsaps. As it is, few banks can match Western Alliance's 2016 performance: return on tangible common equity of 18 percent, return on equity of 15 percent and return on assets of 1.6 percent.  Potential targets include CU Bancorp Inc., Heritage Commerce Corp. and CoBiz Financial Inc., and it would be a "coup" for Western Alliance to snap up any of these "marquee" lenders, Sandler O'Neill & Partners' Tim O'Brien told Gadfly. Purchases of larger banks like CVB Financial Corp. and Westamerica Bancorporation may also be a fit.  An order published Thursday by the Federal Reserve is set to make regional-bank dealmaking more appealing. The Fed said that acquisitions of less than $10 billion of assets or transactions that create lenders with less than $100 billion in assets do "not raise material financial stability concerns." That's an increase from $2 billion and $25 billion, respectively, and gives lenders scope to make bigger transaction without raising regulatory red flags.  Potential buyers should still be aware of the $50 billion threshold that classifies a bank as a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI. That can only be tweaked by Congress. Even with any near-term purchase, Western Alliance has a long runway before it bumps up against that limit. And without a deal? It's compelling, too.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. Gillian Tan is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering deals and private equity.

(Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg News) March 17 TECHNOLOGY Google to change ad policies after backlash Google announced Friday that it will change its advertising policies after several British brands pulled ads from the platform because they appeared alongside offensive content, such as videos promoting terrorism or anti-Semitism. Google said in a blog post that it would give advertisers more control over where their ads appear on both YouTube, the video-sharing service it owns, and the Google Display Network, which posts advertising to third-party websites and against search engine results. The announcement came after the U.K. government and the Guardian newspaper stepped up pressure on YouTube to police content on its platform, pulling ads from the video site because they appeared beside clips seen as inappropriate. A Times of London investigation revealed ads from many large companies and the U.K. government appeared alongside content from the likes of white nationalist David Duke. Ronan Harris, Google’s U.K. managing director, said in the blog post that the company will review its policies and would be making changes “in the coming weeks” to help customers stop their ads from appearing on objectionable websites or against offensive videos. — Bloomberg News CURRENCY U.S. convicts 2 in bitcoin scheme A New Jersey pastor and a Florida software engineer were convicted Friday of scheming to help an illegal bitcoin exchange keep banks and regulators from looking into its activities. The bitcoin exchange, Coin.mx, was linked to a probe of a data breach at JPMorgan Chase revealed in 2014 that exposed more than 83 million accounts. A jury convicted pastor Trevon Gross, 47, and programmer Yuri Lebedev, 39, of conspiracy and bribery charges in Manhattan federal court, a spokesman for federal prosecutors said. Lebedev was also convicted of wire fraud and bank fraud. Prosecutors charged that Lebedev helped arrange bribes to Gross, including $150,000 in donations to his church. In exchange, they say, Gross helped the operator of Coin.mx, Anthony Murgio, take over a credit union Gross ran from his church. Murgio used the credit union to evade scrutiny of banks wary of processing bitcoin payments, prosecutors say. They say Coin.mx was owned by an Israeli who was behind the JPMorgan data breach. — Reuters Also in Business ● President Trump’s top economic adviser plans to sell his stake in the world’s largest bank by assets to comply with federal ethics laws and reduce conflicts of interest. Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, owns almost 23.4 million shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, according to a disclosure report. The stake is valued at more than $15 million. The filings also show that Cohn plans to divest more than $216 million in Goldman Sachs stock, 18 other publicly traded shares, and investments in eight company-managed funds. ● IBM plans to hire 2,000 U.S. veterans over the next four years as part of a broader expansion plan. The company said in December that it hopes to hire 25,000 people over the next four years, partly for what it calls “new collar jobs” where a four-year degree isn’t necessarily required. IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., has also expanded a program to train vets in software used in the defense and law enforcement industries. ● Players won’t see the thimble, wheelbarrow or boot anymore when they buy a new Monopoly game. Those classic tokens are swapping out for a penguin, T-Rex and rubber ducky, toymaker Hasbro said Friday. The move is part of a campaign to update the board game based in part on votes by consumers during a promotional period earlier this year. The updated version of the game will be released in August, Hasbro said. Four classic pieces survived the voting: the dog, car, top hat and battleship. A cat token was added to the game in 2013 to replace the flatiron. ● Two Walt Disney subsidiaries in Florida will pay $3.8 million in back wages to comply with federal law, the Labor Department said Friday. The wages will be paid to 16,339 employees at Disney Vacation Club Management and Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S. after officials found violations regarding minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping, the agency said. “The Department of Labor has identified a group of cast members who may have performed work outside of their scheduled shift, and we will be providing a one-time payment to resolve this,” a Walt Disney spokeswoman said. — From news services business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

President Donald Trump's plans to to ease banking regulation is raising eyebrows in Europe. Trump has asked the U.S. Treasury Department to submit a report on possible changes to Dodd-Frank – the set of rules established in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to clamp down on banks risk-taking. Other banking rules, including the Basel III international framework seem to be on hold since the new administration came in. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said Friday that G-20 countries should not fall into "reform fatigue". Carney, who is also Chair of the global financial industry watchdog the Financial Stability Board, wrote in a letter sent by the FSB to the G-20 finance ministers that "a decade after the start of the crisis, an element of reform fatigue is understandable. "But giving into it would mean that essential standards are neither completed nor fully implemented." A European official working in banking regulation, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitive state of legislation, told CNBC that the world was close to finishing the Basel III regulation last January, until the new administration arrived in the U.S. and delayed the expected conclusion of the process. The U.S. needs to appoint a new Federal Reserve official for banking supervision, which is expected to happen only next month. Until then, the Basel III committee is not aware of the official position from the U.S. show chapters What is Dodd-Frank?    Thursday, 16 Mar 2017 | 11:13 AM ET | 04:18 President Trump has said that banking regulation does not allow lending to the economy to take place. Without the U.S.'s approval for Basel III, it is unlikely that Europe will accept the rules. The aim of the regulation is to ensure a level playing field for banks independently of their geographic operations. Shortly after the election of Donald Trump, Daniele Nouy, the European Central Bank's chief for supervision, stressed that "Basel III should be finalized." "How can banks plan for the future when they do not know what rules they will have to comply with? Regulators must therefore provide regulatory certainty," she said in mid-November. An international economic official, who also asked to remain anonymous, told CNBC that the rollback in financial regulation was a "concern" and that it is a "real danger." "People have short memories and seem to have forgotten how bad things got (during the crisis,)" the European banking official said. Meanwhile The German finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, said Friday that the world's top economies are not concerned that regulations would be rolled back. These are needed to ensure stability and cancelling them could lead to a new financial crisis, Reuters reported. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

(TSLA) and Snap Inc (SNAP) Get in Early on Bank of America Corp (BAC) Earnings View All Posts When it comes to the red-hot financial sectors, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) is at the top of nearly every analyst’s list. And for good reason. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr While global banking giants like Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) are also benefiting considerably from the new higher-rates/lower-regulations environment of the Trump administration, BofA has a considerable edge when it comes to stateside investing. As such, BAC stock is the place to be when it comes to banking on the financial sector. And we’ll get a peek at just how well Bank of America is performing in a just under a month when the company steps into the earnings confessional. Bank of America has yet to set an official earnings release date for its first-quarter report, but estimates put the date near April 14. What to Expect From BAC Stock Earnings Currently, Wall Street is expecting strong growth from Bank of America, with earnings seen rising 25% from 28 cents per share last year to 35 cents per share in the current quarter. Revenue, meanwhile, is expected to rise 9.4% year-over-year to $21.58 billion. Expectations are understandably high for BAC stock, given the hype surrounding the Fed’s interest rate hikes and Trump’s “America First” policies. This enthusiasm is solidly reflected in Wall Street’s take on BAC stock. For instance, according to Thomson/First Call data, 26 of the 33 analysts following BAC rate the shares a “buy” or better, with nary a “sell” rating to be found. There is room for improvement, however, as the 12-month price target of $24.94 represents a discount to BAC stock’s close on Thursday. Earnings-driven price-target increases could be just what BofA needs to extend its current rally. Click to Enlarge In the options pits, BAC stock options traders remain optimistic on the equity’s prospects. Currently, the April put/call open interest ratio checks in at 0.51, with calls nearly doubling puts among those options potentially most affected by Bank of America’s quarterly report. Overall, April implieds are pricing in a potential post-earnings move of about 5.4% for BAC stock. This places the upper bound at $26.59, while the lower bound lies at $23.85. Technically, BAC stock is trading in territory not seen since early 2008, but resistance could emerge near $26 as the shares move higher. On the downside, support should hold firm near $24.50, with a potential short-term floor near $23.50 following a possible sell-on-the-news profit-taking event.

Subscribe By Lauren Coulston Nick Cannon, the multitasking, multi-faceted film star, comedian, TV and radio host, musician, writer, director, executive producer, and philanthropist, is also a successful entrepreneur. Cannon, who founded Ncredible Entertainment in 2009, recently hosted the first Chase for Business Conference series across the country. "Nick's the kind of person who helps us innovate and grow by sharing his own fascinating experiences as a marketer and business owner," JPMorgan Chase Chief Marketing Officer, Kristin Lemkau, says. We had a chance to talk with Cannon about what he has learned from his entrepreneurial experiences: JPMorgan Chase Nick Cannon, the multitasking, multi-faceted film star, comedian, TV and radio host, musician, writer, director, executive producer, and philanthropist, is also a successful entrepreneur. Chase: You're a self-proclaimed "entrepretainer." How did you come to coin the word? Cannon: It started off as a joke, but I'm an even mix of entertainer and entrepreneur. It's how I approach everything: 50 percent creative and 50 percent business, with the same passion on both sides. Chase: Tell us about starting your own multimedia company, Ncredible Entertainment. Cannon: In 2009 I was doing separate projects and wanted to bring everything together in what we call 360 branding. I was looking to create a one-stop shop to sign artists and [intellectual property], do marketing, PR and development, and grow on all levels from entertainment to consumer marketing. Chase: What are some lessons learned from starting your own company? Cannon: So many lessons learned! More than anything, I learned perseverance and integrity. What ever is thrown at you, you have to keep pushing through. As I like to say, hurdles are made to jump over. In terms of integrity, you have to stand for something. Make sure your company or brand stands for something that people can trust in. Chase: What advice would you give to an entrepreneur starting out? Cannon: Use other people's money! No I'm serious, I wish I hadn't invested so much of my own money initially, but you need to take risks if you believe in yourself. Also, be creative, so that you can be a self-generator. Generate your own publicity, generate your own concepts. Anything you can create on your own is always beneficial. Chase: What is the most challenging part of being an entrepreneur? Cannon: The risk factor. It's the most exciting, but it's also the most challenging, because the entrepreneurial spirit is about stepping out where no one else has. It is extremely risky, but with great risk comes great reward. Chase: What role does philanthropy play in your business ventures? Cannon: I always look for things that resonate with my spirit and think it's important to give back. Lupus, kidney disease, homelessness and financial literacy are all causes that I have personally experienced and are organic to who I am, so they fit. Chase: What innovation inspires you? Cannon: The quick access to large amounts of information and the power of social media. How quickly a message can move around the world is truly inspiring. One person can have an idea, and it can become a global movement by the end of the day. It's amazing! Chase: You created the hashtag #DemBabies for your twins Roc & Roe and have a huge social media presence. How do you use social media for your businesses? Cannon: Social media is the true grass roots movement. The conversation has to start there, no matter your product. And you have to be authentic. Trying to be viral never works. Chase: How do you balance the demands of your various endeavors? Cannon: Time management and having a team that can support and help me. Chase: Finally, let's close it out with the lightning round. Favorite small business? Cannon: Aerospace boxing gym [a fitness center in New York City]. Chase: Who's your role model? Cannon: My grandmother. Chase: Best thing about starting your own business? Cannon: Being your own boss! Chase: What do you do to relax? Cannon: Sleep. And write. Lauren Coulston is Vice President of Content Solutions in the Brand Marketing Group at JPMorgan Chase.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe By Jason Fell What's the key to entrepreneurial success? The answer depends on whom you ask. Some will say you need a great idea. Others will say financing is most critical. Others still will tout the benefits of building and working with a strong team. JPMorgan Chase The one thing almost everyone agrees successful business owners must have is passion. They're all right. And, yet, the one thing almost everyone agrees successful business owners must have is passion. Take it from Sarabeth Levine. In the late 1970s, Levine was an insurance salesperson who wasn't particularly fond of or interested in the work. It paid the bills and put food on the table. Up until then, Levine had worked a string of professions—house cleaner, waitress, oral surgeon assistant—but none ever gave her much satisfaction. It was around that time she told her mother, Dore Blume, that she "felt like a nobody," Levine recalled during a panel discussion at the recent Chase for Business Conference in New York City. "She told me, 'You are a somebody, you just haven't found her yet,'" Levine said. Levine's perspective changed in 1981 when she and her husband, Bill, opened a small bakery-kitchen in Manhattan called Sarabeth's. Levine had a passion for making homemade orange-apricot marmalade, among other baked goods and specialty foods. Levine was hungry for something substantial that would spark her interests and desires. With Sarabeth's, Levine found herself, she said. She found her passion. It's that passion, as well as the popularity of her "magic marmalade," that made Sarabeth's into the thriving operation it is today, Levine said. In 1996, Levine was honored with the prestigious James Beard Award for Pastry Chef of the Year and since then, the company has been focused on expansion. Sarabeth's consists of 16 restaurants, with three more opening soon, including one in Dubai. The company also owns a 15,000 square foot factory in the Bronx where the marmalade is jarred, and her spreads are sold in department stores and specialty shops throughout the U.S., the Caribbean, Canada, Japan and South Korea. By loving what she does, Levine in turn makes others happy. After all, pleasing people is at the core of a succesful hospitality business. "I have a path," Levine said. "I have to love what I'm doing. If I don't love it, then it becomes work." JPMorgan Chase "I have a path," Levine said. "I have to love what I'm doing. If I don't love it, then it becomes work." Levine also recommends: Hire people who share your passion. Even though Levine already was an accomplished home baker, she hired "very talented" bakers to help her grow the business. "The more I learned about people, I learned how to get the best out of my employees," she said. "The payback, for me, is to see the quality of our bakers and our chefs and how they care." Always be consistent. "You're only as good as the last meal that you send out," Levine said. If the quality of your works slips, you're bound to hear it from your customers --and they won't be happy. "If I give one bad meal, or one bad croissant I'll hear about it," she said. Danielle Duboise and Whitney Tingle have a similar story, which they also shared during the panel discussion. In 2012, the pair co-founded New York City-based Sakara Life, an organic meal delivery and healthy living company that helps clients achieve health and a sense of well-being. Before launching Sakara Life, Tingle worked in finance but long hours, stress and poor eating habits began to take their toll on her body and her spirit, she said. Similarly, Duboise's pursuit of an acting career left her feeling stressed and unhappy about food. Tingle and Duboise wondered if food could actually be at the heart of a happy and healthy life. So they started Sakara Life with a "mission to make as many people as possible know that food is medicine," Duboise said. As their website reads, "We believe that what you put into your body forms the building blocks for the rest of your life and affects your relationships, career, happiness, and ability to create." What started with Tingle and Duboise cooking food in their kitchen in Manhattan and delivering it by bicycle quickly generated a following, including celebrities. Soon, they were delivering their healthy foods in Boston, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Miami. All the while, it was their passion for healthy eating that fueled their growth. Earlier this year, Sakara Life announced a $4.8 million funding round and that it was expanding its delivery service nationally. "You're all in when you decide to become an entrepreneur," Tingle said. "Making decisions that either grow or hurt your business, it requires all of your passion and ultimate focus, 24/7." Here are two more lessons they shared: Don't wait for the perfect time to start. "If we would have waited until we had all the answers…everything perfectly in place and all the knowledge at that point, then we would have never started," Tingle said. "We started just by getting going, by making the food the best way we knew how even though we're not chefs." Capitalize on organic marketing. It wasn't long after starting up that their customer base began to grow client by client thanks to the power of word-of-mouth. "When you're creating a product that changes people's lives, they want to tell their friends," Tingle said. Jason Fell is a Chase News contributor.

Subscribe Janet Berry-Johnson Neva Peterson founded a bookkeeping and consulting business in Las Vegas five years ago, mainly on a shoestring budget, working alone from a home office. Before the first year ended, she'd grown Neva Knows Business enough to sublet office space, and hire a part-time employee. That employee worked more hours as Peterson brought in additional clients. Soon, it was time to hire again. Business was flourishing, but there were occasional cash shortages when Peterson needed to make payroll. JPMorgan Chase “Small-business loans are so hard to get," Peterson says. "It's practically like donating an organ, you have to jump through so many hoops. And, meanwhile, the clock is ticking." “When I increased my staff by just one person, it did create a cash crunch until I could get that person trained and bring on additional clients," Peterson says, noting that only then could she bill more hours. "Maybe it wasn't the best thing to do, but I took a cash advance from my credit card to cover payroll." Such advances typically come with very high interest rates. Fortunately, Peterson was able to pay herself back quickly. A new report from the JPMorgan Chase Institute shows Peterson is hardly the only small-business owner to struggle with cash flow. Analyzing data from nearly 600,000 small businesses across the US whose owners hold Chase Business Banking deposit accounts, the report found that only half maintain a cash buffer large enough to support 27 days of typical cash outflows. In the report, cash buffer days are the number of days of cash outflows a business could pay from its cash balance were its inflows to stop. The Institute estimated cash buffer days for a business by computing the ratio of its average daily cash balance to its average daily cash outflows. Cash balances held by a business provide a cushion to absorb unexpected shortfalls in revenue or increases in expenses. Those unforeseen events could range from a client who doesn't pay to a vital piece of machinery breaking down. Yet, about one-quarter of small businesses maintain a cash buffer of just 13 days or fewer, making them particularly vulnerable to cash flow crises. And while many small business owners may be able to use credit or other resources to provide some protection, most have limited access to financing. That was certainly true for Peterson when she tapped her credit card in order to meet her payroll obligations. “Small-business loans are so hard to get," Peterson says. "It's practically like donating an organ, you have to jump through so many hoops. And, meanwhile, the clock is ticking." The median cash balance held by all small businesses is $12,100, but these vary substantially across industries. Personal service companies, such as salons and dry cleaners, tend to hold the lowest average daily cash balances, at just $5,300. High-tech manufacturing held the largest, at $34,200. Median inflows and outflows across all small businesses averaged just $380 per day (approximately $140,000 per year), indicating that the typical small business can provide few full-time incomes, for owners or employees, after covering other expenses. Only this year has Peterson consistently been able to pay herself a salary, partly because she has always believed in paying her employees first. "I know that goes against the school of thought that says you should always pay yourself first," Peterson says. But she invests heavily in the people that work for her. “When I started hiring people, I would try to find the best person for the least amount of money. But then I would train them, and they would leave to make more money elsewhere," she says. "I've learned that I'm better off paying more than I think I can afford for a good person. They get off the ground faster, can bill more, and pay for themselves in the long run." Peterson also believes that in her business it's important that clients see her being a good steward of her money. “Dimes truly do make dollars," she says. So she maintains a very strict budget for office supplies, right down to paperclips and reams of paper, and purchases office furniture secondhand. Peterson knows—from personal experience and from working with plenty of small-business owners—that struggling to manage cash flow and control expenses is not uncommon. SCORE, a non-profit organization that helps small businesses, recommends maintaining cash reserves equaling three to six months of expenses; only a quarter of small businesses hold more than 62 cash buffer days. Restaurants maintain the least, with a median of 16 cash buffer days. Real estate companies maintain the most, averaging 47 days. Other professional services, such as Peterson's company, maintain an average of 33 cash buffer days. Peterson says she's doing a little better than the average for her industry. She maintains about six weeks of cash reserves and feels comfortable there, since she has a solid client roster that pays her on time. When asked about the three to six months of expenses benchmark, Peterson laughed. “Three months would be heaven," she says. "I would go on a cruise if I have that much money in the bank."

Subscribe By Selina Wagowski Three years ago, Daniel Trujillo's company, Tortilleria La Ranchera, was scrambling to meet his customers' demand for tortillas. He already had a 22,000-square-foot warehouse, but he needed more space. "People needed tortillas, and we didn't know where to shelve them," Trujillo says." iStock "A lot of these businesses are stagnating because they haven't sought capital. You give them access to capital, and that unleashes economic growth." -Anthony Chan, JP Morgan Chase Chief Economist When he started La Ranchera in 1994, Trujillo had put together the money himself, but now, the business had grown beyond self-financing. It's the second-largest tortilla maker in Houston, Texas, America's fourth-largest city, with a Hispanic population that accounts for 44 percent of its 2.3 million people. Trujillo had never applied for bank financing before. At first, he was overwhelmed by the amount of paperwork lenders required before they would even discuss a loan with him. Then he met Nancy Alvidrez at Chase, who helped him cut through the clutter and secure a loan backed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). In January, La Ranchera opened a new 88,000-square-foot facility in a former Home Depot store. For small business owners looking to finance their growth, establishing the proper relationship with a local banker is a critical first step, Alvidrez says. Good bankers do more than lend money. They also can offer advice and insight. "Don't be afraid. Go ask," Alvidrez told small business owners at a recent Chase for Business: Connecting Minds program in Houston. Trujillo's apprehension about dealing with banks is common among small business owners, especially in the Hispanic community. "Many Hispanics came from countries where the banking system failed," says Nely Galán, media entrepreneur and former Telemundo network president. “They're nervous." Despite Houston's large Hispanic population, only 7 percent of the 1,725 SBA loans in the city last year went to Hispanic-owned businesses, says Tim Jeffcoat, SBA's Houston director. By contrast, Asian-Americans account for about 6 percent of Houston's population, yet they obtain 35 percent of the SBA loans. For Hispanic businesses to grow, they need to take advantage of the financial resources that are available. "A lot of these businesses are stagnating because they haven't sought capital," says JPMorgan Chase Chief Economist Anthony Chan. "You give them access to capital and that unleashes economic growth." Small business owners may not understand how the SBA relationship works—they worry that the government could take over their business if they default on an SBA loan. "We don't actually lend the money," Jeffcoat explains. It provides guarantees so that conventional banks such as Chase can make the loans at an affordable rate. In addition to loans, the SBA guarantees surety bonds for contractors, offers a venture capital program, and resources designed to help small businesses obtain financing. For example, the Small Business Development Council, an SBA affiliate, offers mentoring programs and advisory services to help business owners craft their loan applications. Having the proper tools and understanding of the process can help business owners find a banker that will work with them. "Your personal banker is always the best place to begin," says Mitchell Williams, vice president for special finance with Chase and a panelist at the event. "They know you and your business." Mitchell specializes in SBA lending at Chase, and his department handles about three SBA loans a week, averaging $300,000 each. For businesses that don't qualify for SBA loans—perhaps the business owners have no credit, for example—alternative lenders may still be able to help them find capital. San Antonio, Texas-based LiftFund makes business loans for as little as $500 and up to $500,000 to business owners who need to build credit. "Business owners come to us when, for whatever reason, they can't secure an SBA loan," says Richard Gianni, LiftFund's regional president. For 20 years, LiftFund has made loans to business owners with credit scores as low as 590, he says. If a credit score falls below that threshold, LiftFund has programs to help rebuild their credit and begin the process of gaining access to capital. Despite their clients' lack of credit, default rates are low. Fewer than 4 percent, on average, of LiftFund's borrowers are unable to repay their loans, Gianni says. However, he stresses that LiftFund and other microlenders are not a replacement for banks. Quite the contrary, they provide short-term financing so that business owners can move on to more conventional borrowing. "Our goal is to get every one of our clients back to their banker," Gianni says. "Business owners who avoid traditional finance will impede their own growth." At La Ranchera, growth continues to explode. Even with the new facility, Trujillo says the company is working around the clock to meet tortilla demand. "I don't know how we're going to keep up," he says. "I might have to ask for another loan." If he does, he says he takes confidence in knowing he has the right relationship in place with Alvidrez and her team at Chase. "I can call upon them whenever I have a question," he says. "It's empowering." Selina Wagowski is a Chase News contributor.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Trump meets Merkel By Ben White and Mary Lee 03/17/17 08:00 AM EDT TRUMP MEETS MERKEL — Could be some awkward moments between President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday what with accusations from the administration that Germany manipulates its currency to get an unfair trade advantage. Of course Germany doesn’t actually have its own currency (it uses the euro) but that hasn’t stopped the finger pointing. Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro recently accused Germany of essentially controlling the euro, calling it a stealth Deutsche Mark. So one hopes Trump will be asked during the joint presser if he stands behind those comments and whether he raised the issue during private talks. And if he does stand by it, Merkel is likely to push back rather hard. Could be popcorn worthy. Story Continued Below EVEN TRUMP’S CABINET NOT EXACTLY ON BOARD WITH BUDGET — Here’s a recent Tweet from Energy Secretary Rick Perry: “Innovators like the ones supported by our @ARPAE program are key to advancing America's energy economy.” Here’s the amount of money President Donald Trump’s budget allocated for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E): $0.00. Oops. Here’s what a top level DC GOP operative had to say about this: “Last week Secretary Perry is praising the ARPA-E program. Today it's zeroed out in the budget. This is the kind of thing that makes you think it's Keystone Kops over in the Trump Administration. “Or they just believe the President's budget is for show and doesn't really mean anything. Neither is good. I don't think they realize that secretaries are actually going to have to trudge up to the Hill and defend this stuff. CONGRESS KINDA HATES IT — POLITICO’s John Bresnahan, Sarah Ferris, and Jennifer Scholtes: “Trump’s budget proposal got a rough reception Thursday on Capitol Hill. ‘Not our starting point.’ ‘Not something that will fly around here politically.’ ‘Congress will do its own budget.’ And that’s just the Republicans. … “Democrats, as expected, blasted the 64-page proposal … as radical and cruel, especially for its cuts to programs that support the poor. Yet it’s clear that the Trump budget would gut programs favored by Republicans as well. And key GOP lawmakers in both the House and Senate are already signaling they won’t move forward with Trump’s proposal.” MAYBE NOT WHERE YOU WANNA BE? — OMB Director Mick Mulvaney “launched into lengthy criticism of after-school programs for children and ‘Meals on Wheels’ food service for the elderly and homebound” not to mention tens of thousands of veterans. Read more. SIX SURPRISES in the budget via POLITICO’s Danny Vinik including one that may be linked to Trump’s obsession with the Ebola virus. Read more. TREASURY WOULD TAKE A HIT — POLITICO’s Victoria Guida: “Trump's budget would slash the Treasury Department's funding by 4.1 percent, or $519 million, including elimination of grants from the $210 million Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. “The budget ‘empowers the Treasury Secretary, as chairperson of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, to end taxpayer bailouts and foster economic growth by advancing financial regulatory reforms … The biggest cut comes from a $239 million reduction in funding for the Internal Revenue Service” Read more. GOLDMAN’S TRUMP PROBLEM — NYT’s Kate Kelly: “[T]he Trump connection may actually be more of a liability … That’s because of differences over both style and substance, as well as the constant scrutiny a company naturally falls under when five of its former executives are named to prominent government positions. … If there is a mind meld between Goldman and the Trump administration, it has been fractured at times. “Some of the White House’s early policies, including the Jan. 27 travel and immigration ban and moves to roll back lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, have sat poorly with senior Goldman executives … And being intimately linked to a president whose incoming approval ratings were at a historic low may not burnish the firm’s image as ties to past administrations did” Read more. You will recall that MM wrote of this very issue back in February. The idea that Government Sachs is pure gold for Goldman just isn’t right. Read more. GOOD FRIDAY MORNING — Happy St. Patrick’s Day everyone! Have a lovely weekend. Email me on bwhite@politico.com and follow me on Twitter @morningmoneyben. Email Mary Lee on mlee@politico.com and follow her on Twitter @maryjylee. THIS MORNING ON POLITICO PRO FINANCIAL SERVICES — Zachary Warmbrodt on insurers lobbying Treasury — and to get Morning Money every day before 6 a.m. — please contact Pro Services at (703) 341-4600 info@politicopro.com DRIVING THE DAY — President Trump meets with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House and participates in a roundtable on vocational training followed by a joint press conference at 1:30 p.m. … In the evening Trump heads for Mar-a-lago, sans Merkel … AEI at 9:00 a.m. holds a forum on economic opportunity … Industrial production at 9:15 a.m. expected to rise 0.2 percent … Univ. of Michigan consumer sentiment at 10:00 a.m. expected to rise to 97.0 from 96.3 … Index of Leading Indicators at 10:00 a.m. expected to rise 0.5 percent. ALLISON ON BANK REGS — POLITICO’s Victoria Guida: “Former BB&T CEO John Allison says he supports a House Republican plan to exempt banks from certain regulations if they raise more capital, but he wants even higher capital requirements. “Speaking to POLITICO today after testifying before the House Financial Services Committee, Allison said he would like to see a leverage ratio of 15 percent, compared to Rep. Jeb Hensarling's proposal of 10 percent” Read more. COHN TO SELL CHINA BANK STAKE — NYT’s Kate Kelly and Steve Eder: “The White House economic adviser Gary D. Cohn is selling a significant holding in the world’s largest bank — which happens to be in China — as he clears potential conflicts of interest to serve in his new role. “The stock that Mr. Cohn is selling is in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which with nearly $3.5 trillion in assets is the biggest on the planet, and it would be valued at about $16 million based on Thursday’s trading” Read more. ** A message from the American Bankers Association: Bankers from across the country are in Washington, D.C., this week to tell Congress how it can help America’s banks deliver jobs and growth in their communities. Watch Rob Nichols, president and CEO, American Bankers Association, live from ABA’s Government Relations Summit Tuesday at 9:55 am ET. www.aba.com/SummitLive ** MNUCHIN ON THE E.U. — POLITICO’s Janosch Delcker: “Trump’s administration plans to hold trade talks with the European Union as well as the bloc’s individual member countries, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. ‘It’s complicated, and the answer is both,’ he said Thursday during a joint press conference with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble … “The Trump administration has accused Berlin of currency manipulation to secure trade advantages — even though Germany uses the euro and doesn’t set its own monetary policy. The visit to the German capital is Mnuchin’s first trip abroad since the former Goldman Sachs banker was sworn into office in mid-February” MORE ON THE BUDGET — AP’s Andrew Taylor reports: “President Donald Trump's new $1.15 trillion budget would reshape America's government with the broad, conservative strokes he promised as a candidate, ordering generous increases for the military, slashing domestic programs and riling both fellow Republicans and Democrats by going after favored programs. “The president's initial budget proposal, submitted to Congress on Thursday, would boost defense spending by $54 billion, the largest increase since Ronald Reagan's military buildup of the 1980s. That means deep cuts elsewhere - the environment, agriculture, the arts - but Trump said that's imperative to take on the Islamic State group and others in a dangerous world.” Read more. GOLDMAN ON BUYING BINGE — WSJ’s Liz Hoffman and Serena Ng: “In a strange reverberation of the housing crisis, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has become a voracious buyer of soured mortgages, trying to make money even as it looks to fulfill terms of a government settlement that calls for it to help struggling homeowners. “Over the past year-and-a-half, the Wall Street giant has become the largest buyer of severely delinquent home loans from mortgage giant Fannie Mae. The firm has acquired nearly two-thirds of $9.6 billion in loans the agency has auctioned, representing unpaid loan balances of $5.7 billion, a Wall Street Journal review of government records shows.” Read more. WELLS FARGO BOSSES GET BIG MONE — NYT’s Stacy Cowley reports: “Wells Fargo and its leaders have expressed much contrition about the bank’s misdeeds, which included setting up as many as 2 million bank accounts without customers’ consent. Top executives have surrendered more than $90 million in compensation, fired employees at all levels and vowed to clean house. “But the top executives — particularly the current chief executive and his predecessor, who retired under pressure in October — still took home lavish sums last year, according to a regulatory filing this week.” Read more. IT’S NOT TOO LATE TO BUY EQUITIES — Bloomberg’s Jan-Henrik Foerster and Jeffrey Voegeli: “Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS Group AG have a message for their wealthy clients: it’s not too late to buy equities. “Political risk is keeping many rich individuals on the sidelines of a rally that’s sent global stocks surging to records amid a recovering world economy. Now’s the time for them to jump back in and take advantage of the gains still to be made, say the people looking after their cash.” Read more. WHAT THE FED RATE HIKE MEANS FOR YOU — FT’s Alistair Gray: “Americans face another hit to their wallets in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate rise. US banks are set to push up borrowing costs on credit cards and other types of loan while keeping interest rates on saving products largely unchanged. Here’s how banks are likely to respond to the central bank’s move — and what it means for consumers.” Read more. INVESTORS BET ON GROWTH — WSJ’s Harriet Torry, Jason Douglas and Shen Hong report: “Central banks around the world are signaling a move away from ultra-easy money, but financial markets are responding as if the low-interest-rate party isn’t stopping. “A day after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates a quarter percentage point, the People’s Bank of China raised a suite of key short-term interest rates and the Bank of England signaled that an increase in rates may not be far off. Turkey also raised a lending rate, while central banks in Japan, Norway and Indonesia held rates steady.” Read more. DEBT LIMIT BACK IN FULL FORCE — AP’s Martin Crutsinger reports: “The national debt limit came back into force Thursday at a level near $20 trillion, prompting the Trump administration to alert Congress about the measures it will take to stay under the new limit. “Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a letter to lawmakers that that he has started employing bookkeeping measures to avoid breaching the new limit, a process that will provide possibly five months or more for Congress to raise the limit.” Read more. OPEC CAN'T COUNT ON AMERICAN DRIVERS — Bloomberg’s Mark Shenk and Laura Blewitt report: “Rising U.S. oil production isn’t the only thing getting in the way of OPEC’s efforts to drain a global glut. American drivers aren’t helping either. “The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is counting on growing demand to bolster the production cuts it’s making in a bid to balance the market. But motorists in the U.S. — the world’s largest consumer of gasoline — are using less, not more. And that’s not likely to change any time soon.” Read more. PRELIMINARY PROBE INTO AIRBUS — WSJ’s Robert Wall reports: “France’s financial-crimes investigator has begun a preliminary probe into alleged wrongdoing at Airbus Group SE, the company said Thursday, amid widening accusations facing the European plane maker over potential corruption. “Airbus said the French Parquet National Financier was investigating the same alleged missteps already under scrutiny since last year by Britain’s top corruption watchdog, the Serious Fraud Office. Both are examining potential corruption in Airbus commercial plane deals overseas and the possible misuse of middlemen to secure contracts.” Read more. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — ABA PRESSES ON DURBIN — The ABA on Thursday sent a letter to House leadership along with 793 banks and 49 state bankers associations urging Congress “to include a repeal of the Durbin Amendment in financial reform legislation this year.” Letter is here. BANKERS FEAR AUTOMATION — Via a Brunswick Group study: “Financial services employees are the 2nd most likely to say that their job will be automated - right behind manufacturing” Read more. TRUMP BUDGET COULD HIT RURAL POOR — American Banker’s John Heltman and Ian McKendry: “In a budget that was otherwise relatively short on specifics, the Trump administration on Thursday called for eliminating the Treasury Department’s grant programs for community development financial institutions, a popular industry feature that helps impoverished communities access financial services. “The budget's two-page priorities for the Treasury Department included eliminating the CDFI program itself, the Bank Enterprise Award Program, the Native American CDFI Development Program, and the New Markets Tax Credit Program” Read more. IMMIGRANTS WELCOME IN RUST BELT — Bloomberg’s Michelle Jamrisko and Eric Englert: “In the suburbs and countryside of Rust-Belt swing states … Trump’s anti-immigrant message may have carried the day, but in St. Louis and the rest of the region’s dilapidated, post-industrial cities, it’s anathema. “Immigrants represent rebirth: They’ve stabilized neighborhoods, cushioned city coffers and, in the process, supported credit ratings and bond sales. Mayors from Detroit to Cleveland — as well as northeastern cities like Albany and Lowell, Massachusetts — see financial salvation in these newest Americans and are dismayed by Trump’s drive to tighten the borders” ** A message from the American Bankers Association: America’s banks play a critical role in generating economic growth while delivering safety and convenience for customers. The two million women and men who work for America’s banks safeguard $12.7 trillion in deposits and originate $2.4 trillion in home loans. They provide $328 billion in loans to small businesses and $175 billion in loans to farmers and ranchers. Banks’ fraud protection measures stop at least $11 billion in attempted fraud each year. And thousands of banker volunteers deliver financial literacy lessons annually to millions of young Americans to help them become financially successful adults.

NEW YORK — JPMorgan Chase & Co. has sent some wealth management customers letters this month notifying them that they could be moved to the firm's self-directed platform soon ahead of a pending Labor Department retirement regulation, the bank said Monday. While implementation of the Labor Department's fiduciary rule may ultimately be delayed, the letters went out as part of a plan the bank announced in November to end retirement accounts that pay financial advisers commissions. Clients of Chase Wealth Management, Private Bank and J.P. Morgan Securities who had individual retirement accounts were given the option to either choose to pay a financial adviser a flat fee based on how much money they have invested, or an online platform to manage their retirement account themselves. The move only affected a small portion of J.P. Morgan's clients because only 5 percent of the $1.1 trillion in client assets managed at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management & Investment Solutions are in retirement accounts. However, some clients had not yet responded with an answer as to which option they wanted. Clients who had not chosen one received the letters in early March notifying them that by April 7 they may be moved to the self-directed platform unless they respond with another preference. The letter also included a condition that if the Labor Department rule is delayed the bank, may not move all of these accounts. “We wanted to make sure we gave clients ample opportunity to decide which option they preferred,” said JPMorgan Chase spokesman Darin Oduyoye, adding that the bank has invested in building out its online self-directed services. Last September, the bank announced it had bought a stake in InvestCloud, a software company that it will use to customize its website and mobile apps for its wide-ranging client base. The fiduciary rule aims to put the interests of retirement investors first by eliminating potential conflicts of interest for advisers, such as investments that pay different levels of commissions. As a result, JPMorgan, Bank of America's Merrill Lynch and Commonwealth Financial Network, among others, have chosen to gradually phase out retirement accounts that pay commissions.

Now, though, after testing the faith of the most patient souls with glimmers that came to nothing, things seem to be warming up. It looks likely that this year, for the first time since 2010, rich-world and developing economies will put on synchronised growth spurts. There are still plenty of reasons to fret: China’s debt mountain; the flaws in the foundations of the euro; Donald Trump’s protectionist tendencies; and so on. But amid these anxieties are real green shoots. For six months or so there has been growing evidence of increased activity. It has been clearest in the export-oriented economies of Asia. But it is visible in Europe, in America and even, just, in hard-hit emerging markets like Russia and Brazil.

Surveys of purchasing managers in America, the euro zone and Asia show factories getting a lot busier (see chart 1). Global trading hubs such as Taiwan and South Korea are bustling. Taiwan’s National Development Council publishes a composite indicator that tracks the economy’s strength: blue is sluggish, green is stable and red is overheating. The overall economy has been flashing green lights for seven months and is pushing up towards the red zone. This reflects, among other things, demand for semiconductors around the world; this February exports from Taiwan were up by 28% compared with 2016. Although that is the most striking example, exports are up elsewhere in the region, too. South Korea’s rose by 20% in February compared with a year earlier. In yuan terms, China’s were 11% higher in the first two months of 2017 than in 2016. This apparent vigour is in part just a reflection of how bad things looked 12 months ago; suppliers who overdid the gloom in early 2016 are restocking. Asia’s taut supply chains also owe something to the two-to-three-year life-cycle of consumer gadgetry. On March 10th LG Electronics launched its new G6 smartphone. Its larger rival, Samsung, is due to unveil its Galaxy S8 phone by the end of the month; a new iPhone will be out later this year. But the signs of life run deeper than just those specifics would allow. Business spending on machinery and equipment is picking up. A proxy measure based on shipments of capital goods constructed by economists at JPMorgan Chase, a bank, suggests that worldwide equipment spending grew at an annualised rate of 5.25% in the last quarter of 2016. The good news goes beyond manufacturing, too. American employers, excluding farms, added 235,000 workers to their payrolls in February, well above the recent average. The European Commission’s economic-sentiment index, based on surveys of service industries, manufacturers, builders and consumers, is as high as it has been since 2011. After a strong fourth quarter, the Bank of Japan revised up its forecast for growth in the current fiscal year from 1% to 1.4%. Such optimism raises two big questions: what is behind this nascent recovery and will it take hold? Lilacs from the dead land The revival’s roots can be traced to the early months of last year, when a possible calamity was averted. At the end of 2015 stockmarkets tumbled in response to renewed anxiety about China’s economy. Prices at the factory gate, which had been falling steadily for several years, had started to plunge. There were fears that China would be forced to devalue its currency sharply: a cheaper yuan might spur China’s oversupplied industries to export more, fatten profits and service their growing debts. Such a desperate measure would, in effect, have exported its manufacturing deflation to the rest of the world, forcing rivals to cut prices or to devalue in turn. The expectation that China’s economy was weakening pushed raw-material prices to their lowest level since 2009. The oil price briefly sunk below $30 a barrel. That worsened the plight of Brazil and Russia, already mired in deep recessions. It also intensified the pressure to cut investment in America’s shale-oil industry. To stabilise the yuan in the face of rapid outflows of capital, China spent $300bn of its foreign-currency reserves between November 2015 and January 2016. Capital controls were tightened to stop money leaking abroad. Banks juiced up the economy with faster credit growth. With capital now boxed in, much of it flowed into local property: house prices soared, first in the big cities and then beyond. Sales taxes on small cars were reduced by half. Between them, these controls and stimuli did the trick. Soon stocks of raw materials that had been hurriedly run down started to look skimpy. Iron-ore prices jumped by 19% in just one day last March. Curbs on Chinese coal production underpinned a mini-revival in global prices. Steel prices rose sharply, helped by the closure of a few high-cost mills as well as more construction spending. Oil climbed back above $50 a barrel (though it has slipped back a bit recently). By the end of the year producer-price inflation in China—and across Asia—was positive again. And China’s nominal GDP, which had slowed more than real GDP, sped up again (see chart 2). Central bankers, who had been employing various measures to forestall global deflation, were mightily relieved. On March 9th Mario Draghi, boss of the European Central Bank (ECB), proudly declared that the risk of deflation had “largely disappeared”. His relief was a recognition that, though a surge in inflation will flood the economy’s engine, a gentle dose can serve as a helpful lubricant. At a global level, a bit more factory-gate inflation lifts profits, since a lot of manufacturers’ production costs are largely fixed. Fatter profits not only make corporate debt less burdensome, they also free cash for capital spending, which creates further demand for businesses in a virtuous circle. Since worries about China and deflation receded, spending on things that show some faith in future income has indeed begun to stir. A revival in producer prices and thus profits is leading to business investment around the world. In the last quarter of 2016 business spending in Japan rose at an annualised rate of 8%, according to official GDP figures. Gartner, a tech consultancy, predicted in December that consumers and companies would increase their spending on IT by 2.7% in 2017, up from 0.5% in 2016. John Lovelock, a research analyst at Gartner, says the biggest jump in spending is forecast for the Asia-Pacific region. Continuous as the stars that shine? In America imports of both consumer goods and capital goods are up. There has been speculation that the “animal spirits” of business folk have been lifted by Mr Trump’s election in November, and that cuts in tax and regulations, and a subsequent return of the estimated $1trn of untaxed cash held abroad by companies based in America, will fuel a big boom in business investment. But James Stettler, a capital-goods analyst at Barclays Capital, notes that “no one’s really pushing the button on capex yet”. And companies which might benefit from an investment boom are not getting carried away. In a recent profits statement Caterpillar, a maker of bulldozers and excavators, said that, while tax reform and infrastructure spending would be good for its businesses, it would not expect to see large benefits until at least 2018. So far the recovery in global capital spending is in line with what you would expect from the recovery in global profits, says Joseph Lupton of JPMorgan Chase (see chart 3). The signs of recovery are encouraging. But can they be trusted? The last few bursts of optimism about the global economy all petered out. In 2010 the rebound from a deep rich-world recession was pulled back to earth by the sovereign-debt crisis in the euro area. As soon as Europe gingerly emerged from recession in mid-2013, hints from America’s Federal Reserve that its bond-buying programme would soon tail off prompted a stampede out of emerging markets. This “taper tantrum” blew over in a few months, but it had repercussions. The prospect of tighter monetary policy in America, however distant, hit the supply of credit in emerging markets. The squeeze was made worse in 2014 when the oil price fell from over $100 a barrel to half that in just a few months. The price of other industrial raw materials, which had settled onto a plateau after peaking in 2011, began to fall. The subsequent slump in investment was enough to drag big commodity exporters, such as Brazil and Russia, into recession. Even so, by the end of 2015 the Fed was sufficiently confident about the outlook to raise its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, the first such increase in a decade. More increases were expected in relatively short order. But the jitters about China, and then Brexit, meant that it was a full year before the next. It has now followed up with another increase in much shorter order (see article). False dawns were perhaps to be expected: recoveries from debt crises are painfully slow. Spending suffers as borrowers whittle away their debts. Banks are reluctant to write off old, souring loans and so are unable to make fresh new ones. And the world has had to shake off not one debt crisis, but three: the subprime crisis in America; the sovereign-debt crunch in Europe; then the bust in corporate borrowing in emerging markets. But the initial and most painful stage of economic adjustment in emerging markets is coming to an end. Current-account deficits have narrowed, leaving most countries less reliant on foreign borrowing. Their currencies are a lot more competitive. And interest rates are high, so there is scope to relax monetary policy to boost demand (see chart 4). Business spending is already rising in response. The breadth of the improvement—from Asia to Europe and America—makes for greater confidence that a pick-up is in train. A broad trend is a good proxy for an established trend, notes Manoj Pradhan of Talking Heads Macro, a research firm. Nevertheless, some countries are in better shape than others. India and Indonesia recovered quickly from the taper tantrum; their GDP growth has been fairly strong and steady. At the other end of the spectrum, Turkey and (to a lesser extent) South Africa look unlikely to see a big revival soon. In the middle, there are signs that brutal recessions in two of the largest emerging markets, Russia and Brazil, are slowly coming to an end. Inflation in both countries is receding, restoring spending power to consumers. In Russia inflation fell to 4.6% in February, down from a peak of 16.9% two years ago. In the three months ending in September, GDP growth probably turned positive, according to the central bank, which has cut its main interest rate from 17% in January 2015 to 10% today; more cuts are likely. Manufacturing activity grew in each of the seven months to February, according to a survey of purchasing managers published by Markit, a data provider. Brazil’s economy shrank again in the final months of 2016, but with inflation tumbling towards the 4.5% target, its central bank has cut its benchmark rate by two percentage points, to 12.25%, since October. Further cuts are again likely. Other commodity-producers in Latin America (bar Mexico, where the peso has weakened since Mr Trump was elected) are also relaxing monetary policy. The recent buds relax and spread That is the bull case. What of the risks? One is that tighter commodity markets will stymie consumer spending in the rich world by raising prices. But core measures of inflation that strip out volatile things like food and energy costs remain low: nowhere in the rich world have they reached the 2% rate that is the goal of central banks, the rate seen as necessary for a “normal” cyclical recovery. America is closest to that target; the index preferred by the Fed puts America’s inflation at 1.9%, with the core rate at 1.7%. In Europe the core rate is stuck below 1%, with wage growth of around 1.3% last year; but oil prices have pushed headline inflation back to 2%. There is also the risk of expecting too much. A pick-up in global aggregate demand is good news. But growth rates will always be constrained by how fast the workforce can expand and how much extra output can be squeezed from each worker. In lots of places there is scope for jobs growth; but in America, Japan, Germany and Britain the labour market is already quite tight. With America close to full employment, wage growth has picked up to 2.8%, which is consistent with 2% underlying inflation if productivity growth stays around 1%. Pay is growing fastest in less well-paid industries, such as construction, retailing, hospitality and haulage, according to Morgan Stanley, a bank. Wages might perk up yet more if productivity improved. But the post-crisis slump in productivity growth that has affected both rich and developing countries shows no sign of ending. In America output per hour rose by 1.3% in the year to the final quarter of 2016. Europe has not been able to match even that dismal rate. It would take an astonishing shift in productivity for America’s economy to manage the 4% GDP growth promised by Mr Trump. A less fanciful view is that American GDP growth might top 2% this year, a bit better than is expected for Europe. Continued investment, and possibly deregulation, could improve productivity somewhat; but they will not provide a step change. Without one, rich-world interest rates are likely to stay well below the levels that were considered normal before 2007. It is not hard to imagine things that might yet derail the recovery. Though there is a cast-iron consensus that nothing bad will be allowed to happen before the big Communist Party congress in the autumn, China’s growing debt pile could still bring markets tumbling down. Populist victories in Europe’s various elections could bring about a crisis for the euro. Even if they do not, an end to the ECB’s bond-buying programme, which has kept government-borrowing costs at tolerable levels and even allowed a bit of fiscal stimulus to lift the economy, will lay bare the euro’s still-unfixed structural problems. The Fed might tighten policy too quickly, driving up the value of the dollar and draining capital (and thus momentum) from a recovery in emerging markets. Or Mr Trump might make good on the repeated threats he made in his campaign to raise import tariffs on countries he considers guilty of unfair trade, thus taking a decisive step away from globalisation just as the world’s main economic blocs are at last starting to get into sync. These risks are not new or surprising. What brings a freshness to the air is that a cyclical recovery has managed to overcome them. There may actually be some rosebuds to gather, for a while. twitter icon facebook icon linkedin icon mail icon print icon View comments Reuse this content Editors’ picks Why the what-about-ism?James Comey says the FBI is investigating possible links between Trump and Russia But the House intelligence committee’s Republican members seem more interested in leaks Democracy in America Unusually common languageRex Tillerson talks of a “historic moment” in relations with ChinaAsia On the riseThe global economy enjoys a synchronised upswingLeaders The Economist explainsThe demand for Nigerian debtThe Economist explains You are seeing the beta version of Economist.com Leave feedback Need assistance with your subscription?

Forbes ranks Trump as the world’s 544th richest person, after coming in at No. 324 last year. He has famously refused to reveal his tax returns that would identify his actual net worth, but has claimed it’s “in excess” of $10 billion. Bill Gates now resides at the top of the list.

Penney may be on the chopping block CNBC0:47 UP NEXT James Michael Logsdon, a Louisville auto mechanic, hadn’t been in a classroom in 40 years when his company went out of business in 2015, but he was keen to learn something new. He enrolled in a free program for blue-collar workers at KentuckianaWorks, a regional job-services group that offers education and training courses and connects students with prospective employers. In five weeks, he got certified production technician (CPT) training and was hired weeks later at Atlas Copco AB, the Swedish tool-and-equipment maker. “I had a long interview, but it wasn’t until I talked about the courses I’d taken and showed my grades that they wanted me,” says Logsdon, 59, who now repairs tools used by automakers and equipment manufacturers.

Unskilled assembly-line work has been replaced by so-called advanced manufacturing jobs that require some computer, information technology, or other technical knowledge. In Detroit, Louisville, Grand Rapids, Mich., and other manufacturing hubs, many employers can’t find workers with those skills. “Manufacturing jobs are here and growing in numbers, but you can’t just show up at a plant after high school and get hired any longer. You need some specialized training and certifications,” says Chauncy Lennon, head of Workforce Initiatives at JPMorgan Chase & Co., which helps fund KentuckianaWorks as part of a $250 million commitment to support training for manufacturing, health-care, and other middle-income jobs. KentuckianaWorks’ other funders include the Louisville Redevelopment Authority, the National Fund for Workforce Solutions, and several foundations. Over the next decade, 3.4 million manufacturing jobs are expected to become available as baby boomers retire and economic growth spurs work opportunities, according to a 2015 study by the Manufacturing Institute, a Washington-based think tank, and Deloitte LLC. But a skills gap could result in 2 million of those jobs staying unfilled. Workers are most lacking in computing and technical skills, as well as basic math and problem-solving, the study found. More than 80 percent of 450 U.S. executives surveyed said the gap will affect their ability to meet customer demand, and 78 percent said it will make it more difficult for them to use new technologies and increase productivity. “If you’re wrapping 300 Hershey chocolate kisses a minute, you need to know how to use a robot, and if you’re making tiny instruments for medical equipment, you need to understand mechatronics,” says Fred Dedrick, president and chief executive officer of the National Fund for Workforce Solutions, a nonprofit that works with 32 job-training programs across the country. “Some big companies have closed and left devastation, but it’s inaccurate to say there aren’t opportunities in manufacturing,” he says. To ensure that its curriculum meets employers’ needs, KentuckianaWorks, which has an annual budget of about $700,000, enlisted local manufacturers, including Cardinal Aluminum, Ford Motor, and Kellogg, to help design two training programs: the five-week CPT course and a basic two-week version. Both programs are intensive and have trained people age 18-60. Only 56 percent of those who start one stick with it to the end, but those who do usually find jobs quickly. Since 2014, when the training was launched, 973 graduates have been hired at partner companies at an average salary of about $13 an hour. Cindy Read, deputy director of KentuckianaWorks, says most are entry-level production jobs, “but if you’ve had the discipline to train and get credentials, and then you stick it out on a job and are willing to learn, you can move up quickly.” That’s the case at KCC Cos., a metal fabricator with 350 employees that makes commercial roof products and heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning units. The company has hired 10 KentuckianaWorks graduates in the past year. “The basic training they get sets them apart from other entry-level candidates, and once they’re hired we can expand their knowledge,” says Michael Kopp, a KCC recruiter. He attends at least one session of every course to meet trainees and talk about the company. Kopp also keeps in touch with instructors. “Not everyone we’ve hired has worked out,” he says, “but our retention success rate with these trainees is higher than with other hires.” Logsdon, the former auto mechanic who works at Atlas Copco, says he was “as green as you can be” when he started the training, after losing his job with a small family-run repair shop. He’d never worked on a computer and had to learn Windows and Excel quickly, because the curriculum was online. Classes ran from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and there were tests every Friday. “I got more than the CPT certificate. I got confidence, mentoring, and help writing a résumé,” he says. Initially, Atlas Copco, which found Logsdon’s résumé online, offered him a temporary job repairing tools for $17.50 an hour, 30 percent less than what he’d earned as a mechanic. Still, he jumped at the chance to work for a growing company where workers are encouraged to make decisions and, he says, “solve our own problems.” In November, Logsdon was offered a permanent job with benefits. He plans to keep working as long as he can. “I put in 10-hour days here, starting at 5 a.m.,” he says, “and I’ve never been happier in a job.” The bottom line: Over the next decade, as 3.4 million manufacturing jobs become available, a skills gap could result in 2 million staying unfilled.

Dynamic redo transforms downtown tower By VELVET SPICER Rochester Business Journal February 17, 2017 Weaving through a steady stream of construction crews that dot the downtown landscape, it is easy to see the area is in the midst of a renewal. What may not be apparent, however, is the equally important revitalization happening inside one iconic building. Situated at the southwest corner of East Main Street and South Clinton Avenue, the Metropolitan—formerly Lincoln Tower and more recently Chase Tower—is undergoing a major overhaul that will improve access to the building as well as interior aesthetics and, more importantly, tenancy in Rochester’s third-largest skyscraper.  The building was the brainchild of architect John Graham, who also designed the Space Needle in Seattle. Lincoln Tower, with its unique white fins arcing 400 feet into the downtown sky, was a $20 million project completed in 1973 for Lincoln First Bank. In 1996, the building was renamed Chase Tower, and it serves as JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A.’s Upstate New York headquarters. For years, however, the 475,000-square-foot structure has remained mostly vacant. In 2015 Gallina Development acquired Chase Tower from JP Morgan Chase and rebranded it the Metropolitan. “I think one of the most significant things is that before the tower was sold to the Gallinas, and before this new redevelopment began, that was a huge, iconic tower that was virtually empty,” said Heidi Zimmer-Meyer, president of Rochester Downtown Development Corp. “It was held by an owner that was out of town. To get it into the hands of a local owner and developer is a different story.” A local owner carries the ability to reshape the building’s economic relevance, she said. Indeed, Gallina is in the process of converting the tower into a dynamic, mixed-use space that will include redesigned office space, exclusive retail and restaurant  space, and high-rise living opportunities in the form of contemporary apartments and luxury condominiums. Gallina paired with Hanlon Architects to develop a new main entrance to the building, with a circular driveway and drop-off point under a modern exterior canopy. The intent was to remove the barrier to the street and provide easy vehicular and pedestrian access to the building. The tower is Gallina’s first mixed-use redevelopment project downtown. The commercial real estate developer has roughly 2.5 million square feet of space, primarily in the Monroe County area. Its first major acquisition downtown was the purchase of One East Avenue in 2012. The Metropolitan already has a number of commercial tenants, including JP Morgan Chase; Forsyth, Howe, O’Dwyer, Kalb & Murphy P.C.; 5Linx Enterprises Inc.; U.S. Employee Benefits Services Group; Datto Inc.; and BrandMint. Datto has announced plans to add 200 jobs at its Metropolitan office. JP Morgan Chase occupies three floors of the building in addition to a Chase Bank branch on the first floor. When completed, the first 15 floors of the 26-floor structure are to contain office space, with apartments occupying floors 16 through 21 and condos from floors 22 through 26. “The tenants that will be in the building will support spending within the region, or in the downtown core,” said Gary Keith, vice president and regional economist at M&T Bank Corp. That, in turn, will create an environment in which investors take notice. “You need tangible examples of investors putting capital at risk, and I think that encourages others,” Keith added. “It’s helpful in terms of making the city more vibrant and attractive to folks that want to live there.” The Metropolitan parcel includes nearly an acre of green space that has been underutilized for years. Gallina has partnered with Bayer Landscape Architecture to redesign the outdoor space. Keith said investments like the one at the Metropolitan have more than an economic effect downtown. “It is certainly something that will affect psychology maybe more than the economy, which is important,” he said. “As people see progress in the city center with development like this, it gives them confidence that things are improving.” That helps with the psychology of spending and investing and doing the kinds of things that grow the economy, Keith added. The Metropolitan and its occupants are in the heart of the new Downtown Innovation Zone, Zimmer-Meyer said. The area is seeing fewer conventional businesses moving downtown and more innovation companies, she said. “We now have four companies in the video game world clustering here,” she said. “It’s happened organically.” With the office portion of the building filled, that will mean good things for future retailers, Zimmer-Meyer noted. “What’s going to happen when this building is finished is it puts people on the street,” she said. “It grows the market, creates more vitality at street level. Every new project increasingly creates an environment that people want to be in.” Zimmer-Meyer also pointed to a plan to add more dining options on the second level of the building that will be convenient to other office buildings and hotels in the area. In addition, RDDC has been working on a kitchen incubator to be housed at the Metropolitan. Some $230,000 in state funding for the project already has been received, and RDDC plans to fundraise for additional monies. The Commissary would allow entrepreneurial chefs to rent industrial kitchens for hours at a time. The Metropolitan renovations mean more options and more housing, which in turn means a bustling city center. “It used to be empty,” Zimmer-Meyer said of Rochester’s downtown core. “The whole dynamic is starting to change when you go outside now. You begin to see more and more people out on the streets.”  2/24/2017 (c) 2017 Rochester Business Journal. To obtain permission to reprint this article, call 585-546-8303 or email service@rbj.net.

Chiropractor Melinda Houle helps clients adjust. The Health Care Achievement Awards 2017 supplement. Business tenants excited about renovations By KERRY FELTNER Rochester Business Journal February 24, 2017 The Metropolitan is home to a cluster of commercial tenants, including technology companies, a law firm, an employee benefits firm, an advertising firm and a bank. Space is available for an additional nine tenants, depending on the size of each company, officials said. The third, fourth and ninth floors of the building are still open for occupancy. The group of tenants is ideal so far, said Lauren Gallina, marketing director for Gallina Development Corp., which acquired the building in 2015. “As a true mixed-use building should be, we have a great mix of demographics with our current tenants,” she said. “We have everyone from the creative class with cutting-edge technology firms, to more traditional suit-and-tie businesses. This provides a great environment for people to work.” The current commercial tenants include Forsythe, Howe, O’Dwyer, Kalb & Murphy P.C.; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; 5Linx Enterprises Inc.; U.S. Employee Benefits Services Group; Datto Inc.; and BrandMint. “When we learned about the plans for the building and walked through the space, we knew we wanted to be part of this vision,” said Tammy Gurowski communications manager of U.S. Employee Benefits Services. “Our firm has always been downtown, so the decision to stay was an easy one. “We believe strongly that the revitalization of downtown Rochester can only be successful with a strong economic core. The plans for mixed use will encourage a sustainable foundation, combining business, residential, retail and restaurant development.” The vision of the Metropolitan has helped excite current tenants for the future, Gallina said. The building’s renovations are anticipated to be completed in late spring to early summer. “Our commercial tenants are excited to be a part of the changes going on in the building,” she said. “They don’t mind the construction because they know what is on the other side. Many have worked in the building for a long time and are happy to come into work every day to see what is new. We appreciate our tenants’ patience with us as we continue to make improvements, and are grateful they are able to share in our vision.” Some features of the Metropolitan that are attractive to tenants include valet parking, the views of downtown Rochester, proximity to local sites such as the East End, and being situated in the center of the city. “When we travel to other cities and see the vibrancy and quality of life that’s available, we hope to see that vitality back in downtown Rochester,” Gurowski said. “Being a tenant at the Metropolitan is our commitment to the investments being made in our city. We’re at the epicenter of our future.” Being part of the transformation of the heart of Rochester is a reason why Datto has moved into the Metropolitan, said Robert Poltrino, Rochester operations manager of the firm. “The Metropolitan building is going through a massive overhaul and at Datto we were impressed with Gallina Development’s approach to the improvements,” Poltrino said. “Our focus is attracting the best possible talent while also helping to rejuvenate downtown Rochester. The proximity to RIT, the University of Rochester and SUNY schools meets this criterion for Datto. “Overall, downtown is transforming to a true metropolitan city with mixed-use buildings, restaurants and entertainment. It was a natural fit for Datto.” The flexibility of Gallina Development has helped tenants make their mark on their workspace.  “Gallina Development has been a tremendous partner in the way they listen to our vision for how we want to transform the space,” Poltrino said. “They are helpful in the way they make suggestions for potential additional amenities. This will provide our employees with an amazing work experience.” The law firm Forsythe, Howe, O’Dwyer, Kalb & Murphy has been downtown for all 67 years of its operation. The firm has signed a three-year lease with Gallina Development. “We represent a lot of banks, and so we have a lot of mortgage borrowers who need to close their loans, and they don’t want to come downtown because they don’t know where to park or where to go,” said Duncan O’Dwyer, partner of the firm. “And once Andy (Gallina) has this valet parking they’ll be able to drive up to the front door and come in and close the loan right on Clinton Avenue. We love being downtown.” The transformation of the building will pay off, O’Dwyer said. “Andy is spending a ton of money on this building to bring it up to be a first-class operation,” he said. “It’s going to bring a lot of life to downtown. It will be a wonderful thing for the city of Rochester. He’s taking risk but I think it will be good risk; it will pay off in the end.” The changes are exciting to be part of, Datto’s Poltrino said. “Datto is thrilled to be a part of the transformation and looks forward to what is already in the works,” he said. “The entire Gallina Development family has embraced Datto and is always available to support their tenants. As we move into the future our relationship will only strengthen.” While the tenant mix is strong, it will take more companies to believe in the downtown area and the Metropolitan for true success long term. Rochestarians need to get excited about the center city again, Lauren Gallina said. “We think that office space is still a vital part of what will make our downtown continue to grow,” she said. “The focus right now is on a lot of the residential coming online, but the office market is still quite anemic. “We must continue to work together to attract businesses to our downtown, because they want to be a part of the revitalization and the excitement that is happening all around, and an experience that they can’t have in a suburban office park.” 2/24/2017 (c) 2017 Rochester Business Journal.

The fact that the Feb. 28 shutdown had no visible impact on the industry’s use of cloud services goes to show how far it has progressed since then in embracing the cloud after nearly a decade of hesitation. That change of heart came after providers Amazon Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google took steps to assure financial firms and regulators that the cloud not only made tech systems cheaper and faster, but also more reliable and secure than their own server-filled warehouses. The benefits are so unquestionable that last month’s outage caused by an employee who typed in a wrong code was barely a bump on the road to the cloud and merely a reminder that no technology is foolproof, financial executives, Silicon Valley vendors and analysts who work with them said. ‘Just tools’ “You can’t just say if you use Amazon you get the magic cloud sauce and everything will work perfectly,” said Yevgeniy Brikman, the co-founder of Gruntwork, a start-up that helps big companies deploy cloud services. “And similarly that if you use your own data centre that somehow magically everything will work perfectly. These are just tools.” The payoffs of using the cloud are clear for an industry engaged in rounds of relentless cost-cutting. Calculations performed by IDC Financial Insights show the biggest global banks saving $15 billion by 2019 from cloud adoption, cutting technology infrastructure costs by 25 %. About two thirds of global financial firms will be using cloud services in a significant way by next year, IDC predicts. Developing an application on the cloud can help reduce the time it takes to launch from 89 days to 15 days, according to McKinsey & Co. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Capital One Financial Corp. and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. are already using shared cloud services from large vendors, executives and spokespeople said. So are institutions such as Nasdaq Inc., The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the brokerage industry watchdog. Amazon is the biggest provider with 40% of public cloud business, according to Synergy Research. That market totalled $7 billion in the fourth quarter, and is growing at an annual rate of 50%. FINRA now runs 90% of its critical applications, including market surveillance, on Amazon’s cloud, saving $20 million annually. “The capability and flexibility to recover quickly is much greater, and it is far more cost-efficient than operating your own geographically dispersed data centres,” said spokesman Ray Pellecchia. Cost savings alone would not have been enough to lure big financial firms. For years, the industry sat on the sidelines due to concerns about data security and regulatory compliance as other corporations took advantage of the cloud’s benefits. Silicon Valley took notice and made changes. Trucking data For instance, Amazon has expanded its number and locations of data centres around the world to allow customers to choose a particular centre to comply with different countries’ privacy rules. Customers can also get dedicated servers to avoid sharing them, or can access information through private networks. In late-November Amazon introduced the “Snowmobile,” a tamper-resistant 45-foot (13.72 m) container pulled by a semi-trailer truck that securely transports customers’ servers to its own data centres. Amazon customers can also set up systems to automatically shift to another data centre within its 16 global regions if an outage occurs. That minimized the impact of the recent outage, four financial customers said. George Brady, who heads shared technology operations at Capital One, said the bank believed big tech companies had “controls for public cloud that are as good or better than capabilities we would provide.” He was speaking before the outage, but later said the bank had factored in occasional glitches and remained committed to the cloud. Capital One builds all new applications on the cloud and plans to cut its data centres from eight to three by next year. John Madsen, co-head of technology at Goldman Sachs, said his bank has worked with vendors to ensure cloud networks were secure and reliable, and was satisfied with the results. “We’ve had a lot of success with those efforts,” he said. Customers, regulators and lawyers acknowledge that cloud failures could, in theory, wreak havoc. That is why large financial institutions have mostly kept highly sensitive data off the cloud and have back-up plans, like using multiple vendors. An apocalyptic scenario where many data centres fail at the same time is highly unlikely, they say.

The Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook Index rose from 74.2 in the fourth quarter of last year to 93.3 in the current quarter, the first time in seven quarters that the index has risen above its historical average of 79.8. CEOs who were surveyed also posted an 18-point gain in the subindex that measures plans for future hiring. Increases of 21.0 and 18.4 points were also posted in the sales expectations and capital expenditure subindexes, respectively. Jamie Dimon, chairman of the Business Roundtable and CEO and chairman of JPMorgan, said: I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to enact a meaningful pro growth agenda that will benefit all Americans. As these results confirm, business confidence and optimism have increased dramatically. Our CEOs are committed to working collaboratively with policymakers to drive policy solutions, starting with far-reaching tax reform and a smarter approach to regulation. In the three categories surveyed — sales expectations, capital spending and employment — more than three-quarters of CEOs expected sales to rise in the next six months, up from two-thirds in the fourth-quarter 2016 survey. Nearly half (46%) plan to increase capital spending in the next six months, up from 35% in the fourth-quarter survey, and 41% say they plan to increase employment, up from 35% in the prior quarter. The first-quarter 2017 survey was conducted between February 8 and March 1, 2017, and responses were received from 141 member CEOs.

The draft budget requested substantial cuts to 15 federal agencies while boosting funds for three. Read: Trump’s Budget Plan Increases Funding To Combat Immigration, Hurts Local Law Enforcement After the Treasury Department, a major financial industry regulator, saw its proposed funding reduced to its lowest level in more than two decades, the share prices of several of America’s biggest banks spiked, only to drop substantially in value Friday. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) shot up 0.8 percent in the first half hour of trading Thursday, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) rose 0.7 percent and both Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) jumped 0.6 percent over the same thirty minute period. All four fell substantially Friday, closing at, respectively, $24.96, $243.90, $58.66 and $90.66.   Compared to the megabanks, defense firm shares saw an inverse movement amid news that the proposed budget increased military spending by nearly 9 percent to its highest level since 2012. Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) dropped 1.5 percent Thursday, while fellow defense contractors Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT), Boeing Co. (BA), Raytheon Co. (RTN) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD) fell by between 0.5 and 0.9 percent, only to skyrocket to a full recovery by market close on Friday. The sudden drop may have been a result of shattered expectations for military spending, as defense hawks in Congress such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona criticized the budget proposal. Read: Defense Company Stocks Rise After New Spending Plan Announced From Trump Administration Ahead Of Address Before Joint Session Of Congress In the hours after news surfaced that the Environmental Protection Agency would see nearly a third of its funding slashed, drawing its budget down to the lowest level in history, major corporate polluters saw temporary share price gains. Alcoa Corporation (AA) and German pharmaceuticals firm Bayer AG (BAYN.DE), two of the world’s top air polluters, according to the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Political Economy Research Institute, saw respective share price growth of 1.6 percent and1.3 percent in the aftermath of the budget proposal’s release Thursday. Both fell back toward their pre-budget levels by Friday afternoon, with Alcoa finishing the trading day at $34.96 and Bayer hitting $106.85 by market close. One of the oil and gas sector’s top methane emitters and the former and only workplace of Rex Tillerson, Trump’s appointee for secretary of state, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) saw a modest increase of a third of a percent in the wake of the budget release, only to level off Friday for a market close of $82.

One in six families makes a major medical payment in any given year, most occurring in the first few months, according to the JPMorgan Chase Institute. The average payment is $1,143, and it takes most households "more than a year to recover from the hit." To help cover costs, set up an emergency savings fund. "Two-thirds of Americans would have difficulty coming up with the money to cover a $1,000 emergency." Make sure to read any bills you receive carefully — about half of medical bills contain errors, so you might be paying for treatments and services you didn't receive. Switching to a single income Are you or your partner "dreaming of the day when you can stay home with the kids?" asked Maryalene LaPonsie at US News. If so, plan your finances carefully before making "the leap from being a dual-income to a single-income household." Couples should focus on paying off as much debt as possible before the transition, especially car loans and credit cards. "A mortgage may be worth keeping since current rates are so low and interest can be deducted on itemized returns." Retirement plans also need to be addressed, because even a nonworking spouse should be saving money for the future. Look into opening a spousal IRA for the nonworking partner. And before anyone quits a job, "sit down and create a realistic budget." Where's my auto 401(k)? Automatically enrolling workers in company-backed 401(k) plans has been hailed as an effective way to get more Americans saving for retirement, said Dan Kadlec at Money. But so far, few workers have access to these schemes. The problem lies with the nation's small businesses, which employ about half of U.S. workers. Just 33 percent of companies with 25 to 49 workers, and 20 percent of firms with 10 to 24 employees, offer 401(k)-type plans, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In contrast, 93 percent of companies with 10,000-plus employees offer these plans. What's more, only 12.1 percent of firms with fewer than 500 workers offer auto-enrollment 401(k) plans. "If we're counting on auto enrollment to solve the retirement savings crisis, we should probably find a way to hook in more small businesses." Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine.

By Nadja Sayej / The Guardian March 17, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Hare Krishna / Shutterstock This week, President Trump released his “America first” federal budget plan, which intends to completely wipe out the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. It is the first time a president has ever proposed their complete obliteration. It came a day before the opening of the Whitney Biennial – the longest-running survey of American art – casting a gloomy shadow on a group exhibition that explores the topic of funding, or its lack thereof. The 63 artists on view are co-curated by Mia Locks and Christopher Y Lew, who want to mirror this bleak era. “This biennial arrives at a time rife with racial tensions, economic inequities and polarizing politics,” they write in the introductory statement, “inviting us to pause and pose questions in a tumultuous world.” It’s a politically charged show on the state of America but without the predictable satire. Rather, this exhibition feels like a graveyard of the establishment’s broken promises with glimmers of hope from some of its suffering citizens. Part of the Occupy Museums group show. Photograph: Occupy Museums In light of arts funding cuts, the art collective Occupy Museums, which was formed in 2011 alongside Occupy Wall Street, has created a mini group show in the biennial called Debtfair. The works of 30 artists are grouped by the corporations they are in debt to; JPMorgan Chase, Navient and the FirstBank of Puerto Rico. The artworks can be bought for the artist’s monthly debt charge. What about art education, you ask? Puerto Rican artist and activist Chemi Rosado-Seijo took all the desks and chairs from a classroom from the Lower Manhattan Arts Academy and put the class inside the museum. The piece, called Salón Sala Salón, brings the high school art students to the museum for a weekly workshop, showing the importance the creative arts education in a time when its meaning is being diminished. The arts aren’t the only sector suffering funding cuts – the budget proposal wipes out thousands of jobs in health, science and social programs. New York artist Cameron Rowland’s piece Public Money shows one alternative form of funding that could pave the way for the future, social impact bonds. “The purpose is to gain a more intimate understanding of how they work,” he said. “So few people know they exist, let alone how they work, which is something that is crucial at this moment.” While there are no Trump portraits or American flags, there is a Statue of Liberty standing outside in below-zero weather. The performance, called Liberté (Liberty), has a performer holding up an unlit torch. It was created by art group Puppies Puppies, who are selling foam Liberty Island crowns downstairs in the gift shop for $5, debunking the myth that high art has to be expensive (and inaccessible). Even with holdups at airports and the looming Muslim ban, other pieces dig into the refugee crisis, like The Island, a film by Vietnamese artist Tuan Andrew Nguyen. Shot on the Malaysian island of Bidong, a former Vietnam war refugee camp, it mirrors the present refugee crisis at a time when millions of Syrian refugees have fled their homeland. While the small island accommodated 250,000 people from the 1970s to the time it shut down in 1991, America will accept no more than 50,000 refugees this year after screening each one under a microscope. During the presidential campaign, Melania Trump was called out for copying and pasting parts of Michelle Obama’s speech. Here, there is also a plagiarism spat. On Instagram, Toronto artist Maya Ben David claimed that a sculpture in the biennial by Ajay Kurian looks too similar to a character she created called Mary Jane Anthro Plane, which is featured in her video art piece MBD: Origin Story, which was shown in a gallery last year. Kurian’s sculpture, which is part of a series he called Childermass, features a figure with a red wig and a white mask, just like David’s. “The sculpture in the Whitney not only resembles my character with an airplane mask and red hair, but she is wearing layered shirts and sneakers just like in my work,” said Ben David. “I would like an apology from the artist and curators at the Whitney Museum and recognition that the character Mary Jane Anthro Plane is my creation.” An email sent to Kurian’s gallerist was not answered at the time of publishing this story. Raúl de Nieves’s Technicolor stained glass wall. Photograph: Will Ragozzino It feels like many people are being sold short, and it isn’t just Trump’s budget cuts to the arts. While his proposed Mexican-US border wall will cost billions, the current border is a point of inspiration in the show. Mexican artist Raúl de Nieves’s Technicolor stained glass wall reads Hope, while the Postcommodity art collective created a video that follows the rusty metal fence that currently divides Douglas, Arizona, and Agua Prieta, Mexico. “The border continues to mystify the American public during this administration, as it did before Trump entered,” said Postcommodity artist Cristobal Martinez, who refers to their piece as “a metaphor for the imprisonment caused by the polarizing bipartisan discourse”.   Nadja Sayej is a freelance journalist in Berlin covering art and culture.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Female financial advisers get punished more severely than men, especially at Wells Fargo. That’s according to a new working paper that finds female employees who engage in misconduct at Wells Fargo Advisors are over 25% more likely than their male counterparts to have lost their jobs. Wells Fargo Advisors had the highest rate of female workers leaving among the 44 firms studied between 2005 and 2015. It was followed closely by A.G. Edwards, which is also a division of Wells Fargo. The researchers connected the dots and concluded the employees were often leaving because they were fired. “The financial industry is willing to give male advisers a second chance, while female advisers are likely to be cast from the industry,” wrote professors Mark Egan of the University of Minnesota, Gregor Matvos from the University of Chicago and Stanford’s Amit Seru. The research was published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a prestigious nonprofit group known for declaring when recessions begin and end. The findings are likely to add to concern about the cultural problems at Wells Fargo exposed by the bank’s fake account scandal. Former Wells Fargo employees have told CNNMoney they were retaliated against after calling the bank’s ethics hotline about the illegal sales activity. Wells Fargo Advisors said in a statement it’s examining the study’s “assumptions and conclusions carefully” and said there are “substantial questions” about the data and analysis behind it. “As always, our focus is on providing a diverse and inclusive work environment,” Wells Fargo said. SunTrust Investment Services and Allstate Financial Services also ranked high, with female workers there over 20% more likely to lose their jobs than men with misconduct. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Investment Services and JPMorgan Securities were also in the top 10. After examining data on roughly 1.2 million registered financial advisers in the U.S., the study found that females industrywide face “harsher punishment” than men. They are 20% more likely to be fired after missteps and 30% less likely to find new jobs. That’s despite the fact that researchers found that men are three times more likely to engage in misconduct and twice as likely to be repeat offenders. Men also engage in conduct that is 20% costlier, the paper found. “Our results suggest that firms, and the industry as a whole, exhibit substantial discrimination against women when doling out punishments following misconduct,” the paper said. The financial advisory industry has a history of misbehavior. Roughly one in 13 licensed employees in the industry has a record of misconduct, but that drops to 1 in 33 for females, researchers said. Julie Nugent, vice president and center leader at workplace inclusion nonprofit Catalyst, blamed the findings on gender stereotypes. “Women can be judged more harshly. I call it the Goldilocks Syndrome. Women are perceived as too soft or too tough, but never just right,” Nugent told CNNMoney. It’s worth noting that a Wall Street lobbying group has accused the authors of using methodology that “significantly overstates” misconduct by including all licensed securities personnel. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, known as SIFMA, notes that “less than half” of these employees are actually client-facing financial advisers. However, SIFMA acknowledges that the other half do still hold critical roles such as traders, investment bankers or compliance and legal employees. Morgan Stanley said in a statement that it’s “committed to treating all employees fairly and equally” and has “extensive programs in place to build a diverse, inclusive network of financial advisers.” Representatives from SunTrust, Allstate and Bank of America did not respond to requests from CNNMoney for comment. JPMorgan declined to comment. The paper, titled “When Harry Fired Sally,” acknowledges that the gap between terminating men and women could simply be evidence of “statistical discrimination.” After all, firms could be deciding to punish women more severely because they engage in more expensive bad behavior or are less costly to replace. Yet the academics found “empirical evidence suggests the exact opposite.” They compared male and female advisers at the same firm, in the same location and at the same point in time. The research shows “large and pervasive differences in the treatment of male and female advisers.” For instance, female advisers experience a “disproportionate share” of misconduct complaints that are filed by the firm, instead of customers or regulators. Moreover, companies with a greater percentage of male executives tend to punish women more severely and hire fewer females who have a history of misbehaving.

People make decisions, even life-altering decisions, based on what they perceive as likely to happen. To the extent that public policy affects such decisions, the perception of likely policy change can affect behavior even before the change happens. Something like that seems to be happening in America — and around the world. In the two months since President Trump’s inauguration, people have been making decisions based on perceptions of how he may change the country’s direction. Take the economy. The numbers in the jobs report for February, Trump’s first full month in office, showing an increase of 235,000 jobs, are not wildly out of line with some monthly reports in recent years. In contrast with the years of the Obama stimulus program, when the bulk of new jobs came in the public sector, it appears that the increase here is in the private sector. Moody’s Analytics says there were 298,000 new private-sector jobs in February, far more than the 189,000 it expected. Construction jobs were up 58,000. Private educational services jobs were up 29,000. And manufacturing jobs were up 28,000. This suggests that lots of employers, small as well as large, are taking the plunge and creating new jobs. Can I prove that they’re doing so because of perceptions that regulations and taxes will be decreased by the Trump administration? No, and I’m not sure any economist’s statistical model could, either. But it sure looks as if that’s what’s happening. More On: donald trump Bharara didn't need to make a spectacle of his firing Tillerson to skip NATO meeting in April, visit Russia later in month Trump brags he's the reason Colin Kaepernick is unemployed Why Wall Street might be facing another 'irrational exuberance' Big players in the financial markets seem to think so. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen suggested the Fed will raise interest rates twice more this year after doing so twice in the past three months. That’s a significant shift from her longstanding reluctance to increase rates at all for fear of dampening the economy. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said March 10 that Trump’s agenda of cutting corporate taxes, building infrastructure and rolling back regulations has unleashed the “animal spirits” — economist John Maynard Keynes’ phrase — of businesspeople. Does the unusual speed with which Paul Ryan is leading the House to vote on repealing and replacing ObamaCare suggest he and Trump are trying to strengthen the perception that the private-sector economy will boom? Given the significant risk of political damage and policy bollix, it certainly looks as if the answer is yes. People at the high end of the income spectrum — a category that obviously includes the bulk of job creators — are not the only ones making decisions in response to perceptions. So, it appears, are undocumented immigrants and people deciding whether to cross the border illegally. US Customs and Border Protection reported that apprehensions of people who crossed the southern border illegally in February were down 39 percent from January and down 36 percent from February 2016. They were also lower than the border crossings in December (typically when border crossings are lowest) than in 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012. That’s a startling drop. And it’s one that seems likely to reverberate far beyond Mexico, seeing as most people who have crossed the border illegally since the Great Recession have come from Central America. Under President Barack Obama, Central American children (or adults claiming to be younger than 18) seeking asylum were mostly allowed to remain in the United States, effectively free of border enforcement. Trump’s executive orders on immigration law enforcement have created the perception, probably accurately, that that’s changed. Of course, perceptions can change. Perceptions of an incoming president’s likely policies can shape the behavior of many; perceptions of an outgoing president’s policies, not so much. As a president’s term goes on, perceptions of a president’s policies are replaced by the realities of actual policies, and perceptions of likely effects are modified by conditions on the ground. The wisdom of crowds is not always spot on. But it’s sometimes superior to the wisdom of experts. Most experts predicted that Britain’s vote for Brexit and America’s for Trump would crater those countries’ respective economies. That hasn’t happened yet — and most people seem to perceive it won’t.

Apparently his remarks about kindness had been heard. Also, Sandler, 42, is adorable. Also, there was a lot of sweet barbecue sauce at the Flatiron District venue, which hosted the Riley’s Way Foundation Biennial BBQ Blowout. Ian and Mackenzie Sandler Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg Sandler and his wife Mackenzie created the foundation in August 2014, when their nine-year-old daughter Riley went into respiratory arrest on her last night of sleep-away camp and died. From the start, the couple decided to focus on their daughter’s life "and not her incomprehensible ending," Sandler told guests. Deciding what to do to reflect Riley’s caring nature evolved out of brainstorming sessions largely guided by Paul Burke, the headmaster at Riley’s Upper East Side private all-girls school, Nightingale-Bamford, where empathy training is well in place: younger kids have daily check-ins about their feelings, and older ones are discouraged from labeling someone their best friend so they develop broader social networks. Students from Nightingale-Bamford sing with Rabbi Angela Buchdahl. Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg Early on, the foundation’s builders considered buying a farm to turn into a retreat, said John Horner, chief investment officer and treasurer at JPMorgan Chase. Eventually, the group settled on school-based programs that encourage kindness. John Horner and Meryl Heller, board members of Riley’s Way Foundation Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg While there’s a likely progression for a nascent philanthropy -- piloting, refining, scaling up -- the divisive election year has kicked this effort into high gear. "It’s accelerated everything we’re doing," Sandler said when asked about the impact of the presidential election. In January, the foundation hired a second program director (doubling its staff) to prepare for expansion. And there’s increasing interest from donors, evident from the high turnout at the benefit. "In the last six months, the foundation has taken on another life. People are pushing for it," said Sandler. "Regardless of politics, you can either complain or take direct action. This is teaching kindness student by student, teacher by teacher." For Sandler, the election’s rancor crystallized support of programs that bring together students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. The foundation is also focusing on schools that lack resources to implement social-emotional learning, which at Riley’s Way includes visits by performing artists and a book club. "They’re a blank canvas, which gives us an ability to move the needle," Sandler said. Two grantees are public elementary school in the Ridgewood neighborhood of Queens and a charter school in Harlem. The scene at Hill Country BBQ Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg Sandler said people in finance have been essential to the foundation. Donors who work at Insight Venture Partners as well as Citadel, Carlyle and Morgan Stanley, where Sandler also worked, have helped raise $3 million. That amount gives the foundation resources to make mistakes, to evaluate its efforts, and think seriously about scaling up, Sandler said. David Vroubel and Brandon Haley Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg One year after forming, the foundation gave two schools $60,000 grants, to be dispensed over three years, to shape a curriculum for third- and fourth-graders. A portion is earmarked for teachers’ professional development, said Katie Leonberger, chief executive of Community Resource Exchange, which advised the foundation. The foundation also has a Youth Advisory Council, teens from several schools that do public service and work with the younger cohorts. "It’s been so gratifying to see the foundation develop," said Brandon Haley, founder of Holocene Advisors and formerly of Citadel, as a waiter passed around Hill Country’s sliders. Actor Ben Shenkman and Lauren Shenkman Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg Also in the crowd: Actor Ben Shenkman (his wife, Lauren, is the newly hired program director), who plays Paul Giamatti’s lawyer friend Ira on "Billions." "Empathy drives actors under ideal conditions -- but also competitiveness, narcissism and insecurity," Shenkman said. "Good acting sublimates all that stuff." And so, it seems, does a good party. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein saw his overall compensation fall slightly, reflecting lower revenues at the bank in the first half of 2016. Blankfein's overall pay declined 4 percent to $22 million, according to a regulatory filing. Goldman changed Blankfein's compensation structure by tying all of his equity awards to performance. It also eliminated a long-term incentive award. The bank revamped the pay structure after some shareholders raised concerns that it was overly complex. Blankfein and Citigroup Inc. CEO Mike Corbat were the only major bank CEOs whose pay was cut. Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian Moynihan's compensation surged 25 percent to $20 million, his biggest payday since taking the helm of the bank in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon and Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman saw more modest raises of 4 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Goldman shares rose 34 percent last year, thanks largely to a broad rally in U.S. bank stocks following the Nov. 8 election. Investors are betting that higher interest rates, as well as lighter regulation, lower taxes and faster economic growth promised by Trump will boost profits for lenders. The bank reported a 9 percent decline in net revenues for 2016, as a strong second half of the year in which events like Brexit and the U.S. presidential election spurred trading could not make up for a dismal first quarter across Wall Street. Goldman's return on equity (ROE), a measure that shows how well a bank uses shareholder money to generate profit, was 9.4 percent for 2016. That was below the 10 percent analysts believe is needed to cover a bank's cost of capital, but above U.S. peers which generated on average a 7.9 percent ROE in 2016. Goldman changed its performance-based awards for executives to reflect the bank's ROE relative to peers. Goldman Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz received total compensation of $20 million in 2016, a decline of 5 percent from the year prior.  © 2017 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved.

Here are some top contenders for your consideration. Selena Maranjian (TMFSelena) Mar 17, 2017 at 1:08PM Credit cards can make our financial lives easier if we're smart about how we use them -- such as not charging more than we can afford. We need to be smart about choosing our credit cards, too. They may all look the same -- slick plastic rectangles embossed with our name -- but some will serve you far better than others. Here's a look at some of the best credit cards available, in several categories, such as rewards and cash-back cards, balance-transfer and low-interest rate cards, and travel cards. Image source: Getty Images. Note that each is generally best for many people -- but each will vary in how perfect it is for you. Learn more about these contenders to see which one(s) make the most sense for you, given your needs, your preferences, and your spending habits. Best rewards and cash-back credit cards These kinds of cards are sometimes dealt with separately, but they overlap quite a bit. Getting cash back, after all, is certainly a reward. And many rewards cards issue "points" that can be redeemed in place of cash. Following are some top contenders. Note that each has its own terms and conditions and often some limitations on rewards that can be earned. Most offer additional benefits and perks, so take a close look at any card of interest. (We have full reviews available for most of the cards.) Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express: For the right cardholder, this card can deliver a lot of cash back. Its main offering is 6% cash back at supermarkets (on up to $6,000 in annual spending, after which it becomes 1% cash back), 3% cash back at gas stations, and 1% cash back on everything else. If you spend $6,000 or more at the supermarket (that's about $115 per week), you're looking at $360 or more in cash back just for that. The card does sport a $95 annual fee, but many people will find it well worth that. If you're not one of those, you might prefer the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express, which charges no annual fee and offers 3% back at the supermarket, 2% back at gas stations, and 1% back on everything else. The card also has a special offer in effect as of this writing: If you apply by May 3, 2017, you can earn 10% back on what you spend at U.S. restaurants in the first six months -- up to earnings of $200. On top of that, you can earn $150 if you spend $1,000 on the card in your first three months. (Read our full review of the Blue Cash Preferred® from American Express to learn more.)  Image source: Pixabay. Citi® Double Cash Card: This card looks like it offers 1% cash back on just about all purchases, but it actually offers 2%. It pays you 1% cash back when you make a purchase -- and then another 1% back when you pay off that sum. Better still, there's no annual fee. Balance transfers don't earn cash back, but they do enjoy a 0% APR (annual percentage rate) for the first 18 months. On the other hand, they will also cost you either $5 or 3% of the value of the transfer, whichever is greater. That would amount to a $150 fee on a $5,000 transfer, which is why this is a great cash back card but not the best balance transfer card. (Read our full review of the Citi® Double Cash Card to learn more.) Chase Freedom UnlimitedSM: This card offers 1.5% cash back on all purchases, with no limit. The APR is 0% for the first 15 months, even for balance transfers -- though those are also subject to a fee of $5 or 5% of the amount transferred, whichever is greater. You can collect a $150 bonus once you spend $500 in your first three months. There's no annual fee, either. (Read our full review of Chase Freedom UnlimitedSM  to learn more.) Chase Sapphire Preferred®: This card is best suited for travelers. A key appeal is that it awards you 50,000 points once you spend $4,000 on the card in your first three months. Those points are worth $625 in travel expenses when you redeem them through Chase Ultimate Rewards®. It's also good for those who like to eat out, as you'll earn double points for spending on travel and meals at restaurants. There's a $95 annual fee -- but it's waived in the first year. (Read our full review of Chase Sapphire Preferred® to learn more.)  Image source: Pixabay. Best balance-transfer and low-interest rate cards These two kinds of cards also overlap, as folks seeking to transfer a balance want a low interest rate. The following three contenders deserve your consideration. Barclaycard Ring™ MasterCard®: This card charges no balance transfer fee, and its initial APR is 0% for the first 15 months for transfers made within 45 days of opening the account. The card also offers online access to your FICO® credit score, which can be handy if you're working hard to pay off debts and beef up your score -- perhaps in preparation for getting a mortgage or taking on other debt. It doesn't charge foreign transaction fees, either, which is nice if you travel outside the United States. There's no annual fee.(Read our full review of Barclaycard Ring™ MasterCard® to learn more.) BankAmericard®: BankAmericard also charges no annual fee, though it does charge a balance transfer fee of 3% of the value of your transfer (or $10, whichever is greater). Its initial APR is 0% for the first 18 billing cycles for transfers made within 60 days of opening the account. After that, the APR is the lowest rate charged by any BankAmericard product. The card also offers online or mobile access to your FICO® credit score. (Read our full review of BankAmericard® to learn more.) Citi Simplicity® Card -- No Late Fees Ever: This card features no annual fee, along with "no late fees ever" and "no penalty rate ever." For balance transfers, it charges a fee of 3% of the value of your transfer or $5 -- whichever is greater. Its initial APR is 0% for 21 months for both purchases and balance transfers. (Read our full review of Citi Simplicity® Card to learn more.)  Image source: Pixabay. Best travel credit cards Travel cards come in various forms. Some are dedicated to one airline or one hotel chain, offering benefits and rewards when you frequent the specific company. Others are broader, offering a range of travel-related benefits and rewards. Here are some top contenders for your consideration: Barclaycard Arrival Plus™ World Elite MasterCard®: This card offers 50,000 bonus miles after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first 90 days -- enough for a $500 travel statement credit. You'll get double miles on all purchases, too, and 5% miles back toward your next redemption whenever you redeem miles. It does charge an annual fee, of $89, but that's waived for the first year. Your miles won't expire as long as your account is open, active, and in good standing, and you'll be charged no foreign transaction fees when traveling. You'll also get online access to your FICO score, among other perks. (Read our full review of Barclaycard Arrival Plus™ World Elite MasterCard® to learn more.) Chase Sapphire ReserveSM: This card also offers 50,000 bonus points -- once you spend $4,000 in the first three months -- but here the points convert into a $750 value when you redeem them through Chase Ultimate Rewards®. You'll earn triple points when spending on travel or restaurants, and when redeeming points for airfare, hotels, car rentals, or cruises, you'll get 50% more value for your points. The annual fee is a whopper -- $450 (plus $75 per authorized user) -- but it might be more palatable given the $300 annual travel credit. (Of course, if you don't travel within the year, you'll be out a lot of money.) Perks include access to airport lounges and no foreign transaction fees. (Read our full review of Chase Sapphire ReserveSM to learn more.) Starwood Preferred Guest® Credit Card from American Express: This card can serve you well if you spend a lot of time in hotels. It offers 25,000 bonus Starpoints® after you spend $3,000 on the card in the first three months (and if you sign up by April 5, it will tack on an additional 10,000 once you spend $2,000 more within the first six months). The annual fee is $95, which is waived in the first year. You'll earn Starpoints® when you spend at participating Starwood hotels (Starwood brands include W Hotels, Westin, Sheraton, and more -- and Starwood was recently bought by Marriott). You can spend Starpoints® at gobs of qualifying hotels worldwide and the points can be transferred to most major airline loyalty programs, too. BankAmericard Travel Rewards®: This card is valuable with any airline or hotel, any time. You'll receive 20,000 bonus points after spending at least $1,000 on the card in the first 90 days -- and those points are worth $200 in a statement credit toward travel purchases. There's no annual fee and no point expiration to worry about. If you have an active Bank of America checking or savings account, you can earn an extra 10% in points on every purchase. (Preferred Rewards clients can collect a bigger bonus, of 25% to 75%.) There are no foreign transaction fees. (Read our full review of BankAmericard Travel Rewards® to learn more.) Capital One® Venture® Rewards: With this card, you'll collect 40,000 bonus miles after spending $3,000 on purchases in your first three months. Beyond that, you'll earn two miles per dollar of purchases overall. The annual fee is $59, which is waived in the first year. There are no foreign transaction fees.

Funding an acquisition through bonds rather than cash is unusual, bankers said. In a coup of sorts, JPMorgan Chase & Co is sole book runner and underwriter to the transaction and will be raising the resources on behalf of the Agarwal family office. The bonds will be exchanged either for cash or for Anglo American shares in 2020. The fund-raising is expected to get completed by next week, multiple sources close to the process told ET. The three-year instrument is being offered with annual coupon payments of about 3.75-4.2% and Volcan will pledge Anglo American shares that it accumulates as a security to the transaction. In addition, Anil Agarwal’s flagship London-listed entity Vedanta Resources will pledge nearly one third of the promoter holding as an additional security to bond buyers, sources said. While JPMorgan is a kind of guarantor for the investors, the Anglo shares are the underlying assets, explained a domestic debt market expert, who is not authorised to talk to the media. JPMorgan has entered into a private agreement with Agarwal whereby he has pledged a portion of his shares in Vedanta. The unique structure is being planned as buying such a large chunk of Anglo shares would be time-consuming and the price would rise significantly over that period. This instrument on the other hand has been conceived on the back of expectations that buyers of the convertible bonds will sell their Anglo shares short to hedge exposure. That in turn will help Agarwal build up his stake. “Agarwal is not using cash to acquire Anglo shares. That means, he is not risking himself to buy shares,” said Rakesh Arora, managing director of Go India Advisors. “Though he won’t get any board seat at the moment, the deal would give him firepower to influence board decisions, including strategic sale of assets of Anglo.” A banker who praised the move, said companies don’t use the avenue very often. “By doing this, the promoter is selling equity forwards or buying an option to acquire the shares. And, he has got a three-year window, which is a pretty long time in the commodity space,” the person said. Under the structure, bond investors will be bankrolling the acquisition, said Chirag Shah, senior vice-president, Phillip Capital. “Right now, they would be earning high interest rate but if the issuer (Volcan) fails to repay, they will end up part owning Anglo American shares.” INVESTOR INTEREST An investment banker at a large domestic private bank said: “High-yield investors show interest on such papers. Investors of these instruments are not purely debt investors but institutions with investment mandate for both debt and equity. By floating such a product, the promoter is selling equities forwards as the investors may be converting into equities. Agarwal made a surprise bid for up to 13% of British mining giant Anglo American Plc for $2.4 billion, a move that will give him a foot in the door of the $23-billion conglomerate, which is larger than his Vedanta Resources. It also gives him a piece of De Beers, the diamond powerhouse owned by Anglo American. The move comes after a failed merger proposal between Vedanta and Anglo American last year. Globally mandatory convertible bonds have an outstanding issuance of $22,965 million ($22.97 billion), show data from Bloomberg. During this calendar year, issuers have collectively sold about $2,702 million ($2.70 billion) worth of such instruments. The instrument is a type of convertible bond that has a required conversion or redemption feature at a given date. Either on or before a contractual conversion date, the holder must convert it into the underlying common stock. These securities provide investors with higher yields to compensate holders for the mandatory conversion structure, according to Investopedia.

It also eliminated a long-term incentive award. The bank revamped the pay structure after some shareholders raised concerns that it was overly complex. Blankfein and Citigroup Inc CEO Mike Corbat were the only major bank CEOs whose pay was cut. Bank of America Corp CEO Brian Moynihan's compensation surged 25 percent to $20 million, his biggest payday since taking the helm of the bank in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon and Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman saw more modest raises of 4 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Goldman shares rose 34 percent last year, thanks largely to a broad rally in U.S. bank stocks following the Nov. 8 election. Investors are betting that higher interest rates, as well as lighter regulation, lower taxes and faster economic growth promised by Trump will boost profits for lenders. The bank reported a 9 percent decline in net revenues for 2016, as a strong second half of the year in which events like Brexit and the U.S. presidential election spurred trading could not make up for a dismal first quarter across Wall Street. Goldman's return on equity (ROE), a measure that shows how well a bank uses shareholder money to generate profit, was 9.4 percent for 2016. That was below the 10 percent analysts believe is needed to cover a bank's cost of capital, but above U.S. peers which generated on average a 7.9 percent ROE in 2016.Goldman changed its performance-based awards for executives to reflect the bank's ROE relative to peers. Goldman Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz received total compensation of $20 million in 2016, a decline of 5 percent from the year prior.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio BLink Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker ‘Our aim: not just a transaction, but an experience’ Tanya Thomas comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet RADHIKA GUPTA ,CEO, Edelweiss AMC We are going to be launching loyalty programmes for our distributors, and a lot of new initiatives are starting from April 1 Just a little over a month after she took over the reins at Edelweiss Asset Management and fresh after completing the acquisition of JP Morgan’s mutual fund business, Radhika Gupta says the fund house now has a wider suite of products for investors. The fund house’s assets under management now stand at Rs 7,300 crore. In an interview with BusinessLine, Gupta says the AMC wants to focus on quality and not asset size. Now that the acquisition is complete and the fund management teams have fully transitioned, what should investors expect to see different and what will stay the same? Edelweiss started as a niche fund house where we were playing to our strengths, we were doing risk-adjusted funds, like the absolute return fund. Post the JP Morgan acquisition, we’ve become more broad-based in our offering. So investors now have the traditional long-only option, fixed income option and the risk-adjusted play to choose from. That doesn’t mean that we will become a fund house with 45 different schemes. The two planks on which we’re building the business are quality and focus. So we only plan to have 2-3 flagship equity funds and 2-3 risk-adjusted funds and a limited set of fixed income funds. From Edelweiss’ (the group’s) point of view, a lot more time and attention will go into the AMC business so that what investors get from us is not just a transaction but an experience Edelweiss has so many different lines of business, and we’ve been thinking about how we can pool that knowledge to our investors and partners. We want to bring insights of other parts of the market to our partners to help them have better discussions with their clients. We are going to be launching loyalty programmes for our distributors, and a lot of new initiatives are starting from April 1. We’re building our institutional sales team and strengthening our business in the south. Our team will be almost 100-plus team by the end of the financial year, almost double of what we had earlier. One of the important debates in the industry now is about costs to investors and how that must come down. Do you think mutual funds are expensive? I think mutual funds are the most cost-effective and best regulated options for an investors. It offers daily liquidity, high oversight, no governance issues, complete transparency; for 1.5-2 per cent, it offers professional management of your money. This is without adjusting for the fact that financial literacy is very low in India and the cost of servicing investors is very high. In India, about 85 per cent of mutual funds have outperformed their benchmarks, unlike in the US. This is when benchmarks are themselves doing well, at 10-11 per cent gains a year and the average largecap fund is returning 14-15 per cent. To service the investor who puts in Rs 10,000 a month to move from fixed deposits to equity and to stay in equity is difficult. So if total headline costs come down further, it’s bad for the industry because it will affect both the AMCs and the distributors. We need to make this business financially lucrative for good quality players to stay in the business over the long term. The fund industry is running on SIP inflows now but you don’t have a very strong SIP book. Is that going to be a focus area? We haven’t marketed our SIP offering because we didn’t have long-only funds till the JP Morgan acquisition. Today, we have about 15,000 SIP folios and we want to focus on it. We want to eventually build scale but for the next 2-3 years we want to build a quality business. I think 6-7 years later, we’ll want to be in the top five (by AUM size) in the business. Otherwise it doesn’t make sense to do this business. But I don’t want a business that 90 per cent liquid assets. We’re here to build quality.

Quotes in the article Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS ▼ 242.14 -1.80 -0.74% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 90.03 -0.65 -0.72% Morgan Stanley MS ▼ 44.59 -0.43 -0.96% Bank of America Corporation BAC ▼ 24.44 -0.42 -1.69% Blankfein, 62, received $16 million in performance shares and a $4 million cash bonus, in addition to his $2 million salary, the New York-based firm said Friday in its annual proxy filing. Unlike past years, all of the CEO’s equity-based awards were linked to performance. Goldman Sachs redesigned its compensation structure for 2016 after investors complained that the long-term incentive was overly complex. The bank also changed the performance-based awards to reflect the company’s relative performance. The changes came after an advisory vote on pay at last year’s annual meeting received the least support since such votes were instituted in 2009. Blankfein becomes the third-highest paid CEO of the six largest U.S. banks. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon received $28 million; Morgan Stanley’s James Gorman $22.5 million; Bank of America Corp. Brian T. Moynihan $20 million; and Citigroup Inc.’s Mike Corbat $15.5 million. Wells Fargo & Co.’s Tim Sloan, who became CEO in October, got $12.8 million. Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs’s president before leaving to become President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, received $20 million for 2016, as did Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz and Michael Sherwood, a vice chairman who left last year. Cohn and his wife also received about $12.1 million from selling their stakes in hedge funds and private-equity funds managed by the firm. The divestment was required by ethics guidance Cohn received as part of his move to the government. Performance Shares Goldman Sachs increased the share of Blankfein’s compensation that’s tied to performance to 80 percent of his variable pay by linking all of his stock awards to absolute and relative return on equity, compared with eight other global banks. In prior years, a portion of the shares had been tied only to a requirement that he remain in the job. The change also was made for Schwartz, 53, who was named with David Solomon to replace Cohn as co-presidents of the firm. The awards will pay out half in cash and half in stock. In prior years, the performance-based awards were disbursed solely in cash. Proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co. raised concerns about the long-term incentive plan in a report last year, calling it “troubling both in its design and lack of transparent disclosure,” and said it could “generate excessive payouts.” Goldman Sachs received about two-thirds support from shareholders for its 2015 executive compensation decisions, the lowest result since the bank introduced annual advisory votes on pay in 2009. In response, the firm sought feedback from investors holding about 40 percent of its stock. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

News Week In Review: Fed Hikes, Intel Buys Mobileye, Software Earnings Boom, IPOs Strong IBD STAFF 3/17/2017 Reprints The Federal Reserve raised interest rates but didn't signal that it plans to be more aggressive, sending stocks slightly higher and bond yields sharply lower. Intel (INTC) is buying Mobileye (MBLY), putting its chips on self-driving cars, as Tesla (TSLA) raises cash for its big bet on the Model 3. Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe Systems (ADBE) reported strong cloud revenue. Snap (SNAP) continued to tumble to fresh post-IPO lows, but other new issues had strong debuts. Stocks Edge Up On Fed, Big-Cap Techs The Nasdaq composite rose 0.7% for the week, briefly hitting an all-time high Friday afternoon, helped by Oracle as well as the ongoing strength of Apple (AAPL) and the FANG internet stocks.. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.1% and the S&P 500 index 0.2%, as the Fed raised rates but didn't signal a faster pace of hikes going forward.  The 10-year Treasury yield tumbled from recent peaks on the "dovish rate hike," pressuring bank stocks such as the Dow's JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Homebuilders rallied on the lower yields, while steel stocks climbed on bullish earnings forecasts. Fed Hikes, But Doesn't Signal Faster Rate Rises The Federal Reserve gave financial markets what they wanted, hiking rates a quarter-point, as expected, but stuck to its plan for two more hikes this year and three next year. Policymakers' recent hawkish signals had markets bracing for a quicker ramp-up. The news was great for homebuilders like Lennar (LEN) and Toll Brothers (TOL), since it means that mortgage rates may stabilize for a time after their recent run-up, helping boost the spring selling season. Financials like Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS), which had been pushing higher on hopes for faster rate hikes that can help lift net interest margins, took a breather after the Fed news. RELATED: Fed Hikes Interest Rates But Doesn't Signal Faster Tightening Pace These 2 Builders Near Buy Points As Housing Starts Extend Fed Rally Bank Stocks Snubbed In Fed-Led Rally: Here's Why Intel Chases Nvidia With Mobileye Deal Chip giant Intel (INTC) announced a deal to buy Mobileye (MBLY), a maker of advanced driver assistance systems, for $15.3 billion. Analysts described the deal as a defensive acquisition for Intel to compete against Nvidia (NVDA), which has been scoring numerous partnerships to supply the artificial-intelligence processing power for self-driving cars. Nvidia's latest partnerships are with auto parts supplier Bosch to bring self-driving cars to the masses and with truck maker Paccar (PCAR) to develop autonomous trucks. Nvidia Forges Alliance To Bring Self-Driving Cars To The Masses Why Analysts Say Intel's Mobileye Deal Is 'Defensive' Driving Nvidia Teams With Paccar To Make Self-Driving Trucks Tesla Raising Cash, Investors Relieved Tesla announced that it would sell $750 million in convertible debt and $250 million in stock. With underwriter options, Tesla will likely raise $1.15 billion. That's less than some analysts had expected after CEO Elon Musk warned that the Model 3 would push cash levels "close to the edge." Tesla rose on the funding news after soaring on a report that the company will release a small SUV next year. Tesla shares rose 7.3% for the week. RELATED: Tesla Will Raise $1 Billion In Stock, Debt; Investors No Longer On 'Edge' Oracle Cloud Boom Fuels Earnings Oracle reported fiscal Q3 earnings that cruised past estimates as the software giant's transition to a cloud-based model picks up momentum. Oracle, which three years ago began a concerted push into cloud computing, said its software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service non-GAAP revenue jumped 85% to $1.1 billion, as total cloud revenue reached $1.2 billion, up 62%. Oracle's traditional software licensing business fell 16% as the company transitions. Oracle leapt 6% on Thursday, hitting an all-time intraday high. RELATED: Oracle Turns A Corner As Cloud Revenues Boom, Earnings Top Adobe Tops Q1 Views, Guides Higher Digital media and marketing software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) posted better-than-expected sales and earnings for its fiscal first quarter and gave Q2 targets ahead of forecasts. Adobe stock jumped to record high territory on the news. In Q1, Adobe earned 94 cents a share excluding items, up 42% year over year, on sales of $1.68 billion, up 22%. Analysts were looking for 87 cents and $1.65 billion. For Q2, Adobe guided analyst estimates slightly higher. Adobe shares soared to a record high Friday. RELATED: Adobe Stock Soars On Q1 Beat-And-Raise Report New IPOs Strong As Snap Keeps Falling MuleSoft (MULE) popped 46% in Friday's trading debut after pricing its IPO late Thursday at 17, above its upwardly revised range of 14-16. Outdoor apparel maker Canada Goose (GOOS) popped 26% in Thursday's debut and kept rising Friday. Oilfield services provider ProPetro (PUMP) priced low but rose 3.6% in its debut. The hope has been that the recent IPO of Snapchat operator Snap will lead to a burst of new issues. But after a strong IPO pricing at 17, a 44% first-day gain and a record high of 29.44 the next day, Snap shares have plunged to post-IPO lows, tumbling 11.5% for the week. RELATED: MuleSoft IPO Packs A Punch As Stock Pops On Market Debut Canada Goose Flies In Debut As Snap Digs Hole; Tech Unicorn Prices Late Oil Prices Stop Falling Crude oil prices rose 0.6% to $48.78 a barrel for the week after a big seven-session sell-off. The International Energy Agency said if OPEC keeps its production levels steady until June, the market would see a deficit of 500,000 barrels per day in the first half of the year. Right on cue, the Energy Information Administration reported a surprise 237,000-barrel drop in weekly U.S. crude stockpiles last week. Earlier, Saudi Arabia said it raised its crude output to 10.011 million barrels per day in February, up 2.7% from January, but still under the target agreed to under a production-cut deal. RELATED: Oil Falls For 7th Day As Saudis Report Output Hike After Warning U.S. Shale Firms Oil Prices Snap 7-Day Losing Streak As Supplies Drop, IEA Urges Markets To 'Hold Nerve' Why Oil Prices May Come Under Even More Pressure Snow, Capacity Concerns Hit Airlines Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) got dinged early in the week after Winter Storm Stella forced thousands of flight cancellations. But the airlines got a potential break after federal judges halted key provisions in President Trump's travel ban. In between, United raised its full-year capacity outlook. That gives travelers more options, but the expansion carries risks of overestimating demand and a competitive response from rival airlines. United last month said it would add service to 31 new destinations to serve areas that connect to its airport hubs. Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) this week stepped up its offerings on the West Coast. United stock slid 7.7% for the week, while Delta lost 5.1% and American 2.9%.

AstraZeneca's Lynparza met its primary endpoint, hitting a median 19.1 months of progression-free survival vs. 5.5 months for patients on the placebo. In a similar trial, Tesaro's niraparib delayed reoccurrence of ovarian cancer for 21 months. A best-case review found Lynparza delayed ovarian cancer's return by a median 30.2 months. Meanwhile, Valeant Pharmaceuticals stock plunged to an eight-year low after William Ackman sold Pershing Square's entire stake in the ailing drugmaker. Pershing held 8% of Valeant, or about 27.2 million shares. Amgen announced its cholesterol drug Repatha trimmed the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death, but not as much as some had hoped. Amgen shares fell 6.4% Friday. Regeneron (REGN), Medicines Co. (MDCO) and Esperion (ESPR) also tumbled.

Health Debate Shares of hospitals and Medicaid-focused insurers slid following Monday's late-day Congressional Budget Office score showing House Speaker Paul Ryan's ObamaCare repeal bill would slash Medicaid funding by one-third and leave 24 million more Americans uninsured. Despite political blowback for RyanCare from both moderate and conservative Republicans, and uncertainty over the bill's chances, a cloud remained over the hospital group. Through Thursday trading, Tenet Healthcare (THC) was off sharply for the week while HCA Holdings (HCA) also slid. Insurers bounced back, with Molina Healthcare (MOH), Centene (CNC) and Anthem (ANTM) closing the week with slim gains. RELATED: Health Care Stocks Socked Again After CBO RyanCare Score Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else Hates YY Soars Despite Weak Outlook China social networking company YY (YY) reported Q4 earnings beat estimates, but delivered a first-quarter outlook below consensus views. YY reported adjusted earnings of $1.40 per American depositary receipt, topping the consensus estimate of $1.03. Revenue rose 31% in local currency to $357.8 million, fueled by users who pay for its live streaming services. YY shares initially reversed lower on the Q1 outlook, but rallied to end the week up 8.9%. Meanwhile Momo (MOMO), which recently reported booming revenue from live streaming video, continued to rally for fresh highs. China's YY Earnings Beat On Video Growth; But Outlook Short Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) both raised first-quarter earnings guidance well above views, sending both steel stocks higher.   Share this: Related news Stocks Mixed As Oil Slides; Dow, Nasdaq Finish Flat; How High Can Apple Go? 3/20/2017 Stocks ended narrowly mixed Monday as the Nasdaq backed off a record high and the Dow was flat despite gains... 3/20/2017 Stocks ended narrowly mixed Monday as the Nasdaq backed off...

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein speaks during the plenary session titled ''Equality for Girls and Women: 2034 Instead of 2134?'' at the Clinton Global Initiative 2014 (CGI) in New York, September 24, 2014. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton By Olivia Oran Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein saw his overall compensation fall slightly, reflecting lower revenues at the bank in the first half of 2016. Blankfein's overall pay declined 4 percent to $22 million, according to a regulatory filing. Goldman changed Blankfein's compensation structure by tying all of his equity awards to performance. It also eliminated a long-term incentive award. The bank revamped the pay structure after some shareholders raised concerns that it was overly complex. Blankfein and Citigroup Inc CEO Mike Corbat were the only major bank CEOs whose pay was cut. Bank of America Corp CEO Brian Moynihan's compensation surged 25 percent to $20 million, his biggest payday since taking the helm of the bank in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon and Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman saw more modest raises of 4 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Goldman shares rose 34 percent last year, thanks largely to a broad rally in U.S. bank stocks following the Nov. 8 election. Investors are betting that higher interest rates, as well as lighter regulation, lower taxes and faster economic growth promised by Trump will boost profits for lenders. The bank reported a 9 percent decline in net revenues for 2016, as a strong second half of the year in which events like Brexit and the U.S. presidential election spurred trading could not make up for a dismal first quarter across Wall Street. Goldman's return on equity (ROE), a measure that shows how well a bank uses shareholder money to generate profit, was 9.4 percent for 2016. That was below the 10 percent analysts believe is needed to cover a bank's cost of capital, but above U.S. peers which generated on average a 7.9 percent ROE in 2016. Goldman changed its performance-based awards for executives to reflect the bank's ROE relative to peers. Goldman Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz received total compensation of $20 million in 2016, a decline of 5 percent from the year prior.

Blankfein, 62, received $16 million in performance shares and a $4 million cash bonus, in addition to his $2 million salary, the New York-based firm said Friday in its annual proxy filing. Unlike past years, all of the CEO’s equity-based awards were linked to performance. Goldman Sachs redesigned its compensation structure for 2016 after investors complained that the long-term incentive was overly complex. The bank also changed the performance-based awards to reflect the company’s relative performance. The changes came after an advisory vote on pay at last year’s annual meeting received the least support since such votes were instituted in 2009. Blankfein becomes the third-highest paid CEO of the six largest U.S. banks. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon received $28 million; Morgan Stanley’s James Gorman $22.5 million; Bank of America Corp. Brian T. Moynihan $20 million; and Citigroup Inc.’s Mike Corbat $15.5 million. Wells Fargo & Co.’s Tim Sloan, who became CEO in October, got $12.8 million. Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs’s president before leaving to become President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, received $20 million for 2016, as did Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz and Michael Sherwood, a vice chairman who left last year. Cohn and his wife also received about $12.1 million from selling their stakes in hedge funds and private-equity funds managed by the firm. The divestment was required by ethics guidance Cohn received as part of his move to the government. Performance Shares Goldman Sachs increased the share of Blankfein’s compensation that’s tied to performance to 80 percent of his variable pay by linking all of his stock awards to absolute and relative return on equity, compared with eight other global banks. In prior years, a portion of the shares had been tied only to a requirement that he remain in the job. The change also was made for Schwartz, 53, who was named with David Solomon to replace Cohn as co-presidents of the firm. The awards will pay out half in cash and half in stock. In prior years, the performance-based awards were disbursed solely in cash. Proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co. raised concerns about the long-term incentive plan in a report last year, calling it “troubling both in its design and lack of transparent disclosure,” and said it could “generate excessive payouts.” Goldman Sachs received about two-thirds support from shareholders for its 2015 executive compensation decisions, the lowest result since the bank introduced annual advisory votes on pay in 2009. In response, the firm sought feedback from investors holding about 40 percent of its stock. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Subscribe By Ami Albernaz Credit is essential for most businesses to grow, seize opportunities and fill in cash-flow gaps. In a recent Chase for Business survey of 2,600 business owners, around 70% reported that they use some form of financing. JPMorgan Chase There's a range of credit options to choose from if you're a business owner. The trick is finding the one that best matches your needs and objectives. There's a range of credit options to choose from if you're a business owner. The trick is finding the one that best matches your needs and objectives. To help you sort through the choices, we've outlined the most common types of credit. Term loans A term loan is what you might think of as a traditional loan. Your business receives money to use over a fixed period of time. Term loans work best for purchasing assets that you expect to increase your revenues over an extended period, such as equipment or vehicles. Loans with fixed interest rates allow you to predict your payments and can help protect your cash flow while you benefit from the asset. SBA loans The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers loan programs for companies that may not meet conventional lending requirements. Though SBA loans are offered through banks, the government guarantees a substantial portion of them—making them less risky for lenders. The government guarantee also means that SBA loans often have higher borrowing limits and longer repayment periods. The primary types of SBA loans are general business 7(a) loans; CDC/504 loans, which are generally used to buy equipment, machinery or real estate; and microloans of up to $50,000 to help small businesses start up and expand. You can find more information about each loan type on sba.gov. Lines of credit Lines of credit provide a pool of money that you can tap as needed, and you pay interest only on the amount you use. It's a revolving account, so as you pay back what you owe, you may borrow again up to your credit limit. This type of financing is usually used to cover short-term expenses, such as inventory or payroll. Lines of credit usually have a variable interest rate. You may have to pledge some assets as collateral; in cases where you don't have to pledge anything, the line of credit may have a higher interest rate and lower borrowing limit. Equipment financing Some lenders offer financing options specifically for equipment purchases such as a delivery trucks, refrigeration units or packaging machinery. These options vary among lenders, and may be structured as term loans, lines of credit or a hybrid of the two. Equipment financing may offer businesses more flexible repayment terms than traditional loans, and in some cases, may not require a down payment. Some lenders may also finance a small percentage of "soft" costs, such as sales taxes or installation. Business credit cards For some businesses, credit cards may be easier to qualify for than other short-term financing sources. They're convenient for routine purchases, while the ability to delay payment until the end of each billing cycle can help you manage cash flow. Credit cards can be a steppingstone to other types of credit, since making consistent, on-time payments helps to build a solid credit history. Many business credit cards also offer rewards that accumulate with purchases, such as airline miles, cash back or additional bonus points. For example, the Ink Business PreferredSM credit card offers 3x points for transactions in certain business categories, such as advertising purchases made with social media sites and search engines. Equity financing Instead of taking on debt, you could sell a stake in your business to an investor or group of investors who hope to make a substantial profit. Equity investors, including angel investors and venture capital firms, typically look for young companies with high growth potential, such as software, biotechnology and e-commerce firms. They can often provide valuable expertise and introductions, but their involvement generally means you'll have to share not only future profits but also some degree of control over the company.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe By Danielle Shapiro When Shama Hyder wrote her master's thesis about Twitter, in 2008, she initially thought people went online to connect with others and feel a sense of community. Instead, she learned that most people use social media to express their own identity. JPMorgan Chase Searching online for information can be overwhelming because there's so much material available. But governments and nonprofits can use social media to become trusted sources of wisdom for their audiences by cutting through the noise. That insight has helped Hyder as she went on to create the Marketing Zen Group, a global digital marketing and public relations firm, win numerous awards, write two books and become a frequent keynote speaker. During a recent Chase for Business webinar for government and nonprofit organizations, Hyder shared other key insights about social media marketing. "Marketing" often suggests selling or attracting customers, she explained, but it can also mean creating awareness or spreading messages. Governments and nonprofits, in particular, can use it to fundraise, recruit volunteers, or publicize services and events. Here are five ways to use social media to promote your organization: 1. Make your campaign about the user "It's not so much what your brand says about you," Hyder said, "but what interacting with you, what engaging with you, what volunteering, or giving back, or actually connecting on a civic level with you, allows an individual to say about their particular brand." The best social media marketing lets audiences say something about themselves through their online interactions, with the organization running the effort. The ALS Association took advantage of this principle with its 2014 Ice Bucket Challenge. Rather than simply talking about its mission, Hyder said the campaign allowed people to tell a story about themselves while connecting it to the fight against Lou Gehrig's disease. The entertaining campaign went viral and the association raised $115 million. 2. Collect and organize content Searching online for information can be overwhelming because there's so much material available. But governments and nonprofits can use social media to become trusted sources of wisdom for their audiences by cutting through the noise. The Dallas YMCA, a Marketing Zen Group client, worked with Hyder and her team to share messages related to swimming safety and become a leading voice on the topic. They posted infographics, blogs, and Instagram photos to provide their audience with essential, potentially life-saving, information. 3. Use video "Video, in general, is such a powerful tool," Hyder said. "It's the closest you can get to actually seeing someone face to face." She advises governments and nonprofits to incorporate video into their social media campaigns. Users are more likely to share, comment on, and "like" video content, according to a recent study by market research company Usurv. Facebook Live, which allows users to live stream videos, is a simple tool Hyder especially likes. It's easy to use, works on smartphones and, Hyder notes, live videos are even more engaging than static ones. 4. Let data guide your decisions For successful social media marketing, Hyder recommends using numbers to guide decisions. "The idea is not to go with things just because someone likes it," she said, "or, hey, you've always done it this way." For example, an organization can use Google Analytics to determine how much traffic it's getting from users on mobile devices. If it's a high number, but that organization's website isn't optimized for mobile phones and tablets, there's a missed opportunity to attract larger audiences. 5. Leverage the power of influencers to reach your audience Hyder's last tip for governments and nonprofits is to engage influential people popular with their target audience. Whether it's mommy bloggers, YouTube stars, actors or politicians, these individuals can amplify the reach of an organization's message. Comic Relief Inc., a nonprofit focused on reducing childhood poverty, did exactly that with their Red Nose Day fundraising campaign, Hyder said. By spotlighting well-known celebrities —who wore bright red clown noses while telling stories about themselves—the organization raised $34 million in 2016. Have a long-term strategy Hyder said the best social media marketing starts offline. Rather than sharing as much and as quickly as possible, Hyder encourages organizations to spend time crafting a unique campaign before posting anything. She also advises consistency. "It's the least sexy word, but it's so important," she said, noting that just one tweet or newsletter won't get results. It can take weeks or months of posting for success. "It's consistency that's going to win the game for you." Danielle Shapiro is a Chase News contributor.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe By Darin Oduyoye #1:  Lather, rinse, repeat. Yes, I’m the guy with the shaved head who just made a shampoo reference. But this approach can ultimately lead to increased responsibilities and new opportunities to tackle. It means that by doing something the right way you’ll become an expert and people will learn to rely on you. I chose public relations, specifically financial public relations, and in my career I’ve discovered that if you can demonstrate that you are THE go-to person on a subject, people believe you can propel that into other areas. JPMorgan Chase How to build your career one step at a time. #2:  Life is Long and Wide. Don’t get caught up on the little things. Sure, it is great to be focused on the future and achieving goals, but it’s just as important to have peripheral vision. Remember that the road is long AND wide, so be sure to live life in all directions. Think about it: There are no straight lines in nature. Cathie Black, the former Chairman of the Hearst magazine empire calls it “living a 360-degree life” – a full circle of experiences and people. Look ahead, but look around, too. A lot of great experiences, memories and living goes on in the margins. You’ll be surprised by what you might find when you stop to take a look. #3:  Learn to listen. As a communications specialist, I find this point to be second nature. But as I’ve learned, while anyone can report on an event or story, nine times out of ten, there’s only one person or publication that actually delivers “the news.” Learning to be an active listener will help you to ask the right questions and find opportunities within questions to work in your key messages (or priority points, as I call them). As author Stephen Covey once said, “Most people do not listen to understand. Most people listen to reply.” Remember, it’s hard to hear when your mouth is moving. #4:  It’s Your Story. Where you go is up to you. Every day, the choice is yours. I had a finance professor who was fond of an early Apple ad that said: “You have the choice. With choice comes power. With power comes a responsibility.” Figure out what is important to YOU. Seek out advice and relationships that will challenge you. That will help you develop good judgment, and help you learn and truly understand what is important and what is trivial; what is worthy and what is a distraction. Hope is not a strategy. Don’t wait for someone to assign you a mentor who can provide guidance – go out and get one on your own. #5:  “Be Tenacious.” No one exemplifies tenacity more than Alexander Hamilton, one of America’s most prolific founding fathers whom playwright genius Lin-Manuel Miranda brings to life in his landmark musical, “Hamilton: An American Musical.” In the opening lyrics of the show, Miranda writes: “How does a... Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a... Forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence... Impoverished, in squalor... Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?” Be tenacious. “Do not throw away your shot.” Find your dream and find a way to make it happen. #6:  Don’t be in a rush to get to the top. Brain power is essential, but there’s no substitute for knowledge gained through experience. Regardless of what you do, you’ll never be successful unless you’ve spent time in the trenches. While classes provide a foundation for learning skills, there is nothing that trumps actual work experience, especially if you experience a setback. That moment in my career came on Sept. 11, 2001. As tragedy struck the World Trade Center and Pentagon, I found myself thrown in to serving as the lead communicator for our division’s employees on security measures – whether to stay in the building or not; if you had to leave, what the process was for letting your manager know; what buses, trains, railways were open; what should we tell clients who call concerned about their precious belongings in the lockboxes at the World Trade Center. Then came the task of figuring out how we get information out more broadly – through email, voicemails, the loud speaker in the building. Nobody WANTS to go through these types of experiences, but it’s exactly those experiences that will guide you for the future. There’s no handbook to tell you what to do—you’ll write your own. #7:  Substance matters. Stay in touch with people. Be a good communicator. Using tools like Facebook and Twitter can be effective, but in reality, those are just tools – you cannot replace human contact. Quality – not quantity – of interactions and engagement should be your goal. Go beyond social media platforms to engage people and make sure your message is clear and compelling. Ultimately, it’s the message, not the vehicle that makes the impact. Darin Oduyoye is Chief Communications Officer for J.P.

Subscribe By Chase Small Business Ad Academy The proliferation of digital marketing and social media resources has made it easier than ever to pitch to Main Street--without Madison Avenue budgets. Mickey Mantas, ‎global agency and partner education consultant at LinkedIn, says these options let you be selective in how you spend digitally, and only "build a presence on the platforms that best represent you and your company." Don' t think of it as a one-time campaign; it'll evolve and grow as your business does. JPMorgan Chase Modestly-priced data-mining software can unearth sales and other customer information within your spreadsheets and reports, for insights you can act on: Personalizing offers and improving customer service. Chase assembled a panel of digital marketing experts—from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Yelp—to help you plan your 2017 social campaigns. Here are some of their suggestions: Go mobile: We consume virtually all information on-the-go, so your marketing platform should be "mobile-centric" instead of just "mobile-friendly." Messaging that isn't designed for mobile access and search will be less valuable in 2017. Create compelling content: Our attention spans continue to drop—now just eight seconds, on average, according to a Microsoft study. Grab readers' attention with information tailored to their needs and they'll come back for more. "Put your products, services, business and employees in your content," says Christian Eberhardt, sales manager at Twitter. “Use imagery and video to drive engagement." Dive into data: Modestly-priced data-mining software can unearth sales and other customer information within your spreadsheets and reports, for insights you can act on: Personalizing offers and improving customer service. Think big (without spending big): No business is too small for digital marketing. These resources let you spend wisely, to elevate visibility and reputation. Facebook's Global Head of Financial Services Strategy, Neil Hiltz says, "if people aren't aware of you, they're not going to buy your product." Focus on keyword search and search engine optimization to attract more attention. Pay the piper: Relying on organic means to find your audience stack the odds against you. Amplify your presence, impact and reach through paid advertising on key sites. Consider using the Chase Ink Business Preferred card, because of the flexible rewards you can earn purchasing these types of ads. Build a profile: Spending a few minutes on your LinkedIn and other social media profiles—and amplifying that visibility with well-placed, paid social media posts—will raise your digital profile and attract new customers better than traditional networking would. Ask permission: Nobody wants spam. Earn the respect of your customers, prospects and influencers through permission marketing—a selling approach that requires explicit agreement to receive emails, newsletters or texts. Send "push" content only to those who want it, and leave everyone else off your distribution lists. Try "buy" buttons: Consumers can make purchases in one click, without even leaving Facebook, YouTube and other social media sites. These "buy buttons" are gaining popularity and increase the likelihood of a completed purchase, while freeing you from investing in costly app development. Look locally: A hyper-local paid strategy targets customers by zip code, neighborhood or street name, connecting you with the audiences you most care about. Email often: The so-called death of email marketing has been greatly exaggerated. In fact, email continues to be one of the most useful, cost-effective marketing tools: 78% of consumers aged 35–44 rank it as the communication platform they most prefer, according to MarketingSherpa. Used appropriately, it can be a powerful marketing tool. With Chase Ink Business Preferred, earn 3X points on advertising purchases made with search engines and social media sites and in other select categories.

Subscribe By Marcus DiNitto As an Army captain from 2004-2009, Jed Richard led an Airborne Infantry unit that secured populations in areas as large as 50x50 kilometers in eastern Afghanistan. When fighting the Taliban and Al-Qaeda made it too dangerous for engineering units to operate, Richard was assigned secondary engineering and contracting duties. JPMorgan Chase As an Army captain from 2004-2009, Jed Richard led an Airborne Infantry unit that secured populations in areas as large as 50x50 kilometers in eastern Afghanistan. The West Point graduate with construction in his DNA (his father and grandfather owned construction companies) helped plan and build facilities that included local district headquarters, a school and medical center. His unit also built a bridge on the Arghandab River, which was destroyed by enemy forces the day after it opened. After honorably leaving the military in 2009, Richard returned to the U.S. to work with the U.S. Department of State as a private contractor. His teams planned the design and construction of new embassy compounds, safe havens and major security upgrades for U.S. diplomats in over 30 countries. Richard used the time working for two general contracting companies to gain a deeper understanding of the construction business. In 2014, at the age of 35, he drafted the business plan for a new company. The following year, his own firm—Richard Group—was born. Here he shared lessons from his military experience that small-business owners can use to grow their companies: Respect everyone Soldiers are taught to respect their commanders, their comrades, and even their enemies. Richard said small business owners should adhere to the same principles with employees, manufacturers, suppliers, subcontractors—and competition. "That's what we learn in the military, and while it might be more regimented there, it carries over into the civilian world, too," he said. Richard added that showing respect for subcontractors and helping them find solutions to maximize profits leads to them having faith in Richard Group. Every stakeholder needs a leader Tentativeness doesn't fly in the military, so Richard recognized the need for leadership across the company's various stakeholders. "Every client and employee needs a leader," he said. "Someone who's competent, capable and successful leading their demands, whether it's meetings, scheduling, safety, quality or budget constraints — someone to take charge of a project and see it through to completion." He added, "Employees recognize your confidence in meeting project challenges and begin to emulate these strengths." Be professional A company's reputation, Richard believes, is based on the reputation of its people. Therefore, everyone at the company, from the owner to its most entry-level employee, must demonstrate a high level of professionalism from the time they walk through the door to beyond the time they leave in the evening. As an entrepreneur, you probably have meetings or dinners with clients after the workday officially ends. When you do, don't let your guard down or ignore your company's core philosophies. Employees must also follow this principle when representing your company in off-hours. Persevere through tough times Even in the most difficult of times, it is crucial to stay positive, Richard said. Though the pressures a business owner and soldier face are different, the leader of a company must keep employees' spirits high as they persevere through rough patches. "You've got to have fun with what you're doing or there is no reason to spend all that time with your employees — you might as well go work for another company that makes you more happy," said Richard. Align vision with capabilities A military unit should not enter a battle without the proper planned resources. It should be 100 percent certain it is better prepared than its enemy in order to ensure victory and the safe return of its soldiers. The same concept applies to business and allows it to grow organically. "I am not going to force a 19-month-old company into a project that is not compatible with our systems, policies or procedures—or the financial backing—to support. Those jobs tend to fail. ... Not every project is the right project for a company," Richard said. Reinvest what you've learned, invest what you've earned Richard learned a new lesson every day of his military career. He reinvested the knowledge to become a better leader of his fellow soldiers. He applies the same concept of investing in his business. With less than $100,000 of capital with which to launch his business, Richard found a bank willing to extend him a credit card with zero percent interest for the first year. This helped him establish credit with vendors, suppliers and manufacturers and also gave him the opportunity to accumulate credit cards rewards points that could be invested in his company. He estimates that he has spent about $500,000 on his business credit card. "When you don't have credit history as a new company, being able to charge $20,000 to $30,000 on a zero percent interest card was huge while awaiting payments from customers. It freed up other cash to move the business forward," he says. Richard uses his rewards points on office supplies and gas, and has saved Richard Group nearly $6,000 in itemized travel expenses. "Overhead costs are tough for small businesses at the beginning," said Richard, whose company realized more than $7.5 million in new business in its first 18 months and projects $12 million in new business revenue in 2017.

Subscribe By Selina Wagowski When Maria Rios started her business in 1997, she wore a hard hat to work every day and learned how to drive a garbage truck. But when it came to getting the insight she needed to help grow her company, she was reluctant to ask for help. "Many small business owners are afraid to surround themselves with the right people," says Rios, president and chief executive officer of Houston-based Nation Waste, the first Latina-owned waste removal and recycling company in the U.S. JPMorgan Chase For entrepreneurs, the biggest challenge can be asking for help. Many entrepreneurs take pride in their self-reliance. But building a business often means learning how to build a team beyond hired employees. It means also finding trusted experts--such as accountants, lawyers, and bankers--who can help. For Latino business owners, in particular, this can be difficult. "Often, they are not used to going to banks, so they borrow money from family members," Rios says. Establishing a solid financial foundation is critical. But many Latino business owners are reluctant to share financial information with strangers, she adds. Rios, who emigrated from El Salvador as a child, worked at a waste hauling company while earning a bachelor's degree from the University of Houston. When she graduated, she wanted to start her own company. The trash business, though, is capital intensive. She needed half a million dollars for two trucks, and although she had savings, it wasn't enough. She set aside her fears, went to a bank and secured enough credit to buy the equipment. Today, nearly 20 years later, Nation Waste has 34 trucks, nearly 50 employees, and is one of Houston's largest minority-owned businesses. Many Latinos don't fully understand or aren't comfortable with credit, especially if they're new to the country, says Nely Galán, media entrepreneur and former Telemundo president. Galán is an advocate for small businesses and entrepreneurship and is the author of The New York Times best-seller "Self Made" that delivers advice and shares stories of success from small business owners. "It's important to understand the way business is done here," she says, which includes developing a strong relationship with a banker who understand the needs of your business. Latino-owned businesses are growing at more than 15 times the rate of other U.S. companies, and pumped more than $600 billion into the national economy last year, according to the market research firm Geoscape. However, while small-business loan applications for Latino entrepreneurs rose by 18 percent in 2015, many still struggle to get financing because they lack the credit scores, annual revenue, or enough years in business, according to a survey by Biz2Credit, which connects small businesses with lenders and other sources of funding. That's why it's particularly important for Latino business owners to build relationships that can help their companies grow financially. Minority business owners may find support in organizations such as the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, but Rios says it is important to network beyond your comfort zone. "You have to find the right places where the right people gather," says Rios, a panelist at a recent Chase for Business: Connecting Minds program that took place in Houston. Nearly 200 Latino small-business owners attended the event, one in a series that Chase is hosting for minority-owned businesses and entrepreneurs. That means networking with other industry groups, with small-business support organizations, and public forums that focus on small-business issues. Rios advises business owners to look at the boards of these organizations and approach board members who may be in a position to help or give advice. "Build relationships outside your normal circle of friends," says Ivette Mayo, who launched her consulting company, Yo Soy I Am, in 2006. "Friends want you to be happy. They may not give you the advice you need." Entrepreneurs should recognize they can't be an expert about all aspects of their business. "It's important to assess your strengths so that you can bring in the people to help you," Mayo says. "One of my first strategic partners was my attorney." Then she brought in an accountant who helped her create a business plan and evaluate her company's strengths, costs, and growth potential. Thanks to the expertise Mayo tapped, Yo Soy I Am today provides consulting and cultural competency training to companies such as H&R Block. A related company she founded, Yo Soy Expressions, makes bilingual stationery. Along the way, Mayo learned what she calls "the power of the ask." Entrepreneurs pride themselves on self-sufficiency, but by asking for assistance, you will find new ideas that will help your business grow. Galán says when she started her own production company in 1994, she asked for advice on topics beyond her experience and hired tutors to teach her about everything from social media to finance. "The journey of being self-made is humbling," Galán says. "The secret to entrepreneurship is not that we were brave once, but that we are brave over and over again." Galán knows all about bravery. She started selling Avon products as a young child to help pay for her schooling after she heard her father worrying about the tuition. Eventually, she became the first Latina president of a U.S. television network in 1998 and produced more than 600 award-winning shows in English and Spanish. She went on to create and produce the reality show "The Swan" for Fox in 2004 and appeared on NBC's "Celebrity Apprentice with Donald Trump" in 2008. Galán speaks throughout the U.S. and Latin America about entrepreneurship and women's empowerment. She encourages small-business owners to take any opportunity to build relationships. Mayo, for example, made a contact at a conference who got her a meeting with Wal-Mart. That, in turn, led to a meeting with Hallmark, which helped launch her bilingual greeting cards. "We forget sometimes that we live in a country where success repeats itself," Galán says. "If you stay home, nothing happens. You have to go out and start building contacts." Not all the relationship-building works out, Mayo cautions. Soon after founding her company, her lawyer recommended she set up a website. She was afraid she couldn't afford it, so she asked a website designer for an estimate. He immediately registered her domain name, forcing her to buy it back from him later. The experience made her much more cautious. Now, she gets non-disclosure agreements from potential partners. And she shares her experience with other business owners, reminding them of the value of learning from others. No business succeeds in a vacuum, but rather depends on the outside relationships you build. Mayo's key advice for all small-business owners, especially Latino entrepreneurs, is simple: "You are not alone." Selina Wagowski is a Chase News contributor. She focuses on small businesses.

"Ten years ago, if you bought something online, you were just happy that it arrived," says Brian Rimmer, managing director of customer experience for consulting firm Slalom, in New York City. "Now you want minute-to-minute status and you want to know if it will show up in a day or less." JPMorgan Chase For many people, this culture of immediacy is exciting and helpful—a kind of extreme convenience. But for small businesses, expectations of prompt service can create a demand that's difficult to meet, particularly when so many large companies are already delivering. As the use of the internet has spread, and the technologies available to companies to do business online and globally have become more sophisticated, people now expect to be able to get whatever they want, whenever they want it. For many people, this culture of immediacy is exciting and helpful—a kind of extreme convenience. But for small businesses, expectations of prompt service can create a demand that's difficult to meet, particularly when so many large companies are already delivering. Still, there are strategies small-business owners can use—from making their websites compatible with mobile devices, to hiring staff whose sole job it is to respond to customers rapidly—to help meet the needs for instant service. Making these accommodations is key, because competition in the immediate gratification industry is stiff. Amazon Prime members can get many items in two business days. In more than two dozen cities, Amazon Prime Now members can order certain items--tooth paste, soda, or a calculator--before noon, and receive it the same day, or even within an hour. "I needed to review a long report, and it was driving me crazy looking at charts online," says Susan Dzierson, vice president of human resources for a nonprofit biomedical research institute in San Francisco—one of the cities serviced by Amazon Prime Now. She ordered a printer and paper, and the items arrived at her house in a half-hour. "I love delivery services—particularly for anything large and heavy!" she says. Social media and around-the-clock news have also encouraged this nonstop economy. Facebook and Twitter never sleep. One recent study found that Americans collectively look at their smartphones more than 8 billion times a day. Some of this can be traced to millennials—a generation that grew up with the internet and smartphones, and an unprecedented abundance of information. Unlike their parents, who remember what it was like to visit a library to write a term paper, millennials live in a world in which they can use services like Chase QuickPay to split the bill at dinner. Just use the Chase app to instantly send cash to other Chase QuickPay members. No breaking of twenties necessary. For businesses, Uber—an instant gratification service itself—has launched UberRUSH to connect companies with a courier to make fast deliveries. It's only available in San Francisco, Chicago and New York at the moment, but the company has plans for expansion. When getting paid quickly matters most, Chase Express Funding allows small-business owners to receive funds from customers' card purchases the next business day, rather than the more typical several-day processing. Customers who have business checking and merchant services accounts with Chase can take advantage of this benefit. "Small businesses are very passionate about their cash flow," says Allison Bennett, Chief Marketing Officer of Chase for Business℠. "Many small businesses wait several days to receive their funds. We're hoping to solve that problem for them." Having both business checking and merchant services accounts with Chase has its advantages. It provides an opportunity to organize several of your financial services into one relationship. Here are seven strategies that small-business owners are using to meet instant-service demands around the country: Make customer contact ASAP: At Fit Small Business, a resource website, clients use an online form to request a consultation or demonstration. "The chances of us closing with them is 80 percent higher if we call them back in five minutes," says Marc Prosser, a small-business expert and co-founder of the company. "If we don't, they'll go to a different provider." If you're out of your office, make sure you have calls forwarded to your cell phone. And if someone fills out a form for your business, have auto responders that can quickly provide information. Designate someone to handle immediate requests: "I hired a permanent member of staff to handle phone calls from customers," says Max Robinson, who owns Ace Work Gear UK, which sells workwear, power tools and safety boots. "I knew a lot of customers in this industry like to speak over the phone when purchasing products online. So I decided that by hiring a permanent member of staff to handle calls, I could give the customers the instant gratification many of them are looking for." Charge more for speed: AJ Saleem owns Suprex Learning, a Houston, Texas-based tutoring business, and asks for at least 24 to 48 hours before booking a session, since many of his tutors have full-time jobs doing other things. "I had desperate parents start demanding tutoring within hours of contacting me," he says. "I figured out another method of tutoring: speed tutoring." He charges a 50 percent additional fee for same-day service, since tutors often have to drop other things to make time for it, and his tutors use Skype to conduct their sessions. Make your business smartphone-friendly: On-the-go consumers are often shopping from their phones, and if they can't navigate your site, they'll go elsewhere. "I make sure that our website is mobile friendly and that we are connected to different social media platforms," says Daisy Jing, CEO and founder of Banish, a beauty product line based in Pasadena, California. Set customer expectations: From the moment of contact, let customers know what's happening, and when they can expect to see a product or service. When people make a request through on-demand lawn service GreenPal, they receive quotes from nearby vendors within one hour. Once they book a vendor, they get text notifications as well as a visual calendar showing them their service window. Plan ahead: For custom products, keeping a stockpile of commonly ordered items or parts can shorten production time for impatient clients. "We manufacture and sell direct higher-end, solid wood desks, tables and other furniture, and there is a lot of hand work that goes into each piece," says Andy Tracewell, director of marketing for Caretta Workspace, based in Lewis Center, Ohio. Now the company makes some pieces, like desktop frames, ahead of time, because they can be customized in many ways. Provide a quick consumable: Hannah Raudsepp owns the Honest Beef Company, which ships dry-aged beef from Nebraska ranchers. "The nature of my product means that it arrives frozen to our customer's doorsteps, so they are unable to dive right in," she says. "So I include chocolate or some other small morsel with my orders. From the moment they open their beef, they have a happy experience." Kate Ashford is a Chase News contributor.

Subscribe By Elizabeth Heichler Knowing your customer is a bedrock principle of business, and it's doubly important if you want to make sure you appeal to today's increasingly diverse market. JPMorgan Chase Hire for diversity and foreign language skills. The buying power of Asian-American, African-American and Hispanic consumers is growing at twice the rate of total U.S. purchasing clout, according to market research. Paying attention to the consumption habits and values of diverse people can help your business grow. Here are seven ways to start: 1. Connect with community business leaders: Build relationships with businesspeople of diverse backgrounds. Networking at the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, for example, can alert you to community events that your business can support. 2. Review your messaging: Consider how you might adapt your website, marketing and sales materials to appeal to other cultures, suggests Vicki Flier Hudson, chief collaboration officer at Atlanta-based Highroad Global Services, which helps businesses expand into new markets. When you've built strong relationships with businesspeople from different cultures, you can ask them for feedback. Ask these peers to identify messaging that might elicit a negative reaction from your intended audience, and invite them to suggest improvements. 3. Check your assumptions: Self-awareness is an important step toward gaining broader cultural awareness, says Hudson. For example, you might prize the very "American" value of getting a task accomplished quickly, but your multicultural counterparts may put a priority on developing relationships. Consider how those values are communicated in your outreach to customers. 4. Hire for diversity and foreign language skills: "Your workforce is very important," says Michael Soon Lee, author of “Cross-Cultural Selling for Dummies." “When you have a diverse staff, it signals to people that the business is sensitive to culture." If you serve customers who aren't confident English speakers, having multi-lingual employees could encourage consumers to buy from you, rather than a competitor. 5. Be active in the community: Supporting events such as a street festival that celebrates a particular cultural heritage will help raise your profile with target customers. "It's better than running ads—it's all about word of mouth in the community," says Lee. 6. Talk about culture: "We're so afraid to ask anyone about their culture because we're afraid of offending them," says Lee. "So, instead, we make assumptions that are often in error." While it's poor form to directly ask someone what their ethnic background is, showing an interest in their cultural traditions in the right context demonstrates that you're eager to learn. "And if business owners are interested in culture, they're going to make more money," Lee adds. 7. Note important holidays: Acknowledging and celebrating other cultures' holidays generates goodwill, says Hudson. You can send greeting cards once you've determined whether your clients celebrate occasions such as Diwali, Eid al-Fitr or the Lunar New Year. For festive holidays, restaurants and retail stores can add decorations. Do your homework, though: Before you decorate or send cards or gifts, Hudson advises that you learn about colors, numbers and symbols that may carry negative connotations.

Subscribe By Ami Albernaz Nothing lays the groundwork for success like a well-written business plan. Besides helping you land investors and strategic partners, creating one also clarifies your goals and points out potential challenges. JPMorgan Chase Be sure to estimate your company's expenses and revenues as closely as possible. A business plan typically includes seven sections: Executive summary Company description Market analysis Product or service description Sales and marketing strategy Organizational and management structure Financial projections To help you get started, we asked business experts to share their insights on creating a compelling business plan. Here are their top six strategies. 1. Begin with the basics Tackle your plan in small steps to make the task manageable, says Tim Berry, founder and chairman of Palo Alto Software, which provides startup and management tools for small companies. You can write bullet points first and expand on them later. Start with the essentials: your business strategy, the tactics you'll use to execute it and key milestones such as launch dates. List startup costs, such as equipment, inventory and permits, and calculate your best estimates for sales in the early months. Working through your financials will help you determine how much funding you'll need. 2. Consider your audience If you intend to pitch investors, your plan should demonstrate that you have a superior product or service that solves a difficult problem for a large target market, says Akira Hirai, founder and CEO of Cayenne Consulting, a business plan consulting firm. If you hope to win over a strategic partner, your plan—typically accompanying a partnership proposal—should describe your vision and ability to help the partner reach its strategic goals. No matter whom you are writing your plan for, Hirai adds, make the case that your founding team has the experience and skills to build a successful company. The description of your organizational and management structure should include a brief bio of the founders detailing their employment history, education and background as relevant to your venture. 3. Think growth before profits "Quite often, startup founders think investors want to see profits, and they'll come up with wildly unrealistic projections," Berry says. Investors, however, won't find such numbers credible, and may also see them as a sign that an entrepreneur isn't prioritizing growth. "There's a tradeoff between profits and growth, since growth comes from spending," adds Berry, who is also an angel investor. "If you have too much profit, you're going to have trouble generating growth." Focus on explaining how your business will generate growth. 4. Demonstrate solid cash flow The financial section of your business plan should thoroughly document your projected revenues and expenses, and expected cash flow. Not planning for the timing of inflows and outflows of cash will leave your business vulnerable to failure, no matter how strong your idea. "You can't just suddenly run out of cash," Berry says. "If you don't plan for and manage cash flow, you're putting yourself in danger." Be sure to estimate your company's expenses and revenues as closely as possible. Certain expenses, such as merchant services fees and some types of insurance, can be easy to overlook. If you use a cash flow template to project your expenses, be sure to account for all of your spending categories. 5. Keep it clean "Aesthetics matter," Hirai says. "An attractive, neatly formatted plan is more likely to be read than a disorganized plan." Investors tend to favor brevity, with executive summaries running one to three pages and complete plans at 20 to 25 pages. Plans with spelling or grammar mistakes, or those packed with technical detail or scientific jargon, may get discarded. 6. Review and revise your plan Some entrepreneurs complete a business plan only to set it aside and never look at it again. Review your plan monthly, Berry suggests, to compare your projections with reality and to be sure you're on track for hitting key milestones. "All of that review creates real management and accountability," he says. It also allows you to shift course quickly if sales, market conditions or other factors diverge from expectations.

Subscribe By Laura Schreier When you start a business, it can be difficult, without a track record or collateral, to find venture capitalists or angel investors to underwrite the first stages. Entrepreneurs report not only digging into their own savings, but seeking loans from their personal network—pitching their parents, cousins or college roommates. JPMorgan Chase Regardless of who you approach for funding, clearly explain the realistic payback scenarios in order to manage expectations. If you're asking friends and family to contribute financially to your business, consider the following tips from Martin Zwilling, founder and chief executive officer of advisory company Startup Professionals. Do: File your business paperwork before asking for funding Officially establishing your business signals to your funders that you're serious about the endeavor—that it isn't just a hobby, Zwilling says. A legal structure also provides a framework for responses in the event of financial losses. The best business structure for your company will be informed by the type of business you are starting, along with many other factors, so work with your attorney or tax adviser to make this important decision. Don't: Take money from anybody willing to give it Consider the background and financial position of people before asking them for funding. Zwilling points out that people with business experience are often the best source of capital, since they are more likely to understand the inherent risk in any business investment. Another key characteristic of a good friend or family investor is someone who can afford to part with the funds in the event of failure. Keep in mind that more than money, your relationship is at stake. Regardless of who you approach for funding, clearly explain the realistic payback scenarios in order to manage expectations. Do: Get it all in writing "It's a recipe for disaster," when entrepreneurs don't spell out all the details of funding transactions on paper, says Zwilling. Key elements to specify include the amount of funding, along with how, and when, you'll pay it back. Will you do re-pay funds all at once or in several payments? Agree on the amount of interest or other return that they'll receive. Consulting with your attorney or tax adviser about how companies typically structure these arrangements may be helpful. Don't: Get your funds in the form of a short-term loan You don't want to have to repay borrowed money before your new business has funds to spare. "Revenue always takes longer than you think," says Zwilling, noting that new startups may not have positive cash flow for years. Extend the repayment schedule out as far out as possible. Or better yet, tie loan repayments to the revenue you will eventually generate. That way, you're not committed to making payments before you have the cash. Work with your accountant to build realistic cash flow projections, and then make a repayment plan based on that. Do: Communicate frequently Your funders may be people you've known all your life, but give them the same kind of attention as you would a professional investor. Promise regular updates on your progress—for example, one detailed email each month—and deliver on schedule. Communication should be one-on-one whenever possible, tailored to the expertise level of the recipient. A cousin with an MBA will appreciate detailed reports, while a family friend with no business experience may just want the headlines. Share milestones such as signing a lease for a location, hiring staff or gaining a new distributor. Keeping your investors informed will help those relationships stay strong through the inevitable ups and downs of a new venture. Laura Schreier is a Chase News contributor.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe By Selina Wagowski Christina Morales' first lesson in running her own business came early. Her parents died when she was 15, and by age 23, Morales found herself in charge of the Houston, Texas, funeral home her family had operated since 1931. She had limited experience, little preparation and no time to pursue a higher education before being thrust into the world of business ownership. JPMorgan Chase For small businesses, deciding in advance how they will meet challenges such as death, divorce or other unexpected events—including the need for loans to bridge the business in hard times—is crucial. "I had to learn the hard way," Morales recalls, adding: "As a small business owner, you never know what could happen." Morales survived, and thrived, when the unexpected happened. Over the past 23 years, she not only has succeeded in building the family business—she has become a leader in Houston's Hispanic business community. But others may not be so lucky. For small businesses, deciding in advance how they will meet challenges such as death, divorce or other unexpected events—including the need for loans to bridge the business in hard times—is crucial. Planning with partners, discussing with family members and finding the right advisor to put provisions in place can make the difference between overcoming unexpected events, and succumbing to them. Get it on paper Many small business owners are so focused on running their companies that they don't make time for long-term planning. They may not think about the need to include provisions for ownership in their wills, or have discussions with family members about what will happen to the company after they die, Dr. Laura Murillo, president and CEO of the Houston Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told about 250 small business owners at a recent Chase for Business: Connecting Minds, event in Houston. In Morales' case, her grandmother stepped in to run the funeral home until Morales was ready to take over. But family members aren't always willing or able to do that. If the family hasn't discussed succession planning or an exit strategy, the business could be left in jeopardy. "Make sure you have it all on paper," Morales says. Ownership succession is just one reason that small business owners should develop relationships with lawyers, accountants and bankers they trust and who understand their business. Consider all possible pitfalls In the Hispanic community, in particular, entrepreneurs often rely on family for financial support, says Graciela Saenz, an attorney with the boutique firm of Saenz & Burkhardt, which focuses on business transactions. "If something goes wrong, how will you get that money back? It's better to come to an understanding before you make major business decisions," she says. Small business owners should plan for a wide range of unexpected events that could affect their companies, including injury, disability, death or financial hardship, says Jeff Dinerstein, an attorney with the law firm Jones Day who represents business owners on tax issues as well as mergers and acquisitions. Dissolving or selling a business It's never too early to start the process. Even if a business is still in the startup phase, the owners should think about their plans for selling or dissolving it someday. Planning for these types of long-term outcomes can help avoid pitfalls to growth, Saenz says. "I always tell clients to think about what you want this company to be and where you want it to end up." If a company is owned by a husband and wife who get divorced, for example, dividing the ownership interests can put the future of the business in jeopardy if they haven't planned for how the business would be dissolved or sold. Business owners who plan to sell should begin preparing at least two years before they could conceivably put the company on the market. "You want to think about getting a solid set of financial statements," Dinerstein says. At the same time, they must understand the market, because many buyers would prefer to buy only assets, rather than an entire company. Depending on the nature of the business, it may be important to consider non-compete clauses for employees. "All of this becomes more relevant when you sell," Saenz says. Who to turn to for advice As they seek professional guidance on these issues, business owners should also understand the function that each professional performs, says Cesar Guerra, a Chase Vice President in Houston. Bankers, for example, can provide a financial compass to guide business owners to the best financing options, but they can't offer tax advice. "Your tax expert is the key person in deciding how you can get the most tax advantage from a transaction," he says. When selecting an accountant, keep in mind that many bankers prefer to see that a certified public accountant has reviewed a business's books. Documenting finances Just as audited financial statements are critical for selling the business, they also provide business owners with more financing options if they want to grow their business. In addition to helping in the loan approval process, audited financial statements may also help get a lower interest rate. "Have a banker review them and let them give you an idea of where you stand," Guerra says. "We don't say 'no,' we say 'not now.' If you have the proper safeguards, it should not be a difficult transaction, but you have to make sure you have those safeguards in place." If several bankers all turn down a business's loan application, it may be necessary to re-examine the financial statements, Saenz adds. If a business isn't eligible for a commercial loan, bankers may be able to recommend other financing, such as a loan guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Planning from the start Even businesses just getting started can put plans in place. Startups that don't have an established financial history can fortify themselves with a strong business plan so that lenders can see how the business will work and where the money will come from, Saenz says. She suggests that some business owners may want to form an "advisory council" of other business owners who can offer advice on developing the business. "Having these trusted relationships are important," she says. Morales learned early in her career the importance of trusting family members, but she says business owners must realize that not everyone in the family shares the same commitment to the business. "It can be hard to work with family sometimes," she says. "It's important to recognize potential hazards." Selina Wagowski is a Chase News contributor.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe By Elizabeth Heichler Multicultural women are a growing force in the economy, both as business owners and consumers. So how do you attract more of these women as customers? JPMorgan Chase If you want to hire a creative marketer, look to groups like the Asian American Advertising Federation, or the National Association of Black Journalists. Author and media mogul Nely Galán suggests you start by hiring them. "This is not just hiring for diversity because it's the right thing to do—it's hiring for growth," Galán said recently at the Chase for Business conference held in New York City. "In order to grow your company in this new world, it has to look like the rest of the country." According to Galán, Latina women alone have an annual spending power of $1.3 trillion. Women of Latin, African-American, Asian and Middle-Eastern heritage also make up the fastest growing group of entrepreneurs in the U.S., she said, and represent a significant market opportunity for companies that sell to other businesses. "If you put all multicultural women together, they can make or break your business with their purchasing power," Galán said. Why hiring tops the to-do list Making loyal customers out of this group requires a multipronged approach, particularly in how you market your business. In order to build a strong relationship with your business, customers need to see people like them—and "not just in junior positions, but in positions of power," according to Galán. In a retail environment, seeing staffers of different ethnicities can give shoppers "a powerful sense of feeling invited in," she said, and reassures them that they won't suffer the discrimination of being eyed with suspicion. Conference attendee Miko Branch, co-founder and owner of Manhattan, New York, hair-care company Miss Jessie's, agrees that having a diverse staff helps her business do a better job of serving its multicultural client base. "It's helped us to connect with our customers and to be successful," she said. Branch also points out that a diverse staff benefits the business broadly: "Having a mix of people forces you to be open-minded. It keeps you thinking outside of the box, which you have to do as an entrepreneur." How to recruit for diversity Galán has little patience for businesses that insist they would hire a more diverse workforce if only they could find qualified candidates. "Claiming there's a lack of candidates is a bad excuse. The truth is, they're out there," she maintains. Here are her top tips for recruiting to add diversity to your team: 1. Connect with scholarship funds and organizations "I look at the Hispanic Scholarship Fund and see all these incredible kids at Princeton and Harvard, and I don't see a lot of people pursuing them," Galán said. That organization and the United Negro College Fund have promising lists of alumni that recruiters can tap. 2. Look for local, ethnicity-focused chambers of commerce You can find chambers of commerce and other professional networking groups that serve specific ethnic communities in many cities and regions. A recent Chase survey found that Hispanic business leaders rated networking organizations as their most useful outside relationships. "Next time you're looking for an accountant, advertise in one of their newsletters," Galán suggested. 3. Tap multicultural professional associations for specific roles If you want to hire a creative marketer, look to groups like the Asian American Advertising Federation, or the National Association of Black Journalists. Looking for a CFO? Try the National Society of Hispanic MBAs. These types of organizations can fast-track your search for diverse hires. Galán says the math doesn't lie. Making your company a leader in diversity efforts leaves you better positioned to develop long-lasting customer relationships with a group that has significant economic clout. Watch Nely Galán speak about diversity and business growth at the recent Chase for Business Conference. Elizabeth Heichler is a writer and editor focused on business and technology issues.

Subscribe By Ami Albernaz Taking advantage of their agility and size, small businesses can gain an edge by using technology to simplify, improve or change how they do business. JPMorgan Chase Tip: Seek new tech tools to tap into the information your systems already collect. Inventory software, for example, pulls in real-time sales data and can alert you when stock is running low. Here's how four entrepreneurs have used technology in their businesses, and how you might apply their lessons to your own company. 3-D scanners take tailoring up a notch Sure, male athletes are built better than you and me, but they also have a much harder time finding great-fitting clothes. Standard sizing of most menswear brands doesn't fit them. The solution: Create a system to replace the tattered tape measure, says Kevin Flammia, CEO and co-founder of the Manhattan-based RFM Clothing. He invites thousands of athletes into his studio and uses a 3-D scanner to compile precise measurements for all of them. He then uses that to create RFM's fashionable line of jackets, blazers, shirts and pants, which are sold online and in the company's showroom in the New York City neighborhood, SoHo. Tip: Identify a customer's problem and reimagine how things are done in your industry. Then, use technology to make it happen. Cloud-based software sinks teeth into patient info Slim Dental, a New York City-based dental practice, uses technology to drive improvements in recruiting, human resources management and marketing. But the real game-changer lies in using technology to improve customer service, says founder Stephen Lim. Doctors can write their notes and see their schedules, X-rays and patient records from anywhere by using cloud-based, patient-management software. It allows them to focus on providing top-notch patient care while at the office. Employees use the cloud-based system to pull up records at any of the practice's three locations, which provides convenience for patients who move or change jobs within the city, Lim says. Tip: Move to a cloud-based system to untether employees from their computers and filing cabinets, increasing both customer convenience and productivity. Mobile apps help employees get the scoop 10Below Ice Cream dishes out Thai-style frozen treats in four New York City locations, with plans for more shops in Los Angeles, California and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. So, staying in touch requires mobile apps, not plain-vanilla paper solutions. "We use a lot of the tools from our daily lives," says Richard Tam. He and co-owner David Chen use WhatsApp and GroupMe to share new initiatives or to see who can cover open shifts. They also use a mobile payroll app so employees can check on their all-important paychecks. Tip: Look at areas in your business where staff members might get out of sync. Then, seek mobile communications apps to improve the workflow. Electronic ordering keeps up with blooming customer demand Back in 1994, Starkie Brothers Garden Center became one of the first home and garden stores in its area to use computers. Co-owner George Starkie has been on the cutting edge of technology ever since. These days, he uses an inventory and ordering system to keep in-demand items in stock. "The last thing you want is to be out of something a customer came in for," he says. His point-of-sale-system flags when supplies are running low and connects to the ordering system. Stark can place orders in minutes compared with the hours or days it might take his competitors. "I wouldn't have achieved the growth that I have without it," he says. Tip: Seek new tech tools to tap into the information your systems already collect. Inventory software, for example, pulls in real-time sales data and can alert you when stock is running low.

Subscribe By Chase Small Business Ad Academy The following article is part of the Small Business Ad Academy, a series that offers timely advice on marketing and social media for small businesses, presented by Chase Ink. As the world's largest professional network, with more than 400 million members worldwide, LinkedIn is an increasingly powerful tool for small business owners eager to raise their profile. That's because, as a community of professionals, the social platform's users are already pre-disposed to business-oriented messaging. This makes it a powerful vehicle for companies seeking to establish their expertise with key, targeted audiences. JPMorgan Chase Write a succinct and compelling overview, laying out both career accomplishments and company facts in the summary and experience sections, and then use vibrant photos. Jennifer Grazel, LinkedIn's global director of vertical marketing, says that 25 million business owners are active on the platform. More than half say their primary purpose in using the platform is to engage current and prospective partners, suppliers and customers. "Sales are driven by relationships, so it is important to humanize expertise as part of a business proposition," explains Grazel. "We're finding that business owners who develop and share their voice through strong, consistent content are seen as influencers. And that can provide them with a real competitive advantage." For a fraction of the cost of large-scale marketing campaigns, a small business owner can build a presence as an influencer. Grazel outlines four brand-building steps: 1. Create a winning profile Write a succinct and compelling overview, laying out both career accomplishments and company facts in the summary and experience sections, and then use vibrant photos. A solid profile can garner instant credibility, impressing first-time visitors who may be unaware of those details. And be sure to add relevant keywords or phrases throughout the profile. That improves visibility when prospective customers search those terms in LinkedIn and Google. 2. Expand your network Take time each week to search for, and reach out to, relevant friends, colleagues or others who may be interested in your business. "The power of a network like LinkedIn is not only about who you know, but who they know, as well," says Grazel. Set reminders and follow up with contacts periodically on LinkedIn Contacts, especially when adding new content that may be of interest to them. 3. Speak up Keep content fresh by updating your profile regularly with product launches or marketing offers and illustrate your expertise by adding news that engages and informs connections. Don't shy away from publishing long-form posts to express opinions, points of view and relevant experiences to further establish a professional identity. Further position yourself as a thought leader by joining pertinent LinkedIn Groups, and adding to the conversation on topics and trends. Sharing knowledgeable insights will help build rapport with other contributors, including those who may benefit from their expertise, products or services. 4. Syndicate and amplify Cross-post long- and short-form content from personal pages to the company page to extend your reach. Efforts to raise visibility may be further enhanced by strategic investments in LinkedIn sponsored content, which places your content on select feeds. LinkedIn uses advanced algorithms to help target desired audiences, thus enhancing your return on investment. Plus, there's the option to add personalized messages to specific, segmented audiences. This ability to create—and share—a genuine voice separates authentic business influencers from the pretenders.

It is the first time a president has ever proposed their complete obliteration. Trump's proposal to end arts endowment is latest chapter in a fraught history Read more It came a day before the opening of the Whitney Biennial – the longest-running survey of American art – casting a gloomy shadow on a group exhibition that explores the topic of funding, or its lack thereof. The 63 artists on view are co-curated by Mia Locks and Christopher Y Lew, who want to mirror this bleak era. “This biennial arrives at a time rife with racial tensions, economic inequities and polarizing politics,” they write in the introductory statement, “inviting us to pause and pose questions in a tumultuous world.” It’s a politically charged show on the state of America but without the predictable satire. Rather, this exhibition feels like a graveyard of the establishment’s broken promises with glimmers of hope from some of its suffering citizens. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Part of the Occupy Museums group show. Photograph: Occupy Museums In light of arts funding cuts, the art collective Occupy Museums, which was formed in 2011 alongside Occupy Wall Street, has created a mini group show in the biennial called Debtfair. The works of 30 artists are grouped by the corporations they are in debt to: JPMorgan Chase, Navient and the FirstBank of Puerto Rico. The artworks can be bought for the artist’s monthly debt charge. What about art education, you ask? Puerto Rican artist and activist Chemi Rosado-Seijo took all the desks and chairs from a classroom from the Lower Manhattan Arts Academy and put the class inside the museum. The piece, called Salón Sala Salón, brings the high school art students to the museum for a weekly workshop, showing the importance the creative arts education in a time when its meaning is being diminished. The arts aren’t the only sector suffering funding cuts – the budget proposal wipes out thousands of jobs in health, science and social programs. New York artist Cameron Rowland’s piece Public Money shows one alternative form of funding that could pave the way for the future, social impact bonds. “The purpose is to gain a more intimate understanding of how they work,” he said. “So few people know they exist, let alone how they work, which is something that is crucial at this moment.” 'It's going to make art great again': the street artists taking on Trump Read more While there are no Trump portraits or American flags, there is a Statue of Liberty standing outside in below-zero weather. The performance, called Liberté (Liberty), has a performer holding up an unlit torch. It was created by art group Puppies Puppies, who are selling foam Liberty Island crowns downstairs in the gift shop for $5, debunking the myth that high art has to be expensive (and inaccessible). Even with holdups at airports and the looming Muslim ban, other pieces dig into the refugee crisis, such as The Island, a film by Vietnamese artist Tuan Andrew Nguyen. Shot on the Malaysian island of Bidong, a former Vietnam war refugee camp, it mirrors the present refugee crisis at a time when millions of Syrian refugees have fled their homeland. While the small island accommodated 250,000 people from the 1970s to the time it shut down in 1991, America will accept no more than 50,000 refugees this year after screening each one under a microscope. During the presidential campaign, Melania Trump was called out for copying and pasting parts of Michelle Obama’s speech. Here, there is also a plagiarism spat. On Instagram, Toronto artist Maya Ben David claimed that a sculpture in the biennial by Ajay Kurian looks too similar to a character she created called Mary Jane Anthro Plane, which is featured in her video art piece MBD: Origin Story, which was shown in a gallery last year. Kurian’s sculpture, which is part of a series he called Childermass, features a figure with a red wig and a white mask, just like David’s. “The sculpture in the Whitney not only resembles my character with an airplane mask and red hair, but she is wearing layered shirts and sneakers just like in my work,” said Ben David. “I would like an apology from the artist and curators at the Whitney Museum and recognition that the character Mary Jane Anthro Plane is my creation.” An email sent to Kurian’s gallerist was not answered at the time of publishing this story. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Raúl de Nieves’s Technicolor stained glass wall. Photograph: Will Ragozzino It feels like many people are being sold short, and it isn’t just Trump’s budget cuts to the arts. While his proposed Mexico-US border wall will cost billions, the current border is a point of inspiration in the show. Mexican artist Raúl de Nieves’s Technicolor stained glass wall reads Hope, while the Postcommodity art collective created a video that follows the rusty metal fence that currently divides Douglas, Arizona, and Agua Prieta, Mexico. “The border continues to mystify the American public during this administration, as it did before Trump entered,” said Postcommodity artist Cristobal Martinez, who refers to their piece as “a metaphor for the imprisonment caused by the polarizing bipartisan discourse”.

Support Us Patriot Shop Current Digest Right Analysis Right Hooks Right Opinion Alexander's Columns Top Headlines Memes Cartoons Subscribe Support Us Patriot Post Shop About The Patriot Post Search The Right Opinion Perceptions Are That Trump's Policies Are Working Michael Barone · Mar. 17, 2017 Tweet Perceptions matter. People make decisions, even life-altering decisions, based on what they perceive as likely to happen. To the extent that public policy affects such decisions, the perception of likely policy change can affect behavior even before the change happens — even if it ends up never happening. Something like that seems to be happening in America — and around the world. In the two months since Donald Trump was inaugurated as president, people have been making decisions based on perceptions of how he may change the country’s direction. Take the economy. The numbers in the jobs report for February, Trump’s first full month in office, showing an increase of 235,000 jobs, are not wildly out of line with some monthly reports in recent years. In contrast with the years of the Obama stimulus program, when the bulk of new jobs came in the public sector, it appears that the increase here is in the private sector. Moody’s Analytics says there were 298,000 new private-sector jobs in February, far more than the 189,000 it expected. Construction jobs were up 58,000. Private educational services jobs were up 29,000. And manufacturing jobs were up 28,000. This suggests that lots of employers, small as well as large, are taking the plunge and creating new jobs. Can I prove that they’re doing so because of perceptions that regulations and taxes will be decreased by the Trump administration? No, and I’m not sure any economist’s statistical model could, either. But it sure looks as if that’s what’s happening. Big players in the financial markets seem to think so. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen suggested the Fed will raise interest rates twice more this year after doing so twice in the past three months. That’s a significant shift from her long-standing reluctance to increase rates at all for fear of dampening the economy. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said March 10 that Trump’s agenda of cutting corporate taxes, building infrastructure and rolling back regulations has unleashed the “animal spirits” — economist John Maynard Keynes' phrase — of businesspeople. “Even if he gets (just) part of it done,” Dimon, a Democrat and Hillary Clinton contributor, told Bloomberg, “it’ll be good for growth.” Does the unusual speed with which Paul Ryan is leading the House to vote on the first of three promised initiatives to repeal and replace Obamacare suggest that he and Trump are trying to strengthen the perception that the private-sector economy will boom? Given the significant risk of political damage and policy bollix, it certainly looks as if the answer is yes. People at the high end of the income spectrum — a category that obviously includes the bulk of job creators — are not the only ones making decisions in response to perceptions. So, it appears, are undocumented immigrants and people deciding whether to cross the border illegally. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that apprehensions of people who crossed the southern border illegally in February were down 39 percent from January and down 36 percent from February 2016. They were also lower than the border crossings in December — traditionally by far the lowest month — in the years 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012. That’s a starling drop. And it’s one that seems likely to reverberate far beyond Mexico, seeing as most people who have crossed the border illegally since the Great Recession have come from Central America. Under Obama administration policy, Central American children (or adults claiming to be younger than 18) seeking asylum were mostly allowed to remain in the United States, effectively free of border enforcement. Trump’s executive orders on immigration law enforcement have created the perception, probably accurately, that that policy has changed. That message has apparently been delivered to people hundreds or even thousands of miles south of the Rio Grande. Of course, perceptions can change. Perceptions of an incoming president’s likely policies can shape the behavior of many; perceptions of an outgoing president’s policies, not so much. As a president’s term goes on, perceptions of a president’s policies are replaced by the realities of actual policies, and perceptions of likely effects are modified by conditions on the ground. The wisdom of crowds is not always spot on. But it’s sometimes superior to the wisdom of experts. Most experts predicted that Britain’s vote for Brexit and America’s for Trump would crater those countries' respective economies. That hasn’t happened yet — and most people seem to perceive it won’t.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Bonds News | Fri Mar 17, 2017 | 6:13am EDT EMERGING MARKETS-Emerging stocks set for best week since July 2016 after Fed By Claire Milhench | LONDON, March 17 LONDON, March 17 Emerging equities were set on Friday for their strongest week since July 2016, up more than 4 percent and trading near 20-month highs after a dovish Fed, whilst the Turkish lira was at a three-week high after central bank tightening. MSCI's emerging equity index was rounding off its strongest week in eight months after the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled gradual policy tightening ahead, reassuring investors who had feared a more hawkish stance. "The risk scenario people were looking at, that they could signal a more hawkish path, did not come to fruition ... and this has basically given a green light to buy emerging markets," said Kiran Kowshik, emerging markets FX strategist at UniCredit. Improving global growth, higher commodity prices, fiscal stimulus in China and better Chinese industrial activity had also encouraged investors, he said. The bullishness was evident in bond markets, where average yield spreads on emerging dollar debt over U.S. Treasuries narrowed to 307 basis points (bps) from 316 bps before the Fed's 15 meeting. JPMorgan said that having been underweight emerging market debt after the U.S. presidential elections, it had been adding risk. "With the (Fed) hurdle cleared we now take off the last of our emerging market FX hedges to leave us with a small EM currency overweight position," the bank told clients. Some of the biggest stock market gains came in Asia, where Indian shares hit fresh record highs after ministers cleared key draft bills for a national sales tax. Korea and Taiwan also hit multi-month highs. China was the exception, losing 1 percent for their worst day in three months. Losses were led by sectors exposed to higher borrowing costs after the central bank followed the Fed in raising rates. Most Asian currencies were also set for big weekly gains, with the Taiwan dollar posting its best week in more than five years. In emerging Europe, Russia and Poland were both up 4 percent for the week, the latter enjoying its best weekly performance since December 2016. The Turkish lira outperformed, firming 0.5 percent after the central bank's Thursday meeting pushed up the average cost of funding by 50 basis points. The lira is up 3.5 percent this week, its best performance since early February. "With the dollar weakening, it is possible that the lira will do well over the next couple of weeks … but this could also provide a selling opportunity," Unicredit's Kowshik said.

The surprise is that Trump actually paid taxes in 2005, choosing not to avail himself of the $20 billion loss claimed in previous years. In order to cover the flop, Maddow and Co. suggested without the slightest evidence that Trump leaked the returns himself! + Maddow claims the protection of 1st amendment for publishing Trump’s leaked/stolen tax returns. Fine. But she should apply the same standard to the DNC/Podesta emails, which she and the rest of the MSDNC crew continue to refer to as “stolen.” + Perhaps Maddow was simply preparing her cultish audience for the even bigger bust to come: the Russian Connection. The longer the Democrats, and their talking puppets in the press, remain fixated on the the meta-conspiracy of Russian hacking of the 2016 elections the more cover they give Trump to loot the economy, eviscerate social welfare programs and gut environmental regulations. Trump is going to subvert the country through unbridled greed and avarice, not through a seditious pact with Putin. Maybe it call all be explained as a massive case of PMS–Putin Mania Syndrome. + At the end of last week, Trump canned 46 US attorneys, the nation’s top prosecutors. The mass dismissal was entirely his prerogative and is common practice in new presidential administrations. Who weeps for prosectors? Liberals, apparently, who have made Preet Bharara, the former US attorney for the southern district of Manhattan, into a martyr. Bharara is now being cast as a white knight who was waging mighty battles against the crooks of Wall Street. It’s a ludicrous portrait for anyone who knows anything about Bharara’s less than glorious tenure as US attorney. As Pam and Russ Martens report, Bharara is a creature of Wall Street. In fact, he has largely functioned as a factotum for the Senator from Citibank, Chuck Schumer. Bharara served faithfully for several years as the chief counsel for Schumer on the Senate judiciary. As a reward for his dutiful role in protecting the careers of ace financial predators such as Jamie Dimon and Lloyd Blankfein, Schumer persuaded Barack Obama to appoint Bharara to his post as US attorney in the spring of 2009, during the depths of the economic crisis that Wall Street engineered. One of the biggest cases in Bharara’s tenure was the investigation into the Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme, where Bharara’s role seemed to be to protect the felonious fund’s biggest beneficiaries, JPMorgan Chase and Picower Family, who reportedly made a profit of nearly $20 billion from the Madoff fund. Clearly a hero for our time. + If you’re not a banker, you’re their prey… + No sign of any trillion dollar infrastructure plan in Trump’s budget. In fact, funding for the Department of Transportation shrinks. Perhaps Trump will set up a Go Fund My Infrastructure website? + David Be’eri, an Israeli settlement leader who once ran over Palestinian kids with his car, just won the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement. + Trump’s counter-terror advisor, the brutish Sebastian Gorka, was apparently an active member of a far-right Hungarian order known as Vitézi Rend. As reported in Forward, the US State Department Vitézi Rend operated under the direction of the German Nazi regime in World War II. Leaders of Vitézi Rend to Forward that Gorka had pledged “lifelong loyalty” to the order, a vow that may place Gorka’s immigration status in jeopardy. The State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual states that members of the Vitézi Rend “are presumed to be inadmissible” to the country under the Immigration and Nationality Act. No wonder the Trump White House is desperate to chop the State Department by 30 percent. + Just call her Never-Never Nikki. This week UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, in full damage-control mode, announced that “Russia should never be trusted.” Even Ronald Reagan, the ideological sperm donor for this whole crew, said “trust but verify.” + Royal Robbins, who pioneered low-impact climbing on the vertical faces of Yosemite, died this week. I spent a day in Kings Canyon with Robbins in the early 90s. He was one of the greatest climbers and conservationists of our time. + Trump made a morbid pilgrimage to Hermitage to lay flowers on the tomb of Andrew Jackson, slave-owner and Indian killer. Trump’s hero once penned an advertisement for a runaway slave which offered $50 for the capture of the slave “and ten dollars extra, for every hundred lashes any person will give him.” I had a flashback to Reagan’s creepy visit to graves of the Waffen SS in Bitburg, an homage immortalized by The Ramones. + The most edifying takeaway from Trump’s big interview with Tucker Carlson on FoxNews this week concerned his reading habits, which weigh-in at about half-a-Palin. Of course, he’d read a little more, if he didn’t have to spend all day making America tremendously great again: Tucker Carlson: What do you do at the end of the day? What do you read, what do you watch… Donald Trump: Well, you know, I love to read. Actually, I’m looking at a book, I’m reading a book, I’m trying to get started. Every time I do about half a page, I get a phone call that there’s some emergency, this or that. But we’re going to see the home of Andrew Jackson today in Tennessee and I’m reading a book on Andrew Jackson. I love to read. I don’t get to read very much, Tucker, because I’m working very hard on lots of different things, including getting costs down. The costs of managing our country are out of control. But we have a lot of great things happening, we have a lot of tremendous things happening. + A powerful new study by the UN’s Office of Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia confirms and documents the apartheid-like treatment of Palestinians by Israel. Predictably, this report was met with rage by Israel and its allies in the UN (the US). Pressure was applied and a few days later the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, demanded that the report be removed from OESCWA’s website. Rather than comply with Guterres’s demand, Rima Khalif, the Executive Secretary of the OESCWA, tendered her resignation. There are still things that are true that you can’t say in public without paying an extreme price. + Trump: “I’ve always opposed the Iraq war.” On March 15th, the Pentagon announced it’s plans to send 2,500 new to Kuwait to await their deployment to Syria and Iraq. + What fascists talk about when they go to the beach: “In October 1938, while on holiday at the beach, Claretta recorded that he told her how much he detested the Jews and that he planned to ‘massacre them like the Turks did’. ‘I have imprisoned 70,000 Arabs in concentration camps. I can do the same with 50,000 Jews. I’ll put them on a small island and shut them all up there … I shall kill them, every one.’ He insisted to Claretta that he was disgusted to think he had ever slept with the Jewish Sarfatti, speaking of the ‘stench of her flesh’. He also expressed a wish to wipe out the ‘four million’ Italians who, according to his calculations, had descended from Roman slaves and whose blood must therefore have remained vile for ‘fifty generations’. The English, he told her, were even worse: a ‘piggish and fallen people’ who thought with their bottoms and whose institutions were riddled with Jews. As for the French, with the exception of Napoleon, every last one of them was cowardly, syphilitic and degenerate; French women were whores who only enjoyed sleeping with black men – something Claretta concurred was ‘awful’.” (From “Il Duce and the Red Alfa” by Bee Wilson, London Review of Books.) + Laila al-Arian has produced a terrific new documentary on the implications of Trump’s Muslim ban, called simply “The Ban.” + The West Virginia senate just passed a bill that eliminates coal mine safety inspections. Why? It’s all about the workers! + The first condemnation notices are being sent to Texas landowners to clear the way for Trump’s Great Wall. The landowners are being offered a whopping $2,000 an acre. So much for the sacred nature of property rights. + For the past two years, carbon dioxide rates in the atmosphere have risen by more than 3 parts per million, the fastest increase ever recorded. Thank Gaia that now learned from Scott Pruitt that the stuff is harmless….Inhale, if the wind’s blowing right you might even cop a buzz! (Of course, if Jefferson Beauregard Sessions finds out carbon dioxide makes you high, he might try to ban it–or arrest you for breathing.) + Here is a map of global sea ice. This year’s line is in red and it’s almost off the chart, in a negative kind of way. Over to you Scott Pruitt! + Yemen is on the brink of a deadly famine. Meanwhile, the US and the Saudis continue bombing and blocking the disbursement of food and medical aid. + Trump on Letterman, Jan. 2015: “A friend of mine was in Scotland recently. He got very, very sick. They took him by ambulance and he was there for four days. He was really in trouble, and they released him and he said, ‘Where do I pay?’ And they said, ‘There’s no charge.’ Not only that, he said it was like great doctors, great care. I mean we could have a great system in this country.” Someone should retool Single-Payer, call it TrumpCare and send it to Trump. Flattery sells. + The Trump administration just gave the CIA expanded authority to conduct killer drone strikes against insurgents and suspected terrorists (and anyone in the vicinity). So much for that feud with the Deep State. + California’s only extant wolf pack has gone missing. None of the seven wolves in the Shasta Pack have been seen since last spring. Have they checked the walls on Uday and Qusay Trump’s trophy room? + Rexxon Tillerson ventured to Asia this week, without the press corps, threatened military action against a nuclear power (North Korea), then cut his trip short, citing “fatigue.” Perhaps he consult “low-energy Jeb!” for advice on how to deal with these incapacitating feelings of ennui .. + We-Vibe, a Canadian vibrator manufacturer, has just been fined $4 million Canadian dollars for tracking the sexual activity of their customers without their knowledge. No word on whether Kellyanne Conway conducted a sweep of the White House after Justine Trudeau’s visit…. + Anarchists are fixing Portland’s battered roads, Block by Black Bloc… + Dr. Joey Hensley is bigoted Tennessee state legislator who has built his political career by attacking the LGBT community. Now courtesy of court records from his divorce we learn that Dr. Hensley has been carrying on an affair over the course of several years with his nurse, who also happens to be his cousin. Hensley also served as his lover’s doctor and prescribed her a steady diet of prescription drugs. Hensley, who was the chief sponsor of the “Don’t Say Gay Bill“, refused to testify at the divorce trial claiming “doctor-patient privilege.” Shortly before this story broke, Hensley had introduced a bill in the Tennessee Senate that would deem babies born through artificial insemination “illegitimate.”  Dr. Hensley is, of course, a self-described “family values Republican.” + Speaking of family values Republicans, another one took a break from hectoring his constituents on the wages of sin to get himself arrested for having sex with a  teenage boy prostitute in a Super 8 Motel in Moore, Oklahoma. Perhaps Trump should start a national crime blotter for such acts of hypocritical venality so America can keep track. It would prove much more entertaining than charting crimes made by poor immigrants. + When ExxonMobile executives conducted contentious internal debates on sensitive topics such as climate change, Exxon chieftain Rex Tillerson adopted a fake email name, Wayne Tracker. It’s not clear yet whether Tillerson had any communications with “John Miller” or “Carlos Danger.” + The fiercely independent historian Marylin Young died this week. I was very sorry to hear this. I spoke on a panel with Marilyn shortly after 9/11. Everything she predicted then has come true and more so. + The return of John Coltrane and James Baldwin in the same year? Maybe Trump is making America great again! + My old pal Steve Kelly, the Bozeman artist and environmentalist, made this stirring video on behalf of Yellowstone’s bison, who are being ruthlessly rounded up and killed as they migrate across the park’s boundaries. Watch and then act. + The great poet of the Caribbean Derek Walcott has died. Here’s a favorite passage from his great poem “Another Life, Fully Annotated” The sun drumming, drumming, Past the defeated pennons of the palms, Roads limp from sunstroke, Past green flutes of the grass The ocean cannonading, come! Wonder that opened like the fan Of the dividing fronds On some noon-struck sahara, Where my heart from its rib cage yelped like a pup After clouds of sanderlings rustily wheeling The world on its ancient, Invisible axis, The breakers slow-dolphining over more breakers, To swivel our easels down, as firm As conquerors who had discovered home.   Sound Grammar What I’m listening to this week…. Freedom Highway: Rhiannon Giddens Change My Game: Thorbjørn Risager & the Black Tornado Reverence: Nathan East Love Has Come Around: Donald Byrd and 125th St., N.Y.C. Man vs. Sofa: Sherwood & Pinch Booked Up What I’m reading this week… The Language of the Third Reich by Victor Klemperer Hitler’s American Model: the United States and the Making of Nazi Race Laws by James Q. Whitman Hard Rain Falling by Don Carpenter Dictatorship of Lies Hannah Arendt: “The moment we no longer have a free press, anything can happen. What makes it possible for a totalitarian or any other dictatorship to rule is that people are not informed; how can you have an opinion if you are not informed? If everybody always lies to you, the consequence is not that you believe the lies, but rather that nobody believes anything any longer. This is because lies, by their very nature, have to be changed, and a lying government has constantly to rewrite its own history. On the receiving end you get not only one lie—a lie which you could go on for the rest of your days—but you get a great number of lies, depending on how the political wind blows. And a people that no longer can believe anything cannot make up its mind. It is deprived not only of its capacity to act but also of its capacity to think and to judge. And with such a people you can then do what you please.” Join the debate on Facebook Jeffrey St. Clair is editor of CounterPunch.

At issue is a controversial custom called “last look,” which allows market makers to back out of a trade. After allegations of abuse, most major banks have recently taken steps to publicly disclose their trading standards to clients. But not all are on board. Top-10 dealer BNP Paribas SA doesn’t. And a big player in high-frequency trading called Tower Research Capital LLC says it doesn’t need to. Industry executives -- still reeling from paying billions in currency-rigging fines -- concede that the largely unregulated $5.1 trillion-a-day foreign-exchange market could use a dose of transparency. As part of an effort to police themselves, traders are hoping a global code of conduct due in May will help shore up their reputation before regulators crack down harder. “There’s a large chunk of the industry that’s disheartened by the scandals and by what’s happened to the industry, and wants to move to a better place,” said Guy Debelle, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia who is helping develop the code of conduct. “People do care about the industry and want it to function effectively and restore some of its lost reputation.” Agreement on standards for last look isn’t widespread. Tower founder Mark Gorton said in an email that his proprietary-trading firm doesn’t buy and sell with counterparties in the way that major banks do, so questions about disclosures aren’t relevant. “BNP Paribas is actively participating in developing the FX market single code of conduct and fully supports its principles,” Alexandra Umpleby, a spokeswoman for BNP Paribas, said in an email. “It is fully committed to conducting its FX market activities in a manner which is consistent with the code.” Last look gives a market maker, such as a dealer, time to back out of a trade. Some argue that the practice has merits, allowing market makers to quote better prices. But a firm could unfairly learn a counterparty’s intentions without having to complete the transaction. The Bank of England has said the practice is vulnerable to misuse. Currencies are traded over-the-counter, making quotes far less transparent than much of the stock market, and prices can vary for each customer. The Bank for International Settlements has characterized the industry as “ suffering from a lack of trust,” a credibility crisis going back to the fixing scandal in 2013. It was made worse two years later, when clients balked after dealers tried to walk away from unprofitable trades caused by a shock policy change at the Swiss National Bank. Barclays Plc in 2015 was fined $150 million for abusing its last-look system -- New York regulators allege support staff had been barred from admitting the practice even existed on its platform -- and now Deutsche Bank AG faces lawsuits. Patchy Efforts Voluntary public disclosures are one way of handling that, though the efforts so far are patchy. JPMorgan Chase & Co. for example has told clients it swears off some of the most contentious behaviors including hedging during the last look window -- potentially using a counterparty’s information to bet against it. XTX Markets Ltd., an automated trading firm climbing the market share rankings, has also made assurances about hedging. The fact that the whole industry hasn’t followed suit is worrying, says David Mercer chief executive officer of LMAX Exchange, an electronic trading platform. “I’m not sure how you can hedge risk you haven’t taken yet -- that’s called front running, and it’s unethical and illegal,” said Mercer. LMAX doesn’t allow last look on its platform and would potentially benefit from restrictions on the practice. “It’s an abhorrence that it exists.” Other firms have warned traders of risks: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says it “may trade prior to or alongside a counterparty’s transaction,” though will try to avoid “undue market impact.” Barclays’ website states trade rejections are for risk management. “At least they are telling clients about what they doing, and then a client will decide to trade or not with them,” Dmitri Galinov, CEO of currency-trading platform Fastmatch Inc. “Any last look disclosure that does not go into details of what is done with the client order info and how it is used during the hold time is inadequate.” Players Changing As the debate unfolds, the industry’s major players are changing. Electronic specialists are eating into market share that was once dominated by banks. And while proprietary traders often don’t have clients in the same way a top-tier bank does, their growing clout has increased scrutiny on their practices. Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up As trading platforms evolve, it’s easier for non-banks to trade directly with counterparties. That makes newer generation electronic market makers like Virtu Financial Inc. and Citadel Securities more closely resemble dealers, meaning they can also use last look. The two firms say they provide foreign-exchange disclosures when they trade directly with another firm, though the documents aren’t public. The industry’s code of conduct may increase pressure on firms to step up their efforts. The code in development by central banks and industry will apply to banks, proprietary traders, investors and operators of electronic platforms. “It’s a bit more than just simple disclosure,” said Debelle, chair of the Bank for International Settlements working group for developing the code. “There’s an obligation to explain to your counterparty what exactly is going on with their order.” Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, operates a currency venue. Technological changes may also make last look obsolete. While the market is fragmented across a range of venues, traders look mainly to two of the biggest platforms -- operated by NEX Group Plc and Thomson Reuters Corp. -- as the authorities on currency prices. Both companies are speeding up price updates on their systems. The upshot is that there’s theoretically less lag -- meaning less room for prices to change unexpectedly. Some traders say that reduces the need to protect themselves via last look. “Last look probably is a somewhat out-of-date practice given the technology we have now,” said Kevin McPartland, head of research for market structure and technology at Greenwich Associates. “However, if investors really had a problem with it, they would have taken their business elsewhere and they for the most part haven’t done that yet.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Home Industry US financial firms embrace cloud, “fat fingers” notwithstanding US financial firms embrace cloud, “fat fingers” notwithstanding Only two years ago, an outage similar to the one that struck Amazon's cloud services last month would have reinforced U.S. financial firms' view that shifting data and systems onto the public cloud was just too risky. By: Reuters | New York | Published: March 17, 2017 11:59 AM About two thirds of global financial firms will be using cloud services in a significant way by next year, IDC predicts. (Reuters) Only two years ago, an outage similar to the one that struck Amazon’s cloud services last month would have reinforced U.S. financial firms’ view that shifting data and systems onto the public cloud was just too risky. The fact that the Feb. 28 shutdown had no visible impact on the industry’s use of cloud services goes to show how far it has progressed since then in embracing the cloud after nearly a decade of hesitation. That change of heart came after providers Amazon Inc , Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc’s Google took steps to assure financial firms and regulators that the cloud not only made tech systems cheaper and faster, but also more reliable and secure than their own server-filled warehouses. The benefits are so unquestionable that last month’s outage caused by an employee who typed in a wrong code was barely a bump on the road to the cloud and merely a reminder that no technology is foolproof, financial executives, Silicon Valley vendors and analysts who work with them said. “You can’t just say if you use Amazon you get the magic cloud sauce and everything will work perfectly,” said Yevgeniy Brikman, the co-founder of Gruntwork, a startup that helps big companies deploy cloud services. “And similarly that if you use your own data center that somehow magically everything will work perfectly. These are just tools.” The payoffs of using the cloud are clear for an industry engaged in rounds of relentless cost-cutting. Calculations performed for Reuters by research firm IDC Financial Insights show the biggest global banks saving $15 billion by 2019 from cloud adoption, cutting technology infrastructure costs by 25 percent. About two thirds of global financial firms will be using cloud services in a significant way by next year, IDC predicts. Developing an application on the cloud can help reduce the time it takes to launch from 89 days to 15 days, according to consultancy McKinsey & Company. JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Capital One Financial Corp and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co are already using shared cloud services from large technology vendors, executives and spokespeople said. So are institutions such as Nasdaq Inc, The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the brokerage industry watchdog. State Street Corp is considering the same. Also Watch: Amazon is the biggest provider with 40 percent of public cloud business, according to Synergy Research. That market totaled $7 billion in the fourth quarter, and is growing at an annual rate of 50 percent. FINRA now runs 90 percent of its critical applications, including market surveillance, on Amazon’s cloud, saving $20 million annually. The recent outage did not affect its satisfaction. “The capability and flexibility to recover quickly is much greater, and it is far more cost-efficient than operating your own geographically dispersed data centers,” said spokesman Ray Pellecchia. TRUCKING DATA Cost savings alone would not have been enough to lure big financial firms. For years, the industry sat on the sidelines due to concerns about data security and regulatory compliance as other corporations took advantage of the cloud’s benefits. Silicon Valley took notice and made changes. For instance, Amazon has expanded its number and locations of data centers around the world to allow customers to choose a particular center to comply with different countries’ privacy rules. Customers can also get dedicated servers to avoid sharing them, or can access information through private networks. In late-November Amazon introduced the “Snowmobile,” a tamper-resistant 45-foot (13.72 m) container pulled by a semi-trailer truck that securely transports customers’ servers to its own data centers. Amazon customers can also set up systems to automatically shift to another data center within its 16 global regions if an outage occurs. That minimized the impact of the recent outage, four financial customers said. Also Watch: George Brady, who heads shared technology operations at Capital One, told Reuters the bank believed big tech companies had “controls for public cloud that are as good or better than capabilities we would provide.” He was speaking before the outage, but later said the bank had factored in occasional glitches and remained committed to the cloud. Capital One builds all new applications on the cloud and plans to reduce its data centers from eight to three by next year. John Madsen, co-head of technology at Goldman Sachs, said his bank has worked with vendors to ensure cloud networks were secure and reliable, and was satisfied with the results. “We’ve had a lot of success with those efforts,” he said. Customers, regulators and lawyers acknowledge that cloud failures could, in theory, wreak havoc. That is why large financial institutions have mostly kept highly sensitive data off the cloud and have back-up plans, like using multiple vendors. An apocalyptic scenario where many data centers fail at the same time is highly unlikely, they say. At a conference this month, Scott Mullins, the Amazon executive responsible for generating new cloud business from financial firms, said security has given way to other issues as financial customers’ top concern when making the decision to move. “About four years ago when we began in earnest talking to financial institutions…security was the No. 1 topic,” he said. “Today we don’t spend as much time talking about security.

Sort posts by Newest Oldest 4:56pm on 17 Mar 2017 That's it for Markets Live today and for the week. Thanks for reading and your comments.        Have a great weekend and see you all again Monday morning from 9. 4:53pm on 17 Mar 2017 The sharemarket nudged close to 2017 highs in a week marked by a rebound in mining stocks as well as an equities-friendly rates decision by the US Federal Reserve. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index shook off some initial inertia on Friday to close 0.2 per cent higher at 5799.6 points, taking its weekly gain to 0.4 per cent. Driving the weekly gains were the big miners, which look to have recovered from a month-long slump, with strong commodity prices, a weaker US dollar as well as attractive valuations lifting the materials sector 4.3 per cent over the week. The benchmark index on Friday rose as high as 5815, just 18 points shy of the year's high struck in February, and some investors think that level is likely to fall soon. A "big resources rally" combining with rises in the banks in what is traditionally a good time of the year for their stocks will take the ASX 200 through 6000 points within the next six weeks, Bell Potter director of institutional sales Richard Coppleson predicted. "This time we have everything lined up for this final assault on the 6000 level," Mr Coppleson said. "But when it gets there – driven by momentum as well – it may be the time to sit back and lock in some gains – but we'll deal with that problem in the future." Not everyone is as bullish though. Perpetual head of investment strategy Matt Sherwood described valuations on the local market as "optimistic" and noted that most of the earnings growth was being delivered by the resources sector. "I tend to think Australia's a pretty boring story this year, and stock selection outside resources is going to be key. Value exists elsewhere in the world," he said.  While investors took some profits on Friday, BHP Billiton rose 4.9 per cent over the week, by far the biggest tailwind for the index. Rio Tinto added 6.7 per cent over the week, South32 was up 5.3 per cent, Fortescue rallied 9.7 per cent and gold miners Newcrest lifted 6.1 per cent. Banks were mostly lower over the week, after a fall in global bond yields weighed on the sector. NAB lost 3.1 per cent, Westpac fell 1.4 per cent, ANZ slipped 1.2 per cent but CBA eked out a 0.3 per cent gain. The week's winners and losers.  4:16pm on 17 Mar 2017 NAB has sold $500 million of "gender equality" social bonds, amid burgeoning demand for ethical investments.  Proceeds of the NAB issue will refinance loans made to a portfolio of businesses, including law firms and property companies, that have a gender equality citation from Australian government body Workplace Gender Equality Agency.  Gender equality bonds are rare in the responsible investing space globally, but the NAB sale follows similar issues in Japan and Chile. The self-arranged five-year issue, to be rated AA minus by S&P and Fitch and Aa2 by Moody's, paid a margin of 95 basis points over bank bill swap rate. Ethical investing in Australia has doubled to $51.5 billion in the last two years, according to the Responsible Investment Association Australasia. But Australia is lagging many of its peers when it comes to responsible bond issuance, with a meagre $3.5 billion worth of debt, nearly all green bonds, sold so far in the country. 3:51pm on 17 Mar 2017 And while we're talking commodities: gold is holding firm near a one-week high hit in the previous session and is on course for its first weekly rise in three. The precious metal is profiting from a weaker US dollar after the US Federal Reserve signalled no increase in the pace of monetary tightening. Spot gold is up 0.1 per cent at $US1227.11 per ounce, after hitting its highest since March 6 in the previous session at $US1233.13. "The market is not sure about the timing of a rate hike in the future. I would expect gold to trade in a wide band of $US1190 - $US1230 between the French elections and US Federal Reserve meeting in May," said Jiang Shu, chief analyst at Shandong Gold Group. "What's happening now is just an inverse trade against the dollar. If there is a risk averse sentiment, we can see both the gold and dollar rising together, especially after a Fed rate hike." Gold is highly sensitive to rising US interest rates, as these increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced. The price rise has contributed to a strong week for gold miners, with the All Ordinaries gold index rising more than 9 per cent, following two weeks of steep declines.  This week's performance of gold miners.  3:44pm on 17 Mar 2017 ANZ plans to scale back its commodities market exposure by quitting trading activity in base metals, coal and iron ore, Reuters is reporting citing two people with knowledge of the matter. The unnamed people said the bank would in future focus on its remaining precious metal, oil, and emissions business. The bank was not immediately available for comment. Back to top 3:04pm on 17 Mar 2017 Myer shares have bounced back from yesterday's slump following some positive analyst comments. Shares were whacked badly after the department store chain reported a disappointing slowdown in sales in the second quarter, but the falls have taken the stock to a level that Macquarie deems worth a buy. The investment bank's analysts note Myer's "lethargic sales line" and concede that a reduced store footprint will only exacerbate the sales decline. But operating cash flow and net cash were both ahead of expectations, they say. "Myer has been in a trading range over the last two years as the company executes its 'New Myer' strategy," Macqurie says. "Now back towards the bottom end of its recent range, trading at 13.9x PE and offering a dividend yield of 4%, we believe a short-term trading opportunity is apparent." The analysts have upgraded the stock to "outperform" with a target price of $1.21. It's currently at $1.14, up 5.6 per cent for the day. 2:52pm on 17 Mar 2017 Westpac has joined NAB in lifting mortgage rates for owner occupiers as well as for investors. Variable rates for owner occupiers will go up by 3 basis points to 5.32 per cent for customers repaying principle and by 8 basis points to 5.49 per cent on interest-only loans. Investors will get slugged by a much higher rise of between 23 and 28 basis points, depending on if principal is repaid, to 5.79 per cent and 5.96 per cent respectively. The bank justified the out-of-cycle step with "economic and regulatory factors". "Today's changes are in response to increasing funding costs," Westpac Consumer Bank chief executive George Franzis said. The bank also lifted rates on variable loans for small business by 8 basis points. The move comes after NAB yesterday hiked interest rates on variable home loans for property investors, while also increasing rates for owner occupiers. The bank will lift the variable interest rate on owner-occupiers' loans from 5.25 per cent to 5.32 per cent, and on residential investment home loans from 5.55 per cent to 5.80 per cent, from next Friday. The RBA may be on hold but the big banks are lifting rates. Photo: Rob Homer 2:00pm on 17 Mar 2017 Not much movement in the Australian dollar today after yesterday's big jump and partial retreat, but the currency is on track for a solid weekly gain as the greenback lost steam after the Federal Reserve indicated it was unlikely to speed up monetary tightening. The Aussie is steady at $US76.79¢, within sight of a three-week peak of US77.20¢ touched early yesterday. Since August, the currency has tried around two dozen times to take a wall a resistance at US77¢, but has failed every time. "The US77¢ level remains a graveyard for the Aussie dollar bulls," said AxiTrader chief market strategist Greg McKenna. "But, for the moment a weak US dollar is keeping the Aussie a bit steady." Much of the recent strength came on broad US dollar selling after the Fed signalled fewer interest rate hikes than some investors had expected. Also underpinning are rising commodity prices and optimism about China's economy. All of which has sent the Aussie 1.7 per cent higher since Monday and if sustained, it would be the first such gain after five weeks of losses. For the year, the Aussie has risen more than four cents. It is also holding large gains versus the Kiwi at $NZ1.1001, having popped above $NZ1.1000 for the first time since April last year. 1:24pm on 17 Mar 2017 Complacency among equity investors is rising after Dutch voters inflicted a blow to political populism and JPMorgan says its a good time to hedge against a slide in stocks. A selloff in equities is now more likely than not, because investors are underestimating the chances of disruption when France holds presidential elections that start next month, according to Marko Kolanovic. The bank's global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy in New York says declines of roughly 5 per cent for the S&P 500 Index would make shares worth buying. Kolanovic's call comes fresh on the heels of Goldman Sachs, which cut its outlook for global stocks this week, and a warning from Allianz Global Investors that equity valuations are becoming stretched. The defeat in this week's Dutch elections of anti-immigration candidate Geert Wilders is being seen as a blow to populist political leaders, especially France's Marine Le Pen. Investors should reduce positions in US equities and buy cheaper emerging-market stocks, Kolanovic said in a note to clients. He also says US stocks will be attractive in the longer term, especially for patient investors ready to wait for a better entry point to buy. "Further complacency may set in in the aftermath of the Dutch elections," Kolanovic wrote. "There will be an increase of uncertainty related to French elections. Near-term, market weakness is more likely than not." 12:55pm on 17 Mar 2017 US financial magazine Barron's has taken a closer look at Harvey Norman. saying "leave this retailer on the shelf": Shares of the company have climbed 161% since 2013 as a booming Australian property market and improved cost controls helped to buoy earnings. But a potential fizzling out of earnings growth this year may cause the stock to lose the spring in its step. Also, Harvey Norman's accounting continues to perplex some analysts. Valuations are also somewhat pricey at 14 times forward earnings. While the multiple is only a tad above that of JB Hi-Fi (JBH.AU), the Harvey Norman rival is expected to deliver stronger earnings growth in coming years and has a simpler business model. JP Morgan's Shaun Cousins says that while the retailer has benefited from a strong Australian housing market, store closures and improvements to working capital management, the environment is now looking less rosy and the next leg of cost cuts less certain. Also, property revaluations contributed a hefty chunk of Harvey Norman's profit in the first half. Capex is also on the rise. It's expected to double year-on-year in fiscal 2017, which ends June, as Harvey Norman ramps up spending on new stores. Here's the whole article Shares are down 1.75 per cent at $4.76, on track for a 3.5 per cent weekly loss. Three analysts have a 'buy' rating on the stock, two a 'hold' and seven a 'sell', with an average price target of $5.00. Is the stock past its prime?  Back to top 12:32pm on 17 Mar 2017 Elon Musk's dramatic intervention into South Australia's energy crisis has enthralled the media and politicians of all persuasions (including, weirdly, the Ukrainian Prime Minister). But for many battle-hardened short sellers – including a string of Australian fund managers – it did little more than elicit a smirk. That's because they have seen this type of thing before. Musk, an enigmatic 45-year-old South African-born billionaire – who wants to colonise Mars and thinks we might be living in a computer simulation – is the greatest showman in tech, an industry renowned for its CEO showmanship. So when Atlassian co-CEO Mike Canoon-Brookes publicly dared him to commit to a vague boast made earlier in the week by his cousin (Tesla's battery boss Lyndon Rive), Musk was never going to say no. "I think it was classic Musk," says Regal Funds Management senior analyst Omkar Joshi. "That's what he does. He goes in and talks things up and capitalises on any situation to promote the brand, himself and the company. And once he runs out of steam, he moves on to the next thing."  The thing is, Tesla's share price and lofty market valuation rely, to some extent, on Musk's undeniable charisma and ability to get some investors to buy into his (admittedly impressive) long-term vision. Rather than, you know, actual financial fundamentals. This has emboldened many short sellers – including Australian fund managers – to target the company. About 26 per cent of shares in Tesla's free float have been sold short, according to Bloomberg – the highest among Nasdaq 100 constituent companies. "Elon has got to be credited with building a very sizeable and so far successful business that is a pioneer in several spaces," says Tom King, from Nanuk Asset Management, a sustainability themed fund which has a small short position in Tesla. "He is a world leader in terms of thinking and acting on these secular shifts in technology, and he believes in the importance of them succeeding for the future of the planet. "But if you work out what's implied by the current share price, that is substantial profit growth, and there are some significant challenges to achieving that." The quality of Tesla's cars and batteries is not in dispute. The same can't be said for its finances. Here's more at the AFR Tesla is the most shorted stock among the Nasdaq 100. Photo: David Rowe 12:11pm on 17 Mar 2017 Shares in Slater and Gordon have soared 35 per cent to 12¢ after the distressed law firm confirmed that its new senior lenders are supportive of a restructure of the company, helping it avoid collapse. Slater and Gordon made the announcement this morning after Fairfax Media reported that its previous senior lenders - Westpac, NAB, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland - had onsold its debt to distressed debt buyers. The share price rise came despite sources telling Fairfax Media that existing shareholders faced being heavily diluted in the restructure. Its shares still remain well below its levels of over $8 in April 2015. 12:00pm on 17 Mar 2017 With US employment growth again surprising forecasters and the jobless rate declining to a boom-time 4.7 per cent, below "full-employment", the question is whether central banks, and the Federal Reserve in particular, are "behind the curve", the AFR's Christopher Joye says: In research this week, Goldman Sachs assessed this using a framework previously advocated by Fed chair Janet Yellen. Goldman found "the Fed's current policy stance is about 1 percentage point easier than prescribed by a Taylor rule that uses a depressed neutral rate" and about 3 percentage points easier when adopting a more normal neutral cash rate of about 4 per cent. The latter assumption "implies that the current policy stance represents the largest dovish policy deviation since the 1970s", which coincided with an inflation break-out. "The implication that current policy is somewhat 'too easy' is consistent with the fact the [US] financial conditions index remains easier than average and is still delivering a positive growth impulse at a time when the Fed is trying to impose deceleration," Goldmans said. The investment bank warns "history counsels caution about falling behind" with the experience of the mid 1960s suggesting that inflation increases much more quickly at very low unemployment rates. Could history repeat itself? Much hinges on policymakers' humility. Central bankers are not fond of acknowledging errors, often rationalising ex post facto via the meme that "this time is different", which can be exacerbated by the desire to propagate an image of infallibility. Remember the once-lionised monetary maven Alan Greenspan? These risks have certainly spooked interest rate investors, although the adjustment process has a way to run. After the second biggest fall in fixed-rate (as opposed to floating-rate) bond prices in modern history in the December quarter, the spectre of a Fed hike in March - duly delivered this week - has lifted long-term rates further.  In Australia the 10-year government bond yield is nearing 3 per cent, significantly higher than the sub-2 per cent level traders—gripped by "cheap money forever" fever—priced in September 2016. Current 10-year yields are, however, still miles below the 5.5 per cent average since the Reserve Bank of Australia started targeting inflation in 1993. Some of the best interest rate traders I know, almost all of whom have never experienced a proper inflation cycle, genuinely believe the RBA "will never hike again". Here's more at the AFR 11:37am on 17 Mar 2017 President Donald Trump's first budget outline, calling for a security-heavy realignment of federal spending, drew resistance from his fellow Republicans in the US Congress as many balked at proposed deep cuts to diplomatic and foreign aid programs. Conservatives have plenty to like in the White House plan, with its 10 per cent increase in military spending next year and beefed-up funding to help deport more illegal immigrants and build a wall on the border with Mexico. It also takes steps to downsize government, a central goal of conservatives. But the gaze into Trump's priorities for the next four years proved too savage for many Republicans' taste, foreshadowing an intense battle between Congress and the White House over spending in coming months. Although Republicans control both the Senate and House of Representatives, Congress holds the federal purse strings and seldom approves presidents' budget plans. The administration asked Congress for a 28 per cent, or $US10.9 billion, cut in State Department funding and other international programs to help pay for a 10 per cent, $US54 billion hike in military spending next year. "These increases in defence come at the expense of national security," said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has not hesitated to take on Trump. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who like Graham ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016, levelled similar sentiments, as did some prominent Republicans in the House of Representatives. House Speaker Paul Ryan sidestepped reporters' questions about whether he supported State Department cuts, saying the White House blueprint was just the start of the budget process. The blueprint, a partial budget request that presidents typically release in their first months in office, doesn't account for his proposals to cut taxes, resolve internal Republican disputes over entitlement spending, or reveal what the White House forecasts for economic growth. That is to come as part of a larger document in May. 11:18am on 17 Mar 2017 OPEC and its allies may prolong production cuts after they expire in June if the world's crude inventories remain excessive, Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister says. The curbs will be sustained if stockpiles are "still above the five-year average, if the markets are still not confident in the outlook, if we don't see companies and investors feel good about the health of the global oil industry," Khalid Al-Falih said in a Bloomberg interview. "We want to signal to them that we're going to do what it takes to bring the industry back to a healthy situation." The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet on May 25 to decide whether to continue its production cuts, aimed at ending a slump that battered the economies of energy exporters around the world. The strategy is moving global markets in the "right direction" and fundamentals have improved considerably, Al-Falih said. So far, Saudi Arabia has shouldered the bulk of OPEC cuts, trimming February output to 10.011 million barrels a day, which is below the ceiling imposed by the agreement. OPEC output in February was 1.39 million barrels a day lower than its reference level. But among the 11 non-members joining OPEC in the accord, compliance is lagging. Led by Russia, the countries reduced their February output by 240,000 barrels a day from October-November levels, or 43 percent of their promised 558,000-barrel reduction. OPEC may extend production cuts. Photo: Martin Divisek Back to top 10:52am on 17 Mar 2017 Dutch banking giant ING's Australian arm expects to increase lending to housing investors this year, allowing it to gain market share as the big four banks pull back for fear of breaching regulatory caps, chief executive Uday Sareen says. ING is Australia's fifth-largest retail bank when it comes to household savings balances and mortgages. It's now looking to gain ground on its bigger rivals with investor loans and new products like insurance, credit cards and personal loans. Its past focus on owner-occupier mortgages means it can increase its investor book while rivals including Commonwealth Bank are restricted from doing so as they risk breaching rules limiting growth in investor loans to 10 per cent. "I don't think we'll be contracting (this year)," Sareen said of ING's investor loan book in an interview. "Our investor share is below 2 per cent. If you have that kind of market share and some of our larger competitors considerably slow down, there is still volume coming through." Here's more ING is hoping to ramp up market share in investor lending.  Photo: Jessica Shapiro 10:32am on 17 Mar 2017 Shares have opened flat, with gains in the big banks offset by losses in energy stocks and some miners as sectors reverse some of yesterday's moves. The ASX is up 5 points at 5791.1, on track for a small weekly gain. Caution is the watchword in early Asia Pacific trading today, says CMC chief market strategist Michael McCarthy. The big banks are all around 0.2 per cent higher, following some gains among their US peers, which had dropped sharply the previous session after global bond yields fell. The miners, meanwhile, are mixed, with BHP down 1 per cent, the biggest drag on the index,  and Fortescue slipping 0.5 per cent, while Rio is up 0.6 per cent. 9:52am on 17 Mar 2017 SPONSORED POST Money is getting tighter, writes IG strategist Chris Weston: It was all about the Federal Reserve on Thursday, although there is still some conjecture and strong market debate as to whether the event had a hawkish or dovish tone to it. However, as we got into the latter stages of Asian trade we saw China lift a number of its interbank tools, hiking the rate on reserve repos (the rate at which its central bank borrows money from local commercial banks on 7-day, 14-day and 28-day contracts), as well as its medium-term and short-term lending facilities. China's central bank has been quick to detail this is not seen as a tightening of monetary policy, but in effect, these measures raise the cost for financial institutions to borrow for different maturities and it will reduce liquidity and act as a handbrake on credit expansion. One suspects a hike to its lending and deposit rates could be on its way. Locally, NAB got much press for lifting the cost of home loans, and investors are asking which bank will be next off the rank as NAB's standard variable rate is now the highest of the big four and just shy of the Band of Queensland's. It was certainly interesting to watch prices of financial stocks on Thursday, even more so as around 11:30am traders really started selling into the banks, which obviously coincided with the soggy employment data.  CBA's US traded shares edged up 0.3 per cent, which suggests Aussie banks could actually find small buyers on the final trading day of the week.

It said that they had been informed that the new owners "fully intend to implement a solvent restructure of the company" and to ensure the company has a sustainable level of debt and a stable platform for its future operations in both Australia and the United Kingdom.  Slater & Gordon said it believes the debt for equity restructure was in the best interests of all stakeholders. It said it was in confidential discussions with the new lenders about the terms of the restructure and provide an update in the coming weeks.  New owners move in. Photo: Paul Jeffers Back to top Search pagination Current page Live Article Posts1 Next Live Article Posts2 Share via Email Post on facebook wall Share on Google Plus Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit 1 new post(s) available.

Deep antagonism between the U.S. and a given trading partner, or “a fundamental assault on the multilateral trading systems, the WTO most obviously -- those would be very bad outcomes,” Winters, the former head of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s investment bank, told reporters at Standard Chartered’s main office in Karachi, Pakistan, on Thursday. “If the WTO loses its effectiveness as a mediating trading body, it’ll be undoing 30 years of progress in global trade.” Winters, Standard Chartered’s 55-year-old chief executive officer, said last month that the bank was “war-gaming” trade disruptions that some of Trump’s policies could cause. The Asia-focused lender has a lot staked on the future of trade, as its executives are attempting to persuade investors they can restore revenue growth after years of missing targets and incurring fines for misconduct. Read more: Standard Chartered’s trade war games The CEO reiterated he didn’t think a full-blown trade war was likely. He said the most probable actions taken by the U.S. would include tariffs or other barriers against specific countries such as China and Mexico, causing little knock-on impact to the global economy. However, he said it’s hard to predict what could happen given the rhetoric used by Trump and his top advisers. ‘Bilateral Spat’ “We could end up with something that’s closer to the narrative we heard during the election, especially with a much more aggressive border adjustment type system that has embedded in it substantial tariff barriers -- we’re talking 20 percent, that’s very material,” Winters said. “Or a bilateral spat that gets out of control” with one of the U.S.’s major trading partners, he said. If Trump does start a fight with China over trade, investment would be driven out of the U.S. and Europe and into Asia, where China would take the lead role in a super-regional trade bloc, Winters said Feb. 24. China’s standing in Asia was already bolstered when the U.S. pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he said. “In the short term those sorts of scenarios could be bad for us,” Winters said. “Can the rest of intra-Asian, South Asian, African, Middle East trade offset the decrease from the U.S.? No. The U.S. is the biggest market in the world by far, certainly the biggest importer in the world by far. It would be damaging to the world economy, it would be damaging to the economies in this region.” Pakistan Risks The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Winters was visiting Pakistan for the first time since taking the helm at Standard Chartered in 2015. He said the bank is looking to take advantage of business opportunities from increased consumer spending, as Pakistan heads into an election next year, as well from power and infrastructure projects. But those opportunities will be offset by the bank’s “extremely high” spending on compliance in the country, Winters said. In June, the lender’s Pakistan head Shazad Dada highlighted banking risks in the South Asian nation from “suspicious money” related to terrorism financing, corruption and human trafficking being channeled through lenders. There are also concerns about the lack of transparency with the terms of Chinese loans for projects in Pakistan. “For us to be involved in a project it’ll have to be perfectly transparent to us, there’s no question about that,” Winters said. “We’re not forming a view on the things we don’t need to be directly involved with. If we thought there was something fundamentally corrupt about the arrangements of the government of course we’d have concern, but we certainly see no indication of that.” Standard Chartered has been operating under a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. authorities since 2012, when it was fined $667 million for violating U.S. sanctions on doing business with Iran. After speaking with local officials and lunching with clients in Karachi, the country’s commercial hub, Winters said he’s more confident about Pakistan’s prospects than many other markets as China pumps in about $55 billion of funds and loans to finance badly needed infrastructure projects in the nation of 200 million people. Pakistan’s economic growth rate of about 5 percent wasn’t reflective of its potential, which is above 7 percent, he said. That can be reached if the government can address its infrastructure bottlenecks and continue to improve security, which has traditionally deterred many foreign investors, Winters said. “When I visit many other markets I don’t get the same sense of optimism,” he said. At the same time “I’m not sure if people are queuing up,” but “Pakistan has now demonstrated three solid years of economic growth, coincided with a drop in commodity prices. So there’s a question, how much of the underlying economic momentum is coming as a result of the lower fuel bill?” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The fact that the Feb. 28 shutdown had no visible impact on the industry's use of cloud services goes to show how far it has progressed since then in embracing the cloud after nearly a decade of hesitation. That change of heart came after providers Amazon Inc , Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc's Google took steps to assure financial firms and regulators that the cloud not only made tech systems cheaper and faster, but also more reliable and secure than their own server-filled warehouses. The benefits are so unquestionable that last month's outage caused by an employee who typed in a wrong code was barely a bump on the road to the cloud and merely a reminder that no technology is foolproof, financial executives, Silicon Valley vendors and analysts who work with them said. "You can't just say if you use Amazon you get the magic cloud sauce and everything will work perfectly," said Yevgeniy Brikman, the co-founder of Gruntwork, a startup that helps big companies deploy cloud services. "And similarly that if you use your own data center that somehow magically everything will work perfectly. These are just tools." The payoffs of using the cloud are clear for an industry engaged in rounds of relentless cost-cutting. Calculations performed for Reuters by research firm IDC Financial Insights show the biggest global banks saving $15 billion by 2019 from cloud adoption, cutting technology infrastructure costs by 25 percent. About two thirds of global financial firms will be using cloud services in a significant way by next year, IDC predicts. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2nrpRoG) Developing an application on the cloud can help reduce the time it takes to launch from 89 days to 15 days, according to consultancy McKinsey &amp; Company. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Capital One Financial Corp and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co are already using shared cloud services from large technology vendors, executives and spokespeople said. So are institutions such as Nasdaq Inc, The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the brokerage industry watchdog. State Street Corp is considering the same. Amazon is the biggest provider with 40 percent of public cloud business, according to Synergy Research. That market totaled $7 billion in the fourth quarter, and is growing at an annual rate of 50 percent. FINRA now runs 90 percent of its critical applications, including market surveillance, on Amazon's cloud, saving $20 million annually. The recent outage did not affect its satisfaction. "The capability and flexibility to recover quickly is much greater, and it is far more cost-efficient than operating your own geographically dispersed data centers," said spokesman Ray Pellecchia. TRUCKING DATA Cost savings alone would not have been enough to lure big financial firms. For years, the industry sat on the sidelines due to concerns about data security and regulatory compliance as other corporations took advantage of the cloud's benefits. Silicon Valley took notice and made changes. For instance, Amazon has expanded its number and locations of data centers around the world to allow customers to choose a particular center to comply with different countries' privacy rules. Customers can also get dedicated servers to avoid sharing them, or can access information through private networks. In late-November Amazon introduced the "Snowmobile," a tamper-resistant 45-foot (13.72 m) container pulled by a semi-trailer truck that securely transports customers' servers to its own data centers. Amazon customers can also set up systems to automatically shift to another data center within its 16 global regions if an outage occurs. That minimized the impact of the recent outage, four financial customers said. George Brady, who heads shared technology operations at Capital One, told Reuters the bank believed big tech companies had "controls for public cloud that are as good or better than capabilities we would provide." He was speaking before the outage, but later said the bank had factored in occasional glitches and remained committed to the cloud. Capital One builds all new applications on the cloud and plans to reduce its data centers from eight to three by next year. John Madsen, co-head of technology at Goldman Sachs, said his bank has worked with vendors to ensure cloud networks were secure and reliable, and was satisfied with the results. "We've had a lot of success with those efforts," he said. Customers, regulators and lawyers acknowledge that cloud failures could, in theory, wreak havoc. That is why large financial institutions have mostly kept highly sensitive data off the cloud and have back-up plans, like using multiple vendors. An apocalyptic scenario where many data centers fail at the same time is highly unlikely, they say. At a conference this month, Scott Mullins, the Amazon executive responsible for generating new cloud business from financial firms, said security has given way to other issues as financial customers' top concern when making the decision to move. "About four years ago when we began in earnest talking to financial institutions...security was the No. 1 topic," he said. "Today we don't spend as much time talking about security."

Corner Bench Memos Bench Magazine Subscribe Login Donate Perceptions Are That Trump’s Policies Are Working President Trump speaks to supporters at a rally in Nashville, Tenn., March 15, 2017. (Reuters photo: Jonathan Ernst) Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by Michael Barone March 17, 2017 12:00 AM @michaelbarone It looks as though employers and others believe Trump’s policies will be effective. Perceptions matter. People make decisions, even life-altering decisions, based on what they perceive as likely to happen. To the extent that public policy affects such decisions, the perception of likely policy change can affect behavior even before the change happens — even if it ends up never happening. Something like that seems to be happening in America — and around the world. In the two months since Donald Trump was inaugurated as president, people have been making decisions based on perceptions of how he may change the country’s direction. Take the economy. The numbers in the jobs report for February, Trump’s first full month in office, showing an increase of 235,000 jobs, are not wildly out of line with some monthly reports in recent years. In contrast with the years of the Obama stimulus program, when the bulk of new jobs came in the public sector, it appears that the increase here is in the private sector. Moody’s Analytics says there were 298,000 new private-sector jobs in February, far more than the 189,000 it expected. Construction jobs were up 58,000. Private educational services jobs were up 29,000. And manufacturing jobs were up 28,000. This suggests that lots of employers, small as well as large, are taking the plunge and creating new jobs. Can I prove that they’re doing so because of perceptions that regulations and taxes will be decreased by the Trump administration? No, and I’m not sure any economist’s statistical model could, either. But it sure looks as if that’s what’s happening. Big players in the financial markets seem to think so. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen suggested the Fed will raise interest rates twice more this year after doing so twice in the past three months. That’s a significant shift from her long-standing reluctance to increase rates at all for fear of dampening the economy. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said March 10 that Trump’s agenda of cutting corporate taxes, building infrastructure and rolling back regulations has unleashed the “animal spirits” — economist John Maynard Keynes’s phrase — of businesspeople. “Even if he gets (just) part of it done,” Dimon, a Democrat and Hillary Clinton contributor, told Bloomberg, “it’ll be good for growth.” Does the unusual speed with which Paul Ryan is leading the House to vote on the first of three promised initiatives to repeal and replace Obamacare suggest that he and Trump are trying to strengthen the perception that the private-sector economy will boom? Given the significant risk of political damage and policy bollix, it certainly looks as if the answer is yes. People at the high end of the income spectrum — a category that obviously includes the bulk of job creators — are not the only ones making decisions in response to perceptions. So, it appears, are undocumented immigrants and people deciding whether to cross the border illegally. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that apprehensions of people who crossed the southern border illegally in February were down 39 percent from January and down 36 percent from February 2016. They were also lower than the border crossings in December — traditionally by far the lowest month — in the years 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012. That’s a startling drop. And it’s one that seems likely to reverberate far beyond Mexico, seeing as most people who have crossed the border illegally since the Great Recession have come from Central America. Under Obama administration policy, Central American children (or adults claiming to be younger than 18) seeking asylum were mostly allowed to remain in the United States, effectively free of border enforcement. Trump’s executive orders on immigration law enforcement have created the perception, probably accurately, that that policy has changed. That message has apparently been delivered to people hundreds or even thousands of miles south of the Rio Grande. Of course, perceptions can change. Perceptions of an incoming president’s likely policies can shape the behavior of many; perceptions of an outgoing president’s policies, not so much. As a president’s term goes on, perceptions of a president’s policies are replaced by the realities of actual policies, and perceptions of likely effects are modified by conditions on the ground. The wisdom of crowds is not always spot on. But it’s sometimes superior to the wisdom of experts. Most experts predicted that Britain’s vote for Brexit and America’s for Trump would crater those countries’ respective economies. That hasn’t happened yet — and most people seem to perceive it won’t. —Michael Barone is a senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and a longtime co-author of The Almanac of American Politics. © 2017 Creators.com Load More Photo Essay Wild Boars of Fukushima About Institute Advertise Contact NR Facebook Twitter Google+ Privacy

Andrea Morales/AFP Christopher Steele, British ex-spy behind Trump dossier: 'Competent, professional operator' U.S. investigators reportedly corroborate part of Trump dossier Controversial dossier on Trump alleges that Russia targets Jewish-American businessmen Two Israelis are at the center of a scam aimed at damaging U.S. President Donald Trump using fake documents detailed in an investigative report on the Buzzfeed website. The 35 pages of documents were meant to show that Exxon funneled $1.6 billion dollars to the Trump Organization last June, using a Chinese company as a go-between.   The dossier was purchased in Italy in January by Israeli journalist and political operative Yoni Ariel at the behest of Democratic political activists in the U.S. The implication of the narrative, had the documents been real, would have been that the U.S. president was somehow bribed to choose Exxon’s CEO, Rex Tillerson, as secretary of state, possibly at Russian behest. >> Get all updates on Israel and Trump: Download our free App, and Subscribe >> Sheldon Schorer, an attorney and former chair and legal counsel for Democrats Abroad-Israel, is credited in the article for passing on the tip that led to the purchase of the documents in Italy by Ariel. Schorer told Haaretz that it “came as a very big surprise” to him to learn that the documents were forgeries and that the cash transfers they documented never happened. Ariel said that he, too, believed that the documents were genuine and was angered that the Buzzfeed piece implied he deliberately represented forged documents as being real. “I would never knowingly try to disseminate something that I knew was fake as true,” he said, charging that Buzzfeed, disappointed when the documents didn’t amount to a scoop that could make a real impact that would damage Trump,  “decided to get creative because they desperately wanted something juicy - and published this piece of shit.” The long and complicated investigative story, headlined “The 1.6 Billion Dollar Hoax,” was published in Buzzfeed on Thursday, and opens with a scene in early January in which “an Israeli named Yoni Ariel flew from Tel Aviv to Rome carrying $9,000 in cash on a secret mission to bring down Donald Trump.” The documents, the story related, turned out to have been an example of what has become a “burgeoning market for potentially damaging information about President Trump and his associates.” It was in Rome, the story says, that Ariel paid an Italian businessman who supplied him with the documents. When Buzzfeed sent the details of the documents and emails to the financial institutions that supposedly transferred the money in the deals - JP Morgan Chase and HSBC - the banks responded that they had no records of such transactions and that some of the details of at least one of the documents revealed it was a forgery. The money transfers in question supposedly happened concurrently with a meeting between Exxon CEO and current Secretary of State Tillerson and Russian president Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg, implying that Exxon and Russia were somehow conspiring to bribe Trump to name Tillerson to his position, reported Buzzfeed. Ariel, a former South African living in Israel who purchased the documents in Italy, is also known as Jonathan Schwartz. He describes himself  to Haaretz in an interview as a journalist, a start-up entrepreneur and a consultant on cybermedia warfare. He currently works as an editor on the news site Tazpit as well as publishing opinion pieces in Jerusalem Online. U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks at the American Center for Mobility for American Manufactured Vehicles in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan, U.S. March 15, 2017. JONATHAN ERNST/REUTERS According to the Buzzfeed article, Ariel  “referred repeatedly to what he said was his experience in international espionage,” and said that as a South African anti-apartheid activist he took part in “political subversion” as well as claiming “credit for unearthing a number of political scandals” in Israel when they interviewed him. Ariel’s name hit the news in Israel as a Labor party activist alleging that then-party leader Shelly Yacimovich violated campaign funding laws by appointing donors to senior party posts, charges that sparked a police investigation in 2013. He also told Haaretz that he was involved in the investigation of the Cyril Kern affair as a journalist in 2003, which led him to being arrested by the Shin Bet, allegedly at the behest of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, but he was later released.  Ariel told Buzzfeed that he learned about the Exxon-Trump documents from Schorer, who told him that in late 2016 he was informed of their existence by a contact in Italy whom Buzzfeed identifies as former Israeli Ambassador to Italy Gideon Meir, who served in the post from 2006 to 2011. “But the Israeli government had nothing to do with this,” Schorer stressed. “It was a private matter.” Schorer told Haaretz that he passed along the information after Ariel told him he was on his way to Washington, D.C. to meet with activists whom Ariel describes as “affiliated with the DNC” (Democratic National Committee). Schorer said he gave Ariel the tip about the Italian documents in case Ariel wanted to pursue it with his Democratic contacts while in Washington. His source, he said, told him that there were documents uncovered by Italian police which “purported to show a suspicious transfer of a huge amount of money,” but didn’t specify “where it came from or where it went to.” Deciding that “I shouldn’t be the one to hold onto it and keep it a secret,” Schorer gave Ariel the tip along with the name of the Italian who he was told had the documents. Schorer had been the face of the U.S. Democratic party in Israel until last summer, making media appearances and speaking for the Democrats at election year debates for nearly three decades, during most of which time the group was small and inactive. When the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and opposition to Donald Trump reenergized many American citizens living in Israel, a new group of political activists contacted the international Democrats Abroad organization and the Clinton campaign. Shortly afterwards, Schorer moved out of his leadership position as the new leaders took charge. The Buzzfeed journalists identified the Italian men who told Meir about the documents, and subsequently peddled them to Ariel for $9000. After Ariel learned of the documents and where to obtain them, the article says, he used a “string of contacts, including the chairman of Democrats Abroad-France, and a former Democratic National Committee operative in Washington, D.C.” to find financing for the purchase. According to Buzzfeed, he ultimately got the funding from left-wing activist Brett Kimberlin “who is also notorious as a felon convicted of setting off bombs in the American heartland.” Ariel would confirm to Haaretz only that the financing came from a “liberal activist” who, when told about the documents, agreed to finance his trips to Italy to pursue the matter through the name he received from Schorer, and ultimately provide the money to purchase the documents. When asked if his reasons for pursuing the mission were his payment as a hired gun, or because he shared a politically-motivated desire to sabotage the Trump presidency, Ariel replied, “Both. Would I have done it at my own expense? No. Would I have been pleased if it had turned out to be true? Yes, I would have been pleased.” Several major media organizations were reportedly given the documents but none of them found them credible or published stories on them and all refused comment to Buzzfeed. Eventually, according to the article, “presented with mounting evidence that the documents were not real, activists who had played a role in their circulation quickly began back-peddling, conceding they seemed more likely than not forgeries. Ariel, on the other hand, continued to try to convince journalists that they were genuine, Buzzfeed reported. Ariel disputes that claim, and is critical of the narrative of the Buzzfeed story overall, dismissing it as a “concoction of the possible and the probable.” “There are two kind of journalists in the world. Those who know how to turn facts into a good story. And those who don’t let the facts get in the way of a good story. The Buzzfeed journalists belong to the second group.” Still, he admits that until last week he did believe there was a strong likelihood the documents were genuine as “more and more red flags started popping up,” adding, “I am willing to say now that the probability that they are fake are significantly higher than that they are not.” The strength of his earlier belief that they were genuine was based on his knowledge that the documents were created in June because, he says, their existence was known to Schorer’s Italian sources as early as July and August. Why, Ariel asked himself, would “scammers” invest so much money in creating documents implicating Trump last summer at a time when his election seemed so unlikely and a Hillary win seemed certain? At that time, he said, “Someone approached the Democrats about them, but at that point the Democrats were so confident of Hillary’s victory that they said thanks, but no thanks.”   He says he also isn’t certain the documents were purely a “financial scam” and says there is a possibility they were a trap set by Russian intelligence meant to be part of “a disinformation campaign to paralyze and subvert the American political system.” If media outlets had published them presenting them as real, he suggests, proof could quickly emerge showing they were forgeries “and then  Trump would yell fake news, and it would be another nail in the coffin for the ‘fake media.’ In the current climate, he said, “both possibilities are equally plausible.” Allison Kaplan Sommer Haaretz Correspondent Allison Kaplan Sommer Send me email alerts for new articles by Allison Kaplan Sommer Send Close Email * Please enter your email Allison Kaplan Sommer For a list of Haaretz newsletters, click here.

Forbes ranks Trump as the world’s 544th richest person, after coming in at No. 324 last year. He has famously refused to reveal his tax returns that would identify his actual net worth, but has claimed it’s “in excess” of $10 billion. Bill Gates now resides at the top of the list.

Penney may be on the chopping block CNBC0:47 UP NEXT Stocks closed mostly lower Thursday as modest gains in financial stocks failed to offset declines in health care and utilities stocks.  The Dow lost 15 points, the S&P 500 shed 0.16 percent, and the Nasdaq was little changed.  Quotes in the article Dollar General Corp DG ▼ 71.60 -0.73 -1.01% Adobe Systems Inc ADBE ▼ 126.31 -0.70 -0.55% AdChoices Utilities fell more than 1 percent as the worst performer in the S&P 500 in afternoon trade, followed by the health care stock sector, which lost about 1 percent. Shares of Biogen led declines, dropping nearly 5 percent after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to equal weight. Analysts also attributed the overall health care stock declines to President Donald Trump's budget blueprint, released Thursday, that proposed cutting the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) spending by $5.8 billion. "The proposed cut in the NIH budget is pretty significant and I don't know if it will happen," said Paul Yook, portfolio manager at BioShares Funds. "The NIH is a $32 billion budget. It was expected to increase 3 percent. To have it slashed by 18 percent, $6 billion, is a tremendous change." On Wednesday, the health care sector hit a fresh high going back to August 2015. Financials traded about half a percent higher as the top performer in the S&P. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase were among the top contributors to gains the Dow Jones industrial average. "The market saw a bullish reaction to the Fed's announcement yesterday, allowing the S&P futures to clear intraday resistance. The ratio of up- to down-volume was better than 5-to-1, setting the stage for upside follow-through today," Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG, said in a note. However, she still expects stocks to remain in "pullback-mode until short-term momentum improves."  U.S. crude oil futures reversed earlier gains to trade slightly lower below $49 a barrel. WTI snapped a seven-day losing streak Wednesday after weekly inventory data showed a drawdown in stockpiles. In corporate news, Toronto-based luxury apparel maker Canada Goose went public on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday. Shares opened at US$18 and were last trading near $16, about 25 percent above their IPO price. Canada Goose will also trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected and continued to signal two additional hikes this year. Policymakers said inflation should now "stabilize" around 2 percent and they would continue to monitor developments relative to the Fed's "symmetric" inflation goal. Markets had generally expected indication of more aggressive tightening. U.S. stocks closed higher Wednesday, with the Nasdaq 100 at a record. Stock index futures held higher after a slew of Thursday morning economic reports. The latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed job openings were little changed at 5.6 million on the last business day of January 2017. Weekly initial jobless claims fell to 241,000. Housing starts rose in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.288 million, more than expected. The Philly Fed Index also topped forecasts at 32.8 for March. Gold futures leaped to their highest since March 6. Futures for April delivery settled up $26.40 at $1,227.10 an ounce. While the Fed statement was "arguably hawkish overall, it was not as hawkish as many people in the market place feared, which lifted commodities and [sent] the dollar lower," said Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco Metals. Treasury yields edged higher, steadying after a drop Wednesday afternoon. The 2-year yield was last near 1.32 percent and the 10-year yield traded around 2.52 percent. The U.S. dollar index traded about a third of a percent lower, with the euro around $1.073 and the yen near 113.1. The euro topped $1.07 late Wednesday after the Dutch election gave Prime Minister Mark Rutte a victory over populist rival Geert Wilders. "I think the economic data continues to support the growth thesis," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private bank. "Political risk seems to have pulled back a bit on the Dutch election. Most of the action we're seeing is overseas." Overseas, the STOXX Europe 600 traded more than half a percent higher. The Shanghai composite rose 0.8 percent and the Hang Seng jumped nearly 2.1 percent after China's central bank raised short-term interest rates. The Nikkei 225 closed 0.07 percent higher. U.S. crude oil futures for April delivery settled down 11 cents at $48.75 a barrel. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

People make decisions, even life-altering decisions, based on what they perceive as likely to happen. To the extent that public policy affects such decisions, the perception of likely policy change can affect behavior even before the change happens — even if it ends up never happening. Something like that seems to be happening in America — and around the world. In the two months since Donald Trump was inaugurated as president, people have been making decisions based on perceptions of how he may change the country's direction. Take the economy. The numbers in the jobs report for February, Trump's first full month in office, showing an increase of 235,000 jobs, are not wildly out of line with some monthly reports in recent years. In contrast with the years of the Obama stimulus program, when the bulk of new jobs came in the public sector, it appears that the increase here is in the private sector. Moody's Analytics says there were 298,000 new private-sector jobs in February, far more than the 189,000 it expected. Construction jobs were up 58,000. Private educational services jobs were up 29,000. And manufacturing jobs were up 28,000. This suggests that lots of employers, small as well as large, are taking the plunge and creating new jobs. Can I prove that they're doing so because of perceptions that regulations and taxes will be decreased by the Trump administration? No, and I'm not sure any economist's statistical model could, either. But it sure looks as if that's what's happening. Big players in the financial markets seem to think so. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen suggested the Fed will raise interest rates twice more this year after doing so twice in the past three months. That's a significant shift from her long-standing reluctance to increase rates at all for fear of dampening the economy. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said March 10 that Trump's agenda of cutting corporate taxes, building infrastructure and rolling back regulations has unleashed the "animal spirits" -- economist John Maynard Keynes' phrase — of businesspeople. "Even if he gets (just) part of it done," Dimon, a Democrat and Hillary Clinton contributor, told Bloomberg, "it'll be good for growth." Does the unusual speed with which Paul Ryan is leading the House to vote on the first of three promised initiatives to repeal and replace Obamacare suggest that he and Trump are trying to strengthen the perception that the private-sector economy will boom? Given the significant risk of political damage and policy bollix, it certainly looks as if the answer is yes. People at the high end of the income spectrum — a category that obviously includes the bulk of job creators -- are not the only ones making decisions in response to perceptions. So, it appears, are undocumented immigrants and people deciding whether to cross the border illegally. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that apprehensions of people who crossed the southern border illegally in February were down 39 percent from January and down 36 percent from February 2016. They were also lower than the border crossings in December — traditionally by far the lowest month — in the years 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012. That's a starling drop. And it's one that seems likely to reverberate far beyond Mexico, seeing as most people who have crossed the border illegally since the Great Recession have come from Central America. Under Obama administration policy, Central American children (or adults claiming to be younger than 18) seeking asylum were mostly allowed to remain in the United States, effectively free of border enforcement. Trump's executive orders on immigration law enforcement have created the perception, probably accurately, that that policy has changed. That message has apparently been delivered to people hundreds or even thousands of miles south of the Rio Grande. Of course, perceptions can change. Perceptions of an incoming president's likely policies can shape the behavior of many; perceptions of an outgoing president's policies, not so much. As a president's term goes on, perceptions of a president's policies are replaced by the realities of actual policies, and perceptions of likely effects are modified by conditions on the ground. The wisdom of crowds is not always spot on. But it's sometimes superior to the wisdom of experts. Most experts predicted that Britain's vote for Brexit and America's for Trump would crater those countries' respective economies. That hasn't happened yet — and most people seem to perceive it won't. — Michael Barone is a senior political analyst for The Washington Examiner, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a Fox News Channel contributor and a co-author of The Almanac of American Politics.

For Gallina, Metropolitan 'a game changer’' By ANDREA DECKERT Rochester Business Journal February 24, 2017 Andrew Gallina does not expect the Metropolitan to fade into the background.  Rather, he expects the towering building in the center city to serve as a prominent part of the Rochester skyline.  “It’s going to be a game changer down here,” said Gallina, president of Gallina Development Corp.  The firm is the owner and developer of the Metropolitan, a $35.2 million mixed-use commercial and residential project. It was formerly called the Chase Building. Gallina acquired the property in March, 2015 for nearly $5.4 million.  Gallina Development ranked fifth on the most recent Rochester Business Journal list of real estate developers, ranked by total local, nonresidential square footage. The firm owns and manages roughly 2.5 million square feet of office and warehouse space throughout Monroe County. Gallina also owns One East Avenue, Panorama Landing Business Park and Towers Airport Business Park on Scottsville Road in Chili. Gallina and his daughter, Lauren Gallina, the firm’s marketing director, recently sat down with the Rochester Business Journal to talk about the Metropolitan’s transformation and their hopes for growing downtown. An edited transcript follows:   The project ROCHESTER BUSINESS JOURNAL: What do you think of the project so far?  ANDREW GALLINA: It’s been a challenging and complex project. The new entrance is the biggest component, which finally is coming together; and we’re in the final stages of the construction. That’s very exciting, and it’s even bigger and more dominant than what we anticipated on paper. So, I think it’s going to be wonderful.  We have four or five distinct projects going on in the building at any one time. The entranceway is one big component. We’re also under renovations in the lobby. There’s new tile, a painted ceiling and we have removed the bridge to the old Midtown skyway. There’s a new security desk, elevator renovations for all eight elevators, a digital directory and we are in discussions to place a restaurant in the plaza level.  We are converting (some) floors from office to residential, market-rate apartments. Our first tenants should take occupancy April 1. We get calls every day and have a lot of interest; I think they’ll all go.  Floors 16 to 21 will have apartments and the initial plan is for condominiums on floors 22 to 26. Floors three to 15 will be office.  We are shooting for a lot of the work to be done this spring, early summer, with the front entrance loop and lobby done by then. The restaurant could open in May.  RBJ: What’s your favorite part of the project?  ANDREW GALLINA: What really grabs me is the front entrance. It’s quite a complicated arch, because it’s not only an arch; it hangs out and covers the driveway. It’s a complicated structure to build. When I saw it, I said that’s cool, let’s do that.  We worked with Hanlon (Architects P.C.) and others, and there were many variations of the design from a simple entrance to a little more elaborate to this, which is pretty much over the top. This makes a statement for the building. It’s not just an entrance; it provides a feeling as to what we’re trying to accomplish.  When we purchased the building, there was a big bridge here. We called it the bridge to nowhere because it was cut off. It wasn’t functional; it couldn’t be utilized, so we demolished that. We took it down, at no small expense, and opened up space with visions of creating a central area that would be a focal point. We designed a new bridge at grade level. Now as you enter from the new drive-up loop, you walk across this new subtly lighted bridge to the security desk, to the elevators and to the restaurant and sitting areas. RBJ: Talk about some of the challenges associated with this project. ANDREW GALLINA: I think our real challenge is the full design and engineering component. As I mentioned, it’s a very complicated arch design. We didn’t just fill in the moat around the building; we actually had to build a bridge so the driving surface was actually a bridge made out of structural steel. It’s really a unique design and challenging, from not only concept and engineering, but also from the contractors and constructability. It presented problems every step of the way.  LAUREN GALLINA: I think the other challenging part is that we’re totally changing the functionality of the building. So we’re going from a strictly commercial building to a mixed-use building and thinking about things that didn’t exist before. Things like a trash chute that goes through the entire building, a mailroom for tenants to receive packages and mail, a fitness center as an amenity space, bike storage—so things that didn’t exist here before. We really tried to modernize it in that way to have the experience of a true mixed use building. Residential units RBJ: What demographic has been inquiring about the residential units? LAUREN GALLINA: A lot of young professionals, a lot of empty nesters. It will become clearer as the leasing process moves forward. We’ve had newly divorced people, people with alternative lifestyles, show interest.  There’s a real desire to be in the heart of what’s happening, and there is a new energy down here. You feel it with some of the projects going on here; with Tower280 across the street, and the new workforce (downtown). There’s new energy happening, and I think people really want to be a part of that. I am also getting calls about condos. They are still a ways out, but I think people really have an interest in homeownership in the heart of downtown, which isn’t something that’s available right now.  RBJ: Why do you think there’s such an interest in homeownership downtown? LAUREN GALLINA: There’s a sense of pride associated with homeownership; a sense of belonging when you have a non-transient population investing their own money and stake in the ground, staying a long time, thinking about their future in that space. So it’s different than a rental unit, where you’re signing a lease year to year.  City focus RBJ: You’ve traditionally developed properties outside of the city. But over the past few years, you’ve been making more of an investment downtown. Why now? ANDREW GALLINA: I’ve been a city resident for 40 years. And I’ve always had an interest in our downtown corridor and what’s happening and how it’s coming back. For so many years (there has been) the lack of vibrancy. We talked about managing decline for years and years, and we’re finally at a tipping point at trying to manage growth, which is a difficult concept when you haven’t been there before. So it’s a very different dynamic, and the conversation is different. So just thinking in the future, I jumped in at One East Avenue. (Bank of America N.A.) wanted out of the real estate component, and I thought it was a good opportunity. Then JPMorgan (Chase & Co.) wanted to divest its real estate portfolio too (at the Chase building). They wanted to focus on banking operations, so once we started getting closer, we started to say we have to be ready, we have to develop a vision. We saw it as a great opportunity to mix it up a little bit and really rebrand this building. This was a classic (example) in managing decline. The bank was not leasing space, not investing money, was not trying to take care of the building, they were just status quo. So there’s new life, energy and investment in the building.  LAUREN GALLINA: This building is so iconic. It’s recognizable. You see it from most parts of city, and it’s exciting that we are able to put our footprint on something that’s been such an institution in the heart of downtown for so long.  Especially as a multigenerational company, we’re happy to be doing it together.  ANDREW GALLINA: Lauren, Robby and Evan (Gallina’s adult children) all work in the business, and it’s really important to get the next generation involved in leadership and the direction of the city.  I keep talking about creativity. You’ve got to be creative. We can’t rebuild the city the way it was; we need to raise the bar. We’re raising the bar here. We see that and try to push everybody to push the limits.   RBJ: There have been a number of mixed-use projects either recently developed or proposed downtown. Do you worry there are too many units to fill?  ANDREW GALLINA: With the projects in line now, I don’t think any planned now would have trouble being leased; I really don’t. The vacancy for market rate housing is very low right now. More product is coming online, but there continues to be a demand.  We have a list of well over 200 people who have interest, so I don’t think we’ll have trouble leasing our initial 28 units. As we go along, we’re trying to react to the market, and we’ll do that, but I think we’re OK for a while. I think our city is going to be OK for a while. LAUREN GALLINA: But that’s also why we kept some of the building commercial. We want that flexibility of who we are able to accommodate in the space.  People are taking notice that this is a different type of project. It’s exciting, and there is an interest and support around it. We feel embraced by everyone in terms of the positive comments and energy that have been thrown our way for doing something of this scale.  RBJ: What impact do you think the Metropolitan will have on downtown development? ANDREW GALLINA: If you look at Datto (Inc., which is expanding in the Metropolitan), why that deal is so important is because it paves the way for other high-tech companies, and other millennials, that demographic of workforce coming downtown. Hopefully that will attract others to follow suit, and that continues to be my hope. Because that’s what drives a city; people living and working downtown. And we’re doing a pretty good job of attracting the residential side, from a rental standpoint. Office occupancy is 24 percent, which is dismal, and we need to fill up some space to get this momentum going again, so the next sector focused on is condos.  Homeownership is almost nonexistent in the Inner Loop, at less than 4 percent, so that mix of residence is very important in a vibrant city, and we just don’t have that yet. We hope it’s coming. Parcel 5 RBJ: Why did you throw your hat in the ring for Parcel 5, the 1.1-acre, shovel-ready city-owned site where Midtown Plaza once stood?  ANDREW GALLINA: Where that started was simply a conversation as to what our vision would be. What would be the highest and best use of Parcel 5? Where we started was a community solution.  We have four components to that project. We’re maintaining a very sizable portion for green space, for a park. We plan to develop a two-story underground parking garage, because we have parking challenges in this downtown area. We’re addressing some of the retail and commercial space, so we can really energize Main Street in terms of retail development. Then the fourth is for-sale condos, once again addressing that need for homeownership within the Inner Loop. It wasn’t just our project. It was about what do you think would be the best, and that’s why we really focused with that project on presenting what we thought was the best option. 2/24/2017 (c) 2017 Rochester Business Journal.

 Brexit has started to kill off jobs in London: 'We’ve already witnessed, what was a handful of jobs leaving, become hundreds. How long before we’re looking at losing thousands, even millions?' Ben Moshinsky, Business Insider UK Mar. 16, 2017, 5:50 AM 1,716 facebook linkedin twitter email print The sun is setting on the City of London Charles Clark/Business Insider LONDON – The number of new available jobs listed in the the UK's financial centre fell 17% in February year-on-year to 6,945, according to a survey by Morgan McKinley. The number of people seeking jobs dropped by a huge 38% from February 2016, while month-on-month the number of fresh open positions decreased by 23% in February. Those who did find new jobs in February got an average of a 19% pay rise. In July, the month after the June Brexit vote, the survey reported that the number of new City jobs plunged 27% while the number of people seeking them dropped 13%. "Brexit has pushed institutions into two camps," said Hakan Enver, operations director at Morgan McKinley Financial Services, adding: "On one side we’ve got the 'business as usual’ team, and on the other we have the institutions that are tired of the government’s hemming and hawing and have already begun to move jobs to other EU countries. It’s the latter group that’s contributed to the quarter drop in jobs available." Here is the chart of new jobs: Morgan McKinley "There’s a chance we’ll see a post Article 50 uptick in April, just as we did post-Brexit," he said. "But the data suggests that Brexit has had a fundamental depressing effect on City jobs. We’ve already witnessed, what was a handful of jobs leaving, become hundreds. How long before we’re looking at losing thousands, even millions?" Brexit, and the future status of London as the European Union's financial centre, has been the main focus for those entering the City's job market. Prime minister Theresa May's government has raised the possibility of a so-called "Hard Brexit," which prioritises immigration control over membership of the European single market. Such a move would also lead to the automatic loss of the City of London's EU financial passport. The loss of passporting rights would be devastating to the City of London. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said earlier this year that 5,500 UK companies rely on passporting rights, with a combined turnover of £9 billion.  HSBC, JPMorgan, and UBS have all warned about job relocations. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, told Bloomberg at Davos that the bank will likely move more people than previously thought. "It looks like there will be more job movement than we hoped for," Dimon said. The bank employs 16,000 people in the UK.    More from Business Insider UK: ESPN anchor puts Tiger Woods on the spot and calls him out for his balding hair Here's what the future holds for ESPN Films after winning an Oscar for its O.J.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Mar 18, 2017 at 10:42AM If there was any doubt about Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) desire to raise its dividend, then CEO Brian Moynihan's recently released annual letter to shareholders should put that doubt to rest. Moynihan mentioned the word "dividend" nine times in his letter, two of which referenced the bank's "focus on increasing" its quarterly payout. This will come as no surprise to investors who have followed Bank of America's progress since the financial crisis, when the bank was forced to cut its once-generous dividend to $0.01 per share. Soon after Moynihan took over at the beginning of 2010, he made it clear that one of his priorities was to restart the flow of capital to shareholders. Image source: Getty Images. The problem, however, was that the Federal Reserve had different ideas. It gained authority over big-bank capital plans in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act as part of the central bank's duty to oversee the industry's annual stress tests. In the inaugural test under the new legislation in 2011, Bank of America's request to increase its dividend was denied, which seems to have convinced the North Carolina-based bank to avoid asking for another increase until 2014, when it boosted its quarterly payout to $0.05 per share. It then increased it again, to $0.075 per share, two years later. BAC Dividend data by YCharts. Meanwhile, all of the other large banks, with the exception of Citigroup, have been given the go-ahead to raise their dividends on an annual basis. The net result is that Bank of America pays out half as much of its earnings to shareholders each year compared to banks like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase. It's for this reason that one of Moynihan's top hopes for the current presidential administration, which has vowed to ease the regulatory burden on banks, is that it will remove the Fed's veto power over big-bank dividend plans. Asked at an industry conference last year what aspects of Dodd-Frank that Congress and the incoming Trump administration should revisit, Moynihan answered: For us as a company, just because of where we are, it's about capital return.... It's about getting certainly around the ability to have access to your capital return once you've met all the hurdles. And whether those hurdles move up or down because of various peoples' points of view, the issue is the industry's above them, and now we need to be able to get the capital out. Whether this actually happens remains to be seen. But even if it doesn't, given Bank of America's improving prospects, with near-record earnings in 2016 and an even better performance shaping up for 2017 thanks to rising interest rates, it seems safe to say that shareholders of the nation's second biggest bank by assets will see their quarterly dividend checks rise over the quarters and years ahead.

Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Marc Abramowitz thought he’d found kindred spirits in the founders of Palantir Technologies Inc. Like Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp and billionaire Chairman Peter Thiel, Abramowitz was a Stanford University alumnus looking to build a business empire. In 2006, Abramowitz made an investment in their then unknown startup and became a regular around the office. In recent years, Palantir has risen to be a global data mining giant with a $20 billion valuation. Abramowitz’s shares are estimated to be worth $60 million. But his relationship with the founders has turned toxic, and they now have competing lawsuits in two states. Abramowitz’s suit was filed last week in Delaware’s Chancery Court, saying Palantir thwarted his efforts to sell shares and that the company must disclose its books and records. Bloomberg has obtained an unredacted copy of the suit, which hasn’t been previously reported. It alleges that Palantir blocked a planned sale of Abramowitz’s shares to Chinese private equity firm CDH Investments Fund Management Co. and that Palantir violated an agreement with Abramowitz to provide him with quarterly financial statements and access to shareholder meetings. Palantir, which sued Abramowitz in September for attempting to claim patent ownership for the company’s work, said the new suit is without merit. It said it shouldn’t have to disclose information about its inner-workings or finances because Abramowitz’s interests are at odds with the company’s. “This lawsuit is nothing more than a blatant attempt to distract from Mr. Abramowitz’s unlawful and egregious theft of our intellectual property,” Palantir wrote in an emailed statement. Founded in 2004, Palantir is among Silicon Valley’s most highly valued and secretive companies. In addition to Abramowitz’s investment firm KT4 Partners LLC, an early backer was the venture capital arm of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Palantir’s customers include government spy agencies around the world. It’s well-positioned to cash in on more government work thanks to Thiel’s relationship with President Donald Trump. The legal battles highlight the contentious relationships between startup investors and companies that want to maintain tight control of stockholders. Investors rarely receive financial updates and wield little influence over their ability to cash out through a stock sale, merger or initial public offering. Thiel, 49, maintains a variety of business interests, from internet, finance and energy to rocket ships. Abramowitz, 64, has his own eclectic mix of holdings. He has owned, operated or invested in a medical startup, a lumber business and a hobby-and-craft store, according to a former employer, the private equity firm Riverlake Partners LLC. Abramowitz purchased Palantir shares through his KT4 Partners from 2006 to 2008, according to the suit. He claimed contracts entitled him to quarterly financial statements and annual shareholder meetings, neither of which ever took place. This didn’t appear to bother him much at the time, because he began to frequent the startup’s Palo Alto, California, headquarters. He spent so much time at Palantir’s campus from 2010 to 2015 that he requested his own office, according to the suit filed by Palantir in September. Palantir’s trust in Abramowitz broke down after the investor filed for five patents in his name for work completed by the company, according to the September lawsuit. Palantir claimed he stole trade secrets. During the past two years, Palantir interfered in two attempts by Abramowitz’s firm to sell stock, according to his suit. KT4 Partners negotiated in May 2015 to sell preferred shares to Highbridge Capital Management LLC, once majority-owned by JPMorgan Chase Co. When Abramowitz’s group notified Palantir of the sale, Palantir dispatched an adviser to Highbridge in an attempt to persuade the firm to purchase shares directly from the company. Alexander Fishman, the adviser and a former Palantir employee, was told by a Highbridge managing partner to leave because an agreement had already been made. Palantir’s CEO personally intervened to approve the transaction after he was informed that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was going to contact him, the suit alleged. In December 2015, KT4 Partners and other shareholders, including early Palantir employee Rosco Hill, had negotiated the sale of hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of stock to a fund organized by TPG. The planned buyer was China’s CDH Investments, according to the unredacted court filing. Hill, who once served as “advisor to the CEO,” told Palantir about the proposed sale, and the company again dispatched the same advisory firm as before. CDH Investments backed out of the deal after that meeting, the suit said. Stuart Schonberger, managing director at CDH Investments who was involved in the proposed deal, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up In August 2016, Palantir sought to retroactively amend the contracts with Abramowitz’s firm to remove references to financial disclosures and annual meetings, the suit said. It also tried to stipulate that incoming shareholders wouldn’t have access to such information if KT4 Partners sold its shares. A month later, Palantir filed suit. Since then, its CEO has begun to publicly entertain the idea of providing a consistent way for stockholders to cash out, including a potential IPO. The Delaware case is KT4 Partners LLC v. Palantir Technologies Inc., 2017-0177, Delaware Court of Chancery. The California case is Palantir Technologies Inc. V. Abramowitz, 16CV299476, California Superior Court, Santa Clara County (San Jose). Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

GOP assault on Obamacare rattles workers in California's 'gig economy' The health-care law's unraveling is expected to shake workers in non-permanent jobs around the country, but probably no place is more affected than the Golden state.

With the Silicon Valley and on-demand companies like Lyft and Uber in its backyard, the Bay Area will be a laboratory for determining whether repeal efforts shift employment away from temporary jobs and startups into more traditional employment — potentially dampening innovation. Story Continued Below As goes California, so might go the rest of the nation in an economy increasingly built around temporary jobs, freelance gigs, part-time work and entrepreneurial ventures — arrangements that typically lack health care and other benefits. A new report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office showing the number of uninsured people growing by 24 million in a decade under the GOP plan to repeal the health law fuels concerns that more Americans will suffer "job lock" — meaning they won't leave their jobs for fear of losing health coverage. As a result, the repeal plan could stifle entrepreneurship and small business creation widely credited with driving economic growth. “Lawmakers who dream of gutting the Affordable Care Act do not seem to care about its importance to small business owners, particularly those who are solo entrepreneurs," John Arensmeyer, founder and CEO of Small Business Majority, wrote in a Health Affairs blog post. "What these politicians fail to understand is that the health care law is the first meaningful insurance reform available to entrepreneurs in decades. In fact, for many self-employed business owners, their firms would not exist without it.” Concerns over health benefits hang over Lisa Nieves' dreams of starting her own business. The Oakland, Calif., resident, who was covered under Obamacare's Medicaid expansion most of the past two years, is trying to open a worker-owned cafe and wants to cover her prospective employees as well as herself. The law's repeal could spur her to put her plans on hold. “If Obamacare gets repealed, I’m anxious. What do I do?” she said. “Right now, there is just so much instability. I don’t know how that will shift the market and what that will mean for health insurance costs in terms of small businesses ... This could be the thing that deters us from moving forward.” White House Trump’s media diet causes global heartburn By Matthew Nussbaum Republicans have argued that Obamacare, in fact, may discourage people from entering the workforce because insurance subsidies decrease as incomes rise. “We don't want federal tax law or tax credits to ever encourage a person not to advance, not to get a raise, not to take a job,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said last week. But the Republicans’ tax credits for insurance could have a similar effect, making households lose subsidies as income rises until they phase out at $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for families. Sam Altman, who runs the Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, credits the ACA with helping a lot of founders start their companies. “The Affordable Care Act is far from perfect — for one thing, I think health insurance should be entirely separate from employment — but I hate the thought of losing it without a replacement for people who will lose insurance,” he wrote in a blog post, in which he shared the stories of startup founders who used Obamacare to get health insurance while taking the inherently risky step of starting their companies. It's tough to determine whether Obamacare directly contributed to an individual’s decision to start their own business or leave a full-time job to become an entrepreneur. What is clear is that the self-employed have taken advantage of the new ACA marketplaces. Figures released this year by the U.S. Treasury Department shortly before President Donald Trump took office showed one in five people who enrolled in the Obamacare marketplaces in 2014 were small business owners or self-employed, or both. These enrollees were nearly three times as likely to purchase ACA coverage as other workers. There are between 54 million and 68 million independent workers in the labor force, defined as any individual “who can move between jobs fluidly and who has multiple employers or clients over the course of the year,” in a McKinsey Global Institute study published last fall. The software company Intuit predicts that will be part of the “contingent workforce” by 2020. Those working for online on-demand companies like TaskRabbit, AirBnB and ride-sharing services get the most attention, but make up a relatively small percentage of the independent, non-employee workforce. Trump cracks the whip on Obamacare, fueling GOP momentum The cohort grows bigger when other types of independent workers are factored in — the budding entrepreneurs, sole proprietors, dog walkers and graphic designers and writers who freelance for many companies. Some work part-time as employees, but also earn a significant share of their income from independent work. Such arrangements leave the individuals shut out of employer-sponsored health insurance because they aren't full-time workers. Instead they typically obtain coverage through the Obamacare health exchanges, a spouse's health plan, privately purchased insurance or government payers including Medicaid. Workers younger than 26 can now remain on their parents’ policy under the ACA. “The Affordable Care Act was a very important step in making health care available for people who do not have coverage through a job. The ability to get health coverage has always been a barrier in the U.S. to entrepreneurship,” said Ken Jacobs, who runs the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center for Research and Education. Gauging the size of the independent workforce is tough, because there’s no one, clear definition of who makes up that population. UC Berkeley labor researchers are working on a study to get a handle on the size of the independent workforce — those who don’t receive W-2 forms from an employer and, instead, file 1099 tax forms. What’s clear is that this segment of the workforce is growing. A JPMorgan Chase Institute study last year found a 47-fold increase in the number of people nationwide earning income in the gig economy between 2012 and 2015. San Francisco, where many of these large on-demand companies are based, has the largest percentage of workers earning income from these on-line platforms — at 5.1 percent, according to the study. Many of these workers have moved from their parents' plans into a market where there are no coverage caps and applicants can’t be rejected for pre-existing conditions. While they may be struggling with rising rates, they don’t recall the sky-high premium spikes that fueled the Obamacare debate in 2009. And despite Obamacare’s flaws, they’re worried their post-ACA options could be worse. “A lot of these people came of age during the ACA,” said Andy Slavitt, former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “The very idea they can’t do these things and get health insurance is just starting to dawn on them.” Congress Freedom Caucus aligns with Bannon in risky Obamacare gambit By Rachael Bade, Tara Palmeri and Kyle Cheney Micah Weinberg, president of the Bay Area Council Economic Institute, called repealing Obamacare without an adequate program to replace it “an economic disaster waiting to happen.” “Entrepreneurs aren’t just people working in VC-backed startups. There are lots of entrepreneurs across the region, state and nation making, at least in the initial phases, only a few thousand dollars,” Weinberg said. In San Francisco, a 40-year-old making $30,000 a year receiving $3,800 a year in subsidies under the ACA would get $3,000 in assistance in 2020 under the Republican plan, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. In Santa Cruz County, the drop is even more steep — from $5,490 to $3,000, for a 45 percent decline. In Alameda County, which includes Oakland, the 40-year-old would see a 11 percent reduction under the House proposal compared to the current law. Graham Gardner, 33, was able to quit his job last year to work full time building the company he founded a year earlier, Civil Labs, an Oakland enterprise that allows young people to experience entrepreneurship through real and simulated activities. Gardner bought insurance with the help of subsidies through the state’s exchange, Covered California. But he was surprised to discover his income had dropped so low at times he qualified for Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program. Changes to the health law that would replace subsidies with less generous tax credits strikes him as inherently anti-business — and an irony considering President Donald Trump's pro-business stance. “Any barrier to allowing someone to pursue their dream seems like a barrier to greater innovation and business activity in our communities,” Gardner said. Gig workers could be even more at risk. Dana Bigelow left his San Francisco tech job after his mother got sick to care for her full time. He makes money as a “dasher” — working as a driver for the food delivery service DoorDash. “While the flexibility and variety is great, I needed to purchase health insurance and the Affordable Care Act helped me do that,” Bigelow said in an archived posting on the Health and Human Service Department's web site, which was removed after Trump took office.

Still, health care may not be a dealbreaker that ACA backers would like people to think it is. The lack of data on this population makes it difficult to determine how many independent workers have health coverage, and how they get it. Harry Campbell, a part-time Lyft and Uber driver who runs TheRideShareGuy.com, a blog and podcast for on-demand drivers, conducted a survey this year of about 1,150 drivers and found that health coverage wasn’t among the drivers’ top concerns. More than a quarter of drivers — 26.5 percent — said they got health insurance through another job, which supports the theory that many people drive on the side to supplement their income. The second-highest percentage at 16.4 percent said they were covered through a spouse while 15 percent were on Medicare. Just over 10 percent said they bought coverage through the Obamacare exchanges, and 12.7 percent were uninsured. “The thing a lot of drivers value about working for Uber is that flexibility, and it’s that flexibility that allows them to be doing other entrepreneurial activities,” said Campbell, 30, of Los Angeles. “In L.A., there are a lot of actors. It’s a cliche, but it’s true.” But health insurance still was a key concern for Campbell. Having access to coverage allowed him leave his job three years ago as an engineer for Boeing to drive and manage his ride-sharing blog full time. “The one thing I was pretty worried about — it wasn’t a necessarily a deal breaker, but was one of the top concerns — was health insurance,” Campbell said. He and his wife are insured through a policy they bought on the Covered California exchange.
