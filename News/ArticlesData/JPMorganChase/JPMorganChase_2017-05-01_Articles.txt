Activists are targeting corporations they claim support President Trump's agenda with new #BackersOfHate campaign May Day protesters gather in Los Angeles — REUTERS By Shane Dixon Kavanaugh May 01, 2017 at 4:02 PM ET The heads of some of the most renowned companies in the U.S. may soon become targets of an anti-Trump torrent that has already damaged brands and sent politicians ducking for cover. The CEOs and board members of Boeing, Disney, and seven other corporations are now in the crosshairs of progressive groups who say these business giants are complicit in some of the most controversial pieces of President Donald Trump’s agenda. The campaign, launched by Make the Road New York, the Center for Popular Democracy, and more than a dozen other left-leaning organizations around the country, seeks to channel a groundswell of liberal outrage since Trump’s inauguration toward these companies and their top brass. “Some of America’s most well-known companies are cashing in on the exploitation of immigrants and workers,” said Ana Maria Archila, an executive director with the Center for Popular Democracy. “They can’t be allowed to operate under the radar any longer.” Corporate Backers of Hate The name-and-shame campaign also zeroes in on Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, IBM, BlackRock, Uber, and The Blackstone Group. Activists claim that these companies have cultivated ties to the Trump administration and are poised to profit off the president’s signature issues. Boeing, for example, donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration committee and has a seat on the president’s manufacturing initiative. With investments in the private prison industry, companies like JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs stand to make a mint from the White House’s immigration crackdown. The tip of the campaign’s spear is an online platform called “Corporate Backers of Hate,” which organizers unveiled late last week. The website provides details of the alleged ties between Trump and each company and lists the CEO and board members of the businesses by name. The platform then urges visitors to “Give ‘Em Hell” by allowing them to send messages directly to these company bigwigs. Activists are also taking their fight to the streets. Hundreds of demonstrators who participated in the nationwide May Day and “Day Without Immigrants” rallies on Monday showed up outside the headquarters of JPMorgan and a nearby Wells Fargo in Manhattan to highlight the banks’ financing of private Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities. Around a dozen protestors were arrested, according to reports. Neither JPMorgan nor Wells Fargo immediately responded to requests for comment. Organizers behind Corporate Backers of Hate hope to seize on the surging wave of activism on the left that’s formed since Trump’s victory in November. Activists have relentlessly hounded elected officials with phone calls, emails, faxes, and protests, urging them to publicly disavow the president. They have also pressured retail giants like Nordstrom to no longer carry products sold under the brand of Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and forced other companies to pull advertising from Fox News and Breitbart, two media outlets with a decidedly pro-Trump bent. “Whether we like it or not, everything is political now, including business,” Aaron Chatterji, associate professor at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, told Time. “We can leverage the way people interact with campaigns to the way they interact with companies.”

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Interesting December Stock Options for JPM Shutterstock photo Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is JPMorgan Chase & Co (Symbol: JPM). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the December expiration for JPM. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $75 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.61. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.1% return against the $75 commitment, or a 3.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ). Selling a put does not give an investor access to JPM’s upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless JPMorgan Chase & Co sees its shares fall 14.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $73.39 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.61 from $75), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.4% annualized rate of return. Worth considering, is that the annualized 3.4% figure actually exceeds the 2.3% annualized dividend paid by JPMorgan Chase & Co by 1.1%, based on the current share price of $87.39. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 14.12% to reach the $75 strike price. Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of JPMorgan Chase & Co, looking at the dividend history chart for JPM below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.3% annualized dividend yield. Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the December expiration, for shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co (Symbol: JPM) looking to boost their income beyond the stock’s 2.3% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $95 strike and collecting the premium based on the $2.04 bid, annualizes to an additional 3.7% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ), for a total of 6% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $95 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but JPM shares would have to advance 8.8% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 11.1% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called. The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for JPMorgan Chase & Co, highlighting in green where the $75 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $95 strike in red: The chart above, and the stock’s historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for JPMorgan Chase & Co (considering the last 251 trading day JPM historical stock prices using closing values, as well as today’s price of $87.39) to be 20%.

Madina Toure/Observer May Day kicked off in Manhattan with police arresting 12 activists protesting against major corporations the objectors accused of supporting and profiting from President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement agenda, in front of the JP Morgan Chase Tower on Park Avenue. The individuals arrested included four protestors from the immigrant advocacy group Make the Road New York; two from inner-city organizer New York Communities for Change; one from the anti-Trump Action Group Network; one from the public health activist group CTZNWELL; one from the liberal nonprofit Center for Popular Democracy and one from the teachers union-backed Alliance for Quality Education. The cuffs and threat of imminent prolonged processing did not apparently dampen the demonstrators’ spirit. “No hate, no fear! Immigrants are welcome here!” the protesters yelled as they were getting arrested. The protesters were among more than 500 people rallying against JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and other lending institutions they say are profiting from Trump’s immigration agenda, a rally and march organized by Make the Road New York and the Center for Popular Democracy. The action, which kicked off on May Day, is part of the two groups’ newly launched “Corporate Backers of Hate” campaign against nine corporations they say stand to profit from Trump’s agenda, which includes expanding immigration detention, building a wall along the Mexican border and now-blocked executive orders barring entry to people from Muslim-majority countries and withholding funding from so-called “sanctuary cities.” The companies also include Goldman Sachs, Boeing, Disney, IBM, asset manager BlackRock, Uber and the Blackstone Group. The protesters blocked the the JP Morgan Chase entrance holding signs with the slogans “Your Profit, Our Gain #BackersofHate” and “BACKERS OF HATE.” Police took the demonstrators into custody after they refused to move away from the entrance. “Shame on Chase!” all the protesters yelled repeatedly in unison. Twelve activists protesting against JP Morgan Chase backing President Donald Trump’s agenda were arrested this morning. Madina Toure/Observer The groups noted that JPMorgan Chase donated $500,000 to Trump’s inaugural committee and that CEO Jamie Dimon is a member of Trump’s Business Council. They also said that Trump’s companies owe Wells Fargo $14.4 million, and that the bank services another $1.2 million in Trump’s companies’ loans. They added that when Trump first took office, he took down a U.S. Department of Labor website collecting complaints from Wells employees harmed by the bank’s unauthorized account scandal. The other protesters standing in front of JPMorgan Chase chanted in support of those getting arrested, screaming, “Chase, escucha! Estamos en la lucha!,” “No hate, no fear! Immigrants are welcome here!” and “Your profit, our pain!” The rally kicked off in front of the New York Public Library with speeches from advocates, a rabbi and immigrants speaking out against Trump’s policy of arresting and expelling any foreign national accused of any crime. They subsequently marched to the JP Morgan Chase Tower, Wells Fargo and then returned to the library to conclude the march. Protesters marching against corporations backing President Donald Trump’s agenda as part of #BackersofHate campaign. Madina Toure/Observer Along the way, the protesters chanted, “Trump, escucha! Estamos en la lucha!” (“Listen up, Trump! We’re in the struggle!”), “No somos uno, no somos cien, somos milliones, cuéntanos bien!” (“We are not one, we are not hundreds, we are millions, count us well!”), “Luchando! Creando! Poder popular!,” (“Fighting! Creating! Popular power!”), “Sí se puede!” (“Yes, we can!”) and “El pueblo, unido, jamás será vencido!” (“The people, united, will never be defeated!”) Javier Valdés, co-executive director of Make the Road New York, credited New York Communities for Change for leading the fight on the issue for a “very long time.” “We’re so happy to join them…as we take the fight to those greedy corporate folks that are supporting the Trump administration,” Valdés said. “Today, we wanna make very clear that you gotta pick a side. You cannot be marketing to our community, saying that you’re pro-immigrant, saying that you’re for diversity and then supporting the anti-immigrant policies of Donald Trump.” Indeed, Valdés said that “everybody here has to choose a side” today, particularly the corporations that are based in New York City. “The side has to be with us,” he continued. “They gotta get out of the detention business. They gotta get out of deporting families.” Sonia Medrano, a member of New York Communities for Change, reiterated that the United States is a “country of immigrants.” She said that immigrants must remain united in the face of his policies and suggested that he be kicked out of the country first. “He has a personal vendetta against us Hispanics but we are gonna demonstrate to him that when we come together, we are stronger,” Medrano said, through a translation by another member. “Donald Trump, you are the head of this country whether we like it or not but as the head of this country, you are going to have to be the first one to pack your bags and have to go.” SEE ALSO: ‘Women’s March’ Organizer Linda Sarsour Emcees Anti-Trump May Day Rally in Lower Manhattan National Politics Observer Delivered to Your Inbox Sign Up Submit Must Reads Observer Politics Entertainment Lifestyle Arts Health Contact About Newsletters Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP We noticed you're using an ad blocker.

Subscribe on iTunes http://apple.co/2eX6Eay ... Visit the online home of Playbook http://politi.co/2f51Jnf Good Monday morning and happy first day of May. SPOTTED -- Trump National Economic Adviser Gary Cohn and Ways and Means Republicans Sunday at Agua 301 on the Southeast Waterfront. Republicans are in town for a two-day tax reform retreat. Story Continued Below THE WEEK is starting off on a good note for Republicans. Congress reached a budget deal through the end of September, staving off a potentially dramatic couple of weeks and more talk of a shutdown. And, House Republicans look potentially poised to vote on their health care bill before they head out of town Thursday for a one-week recess. While Republicans are projecting confidence, it’s unclear whether they’ve been able to convince enough moderates to back the package. IF, AND IT IS A BIG IF, Congress is able to clear the funding fight and House Republicans pass the health care bill, the Senate could get started on it. And then -- and only then -- Republicans could begin to discuss tax reform. BUT -- It’s always important to remember: in Trump’s Washington, things could be turned upside down quickly. **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh WE’VE GOT A DEAL -- “Budget deal reached in Congress,” by Burgess Everett, John Bresnahan, and Sarah Ferris: “Congressional leaders have reached a government funding agreement through the end of September, according to several congressional aides familiar with the matter. The deal delivers $15 billion in new defense spending to fight terrorism, with $2.5 billion of that contingent on President Donald Trump presenting a strategy to defeat the Islamic State to Congress, the aides said. It also distributes $1.5 billion in new border security spending, though it does not allocate any new money to a Southern border wall with Mexico despite President Donald Trump's insistence.” http://politi.co/2oOsm5A -- THE WINNERS: Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and other Appalachian senators for getting permanent health insurance for coal miners. Former President Barack Obama for the $2 billion in new funds for the NIH and Obama’s cancer moonshot. -- DEMS 1, TRUMP 0: Trump got very little of what he wanted. He got no money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and roughly half the extra military funding he wanted. -- WHAT THIS MEANS: This bill will likely fly through Congress this week, which will ratchet up pressure on Republicans to get an Obamacare repeal through. WHERE THINGS STAND ON HEALTH CARE -- “GOP faces make-or-break moment on Obamacare repeal,” by Rachael Bade, John Bresnahan, and Kyle Cheney: “House Republican leaders and White House officials are increasingly confident about passing their long-stalled Obamacare replacement bill: More lawmakers than ever are committed to voting ‘yes,’ they say, and GOP insiders insist they’re within striking distance of a majority. But the window of opportunity for Speaker Paul Ryan and his leadership team is closing fast. The House is scheduled to leave town for a one-week recess on Thursday, and some senior Republicans worry that failing to get it done by then would fritter away critical momentum. “Skittish Republicans would return home to face a barrage of pressure from Democrats and progressive outside groups. Some senior Republicans and White House officials are advising Ryan (R-Wis.) and his top lieutenants to cancel the recess if needed, and to keep the House in session until they have the votes.” http://politi.co/2oXe3Xr VOX’S TAKE -- “An interview suggests Trump doesn’t know what's in his health bill: Either the president doesn’t understand the proposal — or isn’t telling the truth about it,” by Sarah Kliff: John “Dickerson is the first journalist I have seen grill Trump on what, exactly, is in the Republican plan. He isn’t asking about the politics of the bill and whether it will pass. Rather, he focuses on what are arguably basic questions: what elements are in this bill, and what do you think of them? “Trump stumbles. He says that people with pre-existing conditions will be protected. Under the latest amendment to the American Health Care Act -- the one that got the Freedom Caucus on board -- they won’t be. ... “The health care plan that Trump described on Face the Nation is not the one that the Republican party has offered. His answers suggest an unfamiliarity with basic policy details of a plan that has been public for nearly six weeks at this point -- a plan that his administration has pushed Congress to pass.” http://bit.ly/2p09s7V -- THE NARRATIVE that Trump doesn’t understand the details of the health care bill is taking hold. NYT: “Pushing for Vote on Health Care Bill, Trump Seems Unclear on Its Details” http://nyti.ms/2px2zMc NYT, A1 -- “Trump’s ‘Very Friendly’ Talk With Duterte Stuns Aides and Critics Alike,” by Mark Landler: “When President Trump called President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines on Saturday, White House officials saw it as part of a routine diplomatic outreach to Southeast Asian leaders. Mr. Trump, characteristically, had his own ideas. “During their ‘very friendly conversation,’ the administration said in a late-night statement, Mr. Trump invited Mr. Duterte, an authoritarian leader accused of ordering extrajudicial killings of drug suspects in the Philippines, to visit him at the White House. Now, the administration is bracing for an avalanche of criticism from human rights groups. Two senior officials said they expected the State Department and the National Security Council, both of which were caught off guard by the invitation, to raise objections internally. ... “Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Twitter, ‘We are watching in real time as the American human rights bully pulpit disintegrates into ash.’” http://nyti.ms/2pyUhpt ****** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: What builds the strongest bonds between communities and the businesses they serve? The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, Red Cross CEO Gail McGovern, Shinola President Jacque Panis and other leading thinkers shared their thoughts in the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Responsibility Report. http://politi.co/2qf8XaS ****** RETIREMENT WATCH -- First it was Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah). Now, it’s Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. The Florida Republican, who is the state’s longest serving member of Congress, will step down at the end of the 115th Congress. -- MARC CAPUTO on Ros-Lehtinen’s retirement: “Ros-Lehtinen denied that her retirement had anything to do with her differences with President Donald Trump. She has long opposed Trump’s position on illegal immigration, didn’t support his recent Obamacare repeal effort and disagreed with his administration's policies on transgender rights. Ros-Lehtinen has a transgender child. “In leaving Florida’s newly drawn 27th Congressional District, Ros-Lehtinen almost assured the Democrats will pick up her seat. No Republican-held House district gave Trump a lower share of the vote in 2016 than Ros-Lehtinen’s. Trump got just 39 percent of the vote in the district, while Hillary Clinton got more than 58 percent – more than 5 points better than Barack Obama in 2012, even as Florida shifted into the Republican column in 2016.” http://politi.co/2qkueTH -- OUR SOURCES have been telling us for weeks that there are several GOP House members considering retirement. The reasons for wanting to leave Congress run the gamut from nothing getting done to wanting to cash out to not wanting to have to defend Trump on the campaign trail. PALACE INTRIGUE -- “Trump starts dismantling his shadow Cabinet,” by Michael Grunwald, Andrew Restuccia and Josh Dawsey: “The White House is quietly starting to pull the plug on its shadow Cabinet of Trump loyalists who had been dispatched to federal agencies to serve as the president’s eyes and ears. These White House-installed chaperones have often clashed with the Cabinet secretaries they were assigned to monitor, according to sources across the agencies, with the secretaries expressing frustration that the so-called ‘senior White House advisers’ are mostly young Trump campaign aides with little experience in government. “The tensions have escalated for weeks, prompting a recent meeting among Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, and other administration officials, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. Now, some of the advisers are being reassigned or simply eased out, the sources said, even though many of them had expected to be central players at their agencies for the long haul. The tumult underscores the growing pains that are still being felt throughout Trump’s government, more than 100 days into his term. ‘These guys are being set up for failure,’ said one administration source. ‘They’re not D.C. guys. They’re campaign people. They have no idea how government works.’” http://politi.co/2pwVJq1 DICKERSON AND TRUMP PART II -- DICKERSON: “You said you were disappointed in the Republicans in Congress. Why?” TRUMP: “Well, disappointed. They’re friends of mine, they’re really special people, whether it’s Freedom Caucus or Tuesday or Thursday or let’s go have a drink, that group. They’re great people, I know them all. And I can honestly say, a lot of them, I can honestly say I don’t dislike any of them. I like almost all of them a lot. And you know, we have some [lawmakers] that have never voted positively. But now we’re the governing party. Before it didn’t matter. They could vote no. It wouldn’t matter because President Obama was going veto everything and they didn’t have the Senate. Now we have the Senate, the House, and the White House. But these are great people. And I think you’re going to see the Republican Party really come together.” -- CBS THIS MORNING is broadcasting live from the White House this morning from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. with Charlie Rose, Norah O’Donnell and Gayle King. The show has administration officials starting with Gary Cohn booked with them as well as part two of their interview with Trump. HMM -- “Will Steve Bannon take over Heritage after Jim DeMint leaves? Mike Needham won’t say,” by Washington Examiner’s Philip Wegman: “Asked by Chris Wallace whether Heritage would be Bannon’s ‘safety net as he’s forced out of the White House,’ [Heritage Action CEO Mike] Needham demurred on ‘Fox News Sunday.’ ‘I can tell you,’ Needham replied, ‘there’s a lot of speculation in the room and in the media that never misses a chance to divide and attack conservatives.’” http://washex.am/2quVgnL THE JUICE … -- FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: JAMES RISEN, the Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter, has started working on a new book for Houghton Mifflin about the history of the Church Committee and Sen. Frank Church. After intelligence abuses of the 1970s, the committee was set up to investigate the intelligence community and ways to reform it. Risen, who has previously written four books, told us he’s always been fascinated by the Church Committee, and wants to explore the “watershed” role it played in the history of U.S. intelligence and the “growth of the national security state.” Playbook Reads IN MOSCOW -- “How the Republican right found allies in Russia,” by WaPo’s Ros Helderman and Tom Hamburger: “On issues including gun rights, terrorism and same-sex marriage, many leading advocates on the right who grew frustrated with their country’s leftward tilt under President Barack Obama have forged ties with well-connected Russians and come to see that country’s authoritarian leader, Vladimir Putin, as a potential ally. “The attitude adjustment among many conservative activists helps explain one of the most curious aspects of the 2016 presidential race: a softening among many conservatives of their historically hard-line views of Russia. To the alarm of some in the GOP’s national security establishment, support in the party base for then-candidate Donald Trump did not wane even after he rejected the tough tone of 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, who called Russia America’s No. 1 foe, and repeatedly praised Putin.” http://wapo.st/2p0b41q BUSINESS BURST -- “Apple’s Cash Hoard Set to Top $250 Billion: Tech giant’s unequaled stash draws calls for buybacks, acquisitions as corporate tax shift looms,” by WSJ’s Tripp Mickle: “Apple Inc. is expected to report Tuesday that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled corporate hoard that is greater than the market value of both Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co. and exceeds the combined foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined. “The money, more than 90% of which is stockpiled outside of the U.S., has drawn fresh attention as President Donald Trump has proposed slashing business taxes and a one-time tax holiday on corporate cash brought home. That could ratchet up pressure on the tech giant to make splashy acquisitions or dole out more money to shareholders.” http://on.wsj.com/2p06IYa IS HE, OR ISN’T HE? -- “Biden to Democrats: Rediscover what you are,” by Isaac Dovere in Manchester, New Hampshire: “Yes, Joe Biden said, the Democratic Party is in crisis. And so is America. But it’s not too late. Returning repeatedly here to the combined 172,000-vote margin in the three states that decided last year’s presidential election, the former vice president said Democrats need to face how deep the problem is — not a fluke, not just about Hillary Clinton’s performance, not just about a campaign by Donald Trump that clearly disgusted him. … “He quickly tried to pierce the tension in the air. ‘Guys, I’m not running,’ Biden insisted at the beginning of his speech, acknowledging with a smile on his face the speculation stoked by his appearance in the first-in-the-nation primary state — a declaration met by the crowd leaping to its feet for a brief ‘Run, Joe, Run!’ chant. Biden didn’t mention the conversations he and his staff are having about building a strategy so that he’ll be best positioned to run if he decides to at the end of next year — or his longtime consultant Mike Donilon, who was perhaps most in favor of his running in 2016, who watched the speech from the side of the room.” http://politi.co/2oXgSb0 ****** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: “Our model combines financial commitments with capable partners, evidence-based solutions and direct investments of our people’s time and expertise.” Read “Private Enterprise for Public Good” by Jamie Dimon in the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Responsibility Report. http://politi.co/2oFpSGE ****** DEEP DIVE -- EVAN OSNOS in The New Yorker, “How Trump Could Get Fired: The Constitution offers two main paths for removing a President from office. How feasible are they?”: “Between October and March, the U.S. Office of Government Ethics received more than thirty-nine thousand public inquiries and complaints, an increase of five thousand per cent over the same period at the start of the Obama Administration. Nobody occupies the White House without criticism, but Trump is besieged by doubts of a different order, centering on the overt, specific, and, at times, bipartisan discussion of whether he will be engulfed by any one of myriad problems before he has completed even one term in office—and, if he is, how he might be removed.” http://bit.ly/2pzGU8h THE GLOBAL POLITICO PODCAST -- In a new interview for Susan Glasser’s Global Politico podcast, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt explains why Trump is more unpopular than former President George W. Bush in Europe and the prospects for a new cold war with Russian President Vladimir Putin. http://politi.co/2oXnVjZ … Transcript http://politi.co/2pwWu2q … Listen and subscribe http://apple.co/2kJ9q1U MEDIAWATCH -- “Fox in talks with Blackstone to buy Tribune Media: Joint bid for TV station operator aims to trump rival offer from Sinclair Broadcasting,” by FT’s Matthew Garrahan in Los Angeles: “Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox is in talks with Blackstone, the private equity firm, to launch a joint bid for Tribune Media, according to two people familiar with the negotiations. “Tribune, which owns a portfolio of US television stations, has a market capitalisation of $3.2bn. Fox and Blackstone hope to trump a rival offer from Sinclair Broadcasting, the largest owner of US television stations, and plan to form a joint venture for the deal, with Blackstone providing the cash and Fox injecting its own portfolio of stations. “Fox has 28 owned and operated stations in the US but its broadcast network is carried by dozens of other stations -- some of which are owned by Tribune. Its bid plans are partly defensive: if Sinclair succeeds in buying Tribune it will own these stations and be better placed to drive a harder bargain in carriage negotiations with Fox.

The Atlanta Fed said it also adjusted its final GDPNow model forecast from last week's 0.5 percent based on a decline in the contribution from inventory investment. Most economists on Wall Street have higher forecasts, but JPMorgan Chase cut its first-quarter growth forecast to 0.3 percent Thursday after trimming it to 0.4 percent Wednesday, and Macroeconomic Advisers sliced its tracking forecast to 0.3 percent. The official first-quarter GDP reading will be out Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists mostly expect second-quarter growth to pick up, and many blame first-quarter weakness on a soft patch and weather. Macroeconomic Advisers raised their forecast for the second quarter to 3.7 percent, based on the anticipated impact of inventories investment. "The forecast of first-quarter real consumer spending growth fell from 0.3 percent to 0.1 percent after yesterday's annual retail trade revision by the U.S. Census Bureau. The forecast of the contribution of inventory investment to first-quarter growth declined from -0.76 percentage points to -1.11 percentage points after this morning's advance reports on durable manufacturing and wholesale and retail inventories from the Census Bureau," the Atlanta Fed said. However, the forecast of real equipment investment growth rose to 6.6 percent from 5.5 percent, after the durable manufacturing report Thursday, and the inclusion of data on the sales of light trucks to businesses. Durable goods orders for March rose 0.7 percent, below the 1.2 percent forecast by economists. The JPMorgan economists cut their view from 0.6 percent on Wednesday, after reviewing the same annual revisions to retail sales data, which reflected a softer trend of consumer spending. CNBC/Moody's Analytics Rapid Update, based on a survey of economists, showed average growth forecasts for the first quarter at 0.9 percent Thursday. Economists also saw growth tracking at an average 0.8 percent, based on actual data releases so far. A Census Bureau report Wednesday reduced retail sales growth to 3.7 percent, from 4 percent. But the control retail sales, used to calculate GDP, fell from 4.1 percent to 3 percent, JPMorgan said. That figure excludes food services, auto dealers, gasoline stations and building materials outlets. "We now think that real consumption increased only 0.6 percent saar in 1Q [previously: 0.9 percent]," they wrote. In March, retail sales slipped by a surprise 0.2 percent, the second straight monthly decline.

Then we will be working on interoperability and standards between ledgers. It reminds me of the old discussions of standards. ‘Sure, we got standards. Which one do you want?’” The original blockchain was created to track the movement of bitcoin, a digital currency, without the need to trust a centralized third party. The basic concept – a set of shared data that multiple connected parties agree on as valid – has been enthusiastically embraced by the financial services industry. Many bankers and technologists say it will help them handle things like securities trades, payments and contracts in a faster, simpler, more efficient and cheaper way than they do today. But agreement as to exactly what that distributed ledger should look like does not yet exist. Need to know A diagram of Quorum, the smart contract platform JPMorgan is building. According to the white paper, the design aims to "prevent all except those party to the transaction from seeing sensitive data." Github Several models have attracted adherents: the IBM-led Linux Foundation Hyperledger Project, which is building a blockchain built on the open-source Hyperledger Fabric, has 122 members, including Wells Fargo, BBVA, JPMorgan Chase, the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and American Express. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which is building a blockchain based on the Ethereum protocol, has more than 30 financial services and technology members including JPMorgan Chase and Intel. R3, which is creating a “blockchain-inspired” distributed ledger called Corda, has 84 members, including Barclays, BBVA, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit Suisse, Royal Bank of Scotland, State Street, and UBS. JPMorgan’s departure from R3 follows on the heels of defections last year by Goldman Sachs, Banco Santander, Morgan Stanley and National Australian Bank. The banks’ reasons for leaving varied. While still a member of the Hyperledger and Ethereum consortia, JPMorgan is also going it alone with a distributed ledger it’s building in-house called Quorum. Quorum is based on the Go Ethereum client, a software program that supports the Ethereum network. In a white paper, the bank outlines how its blockchain will handle data and contract privacy and consensus mechanisms (the process by which different computers agree on the order and legitimacy of transactions on the network). The bank’s decision to use Ethereum was at odds with R3’s decision not to use that system. “Ethereum was a platform we looked at and decided was not fit for purpose,” said Charley Cooper, managing director of R3. Objections among the membership included issues around privacy controls, scalability, immutability of transactions, and consensus mechanisms for validating transactions, Cooper said. R3 originally hoped to use an existing blockchain model like Ethereum, he explained. “When we first launched the company, we were in an ‘adapt or build’ mentality,” Cooper said. “Our thinking was, it would be easier if there was solution fit for purpose, if something out there was close we could adapt it to our needs, but meanwhile we’re going to build something in parallel, a platform fit for purpose for financial services. Ethereum was not deemed by R3’s experts and our members to be appropriate for the financial services industry.” By press time, JPMorgan had not responded to a request for an interview. Other banks have left R3 because they balked at the money it wanted them to pay to help fund the development of Corda, industry sources said. Last May, the group reportedly sought to raise $200 million from members (it later was said to cut the target to $150 million). “That was not the direction expected when these firms were already paying substantial amounts just to be a member of the consortia,” Skinner said. (Dues are in the six figures, according to market sources and published reports.) “It was this, in my view, that caused some of the founders to question where R3 were going.” Yet R3 is still in a strong position, he noted, with many banks still involved in Corda.

Continue Reading Below "The real issue I'm worried about is bad public policy," Dimon said, speaking at the annual Milken Institute Global Conference. "We're leaving a lot of people behind." As a member of the White House's new Strategic and Policy Forum, Dimon is part of the group of business leaders tasked with finding a way to create more jobs in the United States. Dimon joined the task force despite not supporting President Donald Trump in his campaign - a move he attributed to the need to support "the pilot" flying the airplane. Dimon stressed that technology advancements are not the enemy of job creation. "You'd be living in tents, hunting buffalo, and dying at 35," were it not for developments in tech, he said. "Mankind will adjust and find other things to do as robots take their place. If it (technological developments) goes too fast, then we can create policies that make up for it." Dimon, who has led the bank as CEO since December 2005, shrugged off any aspirations for running for office, when asked on stage. He said it was too late for him to live as a civil servant and that he does not want to be a mayor, a senator or governor. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT "You've got to start early. President Obama wrote two books about himself before he did anything," Dimon said - a line that prompted laughter and applause from the hundreds of business leaders, financiers and government officials packed into the Beverly Hills Hilton ballroom. Dimon said the government needs to spend more money on programs that provide education and work opportunities for people, particularly those in poor, economically depressed urban neighborhoods. "I think there are legitimate complaints about what we didn't do to help the problems of these folks," Dimon said. "It's a terrible thing - those inner city kids who may be a Colin Powell, a Barack Obama, Albert Einstein, and we'll never know because we didn't give them the opportunity that most of us had."   (Reporting by Michael Flaherty; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Lisa Shumaker) Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

The company agreed to purchase 4.34 million stock units already beneficially owned by Kraus at $22.90 each, according to a regulatory filing Monday. During his tenure at the company, Kraus received most of his pay in units. They were awarded under his employment contract. Kraus’ departure -- and the removal of nine directors -- left analysts puzzled and fueled speculation on several fronts: that majority owner Axa SA wanted more direct control, that there was friction between the CEO and Axa, or that a major strategy shift was on the way. A conference call led by Axa Chairman Denis Duverne provided few details. “Management’s conference call produced more questions than answers,” Jefferies analyst Surinder Thind wrote in a note on Monday. The changes “would lead one to believe AB will be undertaking a change in strategy. Otherwise, the change does not appear to be justified.” Kraus didn’t return a call for comment. Spokesmen at Axa and AllianceBernstein declined to comment beyond the press release on the changes. Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up Axa took action after AllianceBernstein, known for its actively managed funds, suffered $9.8 billion in net outflows in fiscal 2016. But that wasn’t cited by analysts who issued notes after the news broke on Monday and, in fact, several praised Kraus for stabilizing and diversifying the firm, which has almost $500 billion in assets. Kraus became CEO in December 2008 and in his first few years watched as investors pulled billions from the firm. Assets peaked at more than $800 billion in 2007. Kraus eventually stemmed the bleeding. Pressed by analysts to explain the sudden changes, Duverne was terse. "We decided it was time to put new leadership in place,” he said on the call. “We are not here to challenge what has been done in the past. We are here to discuss the future.” A Problem? JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Seth Bernstein will take over as CEO and Robert Zoellick, a former World Bank president and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive, as chairman, according to a company statement. Kraus had held both positions. Bernstein, 55, spent more than three decades at JPMorgan, most recently as managing director and global head of managed solutions and strategy at the bank’s asset-management arm, according to the statement. He isn’t related to Sanford Bernstein, the founder of a predecessor to AllianceBernstein. “You have to wonder if there was a specific problem or if they just thought he was the wrong guy for a changing industry,” said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston where he helps oversee $2.5 billion. AllianceBernstein added three new independent directors. Joining are Barbara Fallon-Walsh, previously an executive at Vanguard Group; Daniel Kaye, who retired from Ernst & Young; and Ramon de Oliveira, a former JPMorgan executive. The panel will also include Duverne, Anders Malmstrom and Mark Pearson, all from Axa. “We note that all of the board members announced have strong ties with AXA Financial, which we believe suggests AXA might be trying to exert more influence on AB,” a team of analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods wrote Monday in a research note. AXA owned a 63.8 percent economic interest in AllianceBernstein as of March 31. AllianceBernstein fell 3.3 percent in New York trading on Monday. Including reinvested dividends, the stock has lost 2.1 percent this year through April 28. Over the past five years, it has gained 138 percent on that basis, compared with 86 percent for the S&P index of asset managers and custody banks. In an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Erik Schatzker last June, Kraus said active investment managers need to shrink assets by as much as a third if they want to beat industry benchmarks. “It is pretty clear that active managers have not performed above their benchmarks to any great degree,” he said. Read more on how active managers are battling index funds In the first quarter of 2017, the firm attracted $1.6 billion in new cash, AllianceBernstein said in an earnings release April 27. “In an industry that is confronting significant shifts, we need to continue transforming the business to improve the quality of our investment solutions while delivering our services more effectively,” Duverne said in a statement Monday. “We are confident that with Bob and Seth we have the right leadership team in place.” The first sale of Kraus’ stock units will occur on Sept. 1 and include units he owned as of April 28, the company said in the filing. The transaction doesn’t include restricted units, which will be paid in the future. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The specific targets of this action, according to organizers from Make The Road New York, are the Wall Street banks that help finance private prisons and immigrant detention centers. To that end, organizers said twelve protesters were arrested for peaceful civil disobedience while blocking the entrances outside of JPMorgan Chase, which is one of the companies named in Make The Road's and the Center for Popular Democracy's Backers Of Hate campaign. "I think people feel it's a moment of moral crisis for our country and these companies are complicit and that there is an urgency to take action that includes disruption," Daniel Altschuler, the director of civic engagement and research at Make The Road, told Gothamist. While many in the largely immigrant crowd were careful not to risk a potential run-in with ICE by getting arrested, they still participated in the protest. Myriam Fernandez, from Brooklyn, said she was compelled to bring her two nieces, ages 13 and 15, to see the demonstration. "It is very important to be here because we have to raise our voices—to raise a voice for our family," Fernandez said. "They're here but they don't know what's happening to our families right now." Trump, escucha! Estamos en la lucha! -- #mayday labor demonstrations in Bryant park are fired up! pic.twitter.com/uoHRDWXQlD— Scott Heins (@scottheins) May 1, 2017 Prior to the march, a couple hundred demonstrators rallied at Bryant Park, chanting and beating drums as speakers shared personal stories from the steps of the New York Public Library. One especially rousing speech came courtesy of Jonathan Cortez Padilla, an immigrant who fled Honduras last year after facing persecution for being gay. Speaking in Spanish with the help of an English translator, Padilla described his time in an Arizona detention center owned by private prison giant CoreCivic (formerly the Corrections Corporation of America), which relies on debt financing from banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. Padilla related the experience of being tossed in a freezing cell with no mattress or blanket, and how he was later made to scrub floors for days on end just to afford the $1.50 charge to call his mother in New York. In the six weeks he spent in detention, Padilla says he lost 11 pounds.

"Many persons detained in these ice boxes are asylum seekers fleeing life threatening abuse and violence. Today, we take our fight to JPMorgan Chase, one of the many financiers of CoreCivic and other immigrant detention companies." Following the speeches, protesters marched to the JPMorgan's Park Avenue office, where they stood at the entrance to the bank's headquarters behind a large banner reading: "Their profits, our pain." After blocking the entrance to the building, 12 of those protesters were arrested, according to Altschuler. Roughly a dozen arrested for blocking entrance to @jpmorgan HQ #MayDay2017 protest against "corp. legitimizing @POTUS " @MaketheRoadNY pic.twitter.com/uDfMXMopCx— Michael Herzenberg (@MHerzenberg) May 1, 2017 A spokesman for the NYPD could not confirm the arrests or offer any information about the charges. From JPMorgan Chase, protesters then moved on to the offices of Wells Fargo, at Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street. No arrests were made at this location, according to Altschuler. Following the march, several of those arrested released statements highlighting the success of the action. "Immigrants and people of integrity will not stand idly by as major American corporations position themselves to profit from an administration that attacks immigrants and working people," said Deborah Axt, co-executive director of Make The Road New York and one of the twelve people detained outside of JPMorgan Chase. "To those companies who choose to stand on the wrong side of history—especially those seeking to profit from Trump's anti-immigrant crusade—we say: you are on notice, and our communities will hold you accountable."

May 1, 2017 4:49 AM   Subscribe Is it possible to close out a credit card and then open a new card of the same type to take advantage of an intro interest free period? I have a Chase Sapphire card and a Chase Freedom card. I use the Freedom card for my routine and recurring expenses and transfer the points to the Sapphire card for travel. Here’s my conundrum: I am taking a sabbatical from work, and would like the peace of mind knowing I can take advantage of a 0% API for 12-15 months with a new card during that time. I would, however, like to stick with Chase so I can eventually move the points to Sapphire when I pay the card and have an income again. I would like to close the current Freedom card and open a new Freedom card account to take advantage of the 0% intro offer. Is this possible? posted by hobodeluxe to Work & Money (9 answers total)   No, you can't cancel a card and then become immediately eligible for credit card promotions. You may have to wait up to a year. posted by Geckwoistmeinauto at 5:01 AM on May 1 [1 favorite] No, all those intro deals usually specify NEW customers. posted by catatethebird at 5:03 AM on May 1 [1 favorite] No: "Chase cardmembers who currently have or have had a Chase credit card in any Rewards Program associated with this offer, may not be eligible for a second Chase credit card in the same Rewards Program." posted by NotMyselfRightNow at 5:04 AM on May 1 [3 favorites] However, it wouldn't hurt to call up Chase and tell them you're planning to cancel the card so you can get another card (from somewhere other than Chase) with a 0% introductory offer. Their customer retention people may be willing to make an exception or accommodate you in some other way, in order to keep you with Chase. It might be worth a try. posted by DrGail at 6:13 AM on May 1 [10 favorites] You may have to wait up to a year. Three years (or more) in some cases. posted by Candleman at 6:20 AM on May 1 You're not going to have an income for a year? That will make it tricky to qualify for any new card. posted by spitbull at 6:53 AM on May 1 [1 favorite] If you're interested in abusing credit card sign up programs like this, the churning subreddit is a good resource. posted by empath at 7:26 AM on May 1 If you have good credit just open up a new 0% interest card with citibank or CapitalOne or something and don't use it - keep using your Freedom instead. posted by mskyle at 8:11 AM on May 1 In my experience, Chase will approve you for at least three separate cards, no need to close the old one and lose the benefit of the available credit and account age. If you are already have the maximum credit available they are willing to extend their initial response may be a denial, however. You'd then need to call them and have them reallocate some of your credit line from other products to the new card to get it issued, but it isn't a big deal. Generally speaking, if you receive an offer in the mail and it doesn't have fine print about the intro offer not applying if you already have an account with them, they have to give it to you.

Our investments are targeted in 15 to 20 key markets that we believe have superior healthcare demographics that support strong, long-term demand for medical office space. We have achieved, and continue to achieve, critical mass within these key markets by expanding our presence through accretive acquisitions, and utilizing our in-house operating expertise through our regionally located property management and leasing platform. Founded in 2006 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2012, HTA has produced attractive returns for its stockholders that we believe have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 and US REIT indices. Forward-Looking Language This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of HTA, the Acquisitions as described in this press release and the financial performance and business of HTA after completion of the Acquisitions. These forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as "expects," "plans," "estimates," "anticipates," "projects," "intends," "believes," outlook," and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters, are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions which may not be realized and involve risks and uncertainties, many of which cannot be predicted with accuracy and some of which might not even be anticipated, that could cause actual outcomes and results, financial and otherwise, to differ materially, including statements related to the closing of the Acquisitions. Risks and other factors related to HTA that might cause such differences include, among others, the following: we may abandon development or redevelopment opportunities for which we have already incurred costs; adverse capital market conditions may affect our access to various sources of capital and/or cost of capital, which may affect our business activities, earnings and common stock price, among other things; we may not be able to effectively deploy the net proceeds of offerings of securities; changes in economic conditions affecting the healthcare property sector, the commercial real estate market and the credit market may affect our performance and financial condition; competition for acquisition of medical office buildings and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry could increase; economic fluctuations in certain states in which our property investments are geographically concentrated could affect our results of operations; and we may not be able to retain our senior management team. Any forward-looking statements or forecasts relating to the business, prospects, operating statistics or financial results relating to the Acquisitions are based on assumptions and are inherently speculative, are subject to substantial uncertainty, and the actual operating statistics and financial results may differ materially from HTA's forecasts. Risks and other factors related to the Acquisitions that might cause such differences include, among other things, the following: we may not be able to consummate the Acquisitions on time or on the terms currently expected or at all; we may not be able to effectively integrate the assets acquired in the Acquisitions into our portfolio and/or we may fail to achieve expected efficiencies and synergies; our assumptions concerning the availability and/or terms of financing related to the Acquisitions may not be realized; we may encounter liabilities for which we are responsible that were unknown at the time we agreed to the Acquisitions; and our assumptions concerning risks relating to our lack of control of joint ventures may prove incorrect. In addition, HTA's forecasts are subject to a variety of additional factors and risks, including the risks set forth under "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in HTA's Form 10-K, and in HTA's other periodic and Form 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) May 1, 2017 at 8:40PM On the campaign trail, President Trump called for breaking up the nation's biggest banks. This resonated with his constituents, but it wasn't until this week that he reiterated his interest as the sitting president of the United States in potentially doing so. "I'm looking at that right now," Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg News. "There's some people that want to go back to the old system, right? So we're going to look at that." Image source: Getty Images. He's referring to universal banks, those with both investment and commercial banking operations. This was a core concept of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, passed in the midst of the Great Depression. But it was repealed in the deregulatory fervor of the 1990s. Trump's principal economic advisor, Gary Cohn, had previously made a similar suggestion. He told members of the Senate Banking Committee in April that he could support a policy separating the two businesses. The banks that would be hardest hit by a reinstated Glass-Steagall are JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C), all of which have sizable commercial and investment banking operations. Although the market reacted on Monday to President Trump's remarks, causing bank stocks to drop suddenly, these three stocks quickly recovered and ended the day higher. Bank of America was up 1.16% JPMorgan Chase was up 0.07% Citigroup was up 0.58% Investors seemed to conclude that the chances of a new Glass-Steagall are slim to none. It's worth keeping in mind that Trump made the remarks at a gathering of community bankers, who have traditionally been at odds with the likes of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup. In order for major U.S.-based banks to stay competitive on a global basis -- something Trump has repeatedly discussed in the context of regulatory and tax relief -- they need the full array of financial products that large multinational corporations use to raise capital and manage risk around the world. Take away some of these product lines, and universal banks in China, Europe, and Japan will be left with an advantage. Moreover, despite assertions to the contrary, there's no evidence to suggest that breaking them up would unlock value and thereby be beneficial to shareholders. There are theoretical arguments that it would, but that's a long way from tangible evidence stemming from actual experience. The point is that while breaking up the banks plays well on the campaign trail and resonates with certain audiences, it doesn't make sense from either an "America First" perspective or from a business perspective to reinstate Glass-Steagall's prohibition of universal banks. It thus seems unlikely that Trump will actually move to break up banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup -- which explains why their stocks ended the day unfazed by his statement about possibly doing so.

Though May Day was originally a celebration of spring -- replete with flowers and dancing -- it has, since the late 19th century, become known for labor rallies. It shares a date with International Workers' Day and from Seattle, Washington, to Jakarta, Indonesia, the line between revelry and protest has been blurred in recent years as some observances have been marred by violent clashes between riot police and protesters. Here is a look at how people around the globe are honoring May Day: Istanbul Video shows police firing rubber bullets and detaining protesters in Turkey's largest city as demonstrations became violent. At least 165 people have been detained during protests, according to the city's police headquarters. There was a heavy police presence in the major squares across the city. After authorities canceled celebrations in Taksim Square, a traditional rallying point, thousands of protesters gathered in the city's Bakirkoy district. In addition to supporting workers' rights, marchers gathered to support democratic rights, human rights, freedom of expression and rule of law -- rights which are seen to be shrinking in Turkey. Portland, Oregon Police canceled the permit for the demonstration after "anarchists" began throwing projectiles and incendiary devices, and causing unsafe conditions for protesters, the police Twitter account said. Incendiary devices thrown at police "included fireworks, smoke bombs and Molotov cocktails," the department tweeted. New York A small crowd of protesters that organized at Grand Central Station in New York marched west near Bryant Park. They carried signs with slogans, some reading, "Every species has a right to freedom" and "We're here, we're queer, we're fabulous." The group then marched Macy's Herald Square and began chanting within the department store. In a separate protest, a dozen people were arrested outside the Park Avenue office of JPMorgan Chase & Co. for civil disobedience, said New York Police Department Sgt Lee Jones. The protest, dubbed "Corporate Backers of Hate," targets companies who have cultivated ties to President Donald Trump's administration and stand to profit off his policies, said Daniel Altschuler of Make the Road New York, which helped organize the protest. At least four members of the group, which focuses on workers' rights, were among those arrested. Paris Just days before a French presidential election that pits far-right leader Marine Le Pen against pro-Europe centrist Emmanuel Macron in a runoff, the traditional May Day workers' march took place in Paris alongside an anti-Le Pen protest. Skirmishes broke out, and it didn't take long before police fired tear gas at protesters. Reports are emerging that police officers have been injured. Brazilian tourist Joseane Duque says she and a friend witnessed a police officer hit a man, and she saw tear gas and heard a loud bang. Artist Mehmet Ali Uysal, who participated in the demonstrations, said they were mostly peaceful, though he saw some violence, including two motorcycles that were set ablaze. Havana A large crowd gathered in the Cuban capital's Revolution Square, at the base of the memorial honoring writer and poet Jose Marti. A protester with a US flag briefly interrupted the day's celebration and was dragged off by government security officers. Moscow Hundreds of thousands showed up in the Russian capital to celebrate International Workers' Day, according to state-run media. In Red Square, people waved Soviet and Russian flags, as well as banners supporting President Vladimir Putin's United Russia party. "Decent work, wages, and life" is a common theme at the gatherings. People also took to the streets in Yakutsk, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Kazan, Novosibirsk and Salekhard, as well as in Siberia and the Urals and Volga regions, state-run media reported. St. Petersburg, Russia Demonstrators focused their ire not on any labor issue but on a January decision to return a cathedral, one of the city's most famous landmarks, to the Russian Orthodox Church, according to Radio Free Europe. Protesters say the church is gaining too much influence and want the cathedral to remain a museum. Also, according to an Instagram user, anarchists and members of the Russian Socialist Movement marched, chanting, "Our movement is resistance." Tbilisi, Georgia A gathering of trade union and student organizations converged outside Georgia's parliament building with a group of women's right activists demanding better working conditions and an end to discrimination, Radio Free Europe reported. Pristina, Kosovo The Union of Independent Trade Unions gathered, demanding the government provide better conditions for private-sector workers, which they said can be regarded as slaves at some workplaces, according to Radio Free Europe.

Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up For the first time since July, hedge funds and other large speculators are bullish on Treasuries across the yield curve, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. The shift in 10-year futures was particularly striking, with the group adding an unprecedented 255,942 net-long contracts as of the latest figures, covering the week through April 25. Their bias is so skewed toward gains that the group is the most vulnerable to a bond-market selloff since 2008. Their change of heart came at a risky time. While almost no one expects the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates Wednesday, traders are betting that officials will reiterate a plan to hike twice more this year and potentially deliver further signals on their intention to trim the central bank’s balance sheet. What’s more, the same day, the Treasury is set to release documents as part of its quarterly refunding announcement that could shine light on the prospect of ultra-long debt issuance, which has already sent 30-year securities tumbling. “I’m not sure why people are getting long the long-end of the market, especially in the face of the Fed, who’s talking about reducing the balance sheet,” said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasury trading in New York at Bank of Nova Scotia. “There’s a lot of risk” to being bullish on shorter-dated debt as well, he said. Investors like hedge funds are usually contrarian indicators, with the market more often than not moving against them in the following month, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jay Barry. He expressed skepticism about speculators’ short positioning in late January. Those positions were subsequently squeezed out after yields fell to 2017 lows last month. To be fair, hedge funds aren’t suddenly all-in on a bond rally, and their long positions aren’t nearly as large as their bearish wager to start 2017. The Treasury market is “relatively clean and balanced” after the latest shakeout, said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets. Still, “the pain trade would now be toward higher yields in the 10-year sector,” Lyngen said. Speculators are vulnerable since they turned long when “the market was at its lowest yield of the year.” The benchmark 10-year yield has rebounded from its 2017 low of 2.16 percent on April 18. It ended Monday at about 2.32 percent, climbing after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said ultra-long bond issuance could “absolutely” make sense. On Wednesday, traders will look for detail on ultra-long debt sales in Treasury’s May refunding. In its questionnaire released before the meeting, the department asked the primary dealers what it should consider when structuring a bond with a maturity longer than three decades. They’ll also be scrutinizing the Fed’s economic outlook, after U.S. growth last quarter came in weaker than expected. The Citigroup Inc. U.S. Economic Surprise Index, which measures whether data beat forecasts, fell to its lowest level since October this week. Bullish Fodder That degree of disappointment might support bullish bond positions. Yet most strategists expect central bankers will look past the recent data misses, given that the unemployment rate is near the lowest in a decade and market-based measures of inflation expectations are close to policy makers’ 2 percent goal. For the June meeting, using the current effective fed funds rate and the forward OIS rate, the odds of a hike are about 60 percent, compared with 34 percent about two weeks ago. And while the Trump administration’s fiscal plans stalled during his first 100 days, supporting Treasuries, the initiatives could make a comeback. Republicans are determining whether they have the votes to pass an amended version of their health-care bill through the House, after leaders scrapped a planned floor vote in March. “Given the likelihood that the economy rebounds in the second quarter, plus new risks coming out of Washington, it is a little dangerous to take an aggressive stance in the bond market,” said Gary Pollack, head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank AG’s Private Wealth Management unit in New York.

After yet another powerful set of results, and yet another surge in the company's share price, Bezos is a mere $US5 billion away from the Microsoft founder Bill Gates and likely to overtake him very soon. True, on one level, the "world's richest man" is just a statistical footnote, of no great significance. On another, however, the title sets a role model that entrepreneurs and business leaders around the world aspire to.

More videos Amazon by the numbers Get to know the online retail giant before it sets up shop on Australian shores. After all, if making more money than anyone else doesn't tell you they are doing something right, it is hard to know what might. So what lessons can we learn from Bezos's rise to the top of the pile? That you should think big, innovate furiously, ignore failures, forget about obsessing over profits, and avoid major acquisitions. Those are pretty good guidelines for any business heading into the 2020s. The rising value of Bezos's net worth has been almost as relentless as the hard sell of Amazon Prime memberships over the past few years. His stake in the web giant he founded slightly over two decades ago is now worth US$81 billion. In the past five years, Amazon's share price has more than quadrupled, rising from US$220 to more than $900 as the company powers into new industries and markets. He has already overtaken Warren Buffett and Amancio Ortega, the Spanish founder of Zara owner Inditex, to become the world's second richest. It will only take a few more dollars on the share price for him to race past Gates – and given the relatively stagnant performance of his Seattle neighbour, that seems just about inevitable. Related Content $4.4b in five minutes: Bezos cashes in on Amazon share surge Tech billionaires rock global rich list Although there were times when he was briefly overtaken by Buffett, and also for a few weeks by Ortega, Gates has hung onto that title for a long time. He became the world's richest man all the way back in 1995, when it took a mere US$12.9 billion to take that slot. In the past, the title has been held by tycoons such as John D Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, or indeed, if you want to go back far enough, by Musa I of Mali, the 14th-century African king, who many historians now reckon was the richest person of all time, with a net worth of $400 billion in today's money. After 22 years, however, the baton appears about to pass onto a new man. So what are the lessons that every business – and investor for that matter – can learn from Bezos? Here are five of the most important. One, think big. Amazon was started in 1994 as an online books retailer. But books were only chosen because Bezos could see they were a relatively easy way into online retailing. They come in standard sizes, you don't need to try them on, they fit easily into parcels, and there was plenty of space to compete on choice and price. But its ambitions always went way beyond that. As it moved into CDs, DVDs, and then just about everything, it became clear that Bezos wanted Amazon to be the biggest retailer in the world. He was thinking big right from the beginning – and working out the best starting place to get to his ultimate destination. Advertisement Secondly, keep innovating. Amazon is now far more than just an online retailer. It has built a massive cloud computing business that serves some of the biggest web companies in the world. It is making films and TV series for its Prime streaming service. It has developed publishing, physical shops, grocery sales, own-label products, and drone delivery systems. It is rare that more than a few weeks go by without Amazon trialling something or other – right now it is making a huge push with its Alexa voice-activated assistant. Whatever it does, it invariably brings something new to it – for example, shops with no check-out staff. Most companies come up with one or two good ideas  Google's parent Alphabet has created both the search engine and the Android operating system – but Amazon comes up with dozens of them. That is hard to emulate – but it is an incredibly powerful model if you can get it right. Thirdly, don't fret about failure. As you might expect for a company that is always trying out new stuff, Amazon also has plenty of flops. Its smart phone was a complete turkey – it cost US$170 million in investment, but has made no progress so far. Its web payment service went nowhere, and so did Amazon Destinations, its travel unit. Askville, its questions and answers service, was shut down after several years of investment, and Amazon Local was no match for competitors such as Groupon. But so what? Bezos accepts that if you don't try out lots of stuff, you won't ever have more than one or two businesses. He just moves on to the next one.

Amazon appears to hardly care whether it makes any money. It is interested in moving into new markets, and dominating the ones where it has already established itself. Profits will take care of themselves. It is not quite as relentlessly unprofitable as it used to be – it has actually made money for eight quarters in a row now – but its overall margins are wafer-thin given its vast size. Investment in expansion is far more useful than racking up cash in the bank, like Apple, or returning it to shareholders through dividends or stock buy-backs, like just about every other major company. Investors love it – and are rewarded via the share price. Finally, forget acquisitions. It would be wrong to say that Amazon doesn't buy companies. It paid US$1.2 billion for the online shoe shop Zappos in 2009 and $900 million for the video gaming streaming site Twitch in 2014. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Bezos chose books because he could see they were a relatively easy way into online retailing.  Photo: Bloomberg There have been a steady stream of agreed takeovers. But they are all small scale stuff given the size of the company. It is clearly determined to take on Netflix in content, but it is spending massive sums on its own programmes rather than bidding for its rival. Likewise, it's trying to compete with Spotify in music, and Sainsbury's and Tesco in groceries, rather than taking them out in a bid. Most acquisitions destroy value. It is far better to build your own rival from the ground up. Amazon is far from perfect. It can ride roughshod over the competition, and it can be difficult place to work. But with its relentless drive to innovate and create new products, there could be many worse role models for entrepreneurs and business leaders. In his annual letter to shareholders last month, Bezos urged people to "experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when you see customer delight." That formula won't work for everyone. But it is about to make Bezos the richest man in the world – and any business could do a lot worse than follow that formula.

 Global asset management giant abruptly removes CEO, overhauls board Ross Kerber and Tim McLaughlin, Reuters May 1, 2017, 10:09 PM 2,998 facebook linkedin twitter email print Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Jordan Belfort in the 2013 film "The Wolf of Wall Street." "The Wolf of Wall Street"/Paramount Pictures BOSTON, May 1 (Reuters) - The French parent of asset manager AllianceBernstein fired its longtime leader Peter Kraus, replacing him with a new chief executive and and new chairman, and overhauled the firm's board, according to a filing Monday that offered little explanation for the unexpected changes. New York-based AllianceBernstein, which is 64 percent owned by France's AXA SA, named JPMorgan Asset Management executive Seth Bernstein as its new CEO and Robert Zoellick, previously president of the World Bank and a former Goldman Sachs executive, as chairman. Kraus, who held the CEO and chairman titles since 2008, was "terminated" from his job as CEO, according to a securities filing. AllianceBernstein, with $497.9 billion in assets under management at the end of March, gave no hint of changes in the works when it reported earnings on Thursday. The filing also said that on Friday an AXA unit removed nine directors from the AllianceBernsteinboard, including Kraus, and the next day named replacements to fill most of the seats on the board which now has eight members. A spokesman declined to comment on the reason for the changes. Representatives at AXA's Paris headquarters were not available to comment on the moves, which came eight months after Thomas Buberl took over as CEO of the giant French insurer. AllianceBernstein shares fell 3.28 percent to $22.15. Kraus, himself a Goldman Sachs veteran, took over as CEO and chairman in 2008, just as the financial crisis gripped Wall Street. He helped shepherd AllianceBernstein in the difficult years that followed, but it has not fully recovered. AllianceBernstein's assets of $497.9 billion are well below the $800.4 billion it managed at the end of 2007. It is now dwarfed by companies with stronger lineups of passive investment products such as BlackRock Inc, which ran $5.4 trillion at the end of March. On a conference call on Monday morning, AXA Board Chairman Denis Duverne thanked Kraus for his service as CEO. "After eight years, we decided it was time to put in new leadership," Duverne said during the call. Analysts pushed for more detail on the abrupt changes at the top, but Duverne declined to say what, if anything, was lacking during Kraus' watch. Wolf of Wall Street / Paramount In a note to investors Jefferies analysts wrote the shake-up "produces more questions than answers" and that the new management structure may signal a closer alignment between AllianceBernstein and AXA, where six board members now have ties. AXA executives cited a changed industry since Kraus came in, the Jefferies analysts wrote, implying that "AXA disagreed with the strategy being pursued by the previous management team and did not want to wait until the end of Peter's contract to make changes as industry headwinds are only accelerating." Citigroup William Katz wrote however the change may not reflect strategic or financial issues because management had little other news, and that "potentially personal conflict drove the sudden change." Kraus had given no indication of changes ahead. On a conference call after the company's earnings last week, he said: "We've focused for years on rebuilding our presence and regaining relevance with retail clients and are finally where we need to be." Kraus has entered into a "cooperation agreement" with AllianceBernstein, under which he is entitled to termination benefits and salary, according to the filing. According to the filing AXA has agreed to buy from Kraus stock units worth $99.3 million. He may also receive restricted units in the future, the filing states.

REUTERS/ Kyle Grillot By Chris Francescani and Alex Dobuzinskis, Reuters May 1, 2017 at 7:40 pm | Print View NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES — Labor unions and civil rights groups staged May Day rallies across the United States on Monday, challenging President Donald Trump’s immigration policies and his vow to step up deportations of those who entered the country illegally. Activists said they were seeking to amass the largest crowds to have yet turned out for U.S. immigrant rights demonstrations since Trump took office on Jan. 20. Thousands gathered at MacArthur Park near downtown Los Angeles for what organizers called a show of “resistance, unity and defiance,” then set off on a boisterous but peaceful march across town to City Hall. A crowd of several thousand also assembled in Washington’s Dupont Circle for a rally ahead of a planned procession to Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House. Earlier in the day, 500 protesters marched through midtown Manhattan and rallied in front of offices of Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Twelve were arrested, according to a spokesman for Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group that claims 20,000 members. The two banks were targeted because of their dealings with private companies that have built or manage some immigrant detention centers for the government, according to Jose Lopez, Make the Road New York’s co-director of organizing. “The messaging for today was to stop financing immigrant detention facilities,” Lopez said. May Day, also known as International Workers’ Day, has typically been a quieter affair in the United States than in Europe, where it is a public holiday in many countries. May Day unrest flared on Monday in France and Turkey, where demonstrators clashed with police. The U.S. protests focused on Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration as he presses police agencies around the country to assist federal efforts at rounding up individuals sought for deportation and threatens to withhold federal dollars for cities that do not cooperate, which have been dubbed “sanctuary cities.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions also stirred an outcry by saying last month that so-called “dreamers” - illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children and were granted protection under the Obama administration - were subject to deportation. Sessions later walked back his statement, and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly has said dreamers were not being targeted, though some have ended up detained in roundups of immigrants with criminal backgrounds. Retired social worker Christina Reilly Vaccarino, 78, who emigrated from Ireland at age 15 with a green card allowing her to work as a nanny, said she was “disgusted” by Trump’s policies on immigration, taxes and workers’ rights. “I came to America at a time when everyone in Ireland believed that America is so wonderful, so great. And now, after all these years, to experience this? It’s not America anymore,” she said at an afternoon rally in Lower Manhattan. New York City’s biggest rally was planned for the early evening, when organizers expected thousands to gather in downtown Manhattan’s Foley Square for musical performances and speeches by union leaders and immigrants living in the country illegally. Precautions were in place in Seattle, where officials were on the lookout for incendiary devices and gun-carrying protesters after a January shooting outside a political event and an incident during May Day 2016 in which a protester tossed an unlit Molotov cocktail at police. Some Trump supporters said they would also turn out on May Day. Activist Joey Gibson said he and other conservatives would travel to Seattle to defend against what he described as communist and anti-fascist groups who have in the past faced off with police in the evening, after the conclusion of the usually peaceful daytime marches.

So we’re going to look at that.” Trump also said he’s open to increasing the US gas tax to fund infrastructure development, in a further sign that policies unpopular with the Republican establishment are under consideration in the White House. He described higher gas taxes as acceptable to truckers—“I have one friend who’s a big trucker,” he said—as long as the proceeds are dedicated to improving US highways. Separately, Trump said he’d be willing to meet under certain conditions with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, against the recommendations of his political advisers, to avert a military confrontation with the US adversary. He also said that a Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act would protect Americans with pre-existing conditions at least as well as Obamacare. Glass-steagall During the presidential campaign, Trump called for a “21st century” version of the 1933 Glass-Steagall law that required the separation of consumer and investment banking. The 2016 Republican Party platform also backed restoring the legal barrier, which was repealed in 1999 under a financial deregulation signed by then-President Bill Clinton. A handful of lawmakers blame the repeal for contributing to the 2008 financial crisis, an argument that Wall Street flatly rejects. Trump couldn’t unilaterally restore the law; Congress would have to pass a new version. Trump officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, have offered support for bringing back some version of Glass-Steagall, though they’ve offered scant details on an updated approach. Both Mnuchin and Cohn are former bankers who worked for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Wall Street has repeatedly shrugged off politicians’ calls for bank breakups in recent years. Market reaction The KBW Bank Index of 24 major US lenders was up about 1.2 per cent yesterday before Trump’s comment sent it tumbling about a percentage point. It soon recovered most of that, and was up 0.9 per cent as trading closed in New York. Firms including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp., the nation’s two largest banks, were among companies that swooned. The Glass-Steagall law essentially split banking into two categories: deposit-taking companies backed by taxpayers that primarily made loans to businesses and consumers, and investment banks and insurers that trade and underwrite securities and create or focus on other complex instruments. Severing those businesses would prevent Americans’ nest eggs from flowing into more volatile capital markets, Congress reasoned at the time. Large banks see little interest in Congress for reviving the prohibition between commercial and investment banking, especially since lawmakers are currently bogged down with more pressing issues like repealing Obamacare and passing a tax overhaul.  Only one Republican in the Senate, John McCain of Arizona, has endorsed a proposal by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to reinstate Glass-Steagall. That signals that passing any legislation will be an uphill battle. During meetings with bank executives at the Treasury Department about Trump’s February executive order on financial rules, the topic of Glass-Steagall has rarely come up. “This isn’t a near or even medium term threat,” said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners LLC who follows bank regulation. Economic boost Promoting the tax overhaul outline his administration released last week, Trump said the tax cuts he’s seeking would, along with renegotiated trade agreements, serve as badly needed stimulus for the economy. The president called first-quarter economic growth, which the Commerce Department said declined to a 0.7 per cent annual rate, “really bad.” Although he’s taken credit for monthly job growth figures and stock market gains since entering office on January 20, Trump said he’s not responsible for the GDP number. “The first quarter, second quarter really isn’t my quarter. That’s really a leftover from — in all fairness, I just got here,” he said. “So you’re growing at 1 per cent or less in the country, so we need something, we need a stimulus.” Trump touched on a host of foreign and domestic issues during the interview. Honoured to do it Addressing the most urgent foreign policy and national security issue before him, Trump said he’d be willing to meet with North Korean leader Kim “under the right circumstances” if it would result in defusing tension on the Korean Peninsula. “If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely, I would be honoured to do it,” Trump said. “Most political people would never say that,” he said, “but I’m telling you under the right circumstances I would meet with him.” No US president has had direct contact with the North Korean regime and any contacts between the two nations have been limited since the signing of an armistice that halted the Korean War in 1953. Kim has never met with a foreign leader since taking charge after his father’s death in 2011 and hasn’t left his isolated country. Trump also defended his White House invitation to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who’s come under criticism from human rights groups for a brutal crackdown on the drug trade. “The Philippines is very important to me strategically and militarily,” Trump said. “He’s been very, very tough on that drug problem but he has a massive drug problem.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Singapore Air may land unfamiliar net-debt spot by 2018 Companies push back against Trump's 'Buy American' rule (VIDEO) Manufacturing sector improves after two years KL shares open higher on strong buying support Singapore’s DBS reports steady Q1 net profit at S$1.831b Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Petronas Dagangan registers record profit in 34 years Why are global players chasing Proton?

Reuters  | Posted by Sonalee Borgohain  reuters@intoday.com New York, May 2, 2017 | UPDATED 05:25 IST A +A - Highlights 1 Labour unions and civil rights groups staged rallies challenging Trump's immigration policies. 2 May Day unrest flared on Monday in France and Turkey, where demonstrators clashed with police. 3 Thousands set off on a boisterous but peaceful march across town to City Hall. Labour unions and civil rights groups staged May Day rallies across the United States on Monday, challenging President Donald Trump's immigration policies and his vow to step up deportations of those who entered the country illegally. Activists said they were seeking to amass the largest crowds to have yet turned out for US immigrant rights demonstrations since Trump took office on January 20. Thousands gathered at MacArthur Park near downtown Los Angeles for what organizers called a show of "resistance, unity and defiance," then set off on a boisterous but peaceful march across town to City Hall. A crowd of several thousand also assembled in Washington's Dupont Circle for a rally ahead of a planned procession to Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House. Earlier in the day, 500 protesters marched through midtown Manhattan and rallied in front of offices of Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Twelve were arrested, according to a spokesman for Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group that claims 20,000 members. The two banks were targeted because of their dealings with private companies that have built or manage some immigrant detention centers for the government, according to Jose Lopez, Make the Road New York's co-director of organizing. "The messaging for today was to stop financing immigrant detention facilities," Lopez said. May Day, also known as International Workers' Day, has typically been a quieter affair in the United States than in Europe, where it is a public holiday in many countries. MAY DAY UNREST FLARED IN FRANCE, TURKEY May Day unrest flared on Monday in France and Turkey, where demonstrators clashed with police. The US protests focused on Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration as he presses police agencies around the country to assist federal efforts at rounding up individuals sought for deportation and threatens to withhold federal dollars for cities that do not cooperate, which have been dubbed "sanctuary cities." Attorney General Jeff Sessions also stirred an outcry by saying last month that so-called "dreamers" - illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children and were granted protection under the Obama administration - were subject to deportation. Sessions later walked back his statement, and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly has said dreamers were not being targeted, though some have ended up detained in roundups of immigrants with criminal backgrounds. Retired social worker Christina Reilly Vaccarino, 78, who emigrated from Ireland at age 15 with a green card allowing her to work as a nanny, said she was "disgusted" by Trump's policies on immigration, taxes and workers' rights. 'NOT AMERICA ANYMORE' "I came to America at a time when everyone in Ireland believed that America is so wonderful, so great. And now, after all these years, to experience this? It's not America anymore," she said at an afternoon rally in Lower Manhattan. New York City's biggest rally was planned for the early evening, when organizers expected thousands to gather in downtown Manhattan's Foley Square for musical performances and speeches by union leaders and immigrants living in the country illegally. Precautions were in place in Seattle, where officials were on the lookout for incendiary devices and gun-carrying protesters after a January shooting outside a political event and an incident during May Day 2016 in which a protester tossed an unlit Molotov cocktail at police. Some Trump supporters said they would also turn out on May Day. Activist Joey Gibson said he and other conservatives would travel to Seattle to defend against what he described as communist and anti-fascist groups who have in the past faced off with police in the evening, after the conclusion of the usually peaceful daytime marches.

Protests and marches challenging Trump's efforts at stepping up the deportation of illegal immigrants drew crowds by the thousands to the streets of New York, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco, with smaller gatherings popping up across the country. A broad coalition of groups behind the events also took aim at various other Trump policies they saw as discriminatory or xenophobic, including his bid, so far blocked by the courts, to ban travelers from several Muslim countries and temporarily turn away all refugees. But the primary impetus cited by civil liberties and labor activists was Trump's strict new immigration enforcement policy - falling most heavily on undocumented workers who toil in low-paying, non-unionized sectors such as fast-food, hospitality, child care and agriculture. A May Day gathering grew unruly in Portland, Oregon, where a group of black-clad protesters roamed downtown streets in the late afternoon, setting fires, breaking storefront windows, throwing projectiles and vandalizing a police cruiser. Police, referring to the perpetrators as "anarchists," said they made more than two dozen arrests. Nine people were also arrested in Olympia, the state capital in Washington, where protesters threw rocks, bottles and pepper-spray at police officers and broke the windows of downtown businesses, according to a Fox affiliate. Rallies elsewhere across the country were boisterous but mostly orderly, even festive. In some cities, immigrant-run convenience stores and other businesses closed their doors in solidarity with the May Day rallies, and many protesters themselves gave up a day's wages to make their voices heard. "Money will come back later, but not this opportunity, not this day," said David Anaya, 44, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, who chose to forfeit the $300 he would have otherwise earned at his job as a welder. He was one of thousands who gathered at MacArthur Park near downtown Los Angeles for what organizers called a show of "resistance, unity and defiance," then set off on an animated but peaceful march across town to City Hall. A crowd of several thousand also assembled in Washington's Dupont Circle for a rally ahead of a planned procession to Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House. 'NOT AMERICA ANYMORE' Earlier in the day, 500 protesters marched through midtown Manhattan and rallied in front of offices of Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Twelve were arrested, according to a spokesman for Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group that claims 20,000 members. The two banks were targeted because of their dealings with private companies that have built or manage some immigrant detention centers for the government, according to Jose Lopez, Make the Road New York's co-director of organizing. "The messaging for today was to stop financing immigrant detention facilities," Lopez said. May Day, also known as International Workers' Day, has typically been a quieter affair in the United States than in Europe, where it is a public holiday in many countries. May Day unrest flared on Monday in France and Turkey, where demonstrators clashed with police. The U.S. protests focused on Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration as he presses police agencies around the country to assist federal efforts at rounding up individuals sought for deportation and threatens to withhold federal dollars from "sanctuary cities" that do not cooperate. Retired social worker Christina Reilly Vaccarino, 78, who emigrated from Ireland at age 15 with a green card allowing her to work as a nanny, said she was "disgusted" by Trump's policies on immigration, taxes and workers' rights. "I came to America at a time when everyone in Ireland believed that America is so wonderful, so great. And now, after all these years, to experience this? It's not America anymore," she said at an afternoon rally in Lower Manhattan. Some Trump supporters said they would also turn out on May Day. Activist Joey Gibson said he and other conservatives would travel to Seattle to defend against what he described as communist and anti-fascist groups who have in the past faced off with police in the evening, after the conclusion of the usually peaceful daytime marches.

So we’re going to look at that.” Trump also said he’s open to increasing the U.S. gas tax to fund infrastructure development, in a further sign that policies unpopular with the Republican establishment are under consideration in the White House. He described higher gas taxes as acceptable to truckers -- “I have one friend who’s a big trucker,” he said -- as long as the proceeds are dedicated to improving U.S. highways. Trump speaks during an interview in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on May 1. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg Separately, Trump said he’d be willing to meet under certain conditions with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, against the recommendations of his political advisers, to avert a military confrontation with the U.S. adversary. He also said that a Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act would protect Americans with pre-existing conditions at least as well as Obamacare. Glass-Steagall During the presidential campaign, Trump called for a “21st century” version of the 1933 Glass-Steagall law that required the separation of consumer and investment banking. The 2016 Republican Party platform also backed restoring the legal barrier, which was repealed in 1999 under a financial deregulation signed by then-President Bill Clinton. A handful of lawmakers blame the repeal for contributing to the 2008 financial crisis, an argument that Wall Street flatly rejects. Trump couldn’t unilaterally restore the law; Congress would have to pass a new version. Trump officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, have offered support for bringing back some version of Glass-Steagall, though they’ve offered scant details on an updated approach. Both Mnuchin and Cohn are former bankers who worked for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Wall Street has repeatedly shrugged off politicians’ calls for bank breakups in recent years. Market Reaction The KBW Bank Index of 24 major U.S. lenders was up about 1.2 percent on Monday before Trump’s comment sent it tumbling about a percentage point. It soon recovered most of that, and was up 0.9 percent as trading closed in New York. Firms including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp., the nation’s two largest banks, were among companies that swooned. The Glass-Steagall law essentially split banking into two categories: deposit-taking companies backed by taxpayers that primarily made loans to businesses and consumers, and investment banks and insurers that trade and underwrite securities and create or focus on other complex instruments. Severing those businesses would prevent Americans’ nest eggs from flowing into more volatile capital markets, Congress reasoned at the time. Large banks see little interest in Congress for reviving the prohibition between commercial and investment banking, especially since lawmakers are currently bogged down with more pressing issues like repealing Obamacare and passing a tax overhaul.  Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up Only one Republican in the Senate, John McCain of Arizona, has endorsed a proposal by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to reinstate Glass-Steagall. That signals that passing any legislation will be an uphill battle. During meetings with bank executives at the Treasury Department about Trump’s February executive order on financial rules, the topic of Glass-Steagall has rarely come up. “This isn’t a near or even medium term threat,” said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners LLC who follows bank regulation. Economic Boost Promoting the tax overhaul outline his administration released last week, Trump said the tax cuts he’s seeking would, along with renegotiated trade agreements, serve as badly needed stimulus for the economy. The president called first-quarter economic growth, which the Commerce Department said declined to a 0.7 percent annual rate, “really bad.” Although he’s taken credit for monthly job growth figures and stock market gains since entering office on Jan. 20, Trump said he’s not responsible for the GDP number. “The first quarter, second quarter really isn’t my quarter. That’s really a leftover from -- in all fairness, I just got here,” he said. “So you’re growing at 1 percent or less in the country, so we need something, we need a stimulus.” Trump touched on a host of foreign and domestic issues during the interview. ‘Honored to Do It’ Addressing the most urgent foreign policy and national security issue before him, Trump said he’d be willing to meet with North Korean leader Kim “under the right circumstances” if it would result in defusing tension on the Korean Peninsula. “If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely, I would be honored to do it,” Trump said. “Most political people would never say that,” he said, “but I’m telling you under the right circumstances I would meet with him.” No U.S. president has had direct contact with the North Korean regime and any contacts between the two nations have been limited since the signing of an armistice that halted the Korean War in 1953. Kim has never met with a foreign leader since taking charge after his father’s death in 2011 and hasn’t left his isolated country. Trump also defended his White House invitation to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who’s come under criticism from human rights groups for a brutal crackdown on the drug trade. “The Philippines is very important to me strategically and militarily,” Trump said. “He’s been very, very tough on that drug problem but he has a massive drug problem.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

As a member of the White House's new Strategic and Policy Forum, Dimon is part of the group of business leaders tasked with finding a way to create more jobs in the United States. Dimon joined the task force despite not supporting President Donald Trump in his campaign - a move he attributed to the need to support "the pilot" flying the airplane. Dimon stressed that technology advancements are not the enemy of job creation. "You'd be living in tents, hunting buffalo, and dying at 35," were it not for developments in tech, he said. "Mankind will adjust and find other things to do as robots take their place. If it (technological developments) goes too fast, then we can create policies that make up for it." Dimon, who has led the bank as CEO since December 2005, shrugged off any aspirations for running for office, when asked on stage. He said it was too late for him to live as a civil servant and that he does not want to be a mayor, a senator or governor. "You've got to start early. President Obama wrote two books about himself before he did anything," Dimon said - a line that prompted laughter and applause from the hundreds of business leaders, financiers and government officials packed into the Beverly Hills Hilton ballroom. Dimon said the government needs to spend more money on programs that provide education and work opportunities for people, particularly those in poor, economically depressed urban neighborhoods. "I think there are legitimate complaints about what we didn't do to help the problems of these folks," Dimon said. "It's a terrible thing - those inner city kids who may be a Colin Powell, a Barack Obama, Albert Einstein, and we'll never know because we didn't give them the opportunity that most of us had."

All the signs of a catastrophic loss were plainly evident. Yet Trump pulled it off. In the same manner, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) is exceedingly difficult to forecast. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr That BAC stock surged when Mr. Trump took the presidency is no surprise: The brash real estate mogul promised a less burdensome regulatory environment to reinvigorate the economy. As a result, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) and even lying, cheating Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) soared. The expectation was that BofA and company would continue riding the wave of momentum. So far this year, it hasn’t panned out that way … and it’s difficult to figure out why. Despite a torrent of criticism, President Trump has been prolific. Especially with the economy. Naturally, we expect the dollar to move higher along with key interest rates. In turn, lending institutions like Bank of America will have greater revenue potential. And yet the future for big banking remains murky as ever. Excellent Stats for Bank of America First, the markets provide a picture of ambiguity. If Bank of America is the “big league” winner that everyone says it is, BAC stock should swing higher. Instead, BAC is mired in a consolidation pattern horizontal enough to make flat-Earth proponents blush. Shares are up less than 1% against their January opener. The laggard performance is a far cry from its double-digit “Trump rally.” Compounding matters is BofA earnings. Bank of America put up impressive numbers for its first-quarter report, beating its earnings per share target by 17%. This year’s performance substantially widened the gap against its year-ago level results. Additionally, BAC revenue “increased 7% to $22.2 billion,” while “total loans were up $21 billion, or 2%, to $914 billion.” All in all, these figures would easily elicit jealousy among the competition. But in actuality, BAC stock hardly reacted. Adding to the mystery is the underlying economy. Unemployment is way down, at 4.5%, from the most recent March data. Relatively speaking, the real estate market is robust, with housing starts jumping more than 150% from its lows of 2009. Finally, consumer sentiment remains elevated. This implies that Americans generally feel great about the economy, and are more likely to invest or borrow money. Therefore, it’s tempting to run out and buy boatloads of Bank of America shares. Yet I still go back to the technical performance. If BAC stock has the wind at its back, why does Wall Street not care? It’s the Bond Market, Stupid! The answer is found in the bond market. If key interest rates rise, this is a net positive for Bank of America and the banking industry. A big reason why banks were slow growers in prior years was because the lending margins were paper-thin. This is no longer the case. As noted by InvestorPlace contributor Ian Bezek, the “Trump administration appears intent on giving banks the tool to amp up their loan generation and unleashing the excess reserves currently held at the Federal Reserve.” Next Page   1 2 View All View All   Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2017/05/stay-away-from-bank-of-america-corp-bac-stock/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace 10 Super-Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy for Your Retirement 4 High-Yield Stocks for 6%-Plus Dividends 4 Retail Stocks on the Verge of Bankruptcy Stay Away From Bank of America Stock Why AAPL Will Hit $165 After Earnings 3 Reasons Tesla Won’t Be the Next Amazon ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Editor's Picks 10 Simply Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement 4 Retail Stocks on the Verge of Bankruptcy 4 High-Yield Stocks to Buy for 6%-Plus Dividends 3 Tasty Restaurant Stocks to Buy Why Apple Inc.

Peter Kraus, a longtime Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive whose 2008 appointment by majority owner AXA SA as AllianceBernstein's CEO drew fanfare, was terminated from his position Friday, according to a securities filing. Seth Bernstein, a former J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. executive, has been named chief executive and given a seat on the company's board. On a Monday conference call, AXA Chairman Denis Duverne said it was time to bring in a new leadership team. But Mr. Duverne offered few specifics on why the company was taking such dramatic steps now. The announcement stunned industry executives and analysts, some of whom said AllianceBernstein had made progress in its turnaround from its poor performance during and following the financial crisis. People familiar with the matter said Mr. Kraus had never forged a strong relationship with Mr. Duverne, who was appointed AXA's chairman last year. Mr. Kraus was removed from AXA's management committee when a new group was formed following Mr. Duverne's promotion. AllianceBernstein is among a set of stock- and bond-picking firms that have struggled to stem a flood of lost capital to exchange-traded funds and other passive investments that track indexes and typically charge lower fees. Notably, even while shares of many companies in the financial industry have rallied in the past year, AllianceBernstein shares are in the red. The migration has left active investment firms like AllianceBernstein to cut their fees, push more aggressively into passive funds or turn to riskier, more complex strategies for which investors are prepared to pay higher fees. The firm appeared to be gaining momentum, and had high expectations for a set of new low-cost funds it is launching this year. On the call, AllianceBernstein's new executives praised the firm's strategic direction. The firm also named Robert Zoellick as chairman. He previously served in the administrations of President George H.W. Bush and President Ronald Reagan, and was president of the World Bank Group from 2007 to 2012. Mr. Zoellick will receive $425,000 cash and an equity-based grant worth $425,000 annually. AXA America Holdings Inc. is the parent of the sole stockholder of AllianceBernstein Corp., which is the general partner of AllianceBernstein Holding. According to a filing Monday, an affiliate of AXA America on Friday acted to replace Mr. Kraus and remove nine directors from the board of AllianceBernstein Corp. Mr. Duverne and Mark Pearson remained on the board. New to the board, which now consists of eight members, are incoming CEO Mr. Bernstein, Ramon de Oliveira, Barbara Fallon-Walsh, Daniel Kaye, Anders Malmström and Mr. Zoellick.

(NASDAQ: TPIC) has filed an S-1 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a secondary offering. The company intends to sell 4.5 million shares, with an overallotment option for an additional 675,000 additional shares. At the most recent closing price $, the entire offering is valued up to $101.69 million. The underwriters for the offering are JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Cowen, Raymond James and Canaccord Genuity. This company is the largest U.S.-based independent manufacturer of composite wind blades. It enables many of the industry’s leading wind turbine original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), who have historically relied on in-house production, to outsource the manufacturing of some of their wind blades through its global footprint of advanced manufacturing facilities strategically located to serve large and growing wind markets in a cost-effective manner. Considering the importance of wind energy capture, turbine reliability and cost to power producers, the size, quality and performance of wind blades have become highly strategic to OEM customers. As a result, TPI has become a key supplier to OEM customers in the manufacture of wind blades and related precision molding and assembly systems. The firm has entered into long-term supply agreements in which it dedicates certain capacity at its facilities to customers in exchange for their commitment to purchase minimum annual volumes of wind blade sets, which consist of three wind blades. As of April 28, 2017, long-term supply agreements provided for estimated minimum aggregate volume commitments of $2.7 billion. TPI will not receive any proceeds from this offering. Instead the selling stockholders will receive all the proceeds. Shares of TPI were last seen at $19.62 on Monday, with a consensus analyst price target of $24.00 and a 52-week trading range of $11.31 to $23.30.

By Ben Levisohn Updated May 1, 2017 2:19 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large On April 21, Barron'sAndrew Baryrecommended buying big bank stocks, including those of Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs Group (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Illustration: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Bary argued that the stocks, which had been trading at 12 times 2017 earnings, a discount to the S&P 500's 18 times, made them attractive. Today, KBW's Frederick Cannon offers a couple more reasons: Financials rallied again during the last two weeks, creating positive returns for the year but not quite catching up with this year’s gains in the broader market. In this note we review the valuations, earnings growth and betas of the group. We find the large-cap banks compelling. Their price-earnings multiple relative to the market is below where it was pre-election, their expected earnings growth has increased more than the market, and their betas appear to be stabilizing. We remain Overweight on the Universal banks sector and rate BAC, WFC, C and GS Outperform. Shares of Bank of America have gained 1.7% to $23.74 at 2:13 p.m. today, while Citigroup has risen 1.4% to $59.95, Goldman Sachs Group has advanced 1% to $226.05, JPMorgan Chase has ticked up 0.5% to $87.47, Morgan Stanley has rallied 1.5% to $44.01, and Wells Fargo climbed 1.5% to $54.67.

FILE - This July 16, 2013, file photo, shows a Wall Street street sign outside the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks are opening slightly higher on Wall Street, Monday, May 1, 2017, led by gains in technology companies and... By ELAINE KURTENBACH AP Business Writer TOKYO (AP) - Shares were mostly higher in Asia early Tuesday after an upbeat day on Wall Street. Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea's Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market's anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $48.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 5 cents to $51.47 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. GOLD: The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce, reflecting greater appetite for risk and less for safe havens. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.87 yen from 111.84 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0911 from $1.0898. ___ Follow Elaine Kurtenbach: http://twitter.com/ekurtenbach Her work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/kurtenbach%20elaine -- AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed.

It was also just announced that Barack Obama, following in the well-heeled footsteps of Bill and Hillary Clinton, will be paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for giving a speech on behalf of a Wall Street firm. Anyone who thinks these two facts aren't connected isn't paying attention. Obama's payday reflects a longstanding pattern of behavior from Democratic leaders: Talk like liberals, govern from the center, and make a lot of money once you're out of office. Their policies better than Trump's and the GOP's, but that adds even more bite to that poll's other major finding: Democrats are viewed as even more out of touch with everyday concerns than Trump, a twitter-happy billionaire president who weekends at his palatial estate. - Advertisement - Democrats need a better message, to be sure. But they also need messengers who will walk the walk after they have talked the talk. No Surprise Barack Obama's $400,000 speaking fee, from investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, shouldn't surprise anyone. Obama courted Wall Street leaders like Jamie Dimon, CEO of scandal-plagued serial lawbreaker JP Morgan Chase, until it became politically unfeasible to do so during his re-election campaign. (Dimon was once described as Obama's "favorite banker.") In 2009, after Wall Street's criminality shattered the economy and ruined millions of American lives, Obama famously told Wall Street's top CEOs, "My administration is the only thing between you and the pitchforks." In the years that followed, Obama's Justice Department failed to prosecute a single bank executive for that criminality. Even when regulators identified the individuals responsible for criminal behavior, as they did with GE Capital, the Justice Department failed to follow up. For his part, Obama appointed the CEO of GE Capital's parent corporation to a prestigious economic position. Obama chose Wall Street-friendly figures Eric Holder and Tim Geithner to lead the Justice and Treasury departments, respectively. He then followed Bill Clinton's lead by overseeing a revolving door between his administration and Wall Street's biggest banks (most notably Citigroup, the banking behemoth forged in a merger pushed by top appointees in the Clinton Administration). As the nation has learned under Donald Trump, a president's pronouncements can have a powerful effect on legal actions. When Obama pre-emptively declared that Wall Street executives had not broken the law -- an opinion not shared by experts like William K. Black, Jr. -- that very possibly had a chilling effect on prosecutors in the field. It certainly sent a signal to lower-level appointees in his own Justice Department. - Advertisement - The Victims It may be overly cynical to see these large fees as payment for services rendered, but Obama's record on these matters -- like Bill Clinton's before him -- certainly didn't help that perception. At best, these speeches reflect the insular worldview of privileged insiders who neither understand nor fully empathize with the victims of lawbreaking bankers. Dozens of those victims reached out to me in 2010, when I first began writing on the subject, and their emails were heartbreaking. (Their plight was well-documented in David Dayen's book, Chain of Title.) Millions of Americans have either been defrauded by an American bank or know someone who has been. They have seen the Democratic Party's three most prominent leaders -- two ex-presidents, along with a former First Lady, senator, two-time presidential candidate and former Secretary of State -- earn millions by hobnobbing with the same bankers who ruined their lives, their friends' lives, or their communities.

The S&P 500 bank index quickly retreated following the comment from its session high of 288.46, up 1.2 percent, to 285.71, a drop of nearly 1 percent. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co, Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc all experienced a similar decline. The selloff was short lived, however, with bank shares recovering within minutes. The bank index was last up 0.9 percent. Traders attributed the drop and rebound to computer-driven trading, as algorithms scan news headlines and place stock orders. "It was an extreme reaction off algorithms that read the tape," said Mark Kepner, managing director, sales and trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey."It has to be paid attention to, but I wouldn’t be making rash decisions on buying or selling securities because of a one-liner that he just said."

Now get out. In a surprise move that left Wall street flummoxed, AllianceBernstein on Monday ousted Chairman and CEO Peter Kraus, who had led the firm for eights years, as well as all nine of its independent directors. The money manager didn’t provide a clear reason for the shakeup, but in securities filings it revealed that Kraus — a former Goldman Sachs exec who had led AllianceBernstein for 8 years — was getting a $99.3 million payout. AXA, which has 63.8 percent stake in AllianceBernstein, said JPMorgan Chase alum Seth Bernstein will replacing Kraus as CEO. Former World Bank president Robert Zoellick is stepping in as board chairman. “In an industry that is confronting significant shifts, we need to continue transforming the business to improve the quality of our investment solutions while delivering our services more effectively,” Denis Duverne of Paris, France-based insurance firm AXA said in a statement Monday. Analysts weren’t buying Duverne’s soundbites, amid signs that he had been quietly moving to replace him for at least several weeks. “There is little news other than the changes did not reflect strategic or financial issues — suggesting to us, potentially personal conflict drove the sudden change,” Citigroup analyst William Katz wrote in a note Monday. Duverne claimed that the decision was motivated in part by it being “eight years in a row, for Peter.” But analysts pressed further during a AllianceBernstein’s hastily assembled call Monday morning. “I don’t think it’s relevant to make a comment about — I just don’t comment about the past,” Duverne said after Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs said he’d “try another crack at this” and pressed Duverne for details. Before too many tears are shed for Kraus, the now-unemployed CEO will soon be getting his $99.3 million check as AXA, buys back Kraus’ 4.5 percent AllianceBernstein stake, according to regulatory filings. It is the second time Kraus was handsomely rewarded while being shoved out the door. Kraus, formerly a longtime Goldman Sachs executive, famously earned $30 million from Merrill Lynch after spending just three months as head of strategy there in 2008, scoring a golden parachute right before Merrill was sold to Bank of America. Shares of AllianceBernstein closed down 3.3 percent at $22.15.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad AllianceBernstein parent abruptly removes CEO Kraus, directors By Reuters Published: 14:41 EDT, 1 May 2017 | Updated: 14:41 EDT, 1 May 2017 e-mail By Ross Kerber and Tim McLaughlin BOSTON, May 1 (Reuters) - The French parent of asset manager AllianceBernstein fired its longtime leader Peter Kraus, replacing him with a new chief executive and and new chairman, and overhauled the firm's board, according to a filing Monday that offered little explanation for the unexpected changes. New York-based AllianceBernstein, which is 64 percent owned by France's AXA SA, named JPMorgan Asset Management executive Seth Bernstein as its new CEO and Robert Zoellick, previously president of the World Bank and a former Goldman Sachs executive, as chairman. Kraus, who held the CEO and chairman titles since 2008, was "terminated" from his job as CEO, according to a securities filing. AllianceBernstein, with $497.9 billion in assets under management at the end of March, gave no hint of changes in the works when it reported earnings on Thursday. The filing also said that on Friday an AXA unit removed nine directors from the AllianceBernstein board, including Kraus, and the next day named replacements to fill most of the seats on the board which now has eight members. A spokesman declined to comment on the reason for the changes. Representatives at AXA's Paris headquarters were not available to comment on the moves, which came eight months after Thomas Buberl took over as CEO of the giant French insurer. AllianceBernstein shares fell 3.28 percent to $22.15. Kraus, himself a Goldman Sachs veteran, took over as CEO and chairman in 2008, just as the financial crisis gripped Wall Street. He helped shepherd AllianceBernstein in the difficult years that followed, but it has not fully recovered. AllianceBernstein's assets of $497.9 billion are well below the $800.4 billion it managed at the end of 2007. It is now dwarfed by companies with stronger lineups of passive investment products such as BlackRock Inc, which ran $5.4 trillion at the end of March. On a conference call on Monday morning, AXA Board Chairman Denis Duverne thanked Kraus for his service as CEO. "After eight years, we decided it was time to put in new leadership," Duverne said during the call. Analysts pushed for more detail on the abrupt changes at the top, but Duverne declined to say what, if anything, was lacking during Kraus' watch. In a note to investors Jefferies analysts wrote the shake-up "produces more questions than answers" and that the new management structure may signal a closer alignment between AllianceBernstein and AXA, where six board members now have ties. AXA executives cited a changed industry since Kraus came in, the Jefferies analysts wrote, implying that "AXA disagreed with the strategy being pursued by the previous management team and did not want to wait until the end of Peter's contract to make changes as industry headwinds are only accelerating." Citigroup William Katz wrote however the change may not reflect strategic or financial issues because management had little other news, and that "potentially personal conflict drove the sudden change." Kraus had given no indication of changes ahead. On a conference call after the company's earnings last week, he said: "We've focused for years on rebuilding our presence and regaining relevance with retail clients and are finally where we need to be." Kraus has entered into a "cooperation agreement" with AllianceBernstein, under which he is entitled to termination benefits and salary, according to the filing. According to the filing AXA has agreed to buy from Kraus stock units worth $99.3 million. He may also receive restricted units in the future, the filing states.

The S&P 500 bank index quickly retreated following the comment from its session high of 288.46, up 1.2 percent, to 285.71, a drop of nearly 1 percent. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (jpm), Wells Fargo (wfc), Bank of America (bac) and Citigroup (c) all experienced a similar decline. The selloff was short lived, however, with bank shares recovering within minutes. The bank index was last up 0.9 percent. Traders attributed the drop and rebound to computer-driven trading, as algorithms scan news headlines and place stock orders. "It was an extreme reaction off algorithms that read the tape," said Mark Kepner, managing director, sales and trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. "It has to be paid attention to, but I wouldn’t be making rash decisions on buying or selling securities because of a one-liner that he just said."

As New York State has said, "If you boycott against Israel, New York will boycott you." Yet, a New York state affiliated non-profit, Henry Street Settlement, has announced Linda Sarsour, an anti-Israel, pro-BDS activist, will speak at its annual Lillian Wald Symposium, "Immigrant New York: The New Majority," on Tuesday, May 16, 2017. Founded in 1893 by social work and public health pioneer Lillian Wald and based on Manhattan's Lower East Side, Henry Street Settlement delivers a wide range of social service, arts, and healthcare programs to more than 60,000 New Yorkers each year. Major donors to Henry Street Settlements include the New York City Council, New York State Assembly, JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, American Express, and Citibank. Sarsour has said Muslim women who have criticized parts of Islam must have their vaginas taken away. She has said Zionists cannot be feminists, is a proud advocate of BDS and an open opponent of the State of Israel. As Ha’aretz reported, "Sarsour’s history of criticizing Israel and Muslims who cooperate with Israel-related organizations dates back years. In 2015, shortly after the Shalom Hartman Institute created the Muslim Leadership Initiative, in which it takes emerging leaders of that community to Israel, Sarsour tweeted her opposition. Using hashtags #BDS and #FreePalestine she tweeted a statement by the Muslim Anti-Racism Collaborative opposing the program because of Palestinian leaders’ call to BDS." Sarsour has declared that she "believes in a one-state solution" (which ultimately means the end of Israel), and said "nothing is creepier than Zionism." Sarsour has advocated violence against Israeli soldiers, having posting a photo of a Palestinian throwing a rock at Israeli soldiers, labeling it "the definition of courage." Henry Street settlement must rescind the invitation to Sarsour, or their non-profit status must be examined.

Stocks are opening slightly higher on Wall Street, Monday, May 1, 2017, led by gains in technology companies and banks. Mark Lennihan, File AP Photo National May 01, 2017 11:49 PM Asian shares mostly higher despite soft China factory data By ELAINE KURTENBACH AP Business Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story TOKYO Shares were mostly higher in Asia early Tuesday after an upbeat day on Wall Street. Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea's Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market's anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $48.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 5 cents to $51.47 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. GOLD: The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce, reflecting greater appetite for risk and less for safe havens. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.87 yen from 111.84 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0911 from $1.0898. ___ Follow Elaine Kurtenbach: http://twitter.com/ekurtenbach Her work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/kurtenbach%20elaine -- AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed.

Lannis Waters Palm Beach Post Miami-Dade County May 01, 2017 1:56 PM Miami can sue big banks for predatory lending, Supreme Court rules By Lance Dixon and David Smiley dsmiley@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that the city of Miami can sue the nation’s largest financial institutions over allegations that predatory lending practices in minority communities violated the Fair Housing Act and contributed to a real estate meltdown that nearly bankrupted the city. The high court, by a 5-3 decision, said the city has standing to pursue damages against banks that elected leaders blamed for a wave of foreclosures that undercut Miami’s tax base in the late 2000s. The city, which was forced to patch a budget shortfall of more than $100 million following the real estate bust of 2008, took the novel course of suing Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and CitiGroup in 2013. A trial judge tossed Miami’s lawsuits in 2014 in a decision later overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. On Monday, six months after hearing oral arguments on cases brought by Wells Fargo and Bank of America, the high court handed the city a partial victory in a decision that could open the gates for communities around the country to follow Miami’s lead. “You have an expansion of who can sue and that makes the banks more vulnerable in a way,” said Philip Stein, a partner with the law firm Bilzin Sumberg who represents loan originators in mortgage-backed securities. “Until this case someone like a borrower or somebody close to the loans was the only person able to take action.” And yet, the justices also vacated the portion of the 11th Circuit’s ruling that found the city had sufficiently argued that the banks’ activities can be directly blamed for the city’s financial problems on the basis that the fallout should have been foreseeable. They directed the court to reassess that issue, with the three dissenting justices remaining highly skeptical that the city can prove its case. “Under Miami’s own theory of causation, its injuries are one step further removed from the allegedly discriminatory lending practices than the injuries suffered by the neighboring homeowners whose houses declined in value,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote. “No one suggests that those homeowners could sue under the [Fair Housing Act], and I think it is clear that they cannot.” Thomas did say, though, that at least the ruling was narrow enough so that it “should not be read to authorize suits by local businesses alleging the same injuries that Miami alleges here.” As Miami leaders celebrated Monday, Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda issued a statement declaring that “the Supreme Court has brought us one step closer to ending the litigation brought by the city of Miami and other municipalities under the Fair Housing Act.” “We believe that under the stringent standards articulated by the Supreme Court, it will be very difficult for Miami or any other municipality to show the required connection between the claimed damages and unsubstantiated allegations about our lending practices, which do not reflect how we operate in the communities we serve,” Goyda said. Still, elected officials in both Miami and Miami Gardens, which has its own predatory cases pending against the same banks, lauded Monday’s decision. Both cities say the banks violated the 1968 Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discriminatory real estate transactions, by intentionally issuing high-risk loans to African Americans and Hispanics. Miami Commissioner Francis Suarez, a real estate attorney who pushed the city to file suit against the banks back in 2013, said the city can either move to continue litigating the case or talk settlement now that it has greater leverage. “Every citizen in the city should be proud that the city fought on its behalf and that we’ve tried to undo some of the injustice done by these banks,” he said. Miami Gardens Mayor Oliver Gilbert said the court’s decision validated the city’s decision to sue in 2014. He plans to meet with City Attorney Sonja Knighton-Dickens and the city’s outside legal counsel Tuesday to discuss next steps. Miami Gardens has been in a holding pattern with its lawsuit based on the city of Miami’s case. “We made the argument that the city of Miami Gardens and its 112,000 residents could make the case against banks that had bad practices that were sure to cause foreclosures and diminish property values,” Gilbert said. “We said that we could state that case and the court said we have that right.” LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you   Comments   Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 6 hours ago Church of Scientology opens new building in Coconut Grove 1:20 6 hours ago Church of Scientology opens new building in Coconut Grove 0:33 10 hours ago Remarks by Miami Gardens first female police chief 1:57 4 days ago Florida’s first needle-exchange program has begun handing out Narcan in Overtown View More Video Miami-Dade County Church of Scientology opens a massive new center in Coconut Grove Bad condo boards beware: Legislature passes new laws unanimously Facebook partners with Jamaica on ‘Amber Alert’ style system to find missing children. 2-year-old critically injured after falling out of a second-story window State Senate approves homestead amendment for 2018 ballot.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman A Foolish Take: An Ominous Sign for the Economy An economy is like an engine: Both need fuel to accelerate. An engine needs gasoline, while an economy needs credit. But the Federal Reserve is reporting a rapid deceleration in the growth of bank loans, a principal source of credit, and thereby fuel for the economy. Data source: Federal Reserve. Chart by author. Total loans at commercial banks in 2015 and 2016 grew on a year-over-year basis each month by around 8%. But starting at the end of last year, the growth rate has steadily dropped. The latest reading showed that total loans at commercial banks expanded at a rate of only 4.1% in March. However, Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase , recently told analysts that he „wouldn’t overreact to the short term in the loan growth because there are so many things that affect it.” It’s hard to say for sure what’s behind this trend, but it’s generally assumed that uncertainty around President Trump’s pro-growth agenda could be causing businesses to wait before applying for new loans until the White House puts some legislative wins on the scoreboard. If and when that happens, the downward trend in loan growth could be primed to reverse course.

Stocks are opening slightly higher on Wall Street, Monday, May 1, 2017, led by gains in technology companies and... By ELAINE KURTENBACH AP Business Writer TOKYO (AP) - Shares were mostly higher in Asia early Tuesday after an upbeat day on Wall Street. Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea's Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market's anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $48.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 5 cents to $51.47 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. GOLD: The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce, reflecting greater appetite for risk and less for safe havens. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.87 yen from 111.84 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0911 from $1.0898. ___ Follow Elaine Kurtenbach: http://twitter.com/ekurtenbach Her work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/kurtenbach%20elaine -- AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed.

(NYSE: MCRN) has filed an S-1 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding a secondary offering. The company intends to offer 12 million shares with an overallotment option for an additional 1.8 million shares. At the most recent closing price of $18.82, the entire offering is valued up to $259.72 million. The underwriters for the offering are Credit Suisse, Barclays, Baird, Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan, KeyBanc Capital Markets and William Blair. This company is a global leader in the manufacture, distribution and service of highly engineered and customized systems within the $27 billion plastic technology and processing industry. It is the only global company with a full-line product portfolio that includes hot runner systems, injection molding, blow molding and extrusion equipment. Milacron maintains strong market positions across these products, as well as leading positions in process control systems; mold bases and components; maintenance, repair and operating supplies; and fluid technology. Based on management estimates primarily based on industry surveys and publications from 2014, management believes that Milacron is the top manufacturer and supplier of plastic processing technologies in North America on a consolidated basis across the industry’s primary plastic processing machinery applications based on sales. At the same time, on an international basis, management believes that this company is the top supplier to installed base worldwide based on sales, the top manufacturer and supplier of injection molding technologies in India based on sales, the top provider of hot runner systems in the Americas and Europe and the number two provider of hot runner systems in Asia, based on sales. The company will not receive any proceeds from the offering. Instead the selling stockholders will receive all the net proceeds from the sale of shares. Shares of Milacron traded early Monday at $18.05, with a consensus analyst price target of $20.50 and a 52-week trading range of $12.43 to $19.32.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States What Analysts Are Saying About Schneider National After the Quiet Period By Chris Lange May 1, 2017 10:35 am EDT Print Email Tweet Schneider National Inc. (NYSE: SNDR) recently entered the market in its initial public offering (IPO), and shares have since stayed in a relatively tight range. However, now that the quiet period is over, analysts are taking the opportunity to weigh in on the stock, and many are calling for it to go higher. 24/7 Wall St. has included what a few different analysts are saying specifically about the stock in their reports, as well as a montage on how analysts feel in general. Keep in mind the underwriters for this IPO were Morgan Stanley, UBS Investment, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Baird and Wolfe Capital Markets. Merrill Lynch initiated Schneider’s shares with a Buy rating and $23 price objective. The brokerage firm noted that the company is an iconic diversified transport provider. The second largest truck company has diversified customers, transformative tech, e-commerce reach and benefits from improving macro. Schneider also trades at a large discount to its group. Credit Suisse initiated coverage with an Outperform rating for the stock and a $24 price target. The firm commented in its report: We believe that Schneider is poised for solid profit, EPS, and free cash flow (FCF) growth over the coming few years, which would be amplified by improved demand if an inflection point in Truckload arrives sooner than we expect. Moreover, with the potential for improved returns and capital efficiency (ROIIC) along with what we see as a compelling entry point, we think that SNDR is a low-beta, high-quality name that is suitable for investors looking for exposure to trucking and logistics, particularly at a point in the cycle in which fundamentals are weak. A few other analysts weighed in on the stock as well: JPMorgan initiated it with an Overweight rating and a $22 price target. Morgan Stanley initiated it at Overweight with a $24 price target. Wells Fargo initiated it with an Outperform rating. Baird initiated it at Outperform with a $22 price target. Shares of Schneider National were last seen up 3.8% at $19.70 Monday morning, with a consensus analyst price target of $18.00 and a post-IPO trading range of $18.41 to $19.91.

Twelve were arrested, according to a spokesman for Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group that claims 20,000 members. The two banks were targeted because of their dealings with private corrections companies that built or run some immigrant detention centers, according to Jose Lopez, Make the Road New York's co-director of organizing. "The messaging for today was to stop to financing immigrant detention facilities," said Lopez. "This is going to be the first of many attacks against these corporations who, until they stop working with this administration, will continue to be on our target list." May Day, also known as International Workers' Day, has typically been a quieter affair in the United States than in Europe, where it is a public holiday in many countries. New York City's biggest rally was planned for the early evening, when organizers expected thousands to gather in downtown Manhattan's Foley Square for musical performances and speeches by union leaders and immigrants living in the country illegally.In Los Angeles, organizers expected tens of thousands of people to converge on MacArthur Park during the morning before marching downtown to a rally in front of City Hall. Precautions were in place in Seattle, where officials were on the lookout for incendiary devices and gun-carrying protesters after a January shooting outside a political event and an incident during May Day 2016 when a protester threw an unlit Molotov cocktail at police.Some Trump supporters said they would also turn out on May Day. Activist Joey Gibson said he and other conservatives will travel to Seattle to defend against what he described as communist and anti-fascist groups who have in the past faced off with police in the evening, after the conclusion of the usually peaceful daytime marches.

The firm, majority-owned by France's AXA SA, named JPMorgan Asset Management executive Seth Bernstein as its new CEO and Robert Zoellick, previously president of the World Bank and a former Goldman Sachs executive, as chairman. Kraus, who held the CEO and chairman titles since 2008, was "terminated" from his job as CEO, according to a securities filing. AllianceBernstein, with $497.9 billion in assets under management at the end of March, gave no hint of changes in the works when it reported earnings on Thursday. A spokesman declined to comment on the reason for the changes. AllianceBernstein shares fell 2.4 percent to $22.35. Kraus took over as CEO and chairman in 2008, just as the financial crisis gripped Wall Street. He helped shepherd the firm in the difficult years after the crisis, but it has not fully recovered. AllianceBernstein's assets of $497.9 billion are well below the $800.4 billion it managed at the end of 2007. It is now dwarfed by companies with a stronger lineup of passive investment products such as BlackRock Inc, which ran $5.4 trillion at the end of March. On a conference call on Monday morning, AXA Board Chairman Denis Duverne thanked Kraus for his service as CEO. "After eight years, we decided it was time to put in new leadership," Duverne said during the call. Analysts pushed for more detail on the abrupt leadership change, but Duverne declined to say what, if anything, was lacking during Kraus' watch. Kraus had given no indication of changes ahead. On a conference call after the company's earnings last week, he said: "We've focused for years on rebuilding our presence and regaining relevance with retail clients and are finally where we need to be with the breadth and performance of our offerings." The filing also said that on Friday, an AXA unit removed nine directors from the AllianceBernstein board, including Kraus, and the next day named replacements to fill most of the seats on the board, which now has eight members. Kraus has entered into a "cooperation agreement" with AllianceBernstein, under which he is entitled to termination benefits and salary, according to the filing.

JPMorgan told investors to buy financial stocks because of their low valuations and the likelihood of better-than-expected earnings in the coming year. "Large bank stocks have been weak recently after seeing outperformance in the months following the elections. Concerns have arisen as to whether any meaningful policy changes will arise," analyst Vivek Juneja wrote in a report to clients Monday. "Large bank stocks are now attractively valued relative to the market." Juneja cited how the sector's price-earnings multiple is now at the lower end of the historical range relative to the S&P 500 during economic recoveries. Banks are trading at 10.8 times 2018 estimated earnings, which is 64 percent of the market's P/E versus the 59 to 75 percent range in the past 25 years during rate hike cycles, according to the analyst. "Longer term, we continue to like the sector … there is nothing in our EPS estimates for changes from the administration and we have one more rate hike in '17, hence these would provide EPS upside," he wrote. Here are four financial stocks that JPMorgan recommended and their price targets.

Protests and marches challenging Trump's efforts at stepping up the deportation of illegal immigrants drew crowds by the thousands to the streets of New York, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco, with smaller gatherings popping up across the country. A broad coalition of groups behind the events also took aim at various other Trump policies they saw as discriminatory or xenophobic, including his bid, so far blocked by the courts, to ban travelers from several Muslim countries and temporarily turn away all refugees. But the primary impetus cited by civil liberties and labor activists was Trump's strict new immigration enforcement policy - falling most heavily on undocumented workers who toil in low-paying, non-unionized sectors such as fast-food, hospitality, child care and agriculture. A May Day gathering grew unruly in Portland, Oregon, where a group of black-clad protesters roamed downtown streets in the late afternoon, setting fires, breaking storefront windows, throwing projectiles and vandalizing a police cruiser. Police, referring to the perpetrators as "anarchists," said they made more than two dozen arrests. Nine people were also arrested in Olympia, the state capital in Washington, where protesters threw rocks, bottles and pepper-spray at police officers and broke the windows of downtown businesses, according to a Fox affiliate. Rallies elsewhere across the country were boisterous but mostly orderly, even festive. In some cities, immigrant-run convenience stores and other businesses closed their doors in solidarity with the May Day rallies, and many protesters themselves gave up a day's wages to make their voices heard. "Money will come back later, but not this opportunity, not this day," said David Anaya, 44, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, who chose to forfeit the $300 he would have otherwise earned at his job as a welder. He was one of thousands who gathered at MacArthur Park near downtown Los Angeles for what organizers called a show of "resistance, unity and defiance," then set off on an animated but peaceful march across town to City Hall. A crowd of several thousand also assembled in Washington's Dupont Circle for a rally ahead of a planned procession to Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House. 'NOT AMERICA ANYMORE' Earlier in the day, 500 protesters marched through midtown Manhattan and rallied in front of offices of Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Twelve were arrested, according to a spokesman for Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group that claims 20,000 members. The two banks were targeted because of their dealings with private companies that have built or manage some immigrant detention centers for the government, according to Jose Lopez, Make the Road New York's co-director of organizing. "The messaging for today was to stop financing immigrant detention facilities," Lopez said. May Day, also known as International Workers' Day, has typically been a quieter affair in the United States than in Europe, where it is a public holiday in many countries. May Day unrest flared on Monday in France and Turkey, where demonstrators clashed with police. The U.S. protests focused on Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration as he presses police agencies around the country to assist federal efforts at rounding up individuals sought for deportation and threatens to withhold federal dollars from "sanctuary cities" that do not cooperate. Retired social worker Christina Reilly Vaccarino, 78, who emigrated from Ireland at age 15 with a green card allowing her to work as a nanny, said she was "disgusted" by Trump's policies on immigration, taxes and workers´ rights. "I came to America at a time when everyone in Ireland believed that America is so wonderful, so great. And now, after all these years, to experience this? It´s not America anymore," she said at an afternoon rally in Lower Manhattan. Some Trump supporters said they would also turn out on May Day. Activist Joey Gibson said he and other conservatives would travel to Seattle to defend against what he described as communist and anti-fascist groups who have in the past faced off with police in the evening, after the conclusion of the usually peaceful daytime marches.

Photos Videos Topics Live PAK 172/3 (69) - WI 312/10 (98.5) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Narendra Modi Donald Trump Bahubali 2 Exam results 2017 IPL 2017 News World News May Day rallies across US target Trump immigration policy Donald Trump Shares2 Mon, 1 May 2017-09:55pm , Reuters Labor unions and immigrant advocacy groups launched May Day rallies in cities across the United States on Monday, with the largest demonstrations expected late in the day as organizers target the immigration policies of President Donald Trump. Activists said they were trying to make the demonstrations the largest immigrant protests since Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Early in the day, 500 protesters marched through midtown Manhattan and rallied in front of offices of Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Twelve were arrested, according to a spokesman for Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group that claims 20,000 members. The two banks were targeted because of their dealings with private corrections companies that built or run some immigrant detention centers, according to Jose Lopez, Make the Road New York's co-director of organizing. "The messaging for today was to stop to financing immigrant detention facilities," said Lopez. "This is going to be the first of many attacks against these corporations who, until they stop working with this administration, will continue to be on our target list." May Day, also known as International Workers' Day, has typically been a quieter affair in the United States than in Europe, where it is a public holiday in many countries. New York City's biggest rally was planned for the early evening, when organizers expected thousands to gather in downtown Manhattan's Foley Square for musical performances and speeches by union leaders and immigrants living in the country illegally. In Los Angeles, organizers expected tens of thousands of people to converge on MacArthur Park during the morning before marching downtown to a rally in front of City Hall. Precautions were in place in Seattle, where officials were on the lookout for incendiary devices and gun-carrying protesters after a January shooting outside a political event and an incident during May Day 2016 when a protester threw an unlit Molotov cocktail at police. Some Trump supporters said they would also turn out on May Day. Activist Joey Gibson said he and other conservatives will travel to Seattle to defend against what he described as communist and anti-fascist groups who have in the past faced off with police in the evening, after the conclusion of the usually peaceful daytime marches.

I think that tends to be true for most people starting out, and it continues to be a focus of mine. I actually just booked another trip to Europe, so I thought I would do a post on the best award miles to use for flights to Europe. Let’s make these dreams a reality!   United MileagePlus Miles  United has great economy and premium cabin award availability to Europe on their own metal, and through their Star Alliance partners. You can fly economy on United or one of their partners for 30,000 miles, in business class on their metal for 55,500 miles, or in business class on one of their partners, like Lufthansa, for 70,000 miles each way (sometimes they will have sales on partner award flights). United Europe Award Flights   How to book Award travel bookings can be made directly on the United website. Although the United website can be buggy, it’s fairly easy to use and pulls up the majority of United’s partners. If the United website isn’t letting you book the award you want, then you may have to call a rep at 1-800-421-4655. How to earn  The best ways to earn United miles are by flying revenue flights or by using credit cards that earn United miles. Transfer partners  The United MileagePlus program is also a transfer partner of Chase’s Ultimate Rewards program. UR points earned through the Chase Sapphire Preferred, Sapphire Reserve, and Ink Business Card can be transferred instantly at a 1:1 ratio. (You can also use points earned from the Chase Freedom if you have either of the cards mentioned above, then your Ultimate Rewards points can be transferred between those accounts.) American Airlines AAdvantage Miles American Airlines miles aren’t the easiest award miles to use to get to Europe, since you will often have to route through London (higher fees), fly British Airways (high fuel surcharges on longer flights), and they limit award availability on their own metal, especially for premium cabin flights. But they have a good award chart, especially their non-peak availability, and it’s pretty easy to earn AA miles. MileSaaver economy flights start at 30,000 miles, business at 50,000 miles, and first class at 62,500 miles each way. Pretty standard, but the real gem is the round-trip “non-peak” economy flights that cost 45,000 miles (22,500 one way). AA non peak award flights to Europe How to book Award flights to Europe can easily be searched for and booked on AA.com. It’s worth mentioning that you will have to search the British Airways website for Iberia flights. AA also has a generous hold policy for award flights. If you can’t make a booking online, you can call AA at 1-800-882-8880. How to earn  American Airlines AAdvantage miles can be earned through revenue flights, or through many of their co-branded travel rewards cards. There’s the personal Citi Platinum Select Visa, Citi Platinum Select Business, or Citi Executive World Elite, and even the Citi AA Mastercard. Transfer partners  SPG points earned from the personal or business Starwood Preferred Guest cards transfer out to American Airlines. You will receive a bonus of 5,000 miles for every 20,000 SPG points you transfer out to an airline. AeroPlan Miles An interesting loyalty program to use for flights to Europe is Aeroplan. Aeroplan is part of the Star Alliance, so you can fly any airline in the alliance. Aeroplan does charge fuel surcharges and taxes, but they don’t on United flights. And you can book one way award flights. You can fly one-way business class awards to Europe on United (with no fuel surcharges), Lufthansa, or LOT start at only 55,000 points. That’s a great deal. Aeroplan award flights to Europe How to book You can search/book on the Aeroplan website after creating an ANA account. If you can’t book online, then you will need to call Aeroplan at 1-800-361-5373. How to earn  Since Aeroplan is a transfer partner of Amex MR points (see below), you have a lot of options to earn points to be used through the Aeroplan program. The best Amex MR card options are usually targeted. Transfer partners  The best way to earn Aeroplan miles is to transfer in American Express Membership Rewards points. Transfers are instant, and done at a 1:1 ratio. You can also transfer in SPG points. ANA Miles Another Star Alliance airline, ANA can be used for award flights to Europe. You have to book round-trip tickets with ANA miles, but they do have some sweet spots for award flights to Europe. A United round-trip ticket in business class will only cost you 88,000 ANA award miles, or 55,000 award miles in economy, and ANA doesn’t add fuel surcharges on United flights. How to book The ANA website is actually a good site to use to search for Star Alliance award flights. Another good thing about ANA is that you can have 3 stopovers. That’s sweet. If you can’t book your award online, just call the ANA reps at 1-800-235-9262. How to earn  Just like Aeroplan, ANA is a transfer partner of the American Express Membership Rewards program, so any card that earns MR points can be used for ANA transfers. Transfer partners  Amex MR transfers can take up to 4 days, but they are usually completed in 24 hours. Singapore Krisflyer Miles You don’t usually associate Singapore Airlines with flights to Europe, but there are a couple gems. You can fly NYC to Frankfurt in the swanky Suites Class for 76,000 miles, or Houston to Moscow in business class for 65,000 miles. There will be fuel surcharges that vary for each flight. Singapore Suites Seat How to book You can search and book Singapore award flights on their website. If you need to call Singapore Krisflyer, the US center’s number is (213) 404-0301. How to earn with transfer partners The Singapore Krisflyer program is a transfer partner of Citi Thank Points, Chase Ultimate Rewards, American Express Membership Rewards, and SPG points.  Some rewards card options include the Chase Sapphire Preferred, Sapphire Reserve, Ink Plus® Business Card , Starwood Preferred Guest, and all American Express Membership Rewards cards. I love the options!   British Airways Avios Ah, British Airways. Yes, British Airways raised the award prices for premium cabin flights, but there’s still one award flight to Europe that can make sense. Flying from the East Coast to Dublin or Shannon, Ireland. One way economy tickets are still 13,000 Avios miles (non-peak), and 20,000 Avios miles during peak season. How to book You will have to search for Aer Lingus award space on the Qantas website, or United’s website. Then call British Airways at 1-800-452-1201 and give them your flight information that you would like to book. How to earn  British Airways has the personal co-branded British Airways Visa Signature® Card from Chase, and for a limited time, you can earn up to 100,000 Avios.  Transfer partners  British Airways Avios is also a transfer partner of Chase’s Ultimate Rewards earned from the Chase Sapphire Preferred, Sapphire Reserve, Ink Plus® Business Cards. And you can transfer your Starwood Preferred Guest, and Amex Membership Rewards points (lower transfer ratio). These options make adding to your British Avios account easy. Wrap Up Personally, I like to fly business class to Europe, so the Star Alliance is my best option. The best way to go about earning points for award flights to Europe is by focusing on transferrable points, like Chase Ultimate Rewards and Amex Membership Rewards points. That way, you have the most flexibility and options when it comes time to search and book your award.

Wall Street freaked out. This is why we can’t have nice things. Updated by Matthew Yglesias@mattyglesias Apr 29, 2017, 8:30am EDT Presented By tweet share Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images Where technology and economics collide American Airlines agreed this week to do something nice for its employees and arguably foresighted for its business by giving flight attendants and pilots a preemptive raise, in order to close a gap that had opened up between their compensation and the compensation paid by rival airlines Delta and United. Wall Street freaked out, sending American shares plummeting. After all, this is capitalism and the capital owners are supposed to reap the rewards of business success. “This is frustrating. Labor is being paid first again,” wrote Citi analyst Kevin Crissey in a widely circulated note. “Shareholders get leftovers.” Indeed, major financial players were so outraged by American’s decision to pay higher wages that they punished airline stocks across the board. American itself took it hardest on the chin, of course, but the consensus among stock analysts was that higher pay at American could signal higher pay at other airlines too, with negative consequences for the overall industry. But taking a broader view, this blinkered Wall Street perspective on labor compensation is, arguably, exactly what’s gone wrong with the American economy. Any given company obviously benefits when it’s able to get away with paying its workforce less. But one company’s workers are another company’s customers. A world in which labor never gets paid is ultimately one in which nobody has much of anything but leftovers. Wall Street analysts hate the idea of paying workers JP Morgan’s Jamie Baker was even more scathing than Crissey. "We are troubled by AAL's wealth transfer of nearly $1 billion to its labor groups,” he wrote, suggesting that the move was not just contestable as a matter of business strategy, but somehow obviously illegitimate. The argument from American’s managers and unions, by contrast, is that the raises are a question of basic fairness and long-term sustainability. The ups-and-downs of various bankruptcies and mergers had created a situation where American was paying pilots and flight attendants less than its direct competitors Delta and United. Now that American had emerged from bankruptcy and was profitable again, that created an obvious morale problem. What’s more, while the unions had no way to force a raise in 2017, the collective bargaining agreement is set to expire in two years, so ultimately a showdown was inevitable. By that view, the raise represents American making a demonstration of good faith to its workforce to keep people happy and set the table for an eventual negotiation. Baker, however, takes a darker view, saying that not only does the raise increase costs, it “establishes a worrying precedent, in our view, both for American and the industry." Labor’s share of income has been declining Baker is certainly correct that for workers to get a larger slice of the pie would be a dramatic new precedent relative to recent trends. As a report last year from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development shows, in both the United States and other rich countries workers as a whole have been receiving a smaller and smaller share of national income. OECD Noah Smith of Bloomberg View recently wrote a column summarizing the various main theories professional economists have about why this is happening — monopoly power, global trade, robots, and landlords are the leading contenders for villain. It’s less quantifiable, and thus not-beloved by academic economists, but my personal view is that what amounts to a management fad for treating workers poorly is an underrated factor here. The beating American took in the stock market — and the outraged tone of the analyst letters — is a clear sign of the constant pressure that modern companies are under to be as stingy as possible with their workforce. Combine that pressure with what amounts to a 16-year span of objective labor market weakness and you have a whole cohort of corporate executives who’ve probably never even considered the possible merits of a different approach. And as we’re seeing, those who do are smacked down immediately. A company like Apple that thinks nothing of investing money in environmental or accessibility initiatives would never dream of taking a similarly high-minded attitude toward labor issues, even though it obviously could make Apple Store retail employees as well-paid as any manufacturing worker from the “good old days” if it wanted to. Low pay leads to collective economic weakness One big problem here is that even if obsessive cost-cutting is a good strategy for any given business, it’s a terrible strategy for a national economy. Broad-based income growth creates broad-based business opportunities. The vast majority of Americans earn a living supplying services to other Americans, so when wages don’t rise we struggle to find economic opportunities. As the rich get richer, they still find limits to what they can realistically consume, plowing money instead into financial assets. That creates low interest rates that the government could take advantage of to go deeply into debt and massively expand public sector employment. But politicians, with some good reason, are reluctant to embrace a growth strategy that’s so heavily dependent on debt and centralized control. A far better approach would be something more like a generalization of the American Airlines model. Profitable companies could pay workers more and shareholders less, leading to more spending on the products made by other companies. Those companies would then see their revenue, profits, and wages rise and people might find themselves buying more plane tickets. That’s how functioning market economies used to work, and in the end even executives and shareholders ended up just fine. With the unemployment rate finally down to a reasonably low level after years of painfully slow improvement, there’s a chance we just may get it. But for it to happen, economic elites will have to learn to live with a world where labor really does get paid first. Was this article helpful? Awesome, share it: tweet share Help us improve.

Announces Commencement of Consent Solicitations for Alere Inc.'s Notes News provided by Alere Inc. 01 May, 2017, 07:00 ET Share this article WALTHAM, Mass., May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Alere Inc. (NYSE: ALR) (the "Company") announced today the commencement of consent solicitations relating to the Company's 6.500% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020, 6.375% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2023 and 7.250% Senior Notes due 2018 (collectively, the "Notes"). As disclosed in the Form 8-K of the Company dated March 15, 2017 and Form 12b-25 dated March 1, 2017, the Company was unable to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (the "2016 Form 10-K") by March 16, 2017 (the extension period provided under Rule 12b-25) because it is continuing to review certain aspects of revenue recognition at its South Korean and Japanese locations, including inappropriate conduct at the Company's subsidiary in South Korea, Standard Diagnostics, Inc.  The Company will not be able to file its 2016 Form 10-K until this review of revenue recognition at its South Korean and Japanese locations is completed. The Company will file the 2016 Form 10-K as soon as practicable. On April 12, 2017, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, after considering the recommendations of management, concluded that the Company's financial statements and other financial data as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for each of the years ended December 31, 2015,  2014 and 2013, and for each of the quarterly and year-to-date periods in 2015 and the first three quarterly and year-to-date periods in 2016 (collectively, the "Non-Reliance Periods") should not be relied upon because of certain misstatements, as described in the Form 8-K of the Company dated April 17, 2017. The misstatements that caused the Company to conclude that its financial statements and other financial information for the Non-Reliance Periods should not be relied upon were related to matters that were initially identified in late-January 2017 and subsequently reviewed and evaluated. The Company is soliciting consents from holders of each series of Notes to extend the deadline for delivery of certain financial information and to waive through and until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 15, 2017 (such time and date, the "Waiver Date"), any default or event of default that occurred, is continuing or may occur under the indentures under which the Notes were issued (and its consequences) in connection with any failure to timely file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or to timely furnish to the relevant trustees pursuant to the indentures, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (the "Fiscal Year 2016 Failure to File"). If the Company does not file the Annual Report on Form 10-K and fails to obtain the waivers requested pursuant to the consent solicitations, in each case on or before (i) May 16, 2017, with respect to the 7.250% Senior Notes due 2018, (ii) May 19, 2017, with respect to the 6.500% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020, and (iii) June 2, 2017, with respect to the 6.375% Subordinated Notes due 2023, an event of default would arise under the respective series of Notes and, among the remedies available to the noteholders, would be the right to accelerate the payment of the Company's obligations upon notice from the trustee or holders of 25% of the applicable Notes. Each consent solicitation will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 5, 2017 unless extended or earlier terminated (such time and date, as the same may be extended or earlier terminated with respect to a consent solicitation, the "Expiration Date"). Subject to the terms and conditions of the consent solicitations set forth in the consent solicitation statement, dated as of May 1, 2017, the Company is offering to pay to each holder of Notes as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 28, 2017, a cash payment equal to $2.50 for each $1,000 aggregate principal amount of such holder's Notes (the "Consent Fee") in respect of which the holder validly delivers (and does not validly revoke) a consent prior to the Expiration Date, provided that the Company receives and accepts the requisite consents for all series of Notes. If, at any time prior to the market open on May 8, 2017, we file with the SEC the 2016 Form 10-K and we terminate the consent solicitations, we expect to pay to each holder of each series of Notes who has delivered (and not revoked) a valid and duly executed consent prior to the Expiration Date a cash payment, in lieu of the Consent Fee, equal to $1.00 for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes for which such Holder delivered its Consent (the "Consent Termination Fee"). The Company will not be obligated to pay and no holder will be due the Consent Fee in respect of a particular consent solicitation if the Company does not receive the requisite consents for each series of Notes prior to the applicable Expiration Date or does not subsequently accept the requisite consents, such consent solicitation is terminated for any reason before the applicable Expiration Date, the requisite consents with respect to such consent solicitation are not obtained prior to the applicable Expiration Date or if the other conditions to such consent solicitation are not satisfied or waived. Adoption of the waivers for a particular series of Notes requires the consent of holders in respect of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series. The consent solicitations are being made to holders of record of the Notes as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 28, 2017. If the requisite consents are received and accepted with respect to a particular series of Notes, the waivers will bind all holders of such series of Notes, including non-consenting holders of such series of Notes. Holders of Notes who do not deliver consents prior to the Expiration Date of the applicable consent solicitation will not receive either the Consent Fee or the Consent Termination Fee. For a complete statement of the terms and conditions of the consent solicitations, holders of the Notes should refer to the consent solicitation statement, dated as of May 1, 2017, and the related consent form. Such conditions to the consent solicitations are for the sole benefit of the Company, and may be waived by the Company at any time as described in the consent solicitation statement. The Company may terminate, extend or amend all, or any, of the consent solicitations at any time. As disclosed in the Form 8-K of the Company dated as of April 24, 2017, the Company has already obtained (i) an extension of the deadlines for the delivery of certain financial information and (ii) waivers of certain defaults, in each case under its secured Credit Agreement, dated as of June 18, 2015 (as amended or otherwise modified from time to time), among the Company, the several lenders from time to time party thereto, the administrative agents party thereto and certain other agents and arrangers. The Company has engaged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to act as Solicitation Agent in connection with the consent solicitations. Questions regarding the consent solicitations may be directed to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Attention: Liability Management Group, at (866) 834-4666 (toll free) or (212) 834-4811/(212) 270-0844 (collect). D.F.

This announcement is not an offer to purchase, a solicitation of an offer to purchase, or a solicitation of consents with respect to any securities, including the Notes. The consent solicitations are being made solely by the consent solicitation statement and the related consent form and are subject to the terms and conditions stated therein. The consent solicitations are not being made to, and the consents are not being solicited from, holders of Notes in any jurisdiction in which it is unlawful to make such consent solicitations or grant such consents.

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 29, 2017 12:25pm   Comments Share: This weekend's Barron's cover story takes a look at one iconic industrial that may be well positioned for a Trump bump. Other featured articles offer the prospects for stocks that could benefit from tax reform and a personal care company that is a potential takeover target. The outlook for a renewables-focused utility and a struggling restaurant operator are also examined. "Caterpillar Stock Revs Up," the cover story by Jack Hough, takes a look at how, after a series of ill-timed acquisitions and a collapse in commodity prices, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) is back on track for higher profits and a rising stock price. See why Barron's believes that perhaps no company in the United States is better positioned for the prospects for infrastructure and tax reform. In "Under Trump Tax Plan, Banks, Restaurants, MLPs Could Win Big," part of a Barron's review of the president's tax reform proposals, Andrew Bary suggests that lower tax rates would be a boon for many companies with a domestic focus, including Anthem Inc (NYSE: ANTM), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.A). David Englander's "Edgewell Personal Care Could Attract Buyer With Deep Pockets" makes a case that shares of this consumer products company look like a bargain after the recent retreat, and its Schick shaving business has room to grow. Plus, Edgewell Personal Care Co (NYSE: EPC) could be an enticing acquisition target for a larger player such as Unilever plc (NYSE: UL). See also: What Donald Trump And Warren Buffett Have In Common The largest regulated utility in Florida has a strong cash-flow profile, attractive earnings and dividend growth, and an unmatched renewables business that sets it apart from peers, according to "NextEra: Steady Growth and a Rising Dividend" by Lawrence C. Strauss. Can shares of NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE: NEE) see as much as a 20 percent return over the next year? In Jack Hough's follow-up article, "Chipotle's 18% Gain Is Giving Us Indigestion," see why Barron's earlier this year cautioned that Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) stock could have further to fall and why investors still should stay away from it even though same-store sales jumped more than expected in the first quarter. The company also announced at recent data breach. Also in this week's Barron's: An exclusive Barron's poll of Wall Street's favorite sectors The good, the bad and the dumb of the president's tax plan Some property plays in an aging bull market Whether fiber optic stocks are back Whether the proliferation of data and technology is a boon or bane for investors An alternate reality for income taxes Whether tech giants are good payout plays The Nasdaq at 6000 means bubble talk is back Why usage of mobile devices is skyrocketing At the time of this writing, the author had no position in the mentioned equities.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Alere Inc. Announces Commencement of Consent Solicitations for Alere Inc.’s Notes WALTHAM, Mass., May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Alere Inc. (NYSE: ALR) (the "Company") announced today the commencement of consent solicitations relating to the Company's 6.500% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020, 6.375% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2023 and 7.250% Senior Notes due 2018 (collectively, the "Notes"). As disclosed in the Form 8-K of the Company dated March 15, 2017 and Form 12b-25 dated March 1, 2017, the Company was unable to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (the "2016 Form 10-K") by March 16, 2017 (the extension period provided under Rule 12b-25) because it is continuing to review certain aspects of revenue recognition at its South Korean and Japanese locations, including inappropriate conduct at the Company's subsidiary in South Korea, Standard Diagnostics, Inc.  The Company will not be able to file its 2016 Form 10-K until this review of revenue recognition at its South Korean and Japanese locations is completed. The Company will file the 2016 Form 10-K as soon as practicable. On April 12, 2017, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, after considering the recommendations of management, concluded that the Company's financial statements and other financial data as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for each of the years ended December 31, 2015,  2014 and 2013, and for each of the quarterly and year-to-date periods in 2015 and the first three quarterly and year-to-date periods in 2016 (collectively, the "Non-Reliance Periods") should not be relied upon because of certain misstatements, as described in the Form 8-K of the Company dated April 17, 2017. The misstatements that caused the Company to conclude that its financial statements and other financial information for the Non-Reliance Periods should not be relied upon were related to matters that were initially identified in late-January 2017 and subsequently reviewed and evaluated. The Company is soliciting consents from holders of each series of Notes to extend the deadline for delivery of certain financial information and to waive through and until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 15, 2017 (such time and date, the "Waiver Date"), any default or event of default that occurred, is continuing or may occur under the indentures under which the Notes were issued (and its consequences) in connection with any failure to timely file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or to timely furnish to the relevant trustees pursuant to the indentures, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (the "Fiscal Year 2016 Failure to File"). If the Company does not file the Annual Report on Form 10-K and fails to obtain the waivers requested pursuant to the consent solicitations, in each case on or before (i) May 16, 2017, with respect to the 7.250% Senior Notes due 2018, (ii) May 19, 2017, with respect to the 6.500% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020, and (iii) June 2, 2017, with respect to the 6.375% Subordinated Notes due 2023, an event of default would arise under the respective series of Notes and, among the remedies available to the noteholders, would be the right to accelerate the payment of the Company's obligations upon notice from the trustee or holders of 25% of the applicable Notes. Each consent solicitation will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 5, 2017 unless extended or earlier terminated (such time and date, as the same may be extended or earlier terminated with respect to a consent solicitation, the "Expiration Date"). Subject to the terms and conditions of the consent solicitations set forth in the consent solicitation statement, dated as of May 1, 2017, the Company is offering to pay to each holder of Notes as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 28, 2017, a cash payment equal to $2.50 for each $1,000 aggregate principal amount of such holder's Notes (the "Consent Fee") in respect of which the holder validly delivers (and does not validly revoke) a consent prior to the Expiration Date, provided that the Company receives and accepts the requisite consents for all series of Notes. If, at any time prior to the market open on May 8, 2017, we file with the SEC the 2016 Form 10-K and we terminate the consent solicitations, we expect to pay to each holder of each series of Notes who has delivered (and not revoked) a valid and duly executed consent prior to the Expiration Date a cash payment, in lieu of the Consent Fee, equal to $1.00 for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes for which such Holder delivered its Consent (the "Consent Termination Fee"). The Company will not be obligated to pay and no holder will be due the Consent Fee in respect of a particular consent solicitation if the Company does not receive the requisite consents for each series of Notes prior to the applicable Expiration Date or does not subsequently accept the requisite consents, such consent solicitation is terminated for any reason before the applicable Expiration Date, the requisite consents with respect to such consent solicitation are not obtained prior to the applicable Expiration Date or if the other conditions to such consent solicitation are not satisfied or waived. Adoption of the waivers for a particular series of Notes requires the consent of holders in respect of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series. The consent solicitations are being made to holders of record of the Notes as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 28, 2017. If the requisite consents are received and accepted with respect to a particular series of Notes, the waivers will bind all holders of such series of Notes, including non-consenting holders of such series of Notes. Holders of Notes who do not deliver consents prior to the Expiration Date of the applicable consent solicitation will not receive either the Consent Fee or the Consent Termination Fee. For a complete statement of the terms and conditions of the consent solicitations, holders of the Notes should refer to the consent solicitation statement, dated as of May 1, 2017, and the related consent form. Such conditions to the consent solicitations are for the sole benefit of the Company, and may be waived by the Company at any time as described in the consent solicitation statement. The Company may terminate, extend or amend all, or any, of the consent solicitations at any time. As disclosed in the Form 8-K of the Company dated as of April 24, 2017, the Company has already obtained (i) an extension of the deadlines for the delivery of certain financial information and (ii) waivers of certain defaults, in each case under its secured Credit Agreement, dated as of June 18, 2015 (as amended or otherwise modified from time to time), among the Company, the several lenders from time to time party thereto, the administrative agents party thereto and certain other agents and arrangers.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Alere Inc. Announces Commencement of Consent Solicitations for Alere Inc.’s Notes WALTHAM, Mass., May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Alere Inc. (NYSE: ALR) (the „Company„) announced today the commencement of consent solicitations relating to the Company’s 6.500% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020, 6.375% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2023 and 7.250% Senior Notes due 2018 (collectively, the „Notes„). As disclosed in the Form 8-K of the Company dated March 15, 2017 and Form 12b-25 dated March 1, 2017, the Company was unable to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (the „2016 Form 10-K„) by March 16, 2017 (the extension period provided under Rule 12b-25) because it is continuing to review certain aspects of revenue recognition at its South Korean and Japanese locations, including inappropriate conduct at the Company’s subsidiary in South Korea, Standard Diagnostics, Inc.  The Company will not be able to file its 2016 Form 10-K until this review of revenue recognition at its South Korean and Japanese locations is completed. The Company will file the 2016 Form 10-K as soon as practicable. On April 12, 2017, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, after considering the recommendations of management, concluded that the Company’s financial statements and other financial data as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for each of the years ended December 31, 2015,  2014 and 2013, and for each of the quarterly and year-to-date periods in 2015 and the first three quarterly and year-to-date periods in 2016 (collectively, the „Non-Reliance Periods„) should not be relied upon because of certain misstatements, as described in the Form 8-K of the Company dated April 17, 2017. The misstatements that caused the Company to conclude that its financial statements and other financial information for the Non-Reliance Periods should not be relied upon were related to matters that were initially identified in late-January 2017 and subsequently reviewed and evaluated. The Company is soliciting consents from holders of each series of Notes to extend the deadline for delivery of certain financial information and to waive through and until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 15, 2017 (such time and date, the „Waiver Date„), any default or event of default that occurred, is continuing or may occur under the indentures under which the Notes were issued (and its consequences) in connection with any failure to timely file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the „SEC„) or to timely furnish to the relevant trustees pursuant to the indentures, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (the „Fiscal Year 2016 Failure to File„). If the Company does not file the Annual Report on Form 10-K and fails to obtain the waivers requested pursuant to the consent solicitations, in each case on or before (i) May 16, 2017, with respect to the 7.250% Senior Notes due 2018, (ii) May 19, 2017, with respect to the 6.500% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020, and (iii) June 2, 2017, with respect to the 6.375% Subordinated Notes due 2023, an event of default would arise under the respective series of Notes and, among the remedies available to the noteholders, would be the right to accelerate the payment of the Company’s obligations upon notice from the trustee or holders of 25% of the applicable Notes. Each consent solicitation will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 5, 2017 unless extended or earlier terminated (such time and date, as the same may be extended or earlier terminated with respect to a consent solicitation, the „Expiration Date„). Subject to the terms and conditions of the consent solicitations set forth in the consent solicitation statement, dated as of May 1, 2017, the Company is offering to pay to each holder of Notes as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 28, 2017, a cash payment equal to $2.50 for each $1,000 aggregate principal amount of such holder’s Notes (the „Consent Fee„) in respect of which the holder validly delivers (and does not validly revoke) a consent prior to the Expiration Date, provided that the Company receives and accepts the requisite consents for all series of Notes. If, at any time prior to the market open on May 8, 2017, we file with the SEC the 2016 Form 10-K and we terminate the consent solicitations, we expect to pay to each holder of each series of Notes who has delivered (and not revoked) a valid and duly executed consent prior to the Expiration Date a cash payment, in lieu of the Consent Fee, equal to $1.00 for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes for which such Holder delivered its Consent (the „Consent Termination Fee„). The Company will not be obligated to pay and no holder will be due the Consent Fee in respect of a particular consent solicitation if the Company does not receive the requisite consents for each series of Notes prior to the applicable Expiration Date or does not subsequently accept the requisite consents, such consent solicitation is terminated for any reason before the applicable Expiration Date, the requisite consents with respect to such consent solicitation are not obtained prior to the applicable Expiration Date or if the other conditions to such consent solicitation are not satisfied or waived. Adoption of the waivers for a particular series of Notes requires the consent of holders in respect of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series. The consent solicitations are being made to holders of record of the Notes as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 28, 2017. If the requisite consents are received and accepted with respect to a particular series of Notes, the waivers will bind all holders of such series of Notes, including non-consenting holders of such series of Notes. Holders of Notes who do not deliver consents prior to the Expiration Date of the applicable consent solicitation will not receive either the Consent Fee or the Consent Termination Fee. For a complete statement of the terms and conditions of the consent solicitations, holders of the Notes should refer to the consent solicitation statement, dated as of May 1, 2017, and the related consent form. Such conditions to the consent solicitations are for the sole benefit of the Company, and may be waived by the Company at any time as described in the consent solicitation statement. The Company may terminate, extend or amend all, or any, of the consent solicitations at any time. As disclosed in the Form 8-K of the Company dated as of April 24, 2017, the Company has already obtained (i) an extension of the deadlines for the delivery of certain financial information and (ii) waivers of certain defaults, in each case under its secured Credit Agreement, dated as of June 18, 2015 (as amended or otherwise modified from time to time), among the Company, the several lenders from time to time party thereto, the administrative agents party thereto and certain other agents and arrangers.

Woolery will lead a team advising clients on a wide variety of corporate issues, including activist defense and complex transactions. "We are extremely pleased to strengthen our corporate capabilities and opportunities in New York with a senior deal-maker, strategic advisor and board counselor of Jim's caliber," said Robert D. Hays, chairman of King & Spalding. "The addition of Jim to the firm is consistent with our strategy to increase our corporate presence in New York. Jim's legal, investment banking and hedge fund experience and extensive network of relationships with CEOs, directors and general counsel provide him with insight and tactics few others have. Our public company clients will welcome Jim's innovative approach to preventing and defending against activists." "I am very pleased to be joining King & Spalding, which is a firm that has tremendous growth momentum, a strong global platform and a commitment to client service that matches mine," said Woolery. "It also has a true entrepreneurial energy and in my extensive conversations with the firm -- with Robert and other partners as well as associates -- I was impressed with both the people and the firm's long-term commitment to its corporate strategy. I see an exciting opportunity to leverage my experience to serve K&S's impressive list of clients and establish a truly unique and world-class practice in New York." Prior to joining King & Spalding, Woolery was a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, where he also established and led Cravath's Business Development and Strategy Group. After 17 years at Cravath, Woolery became co-head of North American Mergers and Acquisitions at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. In 2013, Woolery joined Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft as deputy chairman and co-chair of the firm's Corporate Department, where he advised numerous companies on a variety of corporate issues, and was responsible for business development, strategy and external relations. Most recently, Woolery was a founder and managing partner of Hudson Executive Capital, an investment firm established with numerous public CEO partners and investors that sought to create value in U.S. middle-market companies through constructive shareholder engagement. Over his career, Woolery has advised on over $750 billion in transactions. His clients ranged from the world's largest corporate and financial institutions to middle-market companies all looking to grow their business and maximize shareholder value. Notable transactions on which Woolery has worked include two of the biggest leveraged buyouts in history: the acquisition of Dell by Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners and the buyout of TXU Corp. by KKR and TPG. He also has deep experience advising boards in takeover and activist situations, including Air Products' public tender offer and proxy fight for Airgas and Clorox's successful defense against Carl Icahn. Woolery has been one of the leading voices on improving the dialogue between shareholders and boards. He was a co-founder of the Shareholder-Director Exchange (SDX), an initiative comprised of leading independent directors and representatives from some of the largest and most influential long-term institutional investors. This initiative created the SDX Protocol, a set of guidelines to provide a framework for shareholder-director engagements. At King & Spalding, Woolery will help lead the firm's Lead Director Network, which brings together a select group of lead directors, presiding directors and non-executive chairmen from many of America's leading companies for private discussions about how to improve the performance of their corporations and earn the trust of their shareholders through more director and long-term shareholder engagement.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association was also an initial lender for the HIT REIT Term Loan. The seven hotels in the Summit Portfolio consist of 651 keys and were acquired for an aggregate purchase price of $66.8 million. All the properties in the portfolio have long term franchise agreements with one of the following brands: Marriott International (Courtyard, Residence Inn and Fairfield Inn), Hilton Hotels (Homewood Suites) or IHG (Staybridge Suites). The properties are located in Germantown, Tennessee and Ridgeland, Mississippi. The transaction increases the Company’s lodging portfolio to 148 hotels totaling 17,844 keys across 33 states. Net proceeds (following the payment of fees and expenses) from the HIT REIT Mortgage Loan were used by HIT REIT to refinance the EQTY 2014-INNS loan, which, as of March 31, 2017, had an aggregate principal balance of $895.4 million, was collateralized by 95 of the Company’s hotel properties, and had a final maturity date of May 2019.

In addition, we are pleased to close on this portfolio of seven premium-branded select-service hotels from Summit.” Additional details regarding these refinancings and the Summit Portfolio acquisition will be available in the Company’s Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by May 3, 2017.

Israel Conley, 20, was arrested Aug. 19 on more than a dozen charges of fraud and larceny. The Boca Raton man had been working at the branch at 240 East Palmetto Park Road for about two months when he allegedly started withdrawing thousands of dollars from customer accounts in July, the report said. His victims were mostly elderly customers, ranging from 57-years-old to 99-years-old, police said. On August 16, the branch manager alerted a corporate investigator about some suspicious transactions she came across during an audit. Conley had processed $36,800 in withdrawls, but the customer withdrawl slips were written in the same handwriting, according to the report. It turns out he forged customer signatures to withdraw large lumps of money from at least six accounts, including a hair extension business, according to the report. He then deposited the stolen cash into his own account at the bank. On Aug. 17, Conley reportedly admitted to a corporate investigator that he had embezzled at least $31,500. He later told police that he took the money to pay his personal bills, the report states. He told them he chose his victims randomly. The branch manager and a JP Morgan Chase spokeswoman declined Wednesday to comment on the case. The victims' accounts have been reimbursed, the report states. Conley was released from the Palm Beach County jail Saturday on a $20,000 bond, jail records show. He has no previous criminal history in Florida, according to state records.

It was also just announced that Barack Obama, following in the well-heeled footsteps of Bill and Hillary Clinton, will be paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for giving a speech on behalf of a Wall Street firm. Anyone who thinks these two facts aren’t connected isn’t paying attention. Obama’s payday reflects a longstanding pattern of behavior from Democratic leaders: Talk like liberals, govern from the center, and make a lot of money once you’re out of office. Their policies better than Trump’s and the GOP’s, but that adds even more bite to that poll’s other major finding: Democrats are viewed as even more out of touch with everyday concerns than Trump, a twitter-happy billionaire president who weekends at his palatial estate. Democrats need a better message, to be sure. But they also need messengers who will walk the walk after they have talked the talk. No Surprise Barack Obama’s $400,000 speaking fee, from investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, shouldn’t surprise anyone. Obama courted Wall Street leaders like Jamie Dimon, CEO of scandal-plagued serial lawbreaker JP Morgan Chase, until it became politically unfeasible to do so during his re-election campaign. (Dimon was once described as Obama’s “favorite banker.”) In 2009, after Wall Street’s criminality shattered the economy and ruined millions of American lives, Obama famously told Wall Street’s top CEOs, “My administration is the only thing between you and the pitchforks.” In the years that followed, Obama’s Justice Department failed to prosecute a single bank executive for that criminality. Even when regulators identified the individuals responsible for criminal behavior, as they did with GE Capital, the Justice Department failed to follow up. For his part, Obama appointed the CEO of GE Capital’s parent corporation to a prestigious economic position. Obama chose Wall Street-friendly figures Eric Holder and Tim Geithner to lead the Justice and Treasury departments, respectively. He then followed Bill Clinton’s lead by overseeing a revolving door between his administration and Wall Street’s biggest banks (most notably Citigroup, the banking behemoth forged in a merger pushed by top appointees in the Clinton Administration). As the nation has learned under Donald Trump, a president’s pronouncements can have a powerful effect on legal actions. When Obama pre-emptively declared that Wall Street executives had not broken the law – an opinion not shared by experts like William K. Black, Jr. – that very possibly had a chilling effect on prosecutors in the field. It certainly sent a signal to lower-level appointees in his own Justice Department. The Victims It may be overly cynical to see these large fees as payment for services rendered, but Obama’s record on these matters – like Bill Clinton’s before him – certainly didn’t help that perception. At best, these speeches reflect the insular worldview of privileged insiders who neither understand nor fully empathize with the victims of lawbreaking bankers. Dozens of those victims reached out to me in 2010, when I first began writing on the subject, and their emails were heartbreaking. (Their plight was well-documented in David Dayen’s book, Chain of Title.) Millions of Americans have either been defrauded by an American bank or know someone who has been. They have seen the Democratic Party’s three most prominent leaders – two ex-presidents, along with a former First Lady, senator, two-time presidential candidate and former Secretary of State – earn millions by hobnobbing with the same bankers who ruined their lives, their friends’ lives, or their communities. The Sponsor Now, Barack Obama is joining their ranks. Cantor Fitzgerald suffered unspeakable tragedy on 9/11. But it has also been fined for a number of violations of the law. One fine was levied for selling unregistered shares and failing to check for money laundering. Another was aiding and abetting fraud. Another, record-setting fine was imposed on a Cantor subsidiary for illegal betting in Las Vegas. Then there’s the speech’s setting, which is typically described as Cantor’s “annual healthcare conference.” It is a healthcare investment conference, where wealthy investors and for-profit healthcare corporations mingle in pursuit of mutually advantageous deals. The press release for the first conference explains: “The full-day conference will provide institutional investors with access to over 70 public and private healthcare companies, and an opportunity to explore investment opportunities and learn about current major healthcare topics.” At a time when the Affordable Care Act is fighting for its life, Obama will be speaking to a group of business people, including pharmaceutical corporations, who have gathered to make money from our nation’s beleaguered healthcare economy. For-profit healthcare isn’t the solution to our health crisis: it’s a principal cause. The Loyalists And yet, many Democratic loyalists refuse to see a connection between behavior like this and the Democratic Party’s low polling numbers and electoral failures at all levels. A typical exchange: The New Republic’s Brian Beutler responded to criticism of Obama’s speaking fee and a recent publicity campaign for Chelsea Clinton by tweeting, “Chelsea shouldn’t run, Obama shouldn’t buckrake, the obsession with them as the Trumps set up a bribery fund is giving me campaign PTSD.” That is consistent with the often-expressed opinion that Democrats shouldn’t “re-litigate” the 2016 Democratic primary race. Nobody wants to induce needless trauma. And yet, however painful it may be for some to consider, the Democrats have a problem: fully two-thirds of the American people feel that they don’t understand their problems. Many Democrats remain fiercely loyal to Obama and the Clintons, and they can be surprisingly protective of their leaders. They need to understand that these high-dollar Wall Street paydays undermine confidence in their party. They alienate “persuadables” and make it less likely that the Democratic base will show up to vote in sufficient numbers. (So does the appearance that elected office is a familial privilege, but that is a topic for another day.) It is not “obsession” that leads people to criticize this behavior, pace Beutler, but a desire to stop Trump’s GOP and the recognized need for better policy. Like it or not, the behavior of top Democrats reflects on the party, and their coziness with the wealthy limits their ability to propose truly transformative economic ideas. The Alternative What’s to be done? The solution is already visible to all those who care to see: Run candidates who have no interest in flattering the ultra-wealthy or becoming wealthy themselves. Bernie Sanders is the most conspicuous example – there is a reason why he’s the most popular politician in the country today – but there are others. Two members of Congress, Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, are activists who take a movement-oriented approach to elected office. (Here’s a video interview on that subject with Rep. Jayapal.) The citizen-candidates who came forward during the recent Rise Up conference (shown here with Sen. Bernie Sanders), together with those recruited by Our Revolution and other grassroots groups, represent a new wave of politician/activists. Candidates like these send a clear signal to voters: We are not career politicians, we don’t see elected office as a stepping stone to wealth, and know that it will take a deep political transformation to meet the everyday concerns of most Americans. _______ About author Richard (RJ) Eskow, a consultant and writer, is a Senior Fellow with the Campaign for America's Future.

He ran for president campaigning on a promise to renogotiate trade agreements like NAFTA. As President he supported policies that contradicted those views and met with the approval of those who are paying him now. The $400K is a message to the Democratic party's established order and current office holders. The message is: "Prevent the revolutionaries from taking over the party and you'll be taken care of". But I think they're going to fail in that. Their tactics are adding fuel to the revolution. Successful democrats in the future will be those who invite the enmity of the oligarchs. I'm sure that Bernie Sanders would be glad to deliver a speech to Wall Street firms at no charge. But I don't think they'll like what he would say to them.

The most accurate description of Obama by far was Cornel West's scathing statement that our pal Barry was nothing more than a “Rockefeller Republican in blackface”. Although Obama talks a good game, and appealed to many because he looked like a black man who might "get it" and want to help those other than himself and the wealthy, he was/is nothing more than a dark skinned shill for the ultra-rich white class. The myth that Obama was raised as a poor black child is belied by the fact that from 5th grade until his high school graduation he attended school at Punahou in Hawaii - one of the most exclusive schools in the country, and the place where many US military officers and other elites in Hawaii send their kids for education. So it should be no surprise that he is cashing in so big and so quickly. If he cared about the optics of this at all, now that there's been a public outcry he would announce that he is going to donate his entire speaking fee to the families of Cantor Fitzgerald employees who were lost in the 9/11 attack. But don't hold your breath waiting for that... _______ Former leader of Freedonia, rufus t. firefly occasionally stoops to use his vast political experience to comment on current events to anyone foolish enough to listen.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Tuesday May 2, 2017 Opinion Larger / SmallerNight Mode We're slaves to new products, but no closer to happiness RICHARD GRUNER 14 Sep 2012, 7:08 p.m. Economic wheels must turn but how far to go until we feel the burn? We're slaves to new products, but no closer to happiness Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit OPINION You would like the new iPhone 5. That's not even a question. You would. Why wouldn't you? It is new, probably faster, and definitely shinier than your old phone. When the new model is released in Australia on September 21, vast numbers of people are expected to line up outside Apple stores. Some might even sleep out on the pavement the night before. Breakfast TV programs will dispatch journalists to breathlessly report the phenomenon. But at what cost? Perhaps it is time for us to question our perpetual product cravings, and accept that "old", "used", and even "broken" are not dirty words. Only 75 years ago we consumed half as much as we do today, and we were no less happy because of it. What (or who) is it that makes us crave new products and queue up outside the store hours, and even days, before their launch?  Our past experiences of new products - in-your-face advertising, clever marketing techniques, word-of-mouth ploys, and so on - certainly play a role in our behaviour. But that may be just part of the picture. A glimpse at the bigger picture reveals that our product cravings are as essential to our economy's stability as jobs, exports and interest rates. Global financial services company JPMorgan Chase recently estimated that the release of the iPhone 5 could add up to one-half of a percentage point to the gross domestic product growth rate of the struggling United States economy. And that's just one product! Today's consumer culture has been manufactured and composed in response to the very real need for ever higher levels of consumption of millions of products. We now even have the concept of ''planned obsolescence'', where companies intentionally design products with a limited shelf life. This forces customers to buy the same (or similar) product again in the future. (You might consider it the technological equivalent of shampoo companies urging users to ''rinse and repeat''.) Some question the ethics of intentionally designing a product to be obsolete within just a few years - and long for the time when things were built to last - but the economic benefits are undeniable. It's all part of what drives ''infinite growth''. And it's why a lot of companies spend as much on advertising as they do on actually creating new products. Companies have created this perceived ''need'' in their customers. And, conveniently, they are right there to meet these needs through constant innovation. Businesses cannot continue to offer the same unchanged product for very long if they wish to make a profit and continue to grow. Does that mean that our hunger for product innovations is bad? On one hand, it is the lifeblood of companies, our economy and society at large. The world as we know it might just collapse if we stopped designing, making, buying and selling snazzy new products. (At least, so we're told.) On the other hand, what's at stake here might be nothing less than our happiness - a deep happiness that goes well beyond the short-lived thrill of bringing home a new phone, car or computer. For most of us, our sense of prosperity does not depend on owning the latest gadgets. Neither does it depend on other success measures we tend to apply to our lives, such as outperforming a competitor, or having the smartest and fastest kid at school. As contemporary Swiss-born philosopher Alain de Botton tells us, "wealth does not involve having many things". It is more about having what we long for. Wealth is relative to desire. It is not absolute. Every time we seek something we cannot afford, we grow poorer, regardless of how much money we have. And every time we stop our hunt for the new and feel satisfied with what we have, we can be counted as rich. In other words, we are rich in proportion to the things we can do without. Political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau knew this in the late 1700s - before cars, computers and credit cards - when he said: "Our souls rarely articulate what they must have in order to be satisfied, or when they do mumble something, their commands are likely to be misfounded or contradictory." Perhaps it is time for us to distinguish between what we want, what companies tell us we need, and what we really need. And that's something that no shiny new product, not even one carrying a fruity logo, can do for you. Dr Richard L. Gruner is a marketing research fellow at the University of Melbourne's faculty of business and economics.

(File photo: Bill Klotz) Regional banks waiting on Trump era promise By: Bloomberg News April 27, 2017 1:10 pm 0 For regional banks across the U.S., the “Trump bump” hasn’t yet translated into business. Bank stocks have climbed since Donald Trump was elected president as investors bet his pro-growth agenda and rising interest rates would help lenders generate huge profits. But this month, executives at some of the country’s largest regional banks said customers, especially corporations and small businesses, are instead waiting for details on the new administration’s proposals and results before seeking financing for expansion. Total loans at the 15 largest U.S. regional banks declined by about $10 billion to $1.73 trillion in the first quarter, compared with the previous three-month period, the first such drop in four years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. All but two of those banks missed analysts’ estimates for total loans, as a slump in commercial and industrial lending sapped growth. “The optimism and the willingness is there, but it has not yet translated into actions or behaviors,” Beth Mooney, chief executive officer of KeyCorp, said of the Cleveland-based bank’s small and middle-market business clients. “We did not see ‘flip the switch’ sort of behavior that led to loan demand or making different capital decisions or investment decisions.” Their view from Main Street contrasts with Wall Street, where global investment banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley announced jumps in earnings from fixed-income trading units that help big investors speculate on bonds, currencies and commodities. The irony is that some types of businesses broadly criticized during the presidential campaign are now profiting most. The last of the 15 largest regional banks reported quarterly results Wednesday. Some said other developments also weighed on lending. They cited instances of clients turning directly to investors for financing, tapping into their optimism for growth under Trump. And many traditional retailers are struggling in the internet era. Within commercial lending, big corporations have been reticent to take out new loans, instead tapping capital markets for their needs, said Terry Dolan, chief financial officer at Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, the nation’s largest regional bank. “We saw a number of our bigger customers go to the bond markets and issue debt and take out credit, so that was a factor” weighing on loan growth in the first quarter, said Citizens Financial Group Inc. CEO  Bruce Van Saun, whose firm is based in Providence, Rhode Island. “The nice corollary to that is that our capital-markets fees are exploding.” Manufacturers in the rust belt are drawing unprecedented inquiries from buyers overseas, said Stephen Steinour, CEO of Huntington Bancshares Inc., Ohio’s third-largest lender. Still, he said, “there’s an expectation that there’s going to be policy changes and those policy changes might have ramifications, so there’s a little bit of a wait and see going on here.” Many regional lenders began to break out their exposure to retailers and the underlying real estate that supports it after investors and analysts voiced concerns about credit quality. The pace of store closings this year is already ahead of 2008, the most recent peak, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse Group AG. “Retail is an industry that’s going through a secular change” as more people shop online, said Darren King, M&T Bank Corp.’s CFO. “How far it will go, and how fast it will go, and what the knock-on effects are remain to be seen.” Share this: Print Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Google 1:10 pm Thu, April 27, 2017 Finance & Commerce Bloomberg News Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Chris FrancescaniAlex Dobuzinskis A broad coalition of groups behind the events also took aim at various other Trump policies they saw as discriminatory or xenophobic, including his bid, so far blocked by the courts, to ban travellers from several Muslim countries and temporarily turn away all refugees. Photo: AFP New York/Los Angeles: Labour unions and civil rights groups staged May Day rallies in several U.S. cities on Monday to denounce President Donald Trump’s get-tough policy on immigration, a crackdown they said preys on vulnerable workers in some of America’s lowest-paying jobs. Protests and marches challenging Trump’s efforts at stepping up the deportation of illegal immigrants drew crowds by the thousands to the streets of New York, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco, with smaller gatherings popping up across the country. A broad coalition of groups behind the events also took aim at various other Trump policies they saw as discriminatory or xenophobic, including his bid, so far blocked by the courts, to ban travellers from several Muslim countries and temporarily turn away all refugees. But the primary impetus cited by civil liberties and labour activists was Trump’s strict new immigration enforcement policy—falling most heavily on undocumented workers who toil in low-paying, non-unionized sectors such as fast-food, hospitality, child care and agriculture. A May Day gathering grew unruly in Portland, Oregon, where a group of black-clad protesters roamed downtown streets in the late afternoon, setting fires, breaking storefront windows, throwing projectiles and vandalizing a police cruiser. Police, referring to the perpetrators as “anarchists,” said they made more than two dozen arrests. Nine people were also arrested in Olympia, the state capital in Washington, where protesters threw rocks, bottles and pepper-spray at police officers and broke the windows of downtown businesses, according to a Fox affiliate. Rallies elsewhere across the country were boisterous but mostly orderly, even festive. In some cities, immigrant-run convenience stores and other businesses closed their doors in solidarity with the May Day rallies, and many protesters themselves gave up a day’s wages to make their voices heard. “Money will come back later, but not this opportunity, not this day,” said David Anaya, 44, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, who chose to forfeit the $300 he would have otherwise earned at his job as a welder. He was one of thousands who gathered at MacArthur Park near downtown Los Angeles for what organizers called a show of “resistance, unity and defiance,” then set off on an animated but peaceful march across town to City Hall. A crowd of several thousand also assembled in Washington’s Dupont Circle for a rally ahead of a planned procession to Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House. ‘Not America anymore’ Earlier in the day, 500 protesters marched through midtown Manhattan and rallied in front of offices of Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Twelve were arrested, according to a spokesman for Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group that claims 20,000 members. The two banks were targeted because of their dealings with private companies that have built or manage some immigrant detention centres for the government, according to Jose Lopez, Make the Road New York’s co-director of organizing. “The messaging for today was to stop financing immigrant detention facilities,” Lopez said. May Day, also known as International Workers’ Day, has typically been a quieter affair in the United States than in Europe, where it is a public holiday in many countries. May Day unrest flared on Monday in France and Turkey, where demonstrators clashed with police. The US protests focused on Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration as he presses police agencies around the country to assist federal efforts at rounding up individuals sought for deportation and threatens to withhold federal dollars from “sanctuary cities” that do not cooperate. Retired social worker Christina Reilly Vaccarino, 78, who emigrated from Ireland at age 15 with a green card allowing her to work as a nanny, said she was “disgusted” by Trump’s policies on immigration, taxes and workers’ rights. “I came to America at a time when everyone in Ireland believed that America is so wonderful, so great. And now, after all these years, to experience this? It’s not America anymore,” she said at an afternoon rally in Lower Manhattan. Some Trump supporters said they would also turn out on May Day. Activist Joey Gibson said he and other conservatives would travel to Seattle to defend against what he described as communist and anti-fascist groups who have in the past faced off with police in the evening, after the conclusion of the usually peaceful daytime marches.
