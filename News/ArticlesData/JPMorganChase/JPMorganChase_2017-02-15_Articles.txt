By Mike Cohen and Renee Bonorchis. Added by Agency Staff on 16 February 2017. Saved under News Tweet A South African antitrust regulator has said it found that more than a dozen international and local banks colluded to manipulate foreign-currency trades and recommended some of them be fined 10% of their annual turnover. The Competition Commission identified lenders including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase & Co, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse Group, HSBC Holdings and Nomura Holdings as having participated in price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand since at least 2007. It referred the case to an antitrust tribunal, concluding an investigation that began in 2015. “The respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times,” the commission said in an e-mailed statement on Wednesday. “They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives.” The outcome of the investigation comes as President Jacob Zuma and his governing ANC step up pressure to break the dominance of South Africa’s largest lenders and improve access to the economy that still alludes many of the country’s black majority almost 23 years since the end of apartheid. South Africa’s efforts to better regulate foreign-exchange trading follows a price-rigging scandal in which some of the world’s largest banks agreed to pay fines and plead guilty to conspiring to manipulate markets after being accused of using online chat rooms to collude. “We need to establish if it’s a rogue trader or if this more widespread,” said Patrice Rassou, head of equities at Sanlam Investment Management in Cape Town. “This could result in fines but the Reserve Bank will ensure that it doesn’t cause disruption in our capital markets.” Bank of America, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, Commerzbank, Macquarie Group, Australia & New Zealand Banking Corp, Standard Bank Group, HSBC and BNP declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Investec said it would cooperate with authorities but was unable to comment further because it didn’t have details of their investigations. Barclays Africa Group also said it would cooperate with the authorities, while noting that the regulator had not sought penalties against it. Credit Suisse said it is looking into the matter. South Africa’s central bank said it viewed the allegations as a serious matter and would allow proceedings to run their course. The tribunal will now notify the banks of the complaint and ask them to respond, Chantelle Benjamin, a spokesman for the body, said by phone. The banks will then file statements and attend a preliminary meeting to set a date for a full hearing, she said. The commission has previously uncovered collusion in the country’s bread and flour industry, among cement producers and by construction companies that bid to build stadiums for the 2010 soccer World Cup. Those involved were forced to pay hefty fines. “Collusive practices must lead to consequences such as termination of the services of key management, executive and nonexecutive directors,” said Asief Mohamed, chief investment officer at Cape Town-based Aeon Investment Management. “The banks, if guilty, will most likely be fined and will have a negative impact on earnings and reputation.”  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 26‘Please call me’ man hits back at Vodacom 10Big four banks’ dominance must end: Zuma 8Set-top box dispute goes to arbitration 7This is how we’re going to fix ICT 7Liquid Telecom’s big plans for Neotel Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

The Competition Commission on Wednesday referred a collusion case to the tribunal for prosecution against 17 banks, including three of South Africa's big banks. The commission said in a statement it has been investigating a case of price-fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand since April 2015. It has now referred the case to the tribunal for prosecution. The banks are Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase & Co, JP Morgan Chase Bank NA, Investec Ltd, Standard New York Securities Inc, HSBC Bank Plc, Standard Chartered Bank, Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd, Commerzbank AG; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Nomura International Plc, Macquarie Bank Limited, ABSA Bank Limited (ABSA), Barclays Capital Inc, Barclays Bank plc (Respondents). The commission is seeking an order from the tribunal declaring that the respondents have contravened the Competition Act. Further, the Commission is seeking an order declaring that 14 of the banks - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase & Co, JP Morgan Chase Bank, Investec, Standard New York Securities, HSBC Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa, Commerzbank; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Nomura International and Macquarie Bank - are liable for the payment of an administrative penalty equal to 10% of their annual turnover.

It further found that the respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times. The commission said traders of the respondents primarily used trading platforms such as the Reuters currency trading platform to carry out their collusive activities. They also used Bloomberg instant messaging system (chatroom), telephone conversation and had meetings to coordinate their bilateral and multilateral collusive trading activities. They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They reached agreements to refrain from trading, taking turns in transacting and by either pulling or holding trading activities on the Reuters currency trading platform. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives. "The referral of this matter to the Tribunal marks a key milestone in this case as it now affords the banks an opportunity to answer for themselves," said Commissioner Tembinkosi Bonakele.

Absa Bank will be spared a stiff penalty by the Competition Tribunal for its part in international forex collusion after it earlier came forward and confessed to the Competition Commission what was going on. Commission spokesperson Sipho Ngwema confirmed to Moneyweb on Thursday night that Absa applied for corporate leniency as whistle blower and that one other bank that he did not name, might admit guilt and enter into an agreement with the Commission. The Commission on Thursday afternoon said in a statement it would proceed to prosecute 17 international banks it alleges were guilty of price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand. Investec, Standard Bank of SA and Absa Bank are among those involved. The CompCom alleges that the practice has been ongoing since 2007 and has referred the matter to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution. The commission is seeking an order that the banks have contravened the Competition Act and want an administrative penalty of 10% of their annual turnover imposed on the banks. The banks accused of collusion are: Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited,  BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase & Co, JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A, Investec Ltd, Standard New York Securities Inc., HSBC Bank Plc, Standard Chartered Bank, Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd, Commerzbank AG; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Nomura International Plc., Macquarie Bank Limited, Absa Bank Limited (Absa), Barclays Capital Inc, Barclays Bank plc. Ngwema said the investigation is a leg of the international investigation into such activities and the Commission was working with other agencies in this regard. Bloomberg reported in January that four banks, Citigroup Inc., Barclays Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Royal Bank of Scotland pleaded guilty in May 2015 to rigging currency rates. “As part of an overall $5.8 billion settlement with multiple regulators, they agreed to pay the roughly $2.5 billion to the (US) Justice department. It was not immediately clear exactly how the local prosecution fits in with this process. Bloomberg reported that the US Justice department “isn’t finished probing global financial markets for collusion after years of investigating currency trading and interest-rate benchmarks that have resulted in more than $4 billion in criminal penalties.” Financial Times reported that global banks have now paid more than $10bn in relation to the forex scandal, exceeding the $9bn paid by a larger group of institutions to settle the Libor rigging claims. Calls have also recently been made in the US for the criminal prosecution of the individual traders involved in the collusion. The South African Competition Commission said in a statement that it found that from at least 2007, “the respondents had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving US dollar/rand currency pair. “Further, the commission found that the respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times. “Traders of the respondents primarily used trading platforms such as the Reuters currency trading platform to carry out their collusive activities. They also used Bloomberg instant messaging system (chatroom), telephone conversation and had meetings to coordinate their bilateral and multilateral collusive trading activities. They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They reached agreements to refrain from trading, taking turns in transacting and by either pulling or holding trading activities on the Reuters currency trading platform.  They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives. “The referral of this matter to the Tribunal marks a key milestone in this case as it now affords the banks an opportunity to answer for themselves,” said commissioner, Tembinkosi Bonakele. Standard Bank declined an invitation to comment. Investec said it will cooperate with the competition authorites. “Unfortunately at this stage we still do not have further detail with respect to the nature of the investigation and are thus not able to comment on the matter,” Investec said in an emailed statement. Absa also said it will continue to co-operate with the Commission and pointed out that that the Competition Commission has not sought any penalties against Absa. In response to the announcement former FNB CEO Michael Jordaan pointed out on Twitter that FirstRand and Nedbank were not among the accused banks.

The Commission said it had been investigating a case of price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand since April 2015. The banks are: Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase and Co, JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A, Investec Ltd, Standard New York Securities Inc., HSBC Bank Plc, Standard Chartered Bank, Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd, Commerzbank AG; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Nomura International Plc., Macquarie Bank Limited, ABSA Bank Limited (ABSA), Barclays Capital Inc, Barclays Bank plc. The Commission said it found that from at least 2007, the banks had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving US Dollar/Rand currency pair. The Commission also found that the banks manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times. According to the Commission, traders of the banks primarily used trading platforms such as the Reuters currency trading platform to carry out their collusive activities. They also used Bloomberg instant messaging system, or chatroom, telephone conversation and had meetings to coordinate their bilateral and multilateral collusive trading activities, the Commission said. They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They reached agreements to refrain from trading, taking turns in transacting and by either pulling or holding trading activities on the Reuters currency trading platform. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives. The Commission is now seeking an order from the Tribunal declaring that the respondents have contravened the Competition Act. Further, the Commission also seeks an order declaring that the banks are liable for the payment of an administrative penalty equal to 10 percent of their annual turnover. "The referral of this matter to the Tribunal marks a key milestone in this case as it now affords the banks an opportunity to answer for themselves," Commissioner Tembinkosi Bonakele said in a statement.

Absa and Standard Bank are named, along with Investec. In a press statement on Wednesday, the Competition Commission of SA announced that it has asked the Competition Tribunal to prosecute 17 banks it alleges were colluding to manipulate the value of the rand. The list includes several major global banks and includes two big South African banks, Standard Bank and Absa, as well as Investec. Below is the full statement, as released by commission spokesperson Sipho Ngwema.

The Commission has been investigating a case of price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand since April 2015.

The Commission found that from at least 2007, the respondents had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving US Dollar / Rand currency pair. Further, the Commission found that the respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times.

They also used Bloomberg instant messaging system (chatroom), telephone conversation and had meetings to coordinate their bilateral and multilateral collusive trading activities. They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They reached agreements to refrain from trading, taking turns in transacting and by either pulling or holding trading activities on the Reuters currency trading platform. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives. The Commission is seeking an order from the Tribunal declaring that the respondents have contravened the Competition Act. Further, the Commission is seeking an order declaring that the Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase & Co, JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A, Investec Ltd, Standard New York Securities Inc., HSBC Bank Plc, Standard Chartered Bank, Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd, Commerzbank AG; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Nomura International Plc., Macquarie Bank Limited are liable for the payment of an administrative penalty equal to 10% of their annual turnover. “The referral of this matter to the Tribunal marks a key milestone in this case as it now affords the banks an opportunity to answer for themselves,” said the Commissioner, Tembinkosi Bonakele.

A front-facing 3-D scanner could replace the home button, which could be phased out if Apple goes with a full-glass front this year, Hall wrote in a research note this week. Biometric facial scanning would be more secure for Apple Pay and could work better in "wet conditions" if the iPhones are more water resistant, JPMorgan wrote. Other industry watchers, like Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, have speculated that Apple is likely working on an augmented reality platform using 3-D sensors in phones. While this may eventually be true, JPMorgan expects the feature is more likely to be used with clothing sizing, home improvement measurements and scanning for 3-D printing. CNBC has reached out to Apple, which rarely announces product features before a new version is officially unveiled. Facial scanning would put Apple in the race with Google's Android platform, which has a "trusted face" security lock setting. It would cost about $10 or $15 per phone, Hall said, squaring with other analysts who have predicted it would be costly. Apple's sensor technology is also a valuable part of its intellectual property, Hall said. On Tuesday, Apple's chief financial officer Luca Maestri said that chips and sensors are among the most "strategic" and "important" Apple investments. — CNBC's Mack Hogan contributed to this report Anita BalakrishnanNews Associate Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change AAPL --- Binge 'Walking Dead' a megahit, thanks in part to white-knuckled binge-watchers By: Marc Gilbert, senior producer, CNBC Walking Dead producer: The phenomenon is no accident    Walking Dead producer: The show isn’t about zombies    Terminator writer sounds alarm on AI    Walking Dead producer: VR makes me nauseous

Of late, the flow of wisdom from top central bankers to the less privileged ones has come down to a trickle. But there is an exception – the subject of cyber security. Reserve Bank of India deputy governor SS Mundra has addressed three conferences in as many months. But the message is more worrying than comforting. His lament was that while the threats for over 1.4-billion bank accounts are on the rise, the banks are hardly doing much to protect their customers. Leave alone taking precautionary measures, they don’t even do the mandatory reporting bit to the regulator on time. Also Read: Bad bank is not a bad idea after all In March 2011, when hackers infiltrated RSA - one of the world’s top computer security companies - the message was loud and clear that if a security company gets broken into, it could happen to anyone. A few years later, its chief Amit Yoran shocked the security world when he announced that “the cyber-security industry was fundamentally broken and warned that it was only going to get worse.” A cyber-attack in the summer of 2014 on the world’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, rattled the industry when accounts of 76 million households and 7 million businesses were compromised. Its CEO Jamie Dimon wrote, “It is going to be a continual and likely never ending battle to stay ahead of it — and, unfortunately, not every battle will be won.” JPMorgan admitted to the breach and now invests nearly $600 million a year to prevent it. The $1.5-trillion Indian Banking industry in the last 6 months has reluctantly reported that a dozen banks were hit by malware, which included compromising 3.2 million card details. “The situation is very scary if banks don’t strengthen their cyber security, there is no doubt in my mind that all banks will be attacked,” says Kiran Shetty, India chief executive of SWIFT, a global financial messaging company. “I absolutely believe that cyber threat is going to evolve and it is going to become more intense than ever before.” So far, the attacks have been few and far between and most of them were minor breaches that did not threaten the industry or even the particular institution. But it could really bring down institutions as it recently happened with the Bangladesh central bank where operations came to a grinding halt. “Cyber-attacks in worst case situations can bring down the entire bank, it can deface their entire website, severely prohibit them from carrying on with their normal functions,” says Reshmi Khurana, managing director, global risk consultancy firm Kroll. The state of affairs in Indian banks does not give confidence. RBI has appointed a standing committee to redraw cyber security preparedness. “We have observed that in many cases, the banks react to cyber incidents in a knee jerk and ad hoc manner which at times has a potential to jeopardise future investigations,” RBI deputy governor SS Mundra said recently. “The world has learnt that in dealing with cyber-attacks, awareness and sharing of information play an important role. We often observe that this key premise is ignored.” While the regulator mandates reporting of cyber-attacks within 2-6 hours of detection, banks usually skip it. The official numbers also don’t reflect the true story. Top 51 banks in India have lost Rs 485 crore between April 2013 and Nov 2016 and 56 per cent of the money lost is due to Net banking thefts and card cloning incidents, finmin data shows. There are at least 15 ransomware attacks per hour in and one in three Indians falls prey to it. “Today India does not have a central repository to detect red flags early on and understand the modus operandi of cyber-attacks,” says Mukul Shrivastava, partner, fraud investigation & dispute services, EY India. “In many cases, organisations which have been previously attacked may mask it and move on, as compared to the western world where there is a reporting mechanism for cyber- attacks.” It is a double-edged sword for banks where digital transactions have soared since high value currency were scrapped while their infrastructure remained as unsafe as before. “As we go down the push towards digital, the counter point is security,” says Uday Kotak, executive vice-chairman, Kotak Bank. “There is risk with some digital initiatives, so be paranoid and believe that it is changing the world. It’s like belief in God. But make sure it’s the right God. Don’t say there is no God. Just in case there is one, you will be out of business. So better be paranoid.” Prevention requires investments, especially in technology. Globally, banks set aside 12-15 per cent of the annual tech spend for cyber security, while in India, most big banks do not even spend a couple of million dollars on IT, leave alone cyber security. “Before demonetisation, Indian banks had only 6-7 per cent transactions happening digitally versus the US, where over 80 per cent transactions are technologically enabled,” says Saket Modi, CEO, Lucideus Tech. “It simply means that the focus of the banks has not been on getting digitally enabled and, hence, it did not make commercial sense for the boards of large banks to sanction large budgets for cyber security.” Gartner, a global technology consultant, has predicted that IT spends by domestic banks and securities firms are expected to grow nearly 10 per cent to $8.9 billion in 2017. But despite the expected increase in IT spends, it’s quite possible that the adversaries will be able to outgun banks. “The probability of you being let down by your bank (even if they spend millions of dollars on security) is very real, thanks to the known unknowns in cyberspace. To err once is human, to err twice is lazy,” says Modi of Lucideus. The world of cyber security is like testing unchartered waters. RBI has warned banks that prevention is better than cure and banks will do well to secure themselves from a threat that has the potential to bring down a financial institution. “A chilling statement by an IT expert is ‘we have all been hacked, the only question is whether you know it or you don’t.’ While the statement may be alarmist, it is an antidote to complacency,” said former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan. “We will be living in interesting times. Whether it is a blessing or a curse is up to us.” READ MORE ON » Uday Kotak | reserve bank of india | Raghuram Rajan | Kotak Bank | Indians | Digital Payments | demonetisation Comments Add Your Comments NEXT STORY Get a Quote Browse CompaniesABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ|123456789 Browse Mutual FundsABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ The Economic Times Live Market News Portfolio Mobile Live TV Newsletter Commodities Speed QnA Blogs Alerts RSS Other Times Group news sitesTimes of India|इकनॉमिक टाइम्स ઈકોનોમિક ટાઈમ્સ|Mumbai Mirror Times Now|Indiatimes नवभारत टाइम्स|महाराष्ट्र टाइम्स ವಿಜಯ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ|Lifehacker Gizmodo|Eisamay|IGN India NavGujarat Samay Living and entertainmentTimescity|iDiva|Zoom| Luxpresso|Gaana|Happytrips| Cricbuzz|Get Smartapp Networkingitimes|MensXP.com Hot on the WebLive:Assembly Elections 2017|Punjab & Goa Election 2017 Income Tax calculator|Income Tax Slabs Sensex, Nifty Live|Elections 2017 Gold rate today Servicesads2book|Gadgetsnow|Free Business Listings Simplymarry|Astrospeak|Timesjobs|Magicbricks|Zigwheels|Timesdeal| dineout|Filmipop|Remit2india|Gaana|Greetzap|Techradar|Alivear| Google Play | Manage Notifications About us/Advertise with us/Terms of Use & Grievance Redressal/Privacy Policy/Feedback/Sitemap/Code of Ethics//Disclaimer Copyright © 2017 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

The Competition Commission identified lenders including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan Chase & Co, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse Group AG, HSBC Holdings and Nomura Holdings as having participated in price-fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand since at least 2007. It referred the case to an antitrust tribunal, concluding an investigation that began in 2015. “The respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times,” the Pretoria, South Africa-based commission said in an e-mailed statement Wednesday. “They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives.” The outcome of the investigation comes as President Jacob Zuma and his governing ANC step up pressure to break the dominance of South Africa’s largest lenders and improve access to the economy that still alludes many of the country’s black majority almost 23 years since the end of apartheid. South Africa’s efforts to better regulate foreign-exchange trading follows a price-rigging scandal in which some of the world’s largest banks agreed to pay fines and plead guilty to conspiring to manipulate markets after being accused of using online chat rooms to collude. No disruption “We need to establish if it’s a rogue trader or if this more widespread,” said Patrice Rassou, head of equities at Sanlam Investment Management in Cape Town. “This could result in fines but the Reserve Bank will ensure that it doesn’t cause disruption in our capital markets.” Bank of America, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered Plc, Commerzbank AG, Macquarie Group Ltd., Australia & New Zealand Banking Corp, Standard Bank Group Ltd, HSBC and BNP declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Investec Plc said it would co-operate with authorities but was unable to comment further because it didn’t have details of their investigations. Barclays Africa Group also said it would cooperate with the authorities, while noting that the regulator had not sought penalties against it. Credit Suisse said it is looking into the matter. Serious matter South Africa’s central bank said it viewed the allegations as a serious matter and would allow proceedings to run their course. The tribunal will now notify the banks of the complaint and ask them to respond, Chantelle Benjamin, a spokesperson for the body, said by phone. The banks will then file statements and attend a preliminary meeting to set a date for a full hearing, she said. The commission has previously uncovered collusion in the country’s bread and flour industry, among cement producers and by construction companies that bid to build stadiums for the 2010 soccer World Cup. Those involved were forced to pay hefty fines. “Collusive practices must lead to consequences such as termination of the services of key management, executive and non-executive directors.,” said Asief Mohamed, chief investment officer at Cape Town-based Aeon Investment Management. “The banks, if guilty, will most likely be fined and will have a negative impact on earnings and reputation. ”   Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Ramaphosa, Zuma cold war hits freezing point National | 2017-02-10 00:00:00 National | 2017-02-10 00:00:00 Editorial: Zuma’s fears erode democracy Editorials | 2017-02-10 00:00:00 Editorials | 2017-02-10 00:00:00 A not-so-proudly South African link to Trump's inner circle Opinion | 2017-02-08 11:08:00 Opinion | 2017-02-08 11:08:00 OkMalumKoolKat: The case of an escape artist Music | 2017-01-30 00:00:00 Music | 2017-01-30 00:00:00 ANC plans 'constitutional revolution' on land Politics | 2017-02-03 00:00:00 Politics | 2017-02-03 00:00:00 Most Read Client Media Releases Press OfficesAfroCentric HealthBarloworld LogisticsBoston City CampusCIO Council of South AfricaContinuitySACorporate TravellerDefencewebFaculty Training InstituteFCm Travel SolutionsFedGroup Financial ServicesFutureSenseGIBSHollardImperial LogisticsInternet SolutionsIpsosiStoreITWebJag MethodLime CapitalLottery ResultsKhulumani Support GroupMail and GuardianMandela Bay DevelopmentMiWayMiX TelematicsMessageLOUDMitelMTNNihilent TechnologiesNorth West UniversityOxbridge AcademyPragmaRosebank CollegeSANRALSAS InstituteSAP AfricaSentechSoarsoft InternationalTeraco Data EnvironmentsThe Innovation HubTiger BrandsVaal University of Technology North West University NRF recognises NWU professor's research Barloworld Logistics Paving the road ahead for young entrepreneurs Soarsoft International Lunch & Learn with Soarsoft International and iManage SANRAL SANRAL welcomes ConCourt judgment on N1/N2 Winelands iStore Introducing iStore Makers: the evolution of iPhoneography Want to publish your media releases here?

Three South African Banks have been accused of price-fixing They are accused by the Competition Commission of manipulating the price of the rand when selling and buying dollars through fictitious buy and sell orders to change supply of the currency. They are also accused of using trading chat rooms to co-ordinate times for the sale of rands or stop selling for a time in order to manipulate prices from 2007. “This is a big deal‚” said market commentator and trader Simon Brown. He said it was a major announcement because “our Competition Commission[ers] are good at what they do”. He also said the rand affected the petrol price and this is also why accusations of manipulating currency have implications and huge interest for South Africans. The commission said in a press release yesterday afternoon that it was “seeking an order from the tribunal declaring that the respondents have contravened the Competition Act”. It is “seeking an order declaring that the Bank of America, Merrill Lynch International Limited‚ BNP Paribas‚ JP Morgan Chase & Co‚ JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A‚ Investec Ltd‚ Standard New York Securities Inc‚ HSBC Bank Plc‚ Standard Chartered Bank‚ Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd‚ Commerzbank AG; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited‚ Nomura International Plc and Macquarie Bank Limited are liable for the payment of an administrative penalty equal to 10% of their annual turnover”. Of the three South African banks in the spotlight‚ it appears Absa may escape prosecution and fines because of its co-operation with the commission. While neither Standard Bank nor Investec had responded to the announcement by yesterday evening‚ Absa issued a brief comment that it would “continue to cooperate” with the commission during the prosecution. “It should be noted that the Competition Commission has not sought any penalties against Absa,” it said. Brown said: “That list of banks involved is so long‚ one almost asks ‘who is not the list?’” He said banking scandals had become common globally. “We have seen so many of them‚ with accusations of banks manipulating the gold price and Libor rates in Britain. There is a lot of dodgy stuff.” Libor, or London Interbank Offered Rate, is a benchmark rate that some of the world’s leading banks charge each other for short-term loans and is used to calculate interest rates on loans around the world. Banks never admit they were wrong but pay large non-admission of guilt fines‚ said Brown. Share prices for the three local banks barely moved after the announcement. Brown said this may be partly because the investigation by the tribunal would take a long time. “I am expecting a Twitter storm. The banks are under huge pressure in South Africa.” Most foreign banks had local financial assets and offices that could be attached if they were eventually fined, making it not so easy to ignore local competition authorities. — TMG Share this story: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Recommended Battered banks face tough year Banks now offering cheaper accounts Standard Bank‚ Absa face prosecution‚ huge fines over price fixing allegations Fifa bans Safa official Kika over match-fixing scandal SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleGONUBIE – 3 Bedroomed House Next articleWhat Trump told Zuma in that phone call Katherine Child RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Car guard goes hi-tech to beat cash drought #FeesMustFall activist Bonginkosi Khanyile is ‘fine’ despite being on hunger strike Youth who ate poison fish dies NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply e-Edition DispatchLive publishes selected content from the Daily Dispatch.

The commission said on Wednesday it had referred the banks to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution in a case that could result in massive fines and lengthy jail time for their directors. It said that it had recommended fines against Nomura International, Standard Bank and Investec, among others, equaling 10 percent of their annual turnover for the collusion. The commission’s commissioner, Thembinkosi Bonakele, said the referral of the matter would allow the banks to air their side of their story. “The referral of this matter to the tribunal marks a key milestone in this case, as it now affords the banks an opportunity to answer for themselves,” Bonakele said. Last week, while delivering the State of the Nation address, President Jacob Zuma applauded the work done by the commission in uprooting collusion in the country. “The competition authorities have done excellent work to uncover the cartels and punish them for breaking the law. Last year I signed into law a provision to criminalise the cartels and collusion and it came into effect on May 1. It carries jail sentences of up to 10 years,” Zuma said. Besides Nomura, Standard Bank and Investec, other implicated banks include Absa, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase, BNP Paribas, Barclays and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Standard New York Securities, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Standard Chartered Bank, Barclays Capital, Macquarie Bank, Credit Suisse Group, Commerzbank and Barclays Capital. Read also: Big four bank 'dominance must end' The commission’s probe followed the admission by Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland to the UK and US authorities in 2015 that they had cheated clients by using invitation-only chat rooms to co-ordinate trades. The four banks were fined close to $6billion (R79.3bn) for the collusion. The currency trading market is estimated to be worth $5 trillion a day. Last year, European antitrust regulators fined HSBC, Crédit Agricole and JP Morgan Chase a total of just over R6.8 billion for colluding to fix benchmark interest rates tied to the euro. The South African probe began in 2015 and focused on price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand. The commission said it had found that since 2007 the banks had agreements to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving US dollar/rand currency pair. Absa said it must be borne in mind that the commission had not sought any penalties against it. “Following the decision of the South African Competition Commission to refer several banks including Absa Bank to the Competition Tribunal, Absa will continue to co-operate with the commission during the prosecution of this matter,” Absa said. The commission further found that the banks had manipulated the price bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fiction bids and offers at particular times. Investec said it was awaiting more details on the move by the commission, but would co-operate with the process. “Investec will co-operate with the competition authorities with respect to their investigation. “Unfortunately, at this stage we still do not have further detail with respect to the nature of the investigation and are thus not able to comment on the matter,” said Investec. The commission said it had found the implicated banks also used a complex method in their collusion, which included using the Reuters trading platform and Bloomberg instant messaging. “They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by co-ordinating trading times. “They reached agreements to refrain from trading, taking turns in transacting and by either pulling or holding trading activities on the Reuters currency trading platform,” the commission said. Standard Bank spokesperson Erik Larsen said the bank would not be commenting. The South African Reserve Bank said it noted the decision and that it had already begun reviewing foreign exchange operations of authorised foreign exchange dealers in the domestic market. “The rand is a globally traded currency. Some 30 percent of daily turnover in the ZAR takes place in South Africa, and turnover with non-residents accounts for 57.5 percent of domestic turnover,” the Reserve Bank said.

 There's a hot new posting for Wall Street bankers Matt Turner Feb. 7, 2017, 9:50 AM 6,707 facebook linkedin twitter email print Guy D'Alema/FX Wall Street dealmakers used to be sent to Hong Kong or London to win new business. Now they're being sent to places like Seattle, Denver, and Atlanta. JPMorgan just hired Brennan Spry as head of corporate client banking and specialized industries in the South, for example. Spry previously worked in Barclays' investment banking division. Spry will be based in Atlanta, overseeing a team of bankers in the region who provide services to large companies with more than $500 million in annual revenues. In addition, the bank has hired Nina Sprinkle to the corporate client banking team in Atlanta as a senior banker responsible for serving companies in Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. She previously worked in syndicated and leveraged finance at SunTrust and Bank of America. Matt Tugwell has also joined as a senior banker focused on the Carolinas. He was most recently at Bank of America in the leveraged finance group. JPMorgan isn't the only bank hiring staff for or moving staff to regional centers in the US. The potential rewards are significant: Middle-market companies in the US and Canada paid $8.2 billion in deal fees in 2015, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch presentation. That's more than the fees netted in most of Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America combined. "This is a key focus for us as we have developed the other areas of our investment bank," Christian Meissner, the head of global corporate and investment banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told Business Insider last year. "Relatively speaking, this represents a greater opportunity than some traditional avenues of growth."

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Feb 15, 2017 at 2:40PM One of the problems with investing in companies, says Nassim Taleb in his book Antifragile, is that the interests of investors and company executives aren't always aligned. Because executives earn a salary and bonuses that often dwarf the value of stock that they own in the company, they generally benefit more from the upside of taking risk without suffering as much downside. The harm tends to primarily accrue instead to the shareholders. The ancient Romans had an ingenious way of dealing with this when it came to building bridges, Taleb notes, requiring the engineers who built the bridges to spend time underneath the completed structures. The English took this a step further, requiring the engineers' entire family to spend time under the bridge after it was built. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Taleb refers to this as having "skin in the game," and it translates easily from bridge building into investing. To ensure that shareholders' and executives' interests are aligned, the people running companies should be required to own a significant number of stock in their firms, as this exposes them to the downside of taking excessive risk. It's for this reason that JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is such a solid stock for investors to own. A majority of CEO Jamie Dimon's net worth is tied up in JPMorgan Chase stock. According to the bank's latest proxy statement, he owns 6.7 million shares outright, valued at around $604 million -- and that doesn't include the options he owns as well. In no other industry is skin in the game as important as it is in banking. Banks are highly leveraged institutions, typically borrowing $10 in debt for every $1 in equity. The net result is that a mere 10% decline in the value of a bank's assets can render it insolvent. On top of this, there's a huge demand for a bank's product -- money. The only limit to how fast a bank can grow by making loans comes from the bank itself, as anyone in their right mind would take a loan if the price (i.e., interest rate) is right. When you combine these two fundamental aspects of banking, in turn, it's clear that a bank's executives must always keep the downside risk of growing too quickly at the forefront of their minds. The best way to do this is by ensuring that the executives of the banks you invest in have a lot of skin in the game. And no other bank executive that I'm aware of owns more stock in their institution than JPMorgan Chase's Dimon. Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. Dimon isn't content just satisfying the bank's baseline requirement of owning a minimum of 1 million shares. His stake is nearly seven times that. On top of this, as JPMorgan Chase notes in its 2016 proxy statement: Mr. Dimon not only complies with all of these ownership guidelines and retention requirements, but has not sold a single share of JPMorgan Chase common stock or, prior to the merger, Bank One Corporation common stock, whether acquired as part of his compensation or on the open market, since he became CEO of Bank One in March of 2000. And it's not as if Dimon just accumulates shares of JPMorgan Chase from stock and options granted by the bank; he's also an avid purchaser in his own right. When bank stocks bottomed out at the beginning of last year, he ponied up $27 million to purchase 500,000 additional shares. In sum, if you want to invest in a bank that's looking out for your interests as a shareholder, you can't do much better than JPMorgan Chase. John Maxfield has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 February 2017 by Military News JPMorgan Chase Institute’s Local Consumer Commerce Index Shows a 0.3 Percent Decrease in Consumer Spending Growth in October 2016 WASHINGTON–()–Today, the JPMorgan Chase Institute released its Local Consumer Commerce Index (LCCI) for October 2016, which showed that five of the 15 U.S. cities analyzed saw positive growth in year-over-year spending. However, overall, year-over-year consumer spending growth declined by 0.3 percent in October – making it the fourth consecutive month of negative growth. Denver continued to experience the fastest growth of all cities studied, this time at 7.9 percent year-over-year. Across all 15 cities, growth contributions from large businesses rebounded significantly from September 2016, adding 1.2 percentage points to overall growth. However, this rebound was offset by declines in growth contributions from small and medium businesses. This report provides a timely view of how the following cities and surrounding metro areas are faring economically, both individually and in aggregate: Atlanta, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, Portland (OR), San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle. By looking at actual anonymized financial transactions, LCCI offers an ongoing, dynamic view of the health and vibrancy of the U.S. consumer and the places where businesses operate. “Despite a slight contraction, October 2016 brought some positive developments in local consumer commerce,” said Diana Farrell, President and CEO of the JPMorgan Chase Institute. “Large businesses helped drive this change, as did ongoing spending growth from millennials and low income consumers. We are hopeful that November and December brought continued increases thanks to local holiday spending.” The key highlights from the latest Index include: Smaller cities, such as Seattle, San Diego, Denver, Portland, and Columbus, continued to grow faster than mid-sized and large cities, with a 2.1 percent overall average growth rate in October 2016. The top forty percent of consumers – from an income perspective – continued to be a drag on growth in October 2016, slightly overshadowing the positive growth contributed by the bottom sixty percent in that month. Small business growth contributions fell sharply in October 2016, subtracting 0.5 percentage points from growth in that month. This is a significant decline relative to the 2.3 percentage point contribution in September. This is only the fourth time in our series that small businesses have detracted from growth. Large businesses recovered significantly from the 2 percentage point subtraction from overall growth in September 2016, contributing 1.2 percentage points to growth in October.

However, overall, year-over-year consumer spending growth declined by 0.3 percent in October – making it the fourth consecutive month of negative growth. Denver continued to experience the fastest growth of all cities studied, this time at 7.9 percent year-over-year. Across all 15 cities, growth contributions from large businesses rebounded significantly from September 2016, adding 1.2 percentage points to overall growth. However, this rebound was offset by declines in growth contributions from small and medium businesses. This report provides a timely view of how the following cities and surrounding metro areas are faring economically, both individually and in aggregate: Atlanta, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, Portland (OR), San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle. By looking at actual anonymized financial transactions, LCCI offers an ongoing, dynamic view of the health and vibrancy of the U.S. consumer and the places where businesses operate. “Despite a slight contraction, October 2016 brought some positive developments in local consumer commerce,” said Diana Farrell, President and CEO of the JPMorgan Chase Institute. “Large businesses helped drive this change, as did ongoing spending growth from millennials and low income consumers. We are hopeful that November and December brought continued increases thanks to local holiday spending.” The key highlights from the latest Index include: Smaller cities, such as Seattle, San Diego, Denver, Portland, and Columbus, continued to grow faster than mid-sized and large cities, with a 2.1 percent overall average growth rate in October 2016. The top forty percent of consumers – from an income perspective – continued to be a drag on growth in October 2016, slightly overshadowing the positive growth contributed by the bottom sixty percent in that month. Small business growth contributions fell sharply in October 2016, subtracting 0.5 percentage points from growth in that month. This is a significant decline relative to the 2.3 percentage point contribution in September. This is only the fourth time in our series that small businesses have detracted from growth. Large businesses recovered significantly from the 2 percentage point subtraction from overall growth in September 2016, contributing 1.2 percentage points to growth in October. With a contribution of 0.9 percentage points, year-over-year spending growth on nondurables, such as office supplies and clothing, recovered in October after the decline experienced in September 2016.

Steve Symington, Dan Caplinger, and Tim Brugger (TMFSymington) Feb 15, 2017 at 9:21AM One of the greatest fears of many investors is the potential for buying a stock at its peak share price. After all, the oft-repeated idea of buying low and selling high makes sense on the surface. But all too often -- and while it might seem counterintuitive -- the best deals are companies whose stocks have a strong history of share-price appreciation.  That's not to say finding those deals is easy. So to help get you started, we asked three top Motley Fool contributors to each pick a stock trading near its 52-week high that they believe investors would be wise to buy this month. Read on to see why they chose Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Image source: Getty Images Investing in the future of gaming Steve Symington (Activision Blizzard): Shares of Activision Blizzard popped more than 16% in a single day last week, touching an all-time high after the company's record fourth-quarter 2016 report. But despite drawing 447 million monthly active users (MAUs) last quarter, and having consumers spending an incredible 43 billion hours playing and watching Activision Blizzard content last year, I think the video-game titan is only just getting started.  For one, Blizzard achieved record fourth-quarter MAUs of 41 million. Overwatch became Blizzard's fastest-ever game to reach more than 25 million players globally, breaking the previous launch-year record for unit sales set by Diablo III in 2012. And even Blizzard's established World of Warcraft franchise managed to grow MAUs 20% year over year during the quarter, with the help of its new Legion expansion. Meanwhile, the Activision studio set its own record with 51 million MAUs in Q4, as Call of Duty capped its eighth consecutive year as the world's No. 1 console franchise. Activision also began to spread its wings last quarter with the debut of its new Skylanders Academy TV series through a partnership with Netflix.  One point of potential concern: MAUs at mobile gaming specialist King Digital -- which Activision Blizzard acquired for $5.9 billion early last year -- declined slightly on a year-over-year basis in Q4, to 355 million. But even then, King Digital simultaneously drove better per-user engagement and investment and still commanded two of the top 10 highest-grossing mobile app store titles for the 13th straight quarter -- an extraordinary demonstration of relative stability, given the ebbs and flows of the often fickle mobile gaming space. All told, revenue last quarter grew 49% year over year, to $1.45 billion, while adjusted earnings per share rose 160%, to $0.65. Activision Blizzard also generated 71% growth in operating cash flow last year, to $2.2 billion; increased its annual dividend by 15%, to $0.30 per share; and approved a new two-year, $1 billion stock repurchase plan. Add to that the potential for incremental revenue from other growth initiatives, including integration of in-game advertising, e-sports, and consumer products, and I'm convinced Activision will continue setting new highs going forward. Rendering beautiful market-beating gains Tim Brugger (Adobe Systems): Following a slow but steady increase in its stock price since it announced record quarterly and fiscal 2016 revenue on Dec. 15, Adobe is still at or near its 52-week high of $116.90. Not exactly a value investor's dream, right? But when investors consider how Adobe has consistently posted strong results, it becomes apparent that CEO Shantanu Narayen had it right all along. Narayen took a gamble: He shut down Adobe's software sales approach and focused on a more sustainable subscription model. Die-hard Adobe Photoshop users weren't amused, but fast-forward to the present and those same fans are kicking themselves if they didn't buy Adobe stock. Adobe ended fiscal 2016 with record revenue of $5.85 billion, and that's not even the best part. Of those sales, nearly 70% -- $4 billion -- were generated by the subscription-based annualized recurring revenue (ARR) from its Digital Media unit. Last fiscal year's ARR was a 28% improvement over 2015. The emphasis on ARR offers several advantages to investors, not the least of which is that it builds a relatively reliable, and predictable, sales foundation. That equates to fewer wild quarterly revenue fluctuations, which in turn limits Adobe stock's risk because if its relative stability. It's also less costly to service existing customers than rely exclusively on new sales. Not surprisingly, Adobe's expense increases are well below its top-line growth. Adobe shares are up 53% in the past year and over 12% in 2017, and it's absolutely still worth buying. This Wall Street bank has more room to run Dan Caplinger (JPMorgan Chase): The financial sector has been one of the biggest winners in the aftermath of the presidential election in November, and in the opening weeks of the Trump administration, the new president has already issued an executive order that will have the end result of reducing regulation on big banks. That's great news for JPMorgan Chase, which has already been rising because of anticipation of higher interest rates and the corresponding profit boost for the company's retail banking business. It isn't certain that Congress will follow through and repeal Dodd-Frank banking restrictions in their entirety. But the potential for JPMorgan Chase to boost the size of its lending portfolio and proprietary trading business could lead to unanticipated profit growth, and already, CEO Jamie Dimon has shown his support for the president's policies on issues ranging from bank regulation to tax reform. JPMorgan Chase has plenty of risks, and the potential threat of growing tensions in the global economy related to trade could have an adverse impact on its international business. However, few banks have successfully read changing trends better than Dimon and JPMorgan Chase, and as long as the bank keeps its fingers on the pulse of the geopolitical and macroeconomic climate, it has the ability to keep climbing despite its past share-price gains.  Dan Caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned. Steve Symington has no position in any stocks mentioned. Tim Brugger has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Activision Blizzard.

The commission said in a statement it has been investigating a case of price-fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand since April 2015. It has now referred the case to the tribunal for prosecution. The banks are Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase & Co, JP Morgan Chase Bank NA, Investec Ltd, Standard New York Securities Inc, HSBC Bank Plc, Standard Chartered Bank, Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd, Commerzbank AG; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Nomura International Plc, Macquarie Bank Limited, ABSA Bank Limited (ABSA), Barclays Capital Inc, Barclays Bank plc (Respondents). The commission is seeking an order from the tribunal declaring that the respondents have contravened the Competition Act. Further, the Commission is seeking an order declaring that 14 of the banks - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase & Co, JP Morgan Chase Bank, Investec, Standard New York Securities, HSBC Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa, Commerzbank; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Nomura International and Macquarie Bank - are liable for the payment of an administrative penalty equal to 10% of their annual turnover. The commission said it found that from at least 2007, the respondents had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving US dollar / rand currency pair. It further found that the respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times. The commission said traders of the respondents primarily used trading platforms such as the Reuters currency trading platform to carry out their collusive activities. They also used Bloomberg instant messaging system (chatroom), telephone conversation and had meetings to coordinate their bilateral and multilateral collusive trading activities. They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They reached agreements to refrain from trading, taking turns in transacting and by either pulling or holding trading activities on the Reuters currency trading platform.  They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives. “The referral of this matter to the Tribunal marks a key milestone in this case as it now affords the banks an opportunity to answer for themselves,” said Commissioner Tembinkosi Bonakele.

Financial News Hedge Funds Hedge fund investors ready to shop around Most respondents in JP Morgan's $750 billion investor survey say they will shop around for better returns in 2017 By Becky Pritchard Feb. 15, 2017 6:59 a.m. ET Investors were disappointed by so-so performance from their hedge funds last year, leading many to say they will shop around for better performance this year. After a year that saw many hedge funds stumble, three quarters of investors that responded to a survey by JP Morgan said their hedge fund investments did not meet their return targets. This was up on the two thirds of respondents in 2015. And the disappointment has come despite the fact that investors are asking hedge funds for less. JP Morgan found that two-thirds, 66% of investors have set their hedge funds an annual return target below 10% - up from 63% in 2015, and 46% in 2014. JP Morgan canvassed 234 investors who have put $750 billion into hedge funds between them; family offices, funds-of-hedge-funds, consultants and others. Nearly 90% of them said they plan to maintain their allocations to hedge funds this year. Of those looking to make changes, 75% said they would reallocate to different managers, while 49% said picking new strategies was an option. They are likely to be looking for " high conviction managers that are differentiated and uncorrelated" to the markets, JP Morgan said, with quant long-short equity, global macro, distressed credit and volatility arbitrage among the likely winners. Many hedge funds were criticised in 2016 for charging high fees for poor performance.  Overall, hedge funds in the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index ended 2016 up 5.6% against the over 11% gain in the S&P 500 Total Return Index. JP Morgan said the number of pension schemes responding to its survey had "declined significantly", accounting for only 6% of the 234 respondents. The bank said this "might be due to pensions' waning interest in hedge funds due to high fees and uneven performance". This is bad news for hedge fund managers, as pension schemes tend to make the largest individual allocations - at least $25 million per hedge fund investment, JP Morgan said, compared to $10 million or less for family offices and consultants.

"To reiterate what we've already shared when asked, we made this decision based on performance," the company said in a statement. "Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn't make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now." In other words, customers are just not into Ivanka. National Retail Federation President and CEO Matthew Shay, in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, gave a measured response. "What we are all seeing is that we're living in a world with a different kind of chief executive in the White House," he said. "It's someone who communicates directly and forcefully and has a strong opinion on issues. We are learning, all of us, I think, how to work in that environment." That's one way of putting it. Another is that the president and his aides are inviting corruption. Had any federal employee, including a Cabinet official, done what Trump did, he or she would have run afoul of federal ethics regulations, specifically, Title 5, Section 2635.702: "An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity, including nonprofit organizations of which the employee is an officer or member, and persons with whom the employee has or seeks employment or business relations. ... An employee shall not use or permit the use of his Government position or title or any authority associated with his public office in a manner that is intended to coerce or induce another person, including a subordinate, to provide any benefit, financial or otherwise, to himself or to friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity." This is garden-variety corruption, of the type we around the country deplore in kleptocratic regimes. Likewise, if an American company consented to hire or do business with a foreign leader's children in order to grease the skids for business dealings or avoid government retribution it would be a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. As the Financial Times reported recently: "JPMorgan has agreed to pay $264m to settle a US probe into its practice of hiring well-connected Chinese 'princelings' to win business. ... " 'JPMorgan engaged in a systematic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials and other favored referrals who were typically unqualified for the positions,' said Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC's enforcement division. 'JPMorgan employees knew the firm was potentially violating the FCPA yet persisted with the improper hiring program because the business rewards and new deals were deemed too lucrative.' " The White House (falsely) keeps insisting the president cannot have conflicts of interest, neglecting the constitutional prohibition on receipt of monies from foreign governments. Nevertheless, Congress can and should close the gap in ethics laws given that this president refuses to divest himself of businesses and insists on using the power of his office (during the transition and currently) to benefit his family finances. Perhaps we need a presidential anti-corruption act that would make Title 5, Section 2635.702 applicable to the president and vice president. In any event, both spokesman Sean Spicer's derogatory comments (an attempt to "coerce") and counselor Kellyanne Conway, who directly hawked Ivanka's line ("I fully—I'm going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online."), seem to run afoul of existing ethics laws and should be held accountable. There may be other legal avenues as well. Ethics guru Norman Eisen of the Brookings Institution this week tweeted that there is a cause of action under California's Unfair Competition law forbidding "any unfair business act." Eisen told me Thursday, "The law has long recognized that when someone makes untrue statements about a business, and those statements cause harm, a cause of action lies. As it happens, California, which has a lot of Nordstrom's stores, has one of the most generous laws in the nation in allowing a business to respond when it is the victim of unfair treatment." He adds, "Interestingly, that law also allows the California attorney general or other public officials to bring an action as well. Nordstrom's says the president and Mr. Spicer's statements were not correct. ... [T]his was a business decision that was made because Ivanka's line was not selling, that there was nothing unfair or political about it." Conveniently, former Democratic congressman Xavier Becerra is now California's state attorney general. Over to you, Mr. Becerra. Jennifer Rubin is a Washington Post columnist.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 2 Comments Moneycontrol Bureau Tata Motors CLSA has downgraded Tata Motors to sell and slashed target price to Rs 405 from Rs 650 after cutting FY18-19 EPS estimates by 25-31 percent due to dismal performance in Q3FY17. Management commentary on JLR margins has weakened significantly, it says, adding hedging losses are likely to continue at high levels for longer. JPMorgan also reduced its target price on the stock to Rs 570 from Rs 610 after cutting FY17/18 JLR EBIT estimates by 26 percent/17 percent and consolidated earnings estimates by 33 percent/23 percent. It advises buying on dip as margin miss was not as bad as it seems. The commercial vehicle and luxury car maker's third quarter profit on consolidated basis fell sharply by 96 percent year-on-year to Rs 112 crore, impacted by big loss in domestic business and operational weakness in JLR. However, other brokerage houses also cut target price, though they retained their rating on the stock. Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on the stock, with reduced target price at Rs 630 from Rs 680 after cutting FY17/FY18/FY19 EPS estimates by 26 percent/15 percent/12 percent. The brokerage house has built in slightly lower margins to account for higher incentives. It expects moderating forex losses from June onwards and sees progressive reduction in hedging losses. Macquarie also retained outperform rating but cut target to Rs 575 from Rs 630 after lowering FY17/18/19 consolidated EBITDA estimates by 20 percent/10 percent/7.0 percent. Most negative factors that impacted Q3 earnings are transitory, it feels. It expects stronger sales growth & margin for JLR in FY18. Deutsche Bank, which has a buy call on Tata Motors with reduced target at Rs 535 from Rs 575, says currency gains remained elusive but management looks upbeat on new models. It expects margin to normalise in medium term. Bank of America Merrill Lynch also retained buy call but cut target price to Rs 560 from Rs 575. The brokerage house forecasts consolidated EPS CAGR of 41 percent over FY16-19. It feels weaker GBP will remain a tailwind to margins in FY18/19 and pre-buy for commercial vehicles should help margins in Q4. Citi says correction in stock price is a buying opportunity as its feels details reveal a brighter picture, though headline is weak. JLR's favourable FS trends should aid in healthy volume growth, it believes. The research firm has a buy call on the stock, with a target price at Rs 660. Sun Pharma Nomura cut FY17 earnings estimates for Sun Pharma by 9 percent, FY18 by 5 percent & FY19 by 3 percent after Q3 earnings missed analysts' expectations. It sees 11 percent revenue growth & 10 percent earnings growth over next 2 years. Return on equities will fall another 200 bps to 18 percent and dividend payouts will be anaemic at 10 percent, it feels. Downside may be limited, it says. Citi has a buy call on Sun Pharma, with reduced target price at Rs 900 from Rs 970. The brokerage house raised FY17 EPS estimates by 4 percent but cut FY18/19 estimates by 7 percent/5 percent. According to the research firm, delay in fresh approvals from Halol plant would remain overhangs. After unclear earnings trajectory, Morgan Stanley retained its equal-weight rating on the stock, with reduced target price at Rs 690 from Rs 762. FY17, FY18 & FY19 EPS estimates cut buy 5.4 percent, 5.4 percent & 4.1 percent, it says. CLSA feels near-term outlook for Sun Pharma looks challenging but valuations are reasonable. The brokerage house has maintained a buy call on the stock but lowered target price to Rs 790 from Rs 800 after cutting FY17-19 EPS estimates by 1-4 percent. JPMorgan says Sun Pharma's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) miss was due to lower ex-Taro gross margins. Halol & ex-Taro performance are key drivers, it feels. The research firm is overweight on the stock, with reduced target at Rs 750 from Rs 775. Goldman Sachs has maintained buy rating on a favourable risk-reward on Sun Pharma but lowered target price to Rs 824 from Rs 836. It expects 14 percent EBITDA CAGR over FY16-19. Adani Ports While assigning a buy call on Adani Ports, with a target price of Rs 375, CLSA says strategic asset should deliver 54 percent growth in port EBITDA over FY16-19 and new corporate structure could lower taxes & boost EPS growth. Bank of America Merrill Lynch says Adani Ports' Q3 beat was led by higher realisation & SEZ income. The research firm has a buy call on the stock, with increased target price at Rs 350 from Rs 330. Credit Suisse feels valuations are reasonable at 16x. Hence, it maintained outperform rating on the stock, with target price at Rs 360. Goldman Sachs raised target price on Adani Ports to Rs 340 from Rs 333 after increasing earnings estimates by 3.6-9.6 percent for FY17-19. Jindal Steel & Power Deutsche Bank says Jindal Steel reported a strong & better-than-expected operating performance in October-December quarter and has achieved 71 percent of FY17 EBITDA forecast in 9 months. However, the research firm has retained sell rating on the stock on elevated risk from high leverage. Visibility on reduction in debt will be a strong stock price driver, it feels. Voltas Deutsche Bank has hold rating on Voltas, with a target price at Rs 365 after Q3 earnings. Cost controls offset weak revenues, Deutsche feels while Goldman Sachs says strong electro-mechanical projects margins drove bottomline beat in October-December quarter. SpiceJet CLSA has retained a sell call on SpiceJet. Fair value for the stock is Rs 35, it says.

Picture: Facebook. Currency Competition Commission Competition Commission of South Africa Bank collusion Hardin Ratshisusu Email Print Tweet Share Thando Kubheka | one hour ago JOHANNESBURG - The Competition Commission has described traders linked to 17 banks, who have been referred to the Competition Commission Tribunal for manipulating its value, as highly skilled and sophisticated. It says the traders used many platforms, including Bloomberg's instant messaging service, to distort the market. Local banks include Standard Bank, Investec and Absa and international institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Nomura and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The commission found that from at least 2007 these banks had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids in relation to currency trading involving the rand and dollar. Deputy competition commissioner Hardin Ratshisusu says, “As long as a trader is linked to a particular bank and they were doing business for that bank, then that bank is involved in that collusive party.” The banks named in the case are: Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited BNP Paribas JP Morgan Chase & Co JP Morgan Chase Bank NA Investec Ltd Standard New York Securities Inc HSBC Bank Plc Standard Chartered Bank Credit Suisse Group Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd Commerzbank AG Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited Nomura International Plc Macquarie Bank Limited ABSA Bank Limited Barclays Capital Inc Barclays Bank plc (Edited by Shimoney Regter) Timeline 'People buying rand would have been affected by bank collusion' 2 hours ago Political parties react to bank collusion case 3 hours ago Competition Commission confident of case against 17 banks 5 hours ago ANC: Collusion findings places doubt on trust in SA banks 14 hours ago More in Local ‘Don’t let his life go in vain,’ cops told after member killed 27 minutes ago Gautrain services between PTA & Hatfield suspended until further notice 40 minutes ago No compensation for families of Lily Mine collapse yet, creditors meet one hour ago Chikane: Allegations against my wife unfounded & slanderous one hour ago Health officials urged to remain vigilant for measles cases one hour ago Cops chase down suspects in Raymond Barras murder one hour ago Comments EWN welcomes all comments that are constructive, contribute to discussions in a meaningful manner and take stories forward.

Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here TOKYO: The dollar pulled back on Thursday after rising to one-month highs in the wake of upbeat US economic data, with demand for the greenback cooling as Treasury yields came off their peaks. Better-than-expected US inflation and retail sales data had backed expectations of an early rate hike by the Federal Reserve, sending the dollar index to 101.76 on Wednesday, a peak unseen since January 12. It has since retreated to 100.92 in the Asia session on Thursday. The dollar also came off from a 2-1/2-week high of 114.95 marked on Wednesday against the yen, touching a low of 113.73. It was last down 0.3 per cent at 113.84 yen. "The dollar is struggling as US Treasury yields retreated from highs," said Junya Tanase, chief currency strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo. US benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields slipped to 2.484 per cent on Thursday, after climbing to a three-week high of 2.524 per cent on Wednesday following the upbeat US data. Data on Wednesday showed US consumer prices recorded their biggest gain in nearly four years, jumping 0.6 per cent in January. Retail sales also outpaced expectations, increasing 0.4 per cent last month compared to the analysts' poll of 0.1 per cent. But some analysts also noted that the data may not be as strong as it appears, while industrial output and a gauge on home builder sentiment took unexpected spills. "Retail sales seemed to have been boosted by higher prices rather than an increase in the real consumption," said Shin Kadota, senior forex strategist at Barclays. "Investors also took profit as the dollar was trading high this week," added Kadota. Up until Tuesday, the dollar index had enjoyed a 10-session winning streak. Fed Chair Janet Yellen offered no additional insight on the timing of the central bank's next rate hike in her second day of economic testimony before Congress on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Yellen hinted more rate hikes were on the way as the jobs market has improved and inflation has shown signs of nearing the Fed's two per cent goal. Markets will get another chance to check the US economic pulse from another batch of data, including housing starts, building permits and the Business Outlook Survey by Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The euro edged up 0.15 per cent at $1.0614, recovering from a five-week trough of $1.052 touched on Wednesday. Elsewhere, the Australian dollar hovered near a three-month high following a slightly better-than-expected reading in the country's January employment data. The Australian dollar last traded at $0.7709 after touching $0.7732, its highest since Nov. 10. Sterling last stood at $1.2460, edging up from a one-week trough of $1.2384 touched on Wednesday, knocked by slowing wage growth in the fourth quarter - bad news for British consumers facing a surge in inflation in the months ahead.

Feb 16 2017 08:54 Mike Cohen and Renee Bonorchis Related Articles Price fixing: Punish guilty banks harshly, urges ANC Questions over timing of banks' collusion case How banks allegedly colluded on currency trades Competition Commission prosecutes banks for collusion   Cape Town – The Competition Tribunal will need to establish whether the manipulation of foreign-currency trades was done by rogue traders or whether it was more widespread at the 17 banks identified by the Competition Commission on Wednesday. That is according to Patrice Rassou, head of equities at Sanlam Investment Management in Cape Town. “We need to establish if it’s a rogue trader or if this more widespread,” said Rassou. “This could result in fines, but the Reserve Bank will ensure that it doesn’t cause disruption in our capital markets.” Asief Mohamed, chief investment officer at Cape Town-based Aeon Investment Management, said earnings and reputations could be at stake. “Collusive practices must lead to consequences such as termination of the services of key management, executive and non-executive directors,” said Mohamed. “The banks, if guilty, will most likely be fined and will have a negative impact on earnings and reputation.” READ: Punish guilty banks harshly, urges ANC Investec said it will cooperate with authorities, but was unable to comment further because it didn’t have details of their investigations.  Barclays Africa Group (which owns Absa) also said it will cooperate with the authorities, while noting that the regulator had not sought penalties against it. Credit Suisse said it is looking into the matter. Bank of America, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, Commerzbank, Macquarie., Australia & New Zealand Banking, Standard Bank, HSBC and BNP declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Banks manipulated the price of bids and offers On Wednesday, the Competition Commission recommended some of them be fined 10% of their annual turnover after concluding an investigation that began in 2015. “The respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times,” the Competition Commission said. “They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives.” READ: How banks allegedly colluded on currency trades The outcome of the investigation comes as President Jacob Zuma and his governing African National Congress step up pressure to break the dominance of South Africa’s largest lenders and improve access to the economy that still alludes many of the country’s black majority almost 23 years since the end of apartheid. South Africa’s efforts to better regulate foreign-exchange trading follows a price-rigging scandal in which some of the world’s largest banks agreed to pay fines and plead guilty to conspiring to manipulate markets after being accused of using online chat rooms to collude. South Africa’s central bank said it viewed the allegations as a serious matter and would allow proceedings to run their course. The tribunal will now notify the banks of the complaint and ask them to respond, Chantelle Benjamin, a spokesperson for the body, said by phone. The banks will then file statements and attend a preliminary meeting to set a date for a full hearing, she said. The commission has previously uncovered collusion in the country’s bread and flour industry, among cement producers and by construction companies that bid to build stadiums for the 2010 soccer World Cup. Those involved were forced to pay hefty fines.

"We like company's increasing growth focus but it takes time to show up," the brokerage house says, adding it continued to build in ramp-up in revenue as Maggi noodles gain traction ahead. Credit Suisse has maintained underperform rating on the stock as company's valuations are expensive compared to peers. The research firm says it cut earnings by 3-4 percent as company finding it tough to get Maggi back to old form. 5-10 percent higher Q4 sales validate slowdown in ramp of Maggi, it feels.

HDIL JPMorgan is overweight on HDIL, with a target price at Rs 140 as net debt continued to decline and thesis on the stock is intact. Pre-sales were weak in Q3 but the brokerage house expects a recovery in FY18. According to the research firm, market's focus on company's earnings is wrong. ICICI Prudential CLSA says insurance sector will be key beneficiary of shift in savings pattern from physical assets. Unit linked insurance plans (ULIPs) can be attractive given lower deposit rates and good return from capital markets, it feels. Mutual fund assets increased by 36 percent YoY, though it is debt funds that formed 67 percent of total, it says. CLSA expects new premium collections to see 16 percent CAGR over FY16-19. ICICI Prudential Life remains its key pick in the sector, the brokerage house says. Ajanta Pharma With recommending sell on Ajanta Pharma, Ambit says dream run led by strong growth in Africa would end with return of incumbents in FY18, no growth in donor funding over 2016-19, and re-alignment of portfolio in branded generics. These would result in a 3 percent decline in revenues in FY18 in Africa, it feels. In domestic, as Ajanta hits the ceiling in existing therapies, growth could taper but remain higher than IPM led by brand equity, it says. The brokerage house says US business will gain on cost arbitrage and low base, but both short-term opportunities at best. With margin/return on capital employed compression and premium valuations, Ambit sees downside risk to bull case Street expectations.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News BUDGET 2017 Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio BLink Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker Dollar retreats as US Treasury yields come off highs Reuters comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Tokyo, Feb 16:   The dollar pulled back on Thursday after rising to one-month highs in the wake of upbeat US economic data, with demand for the greenback cooling as Treasury yields came off their peaks. Better-than-expected US inflation and retail sales data had backed the expectations of an early rate hike by the Federal Reserve, sending the dollar index to 101.76 on Wednesday, a peak unseen since January 12. It has since retreated to 100.92 in the Asian session on Thursday. The dollar also came off from a 2-1/2-week high of 114.95 marked on Wednesday against the yen, touching a low of 113.73. It was last down 0.3 per cent at 113.84 yen. “The dollar is struggling as US Treasury yields retreated from highs,” said Junya Tanase, chief currency strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo. US benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields slipped to 2.484 per cent on Thursday, after climbing to a three-week high of 2.524 per cent on Wednesday following the upbeat US data. US economic data Data on Wednesday showed US consumer prices recorded their biggest gain in nearly four years, jumping 0.6 per cent in January. Retail sales also outpaced expectations, increasing 0.4 per cent last month compared to the analysts' poll of 0.1 per cent. But some analysts also noted that the data may not be as strong as it appears, while industrial output and a gauge on home builder sentiment took unexpected spills. “Retail sales seemed to have been boosted by higher prices rather than an increase in the real consumption,” said Shin Kadota, senior forex strategist at Barclays. “Investors also took profit as the dollar was trading high this week,” added Kadota. Up until Tuesday, the dollar index had enjoyed a 10-session winning streak. Fed rate hike Fed Chair Janet Yellen offered no additional insight on the timing of the central bank's next rate hike in her second day of economic testimony before Congress on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Yellen had hinted more rate hikes were on the way as the jobs market has improved and inflation has shown signs of nearing the Fed's two per cent goal. Markets will get another chance to check the US economic pulse from another batch of data, including housing starts, building permits and the Business Outlook Survey by Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The euro edged up 0.15 per cent at $1.0614, recovering from a five-week trough of $1.052 touched on Wednesday. Elsewhere, the Australian dollar hovered near a three-month high following a slightly better-than-expected reading in the country's January employment data. The Australian dollar last traded at $0.7709 after touching $0.7732, its highest since November 10. Sterling last stood at $1.2460, edging up from a one-week trough of $1.2384 touched on Wednesday, knocked by slowing wage growth in the fourth quarter - bad news for British consumers facing a surge in inflation in the months ahead.

Picture: EWN. Currency Competition Commission Competition Tribunal of South Africa Thembinkosi Bonakele Email Print Tweet Share Stephen Grootes | 5 hours ago JOHANNESBURG – The Competition Commission says it's confident of its case against 17 banks accused of manipulating the currency because it has evidence that they faked bids to distort supply and demand. It announced on Wednesday that it referred the case against the banks to the Competition Tribunal, but says it does expect settlements to be reached. The banks include local institutions like Absa Bank, Standard Bank and Investec as well as international banks like JPMorgan Chase, Standard Chartered Bank and HSBC. Competition Commissioner Thembinkosi Bonakele says they're completely sure of their case. “It would not make sense at all to defend a case like this. It’s very strong and I would expect that a lot of banks would do the right thing and settle it.” He says they want to make sure this cannot happen again. “We always like it when we get into the industry that not only do we fine people, but that the conduct is stamped out completely, and this is what we would expect the banks to do.” The commission says the banks had been co-ordinating their trades, creating false bids, and communicating their intentions through the Bloomberg instant messaging service to distort the market. The banks named in the case are: Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited BNP Paribas JP Morgan Chase & Co JP Morgan Chase Bank NA Investec Ltd Standard New York Securities Inc HSBC Bank Plc Standard Chartered Bank Credit Suisse Group Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd Commerzbank AG Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited Nomura International Plc Macquarie Bank Limited ABSA Bank Limited Barclays Capital Inc Barclays Bank plc (Edited by Tamsin Wort) Timeline Traders in bank collusion ‘highly skilled’ & ‘sophisticated’ one hour ago 'People buying rand would have been affected by bank collusion' 2 hours ago Political parties react to bank collusion case 3 hours ago [BREAKING NEWS] Bank collusion case referred to Competition Tribunal 18 hours ago More in Local ‘Don’t let his life go in vain,’ cops told after member killed 24 minutes ago Gautrain services between PTA & Hatfield suspended until further notice 37 minutes ago No compensation for families of Lily Mine collapse yet, creditors meet one hour ago Chikane: Allegations against my wife unfounded & slanderous one hour ago Health officials urged to remain vigilant for measles cases one hour ago Cops chase down suspects in Raymond Barras murder one hour ago Comments EWN welcomes all comments that are constructive, contribute to discussions in a meaningful manner and take stories forward.

About Contact Jobs Staff Advertise Galleries Home News A & E Features Opinion Sports Comics Columns Go to...Home News A & E Features Opinion Sports Comics Columns Opinion Op-Ed: Who Will Answer to Standing Rock? Nicolás Cruz No Comments » Feb 15th, 2017 Last week the Army Corps of Engineers issued the final easement for Energy Transfer Partners to dig the remaining portion of the Dakota Access Pipeline. This final stretch will be laid horizontally under Lake Oahe half a mile upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. The Army Corps decision came at the behest of President Trump’s executive order pushing this pipeline and the already dead Keystone XL pipeline through without proper review. Construction has already begun and the pipeline could carry oil in as little as 30 days. Meanwhile, a federal judge has denied the tribe’s request to halt construction, arguing that the damage can’t be done until oil begins flowing. But the police violence, private security attacks, and mass arrests have already done great harm to Standing Rock and their allies. And with Federal, State, and County governments intent on continuing the colonial assault on Indigenous land, water, and life by working unabashedly for the oil companies and banks funding this pipeline, who will answer to Standing Rock? The president won’t. In fact, it is yet unclear if either president will. Congress won’t. The soon-to-be-gutted EPA won’t. So how do we respond to the call by Standing Rock for a last stand, which if anything will be the beginning of merely a different form of resistance? We stop giving money to the banks that are funding DAPL. If you have accounts with Wells Fargo, Citibank, US Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Compass Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, HSBC Bank, or one of the other 9 banks that have given Dakota Access $3.75 billion in credit, consider closing your account. Go to a local branch or call customer service and tell them you want to close your account specifically because of their support for the pipeline. Remember that bank tellers aren’t the enemy so be nice to them but be firm; they might try to talk you out of it. Take your money to a credit union like Salal or BECU (they also charge less exorbitant fees). Encourage your friends and family to also take their money out of the 17 banks that fund DAPL. We cut institutional ties with those banks. Look at your SU ID card and flip it over, see the logo on the bottom right? “US Bank.” Why? Because SU has a deal with US Bank for the latter to provide ID cards in exchange for a monopoly on banking services on campus, rights to advertise to students, and access to “significant on-campus activities and events.” In fact, SU receives royalties depending on the “Penetration %” of the student body by US bank account creation. Student Government could present a resolution to urge Connie Kanter, VP of Finance and Business Affairs, to severe this agreement in response to the bank’s support of this pipeline. Divesting from banks is the most direct institutional route of action that takes away money from the projects that harm our communities. The City of Seattle just did this with Wells Fargo to the tune of $3 billion, so why can’t we? We support those who are on the frontlines. Water protectors have been arrested and charged with egregious crimes such as inciting a riot, which is a felony charge. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has taken on a heavy financial and environmental burden of hosting the protest camps. If you or your families can afford to, donate it to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe itself (standingrock.org), a legal defense fund for water protectors (https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/11B5z8), or the legal team fighting to stop the pipeline in court (lakotalaw.org). We stop investing in the companies that will profit off the oil flowing through this pipeline. You’ve heard it from me before but now is the time for Seattle University to divest from fossil fuels. Urge the university to commit to divesting and to inform its investment manager to remove our comingled funds that ultimately fund projects like the Dakota Access Pipeline. Sundborg says it is too hard but we must show him that the alternative is not only much harder on those who will face the detriments but is also morally wrong. Sign the petition, come to our next event in March, and join the movement. Check out SSA’s website: divestsu.weebly.com for more information. We put our bodies on the line through direct action. The partial victories that have come against the pipeline, including the original plan for an Environmental Impact Statement, did not come from either negotiating alone or from the goodwill of those in power. It was the direct action of the water protectors at Standing Rock and activists across the globe that are targeting banks, oil companies, the Army Corps of Engineers, and other guilty parties that have had the biggest impact. Now with the government’s obvious support of the pipeline, direct action takes on an even more crucial role. Stay tuned for how to get involved in direct action! —Nicolás Cruz Contact Nicolás with questions or to get plugged in at cruzn@seattleu.edu.

Better-than-expected U.S. inflation and retail sales data had backed expectations of an early rate hike by the Federal Reserve, sending the dollar index to 101.76 on Wednesday, a peak unseen since Jan. 12. It has since retreated to 100.92 in the Asia session on Thursday. The dollar also came off from a 2-1/2-week high of 114.95 marked on Wednesday against the yen, touching a low of 113.73. It was last down 0.3 percent at 113.84 yen. "The dollar is struggling as U.S. Treasury yields retreated from highs," said Junya Tanase, chief currency strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo. U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields slipped to 2.484 percent on Thursday, after climbing to a three-week high of 2.524 percent on Wednesday following the upbeat U.S. data. Data on Wednesday showed U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest gain in nearly four years, jumping 0.6 percent in January. Retail sales also outpaced expectations, increasing 0.4 percent last month compared to the analysts' poll of 0.1 percent. But some analysts also noted that the data may not be as strong as it appears, while industrial output and a gauge on home builder sentiment took unexpected spills. "Retail sales seemed to have been boosted by higher prices rather than an increase in the real consumption," said Shin Kadota, senior forex strategist at Barclays. "Investors also took profit as the dollar was trading high this week," added Kadota. Up until Tuesday, the dollar index had enjoyed a 10-session winning streak. Fed Chair Janet Yellen offered no additional insight on the timing of the central bank's next rate hike in her second day of economic testimony before Congress on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Yellen hinted more rate hikes were on the way as the jobs market has improved and inflation has shown signs of nearing the Fed's two percent goal. Markets will get another chance to check the U.S. economic pulse from another batch of data, including housing starts, building permits and the Business Outlook Survey by Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The euro edged up 0.15 percent at $1.0614, recovering from a five-week trough of $1.052 touched on Wednesday. Elsewhere, the Australian dollar hovered near a three-month high following a slightly better-than-expected reading in the country's January employment data. The Australian dollar last traded at $0.7709 after touching $0.7732, its highest since Nov. 10. Sterling last stood at $1.2460, edging up from a one-week trough of $1.2384 touched on Wednesday, knocked by slowing wage growth in the fourth quarter - bad news for British consumers facing a surge in inflation in the months ahead.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    BlackRock Inc. is looking to capitalize on Argentina’s improving fortunes, but it may be too late. The world’s largest asset manager unveiled the iShares MSCI Argentina Global Exposure ETF on Feb. 2, four months before MSCI Inc. will decide whether the country qualifies for inclusion in its emerging-market index. An upgrade from its current designation as a frontier market may prompt investors to pour $1 billion into Argentine stocks, says JPMorgan Chase & Co.  But BlackRock -- whose more than 800 ETFs make it the world’s largest provider of such funds -- will be playing catch-up as it seeks to capitalize on a stock market boom fueled by President Mauricio Macri’s dismantling of capital controls. That’s because it will have to contend with the Global X MSCI Argentina ETF -- the only other U.S.-listed ETF covering Argentine equities. The fund, which has about $100 million in assets, has already staked its claim since starting in 2011. That means even mighty BlackRock may struggle to lure buyers, said Sebastian Mercado, a strategist for ETFs at Deutsche Bank AG. “There’s always a level of loyalty for the first to market,” he said. “It’s very difficult to get a first-to-market out of the market, even if you have BlackRock. The reason for that is that first-to-market tends to encompass liquidity as well.” BlackRock need only look to its experience in Colombia to realize the importance of being first on the scene.  Fee Battles The company’s Colombia equity ETF, known as ICOL, had initially charged a lower fee than Global X’s GXG for the same country, which was unveiled four years earlier in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Global X boosted a fee waiver in July 2014 that it had first added in June 2013, moves that put GXG’s overall expense in line with that of BlackRock’s ICOL. With $100 million in assets, the GXG fund dwarfs the less than $18 million accumulated by ICOL. “Brand power is important to a certain extent,” said Edward Lopez, head of ETF Product Management at VanEck Associates. “But even if a higher-cost product has already dominated in terms of assets and trading volume, nothing else will really matter.” ARGT charges 74 basis points per fund share. BlackRock hasn’t disclosed its management fee for its Argentina ETF. BlackRock -- whose ETF will track an index that includes 25 companies categorized by MSCI as being Argentine -- is seeking to tap into soaring investor optimism in the country since Macri took office in December 2015. The nation’s benchmark index has gained 65 percent in dollar terms over the past 12 months. “ARGT saw $58 million in inflows since President Macri’s election in November 2015, reflecting renewed investor interest in the country,” said Jay Jacobs, vice president and director of research at Global X. Argentina Appeal In January, Macri jettisoned a rule that required investments remain in Argentina for at least 120 days, stoking speculation that the country is poised for an upgrade. The implementation of capital controls led MSCI to downgrade the country’s stocks to frontier market in 2009, relegating it to a universe that includes the likes of Kazakhstan and Morocco. Last year, the index provider said it would evaluate the country’s classification and will announce its decision in June. In a Morgan Stanley survey, investors said the country’s MSCI reclassification was the second-most important catalyst for Argentine stocks after price stability. Investors with $1.6 trillion in assets follow MSCI’s emerging-market index, versus an estimated $26 billion for the frontier gauge. “Although Argentina is still in the early stages of regaining access to the global market place and beginning what could be a multi-year fiscal adjustment process, the current administration has committed to structural reforms intended to help Argentina achieve more sustainable growth in the future,” said Paul Young, a spokesman for BlackRock. For buyers who are seeking exposure to Argentina but still wary of the local stock market’s low liquidity -- only an average of $20 million trades every day -- an ETF makes a lot of sense. “We don’t have boots on the ground in Argentina to know those trading markets and we manage separate accounts where our clients felt more comfortable owning dollar denominated assets versus ARS denominated assets,” said Andy Wester, a money manager at Proficio Capital Partners LLC who owns Global X’s ARGT ETF. The fund allows for liquid access to an otherwise obscure market and to the industries he thinks are more representative of the Argentine economy, like energy, he said. Almost 20 percent of the fund is made up of steel-pipe maker Tenaris, while 8 percent consists of state-controlled oil company YPF. Still, Wester suggests there may be a potential opening for BlackRock, saying it would just come down to fees. “With all else being equal, we would move into a new ETF with a lower fee,” Wester said. “Assuming ARGT wouldn’t slash their fees to be competitive, that is.” © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

Two days of testimony this week from a more hawkish and confident Fed Chair Janet Yellen, and stronger-than-expected retail sales and consumer inflation data Wednesday, combined to move some expectations for a Fed rate hike slightly forward. JPMorgan, in fact, said it now sees the Fed hiking in May, rather than June, as most of Wall Street expects. Market expectations moved up slightly to about a 30 percent chance of a hike as early as March. "[Yellen] made it very clear that the economic data matters, and the trajectory of monetary policy is predicated on better economic data, along with inflation moving higher. We're going to be watching the data releases that come out tomorrow," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. Thursday's reports include weekly jobless claims, housing starts and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing, all at 8:30 a.m. ET. There are also earnings reports from Alexion, Encana, TransCanada, Dean Foods, Wendy's, Cabela's, GNC Holdings, Time and others before the opening bell. Con Ed, Allscripts Healthcare, WebMD, Yamana Gold and TrueCar, are among companies reporting after the close. As Fed expectations have risen, so have Treasury yields, with the two-year note yield at 1.24 percent late Wednesday and the 10-year at 2.49 percent. Stocks surged Wednesday, closing at a record high for a fifth day. The S&P 500 was up 11 at 2,349, while the Dow was up 107 at 20,611. The Nasdaq was up 36 points at 5,819. "Obviously all eyes are on the White House, who is going to be Labor secretary," said Krosby. Andrew Puzder withdrew, after it appeared he would be rejected by the Senate. Krosby said the market has chosen not to focus on controversies in the Trump White House, like the resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and reports about Trump campaign contacts with Russia. "The market has just zeroed in on growth, pro-business, rolling back regulation and as long as the market believes this is his agenda, and he is going to follow through, the market has just embraced that," she said. "It's a market that for so many years has wanted a pro-business backdrop. It finally gets that, and I think it sees the issues coming from the White House, personnel issues, as just a zig with a zag," she said. Krosby said it was a positive the VIX, the CBOE volatility index, jumped 11 percent Wednesday to just near 12. She said a higher VIX would remove some concerns that there is too much complacency in the market. "Today the victory was for the financials, taking another leg up on the back of a higher 10-year yield and continued potential for scaled back regulation," she said. The S&P financial sector rose 0.7 percent Wednesday, and was up 3.1 percent week to date. "Also the president seems to have moderated some of his views with regard to China. Those are the sort of things that have worried investors," she said, noting his friendlier tone with China and a report that he was not likely to label China a currency manipulator. show chapters Many fundamental reasons to take advantage of the market: Kate Moore    21 Hours Ago | 03:15 Patti DommCNBC Markets Editor To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Thursday, February 16, 2017 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Archive thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  Hong Kong police struggle to stop brokerage hacking spree February 16, 2017, Thursday HONG KONG: Hong Kong police are struggling to deal with digital pump-and-dump schemes targeting brokerages – a little-known type of computer-generated fraud that surged in the Chinese territory last year. Although the money involved was small – only about US$20 million worth of shares – there were 81 such incidents reported in 2016, more than triple the number in 2015, according to police. In the scheme, criminals invest in thinly traded penny stocks and then manipulate their share prices by ordering trades from hacked brokerage accounts. They earn profits by selling before the fraudulent trades are reported. After last year’s cyber-heist of US$81 million at Bangladesh’s central bank and a series of hacks of ATM’s around the world, authorities fear such pump-and-dump schemes could be increasingly used for electronic theft. Hong Kong is a favoured place for such attacks because of the number of thinly-traded penny stocks in the territory and because its securities industry has fallen behind other financial centers in defending against cyber fraud. At least seven brokers and eight banks have been targeted in Hong Kong, including HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank of China International (BOCI) Securities, according to regulators and people familiar with confidential investigations. A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment. A spokeswoman for BOCI Securities said he could not comment on its case but the brokerage would continue to invest in IT security. “If you ask regulators in the industry what is the number one threat, not surprisingly it’s all about cyber attacks,” Ashley Alder, CEO of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and chairman of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, said in a speech to the local legislature last week. “We’ve seen that happen not only in banking but also at brokers in Hong Kong, in particular recent attacks to do with basically hijacking share trading accounts.”  Such schemes surfaced more than a decade ago in the United States. Charles Schwab Corp, E*Trade Financial Corp and JP Morgan Chase & Co. were identified as victims of these schemes in a 2006 complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The pace of attacks reported in the United States has slowed in recent years after big brokerages implemented a variety of strategies to thwart the hacks, said John Reed Stark, a former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Office of Internet Enforcement. Some use algorithms to identify and halt unusual trading activity, others scrutinise Internet traffic for orders coming from suspicious servers and one stopped permitting customers to use its online trading platform from buying penny stocks, said Stark, who now runs cyber-security consulting firm John Reed Stark Consulting LLC. But such protections are rare in Hong Kong, where the government has only recently started suggesting security improvements to banks and brokerages which have traditionally considered stock trading to be low-risk. The Hong Kong SFC last year told firms to increase surveillance of client transactions and data protection. Authorities believe that hackers accessed brokerage accounts using stolen or guessed passwords, according to investigators. This might have been thwarted if they were protected with two-factor authentication, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has said. Two-factor authentication typically includes a password and a piece of information only the user has, for instance an electronic token with changing numbers. “Hong Kong is being targeted because they have not instituted the same cyber protections that we see in the US and certain parts of Europe,” said Jeff Cramer, a former US prosecutor. Cramer, who is managing director with cyber-security investigations firm Berkeley Research Group, said he expects to see more attacks in Hong Kong and perhaps other Asian nations, including China, Japan and South Korea that are also behind in cyber security. Such pump and dump cases have proven tough to crack in the United States because the masterminds are typically overseas, using surrogates and pseudonyms to make investments. Brokerages are typically not required to go public when they are hacked, so cases often only surface when the government files a complaint against suspected cyber criminals, or the hack results in litigation. The attack involving BOCI Securities year became public after it was sued by a customer that claimed its account was breached. Trading firm Fast Track Holdings Limited alleged in court documents that somebody hacked into its brokerage account on the afternoon of September 23 using a valid user ID and password. Within 18 minutes, the intruder had emptied the account by spending HKUS$38 million to buy 49 million shares of thinly traded Pa Shun Pharmaceutical, according to Fast Track. — Reuters What do you think of this story?

Africa   17 banks to be prosecuted in S. Africa for collusion Source: Xinhua   2017-02-16 03:14:20             Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- The South African Competition Commission said Wednesday they have referred 17 banks to their tribunal for prosecution of collusion. Among the 17 banks, 3 of them are South Africa's biggest banks who face prosecution of collusion for price fixing of the South African rand. The country's consumer watchdog has been investigating the banks for the past two years and has resolved to refer the case to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution. The Competition Commission said the banks manipulated the price for bids and offers through an agreement to abstain from trading and creating fake bids and offers at given times. The collusion happened through groups chats. The South African Banks involved in collusion includes Standard Bank of South Africa, Absa and Investec. The foreign banks involved are JP Morgan Chase Bank, Barclays Capital, Barclays Bank, HSBC Bank and Bank of America Merril Lynch International, among others. Tembinkosi Bonakele, one of the Commissioners from the Competition Commission said "the referral of this matter to the tribunal marks a key milestone in this case as it now affords the banks an opportunity to answer for themselves." The Commission said the banks had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving U.S. dollar and rand currency pair. According to the Commission, some banks used trading platforms such as the Reuters currency trading platform to carry out their collusive activities. Some used Bloomberg instant messaging system (chatroom), telephone conversation and had meetings to coordinate their bilateral and multilateral collusive trading activities. The banks coordinated trading times and helped each other to reach desired prices. The Commission applied to the Tribunal to declare that the 17 banks as having contravened the Competition Act and are liable for the payment of an administrative penalty equal to 10 percent of their annual turnover. South African ruling party, African National Congress spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the actions by the banks are an attack on the constitutional mandate of the South African Reserve Bank to protect the value of the South African currency. "The African National Congress takes an extremely dim view of the activities of the listed banks, understanding the banking sector as being instrumental to our quest for economic growth and development," he said.

Towing: Celebrating 29 years Home News Business Fiat may get second chance at Detroit deal once GM... | 12 hours ago  |  Vote 0    0 Fiat may get second chance at Detroit deal once GM exits Europe Waterloo Region Record By Tommaso Ebhardt and David Welch General Motors's proposed sale of its European business could create an opening for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to revive its long-standing and one-sided effort to combine with the American carmaker. Shedding Opel and U.K. nameplate Vauxhall would eliminate GM's overlap with Fiat in Europe and allow GM to replace money-losing operations with Fiat's profitable marques. Fiat chief executive officer Sergio Marchionne is still open to a deal even though GM rejected his overtures in 2015 and his focus at the moment is on meeting financial targets, according to people with knowledge of the carmaker's strategy. If PSA Group, manufacturer of Peugeot and Citroen vehicles, succeeds in buying Opel, "it would certainly fuel additional M&A speculation, including possibly Fiat taking another shot at GM," Jose Asumendi, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase in London, said in a note to clients. Fiat shares rose as much as 3.3 per cent on Wednesday. The gain extended the surge into record figures that began on Tuesday after GM said it's considering selling Opel and Vauxhall to France's PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars. Marchionne, who completed Fiat's acquisition of U.S.-based Chrysler in 2014, has often said that automakers should merge to become more profitable, arguing that billions of dollars are wasted by the industry on creating multiple versions of the same technology. High costs for developing more energy-efficient cars and adding self-driving features are putting pressure on traditional automakers, which also face threats from new rivals such as Tesla Inc. Even with a potential opening for a deal, Marchionne is focused on reaching operational targets, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the information is private. At the Detroit car show in January, Marchionne suggested that President Donald Trump might support a tie-up between Fiat and GM, although the CEO later downplayed his statement. Representatives at Fiat Chrysler and GM declined to comment. On Wednesday, GM CEO Mary Barra and company president Dan Ammann were in Germany for a number of visits in a bid to win political support for the proposed sale of Opel to PSA Group. The sale would mark GM's exit from Europe after losing about $9.1 billion (all figures U.S.) in the region since emerging from bankruptcy in 2009. That creates a tough hurdle for any deal that would expose the company to the region's saturated and mature auto market. Even if it loses Opel's one million in annual deliveries, the company is not interested in a merger with Fiat or any other major automaker, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because the information is private. GM's management believes the company has plenty of size even without Opel. Still, a GM-Fiat deal could be possible down the line, Banca Akros analyst Gabriele Gambarova wrote in a note to clients. "The move doesn't automatically mean that GM is ready" for a deal with Fiat, he said. "But it can create better conditions for a possible tie-up." Marchionne has focused on completing an ambitious business plan that would put Fiat on stronger footing ever since his public courtship of GM in 2015 ended fruitlessly. His targets for 2018 include more than doubling profit and turning 4.6 billion euros ($4.9 billion) of debt into at least 4 billion euros of cash. His efforts have paid off: Fiat's shares have almost doubled in the past year, giving the company a market value of 16.5 billion euros. Investors have been bidding up the stock as Fiat has reported better-than-expected financial results and expressed higher confidence in reaching its goals. While the stock gains have made Fiat more expensive, the company's value is still less than a third of GM's $55.8 billion.

Bloomberg News reports that The Competition Commission identified banks including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, HSBC and Nomura as having participated in price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand since at least 2007. It referred the case to an antitrust tribunal, concluding an investigation that began almost two years ago. ''The respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times,” the commission said in an e-mailed statement Wednesday. “They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives.” Hit the link below to access the complete Bloomberg News article: South Africa Regulator Says Banks Colluded on Forex Trades UBS France Said to Be Charged With Harassment Amid Tax Probe And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is...

Now, that volatility could be spurred by the Trump administration. Hawkish foreign policy positions, coupled with looser domestic regulation, could create an avalanche of selling from two of the biggest Treasury buyers: big U.S. banks and China. Since the financial crisis, banks have been stockpiling Treasurys because they qualify as "safe" assets that count toward required regulatory capital levels. U.S. commercial banks now hold $2.4 trillion in government debt and agency securities, more than double the total from nine years ago, according to the St. Louis Fed. But House Republicans — with the support of the administration — are pushing to roll back parts of the Dodd-Frank regulations that were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. That means banks could get a reprieve from those capital level requirements, and they could reduce their Treasury holdings as a result. In a report, RBC managing director and banking analyst Gerard Cassidy calculates the 24 largest bank holding companies already hold $100 billion in excess capital, with Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase having the highest dollar amount. As regulation eases, the capital that was once used as a large cushion against a future recession could be funneled into stock buybacks. Those Treasury-heavy portfolios "will certainly be the source of cash to use to buy back stock," Cassidy wrote in an e-mail to CNBC. Banks have already been slowly selling off the debt, which causes yields to rise. Between the middle of 2013 and 2014, Bank of America's holdings of U.S. Treasurys grew from $2.9 billion to $58 billion. At the end of 2016, that figure had dropped to $48 billion, according to the bank's earnings. Wells Fargo's $26 billion Treasury balance in September is down nearly 30 percent from a year ago. Not all banks break out the specific balance, but the totals as of the third quarter of 2016 range from $23 billion (Morgan Stanley) to $111 billion (Citigroup). The bigger risk: China But banks are just one source of possible selling en masse. China is a creditor of a different magnitude: The country held $1.05 trillion in Treasurys as of November, down by $215 billion from a year earlier. It dumped $41 billion in U.S. debt in October alone, a move that relinquished its ranking as the largest foreign creditor to the United States. One reason for the country selling U.S. debt previously was its need to raise cash to prop up its currency, the yuan, after years of seeking to devalue it to make its exports more attractive. Its intervention in the currency markets led President Donald Trump, while campaigning, to label China a currency manipulator and threaten a 45 percent tariff on products made in China but sold in the United States. Goldman Sachs senior political economist Alec Phillips writes that if the White House pursues a unilateral policy on tariffs on Chinese products, one possible avenue for China to retaliate would be to dump even more U.S. Treasurys. "China would retaliate swiftly against even a slight increase in tariffs," according to the report, citing Tu Xinquan, dean of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. Now it appears the administration may take a broader approach to foreign currencies. According to The Wall Street Journal, the Commerce Department could pursue a blanket policy against currency manipulation by any country in an effort to avoid singling out China and keep the relationship intact. But if a creditor of that magnitude is angered, the Treasury market could be the first place it looks to send a message back to the United States. — CNBC's Stephanie Dhue contributed to this report. show chapters Cramer: Why it's critical to watch boring bonds to detect the economy's next move    Thursday, 9 Feb 2017 | 6:40 PM ET | 14:30 Kayla TauscheCNBC Correspondent Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change C --- US 10-YR --- US 2-YR --- US 5-YR --- AGG --- BND --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

The DSO will present the world premiere of a yet-unnamed piece composed by Blanchard marking the 50th anniversary of Detroit’s tumultuous summer of 1967. (Please note: Blanchard does not perform on the piece, which is scored for orchestra and voice.) Kazem Abdullah will conduct the program, which also includes a performance by Carter and Jeffrey Mumford’s cello concerto titled of fields unfolding…echoing depths of resonant light with guest cellist Christine Lamprea, First Prize winner of the 2013 Sphinx Competition. A performance by the Brazeal Dennard Chorale will also be featured. The premiere of Blanchard’s piece is an element of the DSO’s partnership with Detroit 67: Looking Back to MOVE FORWARD, a multi-year community engagement project of the Detroit Historical Society that brings together diverse voices and communities around the effects of an historic crisis to find their place in the present and inspire the future. “The DSO’s Classical Roots Celebration is an annual tradition, celebrating African American musicians and composers whose contributions transcend time and place while rooting us deeply in our community,” says Marlowe Stoudamire, Director of the Detroit 67 Project. “The debut of Terence Blanchard’s piece demonstrates the role art can play in making history relevant in the present as we come together to tell our story and inspire our future.” Co-chairing the Classical Roots Celebration are Jason Tinsley and Therese Peace, with the support of more than 30 Detroit-area volunteers and corporate leaders committed to the Classical Roots mission. About the Honorees Terence Blanchard has established himself as one of the most influential jazz musicians and film score masters of his generation. With more than 31 albums to his credit, Blanchard is a five-time Grammy Award-winner and a Golden Globe nominee. He has composed scores for more than 50 films, including Lucasfilm’s 2013 historical drama Red Tails, about African-American pilots in World War II. Blanchard’s Champion: An Opera in Jazz will receive its east coast premiere in 2017 at The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC. In Detroit, Blanchard serves as the DSO’s Fred A. & Barbara M. Erb Jazz Creative Chair and the regular host of the Paradise Jazz Series. Regina Carter is considered the foremost jazz violinist of her generation. A Sony Masterworks artist, Regina was a 2006 recipient of a MacArthur Foundation “genius” grant. A master of improvisation, she has released numerous albums as a leader and has collaborated with artists as diverse as Wynton Marsalis, Lauryn Hill, Max Roach, Joe Jackson, and Dolly Parton. Carter is a native Detroiter, proud Cass Technical High School alumna, and former DSO Civic Youth Ensembles student.

They also accused of using trading chat rooms to co-ordinate times for the sale of rand or stop selling for a time in order to manipulate prices from 2007.  “This is a big deal‚” said market commentator and trader Simon Brown  He said it was a major announcement because “our Competition Commission are good at what they do“. When it comes to price fixing‚ “they are not often wrong on everything from bread to bicycles“. He also said the rand affected the petrol price and this is also why accusations of manipulating currency have implications and huge interest for South Africans.  The commission said in a press release on Wednesday afternoon that it was “seeking an order from the Tribunal declaring that the respondents have contravened the Competition Act“. It is “seeking an order declaring that the Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited‚ BNP Paribas‚ JP Morgan Chase & Co‚ JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A‚ Investec Ltd‚ Standard New York Securities Inc.‚ HSBC Bank Plc‚ Standard Chartered Bank‚ Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd‚ Commerzbank AG; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited‚ Nomura International Plc.‚ Macquarie Bank Limited are liable for the payment of an administrative penalty equal to 10% of their annual turnover“.

There is a lot of dodgy stuff.” Banks never admit they were wrong but pay large non-admission of guilt fines‚ said Brown.  The three local banks: Absa‚ Standard Bank and Investec share prices barely moved after the announcement. Brown said this may be partly as the investigation by the tribunal would take a long time. “I am expecting a Twitter storm. The banks are under huge pressure in South Africa.” Most foreign banks had local financial assets and offices that could be attached if they were eventually fined making it not so easy to ignore local competition authorities. -TMG Digital Email Print Tweet Back to top Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Steve Symington, Dan Caplinger, and Tim Brugger (TMFSymington) Feb 15, 2017 at 9:21AM One of the greatest fears of many investors is the potential for buying a stock at its peak share price. After all, the oft-repeated idea of buying low and selling high makes sense on the surface. But all too often -- and while it might seem counterintuitive -- the best deals are companies whose stocks have a strong history of share-price appreciation.  That's not to say finding those deals is easy. So to help get you started, we asked three top Motley Fool contributors to each pick a stock trading near its 52-week high that they believe investors would be wise to buy this month. Read on to see why they chose Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Image source: Getty Images Investing in the future of gaming Steve Symington (Activision Blizzard): Shares of Activision Blizzard popped more than 16% in a single day last week, touching an all-time high after the company's record fourth-quarter 2016 report. But despite drawing 447 million monthly active users (MAUs) last quarter, and having consumers spending an incredible 43 billion hours playing and watching Activision Blizzard content last year, I think the video-game titan is only just getting started.  For one, Blizzard achieved record fourth-quarter MAUs of 41 million. Overwatch became Blizzard's fastest-ever game to reach more than 25 million players globally, breaking the previous launch-year record for unit sales set by Diablo III in 2012. And even Blizzard's established World of Warcraft franchise managed to grow MAUs 20% year over year during the quarter, with the help of its new Legion expansion. Meanwhile, the Activision studio set its own record with 51 million MAUs in Q4, as Call of Duty capped its eighth consecutive year as the world's No. 1 console franchise. Activision also began to spread its wings last quarter with the debut of its new Skylanders Academy TV series through a partnership with Netflix.  One point of potential concern: MAUs at mobile gaming specialist King Digital -- which Activision Blizzard acquired for $5.9 billion early last year -- declined slightly on a year-over-year basis in Q4, to 355 million. But even then, King Digital simultaneously drove better per-user engagement and investment and still commanded two of the top 10 highest-grossing mobile app store titles for the 13th straight quarter -- an extraordinary demonstration of relative stability, given the ebbs and flows of the often fickle mobile gaming space. All told, revenue last quarter grew 49% year over year, to $1.45 billion, while adjusted earnings per share rose 160%, to $0.65. Activision Blizzard also generated 71% growth in operating cash flow last year, to $2.2 billion; increased its annual dividend by 15%, to $0.30 per share; and approved a new two-year, $1 billion stock repurchase plan. Add to that the potential for incremental revenue from other growth initiatives, including integration of in-game advertising, e-sports, and consumer products, and I'm convinced Activision will continue setting new highs going forward. Rendering beautiful market-beating gains Tim Brugger (Adobe Systems): Following a slow but steady increase in its stock price since it announced record quarterly and fiscal 2016 revenue on Dec. 15, Adobe is still at or near its 52-week high of $116.90. Not exactly a value investor's dream, right? But when investors consider how Adobe has consistently posted strong results, it becomes apparent that CEO Shantanu Narayen had it right all along. Narayen took a gamble: He shut down Adobe's software sales approach and focused on a more sustainable subscription model. Die-hard Adobe Photoshop users weren't amused, but fast-forward to the present and those same fans are kicking themselves if they didn't buy Adobe stock. Adobe ended fiscal 2016 with record revenue of $5.85 billion, and that's not even the best part. Of those sales, nearly 70% -- $4 billion -- were generated by the subscription-based annualized recurring revenue (ARR) from its Digital Media unit. Last fiscal year's ARR was a 28% improvement over 2015. The emphasis on ARR offers several advantages to investors, not the least of which is that it builds a relatively reliable, and predictable, sales foundation. That equates to fewer wild quarterly revenue fluctuations, which in turn limits Adobe stock's risk because if its relative stability. It's also less costly to service existing customers than rely exclusively on new sales. Not surprisingly, Adobe's expense increases are well below its top-line growth. Adobe shares are up 53% in the past year and over 12% in 2017, and it's absolutely still worth buying. This Wall Street bank has more room to run Dan Caplinger (JPMorgan Chase): The financial sector has been one of the biggest winners in the aftermath of the presidential election in November, and in the opening weeks of the Trump administration, the new president has already issued an executive order that will have the end result of reducing regulation on big banks. That's great news for JPMorgan Chase, which has already been rising because of anticipation of higher interest rates and the corresponding profit boost for the company's retail banking business. It isn't certain that Congress will follow through and repeal Dodd-Frank banking restrictions in their entirety. But the potential for JPMorgan Chase to boost the size of its lending portfolio and proprietary trading business could lead to unanticipated profit growth, and already, CEO Jamie Dimon has shown his support for the president's policies on issues ranging from bank regulation to tax reform. JPMorgan Chase has plenty of risks, and the potential threat of growing tensions in the global economy related to trade could have an adverse impact on its international business. However, few banks have successfully read changing trends better than Dimon and JPMorgan Chase, and as long as the bank keeps its fingers on the pulse of the geopolitical and macroeconomic climate, it has the ability to keep climbing despite its past share-price gains.  Dan Caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

New look for Sunday World Thu Feb 16 11:39:44 SAST 2017 Standard Bank‚ Absa‚ Investec face prosecution‚ huge fines over price fixing allegations 2017-02-15 17:25:44.0 | Katharine Child | Three of South Africa’s biggest banks — Standard Bank‚ Absa and Investec — and 14 international banks have been referred to the competition tribunal for price fixing.      RELATED ARTICLES A must-see musical for all Sakhumzi manager had a bright smile for all DJ Sbu leaving Vuma FM Zuma's son launches scathing attack on Gordhan‚ Jonas and De Klerk The splendid shades of Jozi's steamy nightlife Sakhumzi Restaurant murder accused appears in court They are accused by the Competition Commission of manipulating the price of the rand when selling and buying dollars- through making fictitious orders to buy and sell rand to change supply of the currency. They also accused of using trading chat rooms to co-ordinate times for the sale of rand or stop selling for a time in order to manipulate prices from 2007. “This is a big deal‚” said market commentator and trader Simon Brown He said it was a major announcement because “our Competition Commission are good at what they do“. When it comes to price fixing‚ “they are not often wrong on everything from bread to bicycles“. He also said the rand affected the petrol price and this is also why accusations of manipulating currency have implications and huge interest for South Africans. The commission said in a press release on Wednesday afternoon that it was “seeking an order from the Tribunal declaring that the respondents have contravened the Competition Act“. It is “seeking an order declaring that the Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited‚ BNP Paribas‚ JP Morgan Chase & Co‚ JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A‚ Investec Ltd‚ Standard New York Securities Inc.‚ HSBC Bank Plc‚ Standard Chartered Bank‚ Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd‚ Commerzbank AG; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited‚ Nomura International Plc.‚ Macquarie Bank Limited are liable for the payment of an administrative penalty equal to 10% of their annual turnover“. Brown said‚ “that list of banks involved is so long‚ one almost asks‚ ‘who is not the list?’“ He said that banking scandals had become common gobally. “We have seen so many of them‚ with accusations of banks manipulating the gold price and LIBOR rates in Britain. There is a lot of dodgy stuff.” Banks never admit they were wrong but pay large non-admission of guilt fines‚ said Brown. The three local banks: Absa‚ Standard Bank and Investec share prices barely moved after the announcement. Brown said this may be partly as the investigation by the tribunal would take a long time. “I am expecting a Twitter storm. The banks are under huge pressure in South Africa.” Most foreign banks had local financial assets and offices that could be attached if they were eventually fined making it not so easy to ignore local competition authorities. -TMG Digital Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Search Primary Menu Skip to content FRONT PAGE NEWS SOCIETY BUSINESS ECONOMY POLITICS EDUCATION SCI-TECH SPORTS TRAVEL 日本語 Japan's economy running along on half-empty fuel tank Bloomberg -- Feb 15 Japan's economy is cruising along, at least by its own recent standards, with real growth clocking in at 1 percent in 2016. It may have reached top speed. Real gross domestic product expanded for a fourth consecutive quarter at the end of 2016, the best run in more than three years. A number of indicators are flashing green as global demand strengthens and last year's fiscal stimulus kicks in. Exports rose in December for the first time in more than a year, and in the fourth quarter industrial production gained the most in nearly three years. "Japan is in the best position it's been in in four years," said Izumi Devalier, head of Japan economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who expects a 1.5 percent expansion in real GDP this year--nearly twice the potential growth rate of 0.8 percent. Her forecast ranks the second-highest among those compiled by Bloomberg, behind JPMorgan's 1.6 percent. The median is for 1 percent growth. The problem, though, is that near-term growth depends on external demand and fiscal stimulus, economists say, meaning the upside and growth horizon are limited. Japan also faces the risk that U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist rhetoric is soon transformed into policy that disrupts global trade, while the effects of last year's stimulus are expected to fade by the second quarter of next year. "Unless domestic private consumption picks up the economy is unlikely to gain traction," said Atsushi Takeda, an economist at Itochu Corp. in Tokyo. A hit to exports would leave Japan's beleaguered consumers to pick up the slack, something they've shown little inclination to do since a sales-tax increase in early 2014. Wages are rising only slightly, even with the tightest labor market in decades.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 17 Comments Moneycontrol Bureau Tata Motors shares crashed 10.6 percent intraday Wednesday (on top of 3.7 percent loss in previous session) as brokerage houses worried about company's hedging losses that may likely to continue for next 3-4 quarters. Analysts slashed target price of the stock sharply due to disappointing set of earnings in the quarter ended December 2016. CLSA has downgraded the stock to sell and lowered target price to Rs 405 from Rs 650 after cutting FY18-19 EPS estimates by 25-31 percent due to dismal performance in Q3FY17. Management commentary on JLR margins has weakened significantly, it says, adding hedging losses are likely to continue at high levels for longer. JPMorgan also reduced its target price on the stock to Rs 570 from Rs 610 after cutting FY17/18 JLR EBIT estimates by 26 percent/17 percent and consolidated earnings estimates by 33 percent/23 percent. It advises buying on dip as margin miss was not as bad as it seems. Edelweiss downgraded the stock to hold from buy, with reduced target price at Rs 501 (from Rs 604) after lowering FY17/18 EBIDTA estimates by 35/25 percent to Rs 29,500/38,500 crore to reflect weaker margins. The commercial vehicle and luxury car maker's third quarter profit on consolidated basis fell sharply by 96 percent year-on-year to Rs 112 crore , impacted by big loss in domestic business and operational weakness in JLR due to adverse product & regional mix and higher discounts. UK subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover's net income during the quarter dropped 62 percent year-on-year to 167 million pound as operating profit fell 26.7 percent to 611 million pound and margin contracted 510 basis points to 9.3 percent on year-on-year basis, which both were far below estimates. Edelweiss says JLR, management indicated that it can take 4-5 quarters to reach 14-16 percent margin trajectory and average discounts are likely to remain higher in 2017 versus 2016/2015. JLR’s volume momentum will be sustained by series of new launches/upgrades from January 2017 (new Discovery, XF in China, mid-size Range Rover and smaller crossover E-Pace), the company says. For India, Tata Motors indicated that efforts intensified to improve profitability and regain market share in commercial vehicle; and capex is expected to remain at Rs 3,500 crore till FY19 for various product development program. On standalone basis (i.e. domestic business), the company posted a big loss of Rs 1,046 crore during the quarter against Rs 137 crore in Q3FY16 and that was quite higher compared with Rs 500 crore estimated by analysts. In previous quarter (July-September), the loss was Rs 631 crore. Other brokerage houses also cut target price, though they retained their rating on the stock. Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on the stock, with reduced target price at Rs 630 from Rs 680 after cutting FY17/FY18/FY19 EPS estimates by 26 percent/15 percent/12 percent. The brokerage house has built in slightly lower margins to account for higher incentives. It expects moderating forex losses from June onwards and sees progressive reduction in hedging losses. Macquarie also retained outperform rating but cut target to Rs 575 from Rs 630 after lowering FY17/18/19 consolidated EBITDA estimates by 20 percent/10 percent/7.0 percent. Most negative factors that impacted Q3 earnings are transitory, it feels. It expects stronger sales growth & margin for JLR in FY18. Deutsche Bank, which has a buy call on Tata Motors with reduced target at Rs 535 from Rs 575, says currency gains remained elusive but management looks upbeat on new models. It expects margin to normalise in medium term. Bank of America Merrill Lynch also retained buy call but cut target price to Rs 560 from Rs 575. The brokerage house forecasts consolidated EPS CAGR of 41 percent over FY16-19. It feels weaker GBP will remain a tailwind to margins in FY18/19 and pre-buy for commercial vehicles should help margins in Q4. Citi says correction in stock price is a buying opportunity as its feels details reveal a brighter picture, though headline is weak. JLR's favourable FS trends should aid in healthy volume growth, it believes. The research firm has a buy call on the stock, with a target price at Rs 660. Kotak expects gradual improvement in JLR EBITDA margin as forex hedge rate comes closer to spot rates in next two years. Volume growth will likely remain strong led by a fresh and young model line-up, the brokerage house says while maintaining buy rating on attractive valuations but lowered target price to Rs 550 (from Rs 600 earlier). At 09:25 hours IST, the stock was quoting at Rs 445.70, down Rs 41.10, or 8.44 percent amid high volumes on the BSE.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 15 February 2017 | MYT 1:14 PM Hong Kong police struggle to stop brokerage hacking spree Hotbed of cybercrime activity: At least seven brokers and eight banks have been targeted in Hong Kong, including HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank of China International (BOCI) Securities, according to regulators and people familiar with confidential investigations. — Reuters HONG KONG: Hong Kong police are struggling to deal with digital pump-and-dump schemes targeting brokerages – a little-known type of computer-generated fraud that surged in the Chinese territory last year.  Although the money involved was small – only about US$20mil (RM89mil) worth of shares – there were 81 such incidents reported in 2016, more than triple the number in 2015, according to police.  In the scheme, criminals invest in thinly traded penny stocks and then manipulate their share prices by ordering trades from hacked brokerage accounts. They earn profits by selling before the fraudulent trades are reported.  After last year's cyber-heist of US$81mil (RM360.45mil) at Bangladesh's central bank and a series of hacks of ATM's around the world, authorities fear such pump-and-dump schemes could be increasingly used for electronic theft.  Hong Kong is a favoured place for such attacks because of the number of thinly-traded penny stocks in the territory and because its securities industry has fallen behind other financial centres in defending against cyber fraud.  At least seven brokers and eight banks have been targeted in Hong Kong, including HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank of China International (BOCI) Securities, according to regulators and people familiar with confidential investigations.  A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment.  A spokeswoman for BOCI Securities said he could not comment on its case but the brokerage would continue to invest in IT security.  "If you ask regulators in the industry what is the number one threat, not surprisingly it’s all about cyberattacks," Ashley Alder, CEO of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and chairman of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, said in a speech to the local legislature last week.  "We've seen that happen not only in banking but also at brokers in Hong Kong, in particular recent attacks to do with basically hijacking share trading accounts."  Such schemes surfaced more than a decade ago in the United States. Charles Schwab Corp, E*Trade Financial Corp and JP Morgan Chase & Co were identified as victims of these schemes in a 2006 complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The pace of attacks reported in the United States has slowed in recent years after big brokerages implemented a variety of strategies to thwart the hacks, said John Reed Stark, a former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Office of Internet Enforcement.  Some use algorithms to identify and halt unusual trading activity, others scrutinise Internet traffic for orders coming from suspicious servers and one stopped permitting customers to use its online trading platform from buying penny stocks, said Stark, who now runs cyber-security consulting firm John Reed Stark Consulting LLC.  But such protections are rare in Hong Kong, where the government has only recently started suggesting security improvements to banks and brokerages which have traditionally considered stock trading to be low-risk.  Two-factor authentication  The Hong Kong SFC last year told firms to increase surveillance of client transactions and data protection.  Authorities believe that hackers accessed brokerage accounts using stolen or guessed passwords, according to investigators. This might have been thwarted if they were protected with two-factor authentication, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has said.  Two-factor authentication typically includes a password and a piece of information only the user has, for instance an electronic token with changing numbers.  "Hong Kong is being targeted because they have not instituted the same cyber protections that we see in the US and certain parts of Europe," said Jeff Cramer, a former US prosecutor.  Cramer, who is managing director with cybersecurity investigations firm Berkeley Research Group, said he expects to see more attacks in Hong Kong and perhaps other Asian nations, including China, Japan and South Korea that are also behind in cyber security.  Fighting back  Such pump and dump cases have proven tough to crack in the United States because the masterminds are typically overseas, using surrogates and pseudonyms to make investments.  Brokerages are typically not required to go public when they are hacked, so cases often only surface when the government files a complaint against suspected cyber criminals, or the hack results in litigation.  The attack involving BOCI Securities year became public after it was sued by a customer that claimed its account was breached.  Trading firm Fast Track Holdings Limited alleged in court documents that somebody hacked into its brokerage account on the afternoon of Sept 23 using a valid user ID and password. Within 18 minutes, the intruder had emptied the account by spending HK$38mil (RM21.79mil) to buy 49 million shares of thinly traded Pa Shun Pharmaceutical, according to Fast Track.  The stock soared more than 30% after the purchase, which was made at a 36% premium to the previous day's closing price, Reuters data shows.  BOCI alerted Fast Track of the suspicious activity an hour later, but it has said in court documents it should not be held financially responsible, saying it found no evidence its systems had been compromised.  Peter Pang, Pa Shun's CFO, told Reuters the management "would keep an eye to the incident and report to the regulators and the public when necessary".  One person familiar with the case said Fast Track's management believes the incident was a pump and dump scam and that Pa Shun was targeted because it is thinly-traded, but it remained unclear who was responsible.  Fast Track's directors did not respond to requests for comment. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Stocks , Technology Related Stories You May Be Interested China’s Huawei, Philippine telco join forces in 5G deal Toshiba shares tumble as bigger stake in chip unit likely up for sale Spotify expands with World Trade Centre move French President Hollande demands election cyber-security measures Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Others Also Read Butterworth Art Walk in alley aimed at getting visitors to stop and ponder How algorithms (secretly) run the world Man United will give Europa tilt full focus, says Mourinho advertisement Latest News Bank Negara to work closely with Cabinet on forex losses Carpool and save with GrabShare DBS profit slumps to two-year low on oil and gas bad debts Maybank Indonesia posts record earnings in FY16 Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: The universe expands Nokia 3310 on the comeback trail: report Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Stand up to cancer Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple: study Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

The Zoning Committee had also unanimously rejected the request. Marsha Lilley, the committee's chairwoman, said during Tuesday's meeting the group prefers Avangrid use a bank based in the U.S., if not in Illinois. According to documentation placed in the County Board packet, Credit Agricole is ranked second among European banks by Tier One Capital. JP Morgan Chase is ranked No. 1 in the U.S. Avangrid was attempting to change its existling leter of credit with the county. County approves to change polling places The board approved changing election polling places to allow easier accessibility for voters. Princeton Precinct 3/6, previously at St. Matthew's Church, and Princeton Precinct 4/5, at the Bureau County Farm Bureau building, will now be located at the Princeton Moose Lodge on North Euclid Avenue. Selby Precinct 2/3 at St. Mary's Church Hall will now be located at the VFW building in DePue. The new polling places will not include steps down into a voting room or the use of a non-compliant ramp, making it easier for voters to cast their ballots on Election Day. In other news, the board: • Approved the appointment of Kevin Buckman to fill an unexpired term for Buda Fire trustee opened by Raymond Behrens' retirement. • Approved an engineering agreement with Hutchinson Engineering of Peoria to replace an existing bridge structure over Smith Ditch in Gold Township. Bureau County's cost is $43,800 in federal funds for 80 percent of the preliminary engineering cost, as well as $10,950 of local funds for 20 percent of the engineering costs. • Approved to change the regular meeting in April to Wednesday, April 12, due to a conflict with annual township meetings.

Homepage Follow Sign in / Sign up Nafeez AhmedBlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Investigative journalist, recovering academic, tracking the Crisis of Civilization patreon.com/nafeez Feb 10 How the Trump regime was manufactured by a war inside the Deep State A systemic crisis in the global Deep System has driven the violent radicalization of a Deep State faction By Nafeez Ahmed A special report published by INSURGE INTELLIGENCE, a crowdfunded investigative journalism project for people and planet. Support us to keep digging where others fear to tread. President Donald Trump is not fighting a war on the establishment: he’s fighting a war to protect the establishment from itself, and the rest of us. At first glance, this isn’t obvious. Among his first actions upon taking office, Trump vetoed the Trans Pacific Partnership, the controversial free trade agreement which critics rightly said would lead to US job losses while giving transnational corporations massive power over national state policies on health, education and other issues. Trump further plans to ditch the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and US, which would have diluted key state regulations on the activities of transnational corporates on issues like food safety, the environment and banking; and to renegotiate NAFTA, potentially heightening tensions with Canada. Trump appears to be in conflict with the bulk of the US intelligence community, and is actively seeking to restructure the government to minimize checks and balances, and thus consolidate his executive power. His White House chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has restructured the National Security Council, granting himself and Trump’s Chief of Staff Richard ‘Reince’ Priebus permanent seats on the NSC’s Principals’ Committee – opening the door to the White House politicization of the government’s highest national security body. Trump’s White House has purged almost the entire senior staff of the State Department, and tested the loyalty of the Department of Homeland Security with its new ‘Muslim ban’ order. So what is going on? One approach to framing the Trump movement comes from Jordan Greenhall, who sees it as a conservative (“Red Religion”) Insurgency against the liberal (“Blue Church”) Globalist establishment (the “Deep State”). Greenhall suggests, essentially, that Trump is leading a nationalist coup against corporate neoliberal globalization using new tactics of “collective intelligence” by which to outsmart and outspeed his liberal establishment opponents. But at best this is an extremely partial picture. In reality, Trump has ushered in something far more dangerous: The Trump regime is not operating outside the Deep State, but mobilizing elements within it to dominate and strengthen it for a new mission. The Trump regime is not acting to overturn the establishment, but to consolidate it against a perceived crisis of a wider transnational Deep System. The Trump regime is not a conservative insurgency against the liberal establishment, but an act of ideologically constructing the current crisis as a conservative-liberal battleground, led by a particularly radicalized white nationalist faction of a global elite. The act is a direct product of a global systemic crisis, but is a short-sighted and ill-conceived reaction, pre-occupied with surface symptoms of that crisis. Unfortunately, those hoping to resist the Trump reaction also fail to understand the system dynamics of the crisis. All this can only be understood when we look at the big picture. That means the following: we must look a little more closely at the individuals inside Trump’s administration, the wider social and institutional networks they represent, and what emerges from their being interlocked in government; we must contextualize this against two factors, the escalation of global systemic crisis, and the Trump regime’s ideological framing(s) of that crisis (both for themselves, and for public consumption); we must connect this with the impact on the transnational Deep System, and how that links up with the US Deep State; and we must then explore what this all means in terms of the scope of actions likely to be deployed by the Trump regime to pursue its discernable goals. This investigation will help to establish a ground state for anyone on which to build a meaningful strategy of response that accounts for the full systemic complexity of our Trumpian moment. So the first step to diagnosing our Trumpian moment is to see who is leading it. We’ll begin by looking at a cross-section of some of Trump’s most prominent nominations and appointments. 1. The Trump regime Money Monsters If all Trump’s appointees are confirmed, his administration will be among the most business-heavy, corporate-friendly governments in American history. Five of the 15 people nominated by Trump as Cabinet secretaries have no public sector experience, and have spent their entire careers in the corporate sector. “That would be more business people with no public-sector experience than have ever served in the Cabinet at any one time,”, concludes Pew Research Center. Betsy DeVos has been nominated for Education Secretary. She’s a billionaire married to the Amway conglomerate. Andrew Puzder has been nominated as Labor Secretary. He’s a billionaire CEO of fastfood chain owner CKE Restaurants. Trump’s nominee for Commerce Secretary is Wall Street veteran Wilbur Ross. He’s a billionaire financier who invests in buying and selling companies in distressed industries, and who made his early fortune as a fund manager at the Rothschild Group. Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s Treasury Secretary, is a former partner at the global investment bank Goldman Sachs, a hedge fund manager and, until his nomination, a board member of the Fortune 500 financial holding company, CIT Group. He’s also a member of the Yale University secret society, Skull and Bones. Vincent Viola is Trump’s nominee for Army Secretary. He’s a billionaire, former chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), and current chairman of Virtu Financial, a high-frequency trading firm. Linda McMahon is Trump’s Small Business Administrator. She’s a co-founder and former CEO of WWE, which is now valued at around $1.5 billion, and married to billionaire WWE promoter Vincent McMahon. Gary Cohn is Trump’s chief economic advisor and Director of the White House National Economic Council. He just left his previous post as president and chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs for the job. Anthony Scaramucci has served as a senior advisor to Trump on the executive committee of the Presidential Transition Team. Previously he was founding co-managing partner of global investment firm SkyBridge Capital. Like Steve Bannon, he also began his career at Goldman Sachs. Walter ‘Jay’ Clayton is Trump’s nominee for the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), the financial industry’s top regulatory watchdog. Yet Clayton himself is a Wall Street lawyer who has worked on deals for major banks, such as Barclays Capital’s acquisition of Lehman Brothers’ assets, the sale of Bear Stearns to JP Morgan Chase, and the US Treasury’s capital investment in Goldman Sachs. In the same capacity, he has campaigned to reduce restrictions on foreign public companies, and sought lax enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. His wife, Gretchen Butler, works for Goldman Sachs as a private wealth advisor. Trump’s crack team of money monsters is clearly not planning on acting in the interests of American workers — they will instead do what they know best: use the considerable power of the American state to break down as many regulatory constraints on global banking finance as possible, with a special view to privilege US banks and corporations. Source: Earth Island Journal via Chris van Es www.chrisvanes.com Fossil Fuel Freaks Trump’s administration has not just been bought by Wall Street. It’s been bought by the oil, gas and coal industries. Rex Tillerson is Trump’s Secretary of State, and former chairman and CEO of giant oil and gas conglomerate ExxonMobil. As the world’s largest oil major of all, ExxonMobil is the de facto king of fossil fuel interests. Tillerson has close business ties with Russian president Vladimir Putin, and has previously headed up the joint US-Russian oil company Exxon Neftegas. Tillerson is a friend of Igor Sechin, who heads up the military security services faction of the Kremlin known as ‘Siloviki’. ExxonMobil also had intimate ties with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates under Tillerson. In any case, Trump has richly rewarded Tillerson for services rendered — 91% of the $1.8 million donated to federal candidates by ExxonMobil’s PAC under Tillerson for this election cycle, went to Republicans. It’s well-known that ExxonMobil has funded climate denialism to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. What’s less well-known is that in the 1970s, ExxonMobil’s own scientific research fully validated the scientific reality of climate change. Yet company executives made a self-serving business-decision to suppress these findings, and fund efforts to discredit climate science. Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, is Trump’s Secretary of Energy. Perry holds board directorships at Energy Transfer Partners LP and Sunoco Logistics Partners LP, which jointly developed the Dakota Access Pipeline project. The CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, Kelcy Warren, donated $5 million to a super-PAC supportive of Perry. More generally, his two presidential campaigns received over $2.6 million from the oil and gas industry. Scott Pruitt, former Attorney General in Oklahoma, is the new head of the Environment Protection Agency. Pruitt has a track record of launching federal lawsuits to weaken and overturn EPA regulations not just on carbon emissions, but on all sorts of basic environmental rules on air and water pollution. The New York Times reports that he and other Republican attorneys general have forged an “unprecedented, secretive alliance” with the oil industry. Congressman Ryan Zinke is Trump’s nominee for Secretary of the Interior. During Senate confirmation hearings, he refused to admit the accuracy of the scientific consensus on human activity being the dominant cause of climate change. Zinke has supported clean energy measures in the past, but in May 2016, he sponsored a bill for a time limit on Obama’s moratorium on federal coal leasing. He routinely voted against environmental protection measures, supporting fossil fuel use, seeking to minimize public and state involvement in managing public lands, while opposing protections for endangered species. Zinke’s philosophy is basically ‘drill, baby, drill’. That’s why he’s taken over $300,000 in campaign donations from oil and gas companies that want to accelerate drilling across public lands. Mike Catanzaro is Trump’s nominee for Special Assistant for Energy and the Environment. He is also a climate-denying lobbyist for the oil and gas industry, working for Koch Industries, America’s Natural Gas Alliance (ANGA), Halliburton, Noble Energy, Hess Corporation, and many others. Early on in his career, he was Deputy Policy Director of the 2004 Bush-Cheney presidential campaign. The fossil fuel freaks want to burn all the oil, gas and coal they can, at any cost — and they are willing to dismantle whatever environmental protections stand in their way. Black Ops Brigade It would be mistaken to assume that Trump’s conflicts with the US intelligence community mean he is necessarily at odds with the military-industrial complex. On the contrary, his defense appointees and advisors are embedded across the military-industrial complex. Trump’s education secretary, DeVos, is the sister of Erik Prince, the notorious founder of disgraced private security firm Blackwater, now known as Academi, which was outed for slaughtering 17 Iraqi civilians. A source in Trump’s transition team confirms that Erik Prince has advised Trump’s team on intelligence and security issues. Prince now runs another security firm, Frontier Services Group. He supports Trump’s proposal for the US military to grab Iraq’s oil and recommends the escalated deployment of private defense contractors across the Middle East and North Africa, such as in Libya, to crackdown on refugees. General ‘Mad Dog’ James Mattis is Trump’s Secretary of Defense. He was also, until his resignation due to his political appointment, on the board of directors of General Dynamics, the fifth largest private defense contractor in the world. Mattis is also on the board of Theranos, a biotechnology company known for its questionable automated fingerstick blood test technology. Lieutenant-General Mike Flynn was Trump’s National Security Advisor until his resignation on February 13 over his ties to Russia. He is a former head of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) under Obama, and a longstanding military intelligence and special operations insider. Previously, he was director of intelligence for the Joint Special Operations Command; director of intelligence for the US Central Command; commander of the Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; chair of the Military Intelligence Board; and Assistant Director of National Intelligence. Flynn also runs Flynn Intel Group, a private intelligence consulting firm. Flynn has just co-authored a book with Michael Ledeen, The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and its Allies. Ledeen is a leading neoconservative defense consultant and former Reagan administration appointee who was involved in the Iran–Contra affair as a consultant of then US National Security Advisor, Robert McFarlane. Currently a Freedom Scholar at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD), he was a staunch advocate of the 2003 invasion of Iraq (he was directly involved with the Yellowcake forgeries attempting to fabricate a weapons of mass destruction threat to justify the war) and has campaigned for military interventions in Syria, Iran and beyond. Ledeen’s aggressive foreign policy vision was deeply influential in the formation of the Bush administration’s foreign policy strategy. It’s worth noting how low Ledeen stoops with his political philosophy. In his 2000 book, Tocqueville on American Character, Ledeen argues that in some situations, “[i]n order to achieve the most noble accomplishments, the leader may have to ‘enter into evil.’” (p. 90) He even argues that this is sanctioned by the Christian God: “Since it is the highest good, the defense of the country is one of those extreme situations in which a leader is justified in committing evil.” (p. 117) That sort of thinking has led him to endorse the ‘cauldronization’ of the Middle East. In 2002, he wrote in support of invading Iraq that: “One can only hope that we turn the region into a cauldron, and faster, please. If ever there were a region that richly deserved being cauldronized, it is the Middle East today.” General John F. Kelly is Trump’s Secretary of Homeland Security. He is a retired United States Marine Corps general who previously served under Obama as commander of the US Southern Command, responsible for American military operations in Central America, South America and the Caribbean. Before that Kelly was the commanding general of the Multi-National Force-West in Iraq, and the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North. Kelly is also a vice chairman at the Spectrum Group, a defense contractor lobbying firm; and on the board of directors of two other private Pentagon contractors, Michael Baker International and Sallyport Global. James Woolsey, the former CIA director and neoconservative stalwart — a former Vice President at NSA-contractor Booz Allen Hamilton and among Michael Ledeen’s bosses at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies — was an early Trump supporter, and a senior advisor to Trump on his transition team. He dropped out over reservations with Trump’s plans to restructure the intelligence community. Lieutenant General Joseph Keith Kellogg is Chief of Staff and Executive Secretary of Trump’s White House National Security Council – but has replaced Flynn as acting National Security Advisor. Kellogg was the US military’s top information technology official during the Bush administration’s invasion of Iraq in 2003. He went on to become chief operating officer for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad, the mechanism for the US occupation of Iraq, from November 2003 to March 2004 — the period widely recognized as being particularly corrupt and inept. In between, Kellogg had joined the board of directors of US government IT contractor, GTSI Corp, where he returned as an independent director after his Iraq stint from 2004 until 2013 — when the firm changed its name to ‘UNICOM Government Inc.’ in an attempt to distance itself from earlier revelations of misconduct. Kellogg later joined the Advisory Board of US defense contractor Raytheon’s Trusted Computer Solutions Inc., and the Strategic Advisory Board of RedXDefence, a US military contractor part-owned by Regina Dugan, former director of the Pentagon’s Defense and Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In 2012, Wired magazine outed RedXDefense for creating completely rubbish bomb detection technology under a multi-million dollar DARPA contract during Dugan’s tenure. Despite its flaws, the tech was purchased widely by the US military, and numerous allied militaries around the world. Mike Pompeo is the icing on the cake. As Trump’s CIA director, this Republican Congressman has no obvious experience relevant to running a national intelligence agency, except perhaps for one thing: as Jane Mayer writes in her book Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right (Doubleday 2015), Pompeo is “so closely entwined with the climate-change denying Koch brothers that he was known as the ‘congressman from Koch.’” The Koch brothers, who made their fortune investing in fossil fuels, now have a direct line to America’s premiere national intelligence agency. Now that’s what you call a coup. Ku Klux Klan Virulent white nationalism is another fundamental defining feature of the Trump regime. Steve Bannon was founding executive chair of Breitbart News, “the platform of the alt-right” according to Bannon himself. Breitbart is widely known for its publication of “racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic material.” Bannon himself is also a prolific film producer, and has made or contributed to a range of xenophobic films. Before his rise to media mogul status, though, Bannon spent a brief time as acting director of the Biosphere 2 experiment, an effort to create a self-sufficient ‘closed system’ environment survivable by a small group of people from 1993 to 1995. At the time, Bannon appeared to share and strongly support the concerns of the Biosphere 2 scientists about the danger of climate change driven by, in his own words, “the effect of greenhouse gases on humans, plants and animals.” He later underwent an Exxon-like about-turn, illustrated by Breitbart’s rampant opposition to the idea that the burning of fossil fuels by human civilization is intensifying climate change. In 2007, Bannon produced a proposal for a new documentary, ‘Destroying the Great Satan: The Rise of Islamic Facism [sic] in America’, which accused various media outlets, “Universities and the Left”, the “American Jewish Community”, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the CIA, the FBI, the State Department, and the White House as being “enablers” of a covert mission to establish an “Islamic Republic in the United States.” Bannon consulted on the proposal with Steven Emerson of the Investigative Project on Terrorism. In 2015, Emerson was described as a “complete idiot” by then Prime Minister David Cameron for claiming falsely on Fox News that Britain is full of Muslim “no go zones” (like the entire city of Birmingham), and that London is run amok by Muslim religious police who beat and wound people who refuse to dress according to a Muslim dress code. Bannon’s list of interviewees for the proposed film is like a Who’s Who of far-right bigotry. Two of the most well known names included Walid Phares, who advised Trump on his national security team during the presidential campaign, and Robert Spencer. Both are connected to the Washington DC-based Center for Security Policy (CSP), a far-right think tank run by former Reagan defense official Frank Gaffney, where they appear regularly as guests on CSP’s ‘Secure Freedom’ radio podcast run by Gaffney. Phares is also a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy. Frank Gaffney’s CSP commissioned the original flawed opinion poll that was cited by Trump to justify his ‘Muslim ban’ when he first announced it in late 2015. So it’s clearly no coincidence that Kellyanne Conway, the pollster who carried out the flawed poll, is now Counselor to the President. Gaffney thus has a significant degree of ideological influence on the Trump regime. He has appeared at least 34 times on Bannon’s Breitbart radio program. His work has also been cited in speeches by Michael Flynn, Trump’s national security advisor. Alarmingly, Gaffney has disturbing connections to full-blown neo-Nazi groups across Europe, such as the Danish People’s Party (DPP) and the Vlaams Belang (VB) in Belgium. But he simultaneously has close ties to the US military-industrial complex. In 2013, CSP tax records showed that the CSP had received funding from six of America’s biggest aerospace and defense contractors, namely Boeing ($25,000); General Dynamics ($15,000); Lockheed Martin ($15,000); Northrup Grumman ($5,000); Raytheon ($20,000); and General Electric ($5,000). The CSP has a particularly close relationship with Boeing, the second largest defense contractor in the world, which still provides Gaffney’s group with “general support.” Michael Reilly, who has been Director of Federal Budget and Program Analysis at Boeing since 2010, was previously Gaffney’s Vice President for Operations at the CSP. These incestuous ties with the US private defense sector comprise one prime reason that fully 22 officers or advisors of Gaffney’s CSP ended up having appointments in the George W. Bush administration. Senator Jeff Sessions is Trump’s Attorney General. Gaffney’s CSP awarded Sessions the annual ‘Keeper of the Flame’ award in 2015. Sessions has previously expressed sympathies for the Ku Klux Klan. He has closely associated with far-right anti-immigrant organizations founded by John Tanton, a driving force in America’s white nationalist movements. In 1993, Tanton declared: “… for European-American society and culture to persist requires a European-American majority, and a clear one at that.” Yet Trump’s new Attorney General is known for frequently quoting from Tanton’s groups, showing up at their press conferences, and has even received recognition and campaign contributions from them. The John Tanton connection opens up a can of worms. Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s Counsellor, is also connected to Tanton. Her polling firm was previously contracted by Tanton’s anti-immigration platform Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). Numerous other officials involved in the Trump team — Lou Barletta, Kris Kobach and Julie Kirchner — have direct organizational ties to Tanton’s FAIR. But this connects senior Trump officials to a grim history of neo-Nazi agitation in the US. Tanton received large sums of early money for FAIR from the Pioneer Fund, a pro-Nazi grant-giving organization which funded eugenics — the discredited ‘science’ of ‘racial hygiene’. Tanton’s various anti-immigrant platforms received money from the Pioneer Fund as late as 2002. According to a study in the Albany Law Review, the Pioneer Fund had direct ties to Nazi scientists, and its founding directors were Nazi sympathizers. One of them had even travelled to Germany in 1935 to attend a Nazi population conference. Stephen Miller is a senior policy advisor to Trump. He previously worked as communications director for Jeff Sessions in his senator’s office, and crafted the strategy to defeat a bipartisan immigration reform bill in 2013. During his university days, he worked closely with the neo-Nazi leader Richard Spencer, who coined the term “alternative Right” as a new way of capturing a movement about white racial identity. Miller denies having worked closely with Spencer when they were at university together as members of the Duke Conservative Union. According to Spencer, Miller helped him with fundraising and promotion for an on-campus debate on immigration policy in 2007. The event featured Peter Brimelow, who runs the white nationalist website Vdare.com, which regularly publishes articles by neo-Nazis. Miller’s relationship with Spencer at this time has been confirmed by email correspondence between Spencer and Brimelow. It’s perhaps worth noting that the inspiration for Tanton’s neo-Nazi sympathies were, ostensibly, environmental concerns. In a recent article he admits, “my initial interest in curtailing immigration was motivated by a longstanding concern for the environment.” From 1971 to 1975, Tanton was chair of the National Population Committee of one of America’s oldest environmental organizations, the Sierra Club. His theory was that immigration drives unsustainable population growth, which then drains resources and harms the environment. The environmental crisis, from Tanton’s point of view, is a population problem — specifically, a problem of too many people. Part of dealing with that means cracking down on immigration — this, ironically, in a nation founded on immigration. This insidious proto-Nazi ideology now appears to have an operating influence on the White House through Tanton’s ideological surrogates, many of whom are connected to Gaffney and his acolytes in the Trump regime. Guru Gang The unifying ideology that lends coherence to these intersecting networks of influence comes from a variety of people, but the following stand out in particular. Michael Anton is a little-known but powerful figure in the Trump administration, now a senior director of strategic communications in the White House National Security Council. He launched his career as a speechwriter and press secretary for New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, before joining Bush’s White House in 2001 as a communications aide for the National Security Council. He went on to become a speechwriter for media mogul Rupert Murdoch at News Corp, then moved into the financial sector, firstly as director of communications for Citigroup, then as a managing director at the BlackRock investment firm. Anton has played a major role in attempting to cajole and convince conservatives, through various anonymous writings in conservative publications and behind-the-scenes networking, of the necessity of voting Trump to head off the crisis of conservative decline amidst the apocalyptic failures of liberalism. Rupert Murdoch has a direct line to the Trump White House through Michael Anton, but it’s one the News Corp owner has gone to pains to build personally. Murdoch and his wife Jerry Hall were hosted for dinner by Trump at his golf course in Scotland in June 2016. Later Murdoch was seen visiting Trump Tower in November 2016. Murdoch is set to have significant influence on Trump, who reportedly asked the Fox News owner to recommend his top preferred candidates to chair the Federal Communications Commission. The Murdoch connection has other alarming ramifications. Since 2010, Murdoch has been an equity-holding board member of the American energy firm, Genie Oil & Gas. He had teamed up with Lord Jacob Rothschild, chairman of Rothschild Investment Trust (RIT) Capital Partners, to buy a 5.5% stake in the corporation then worth $11 million. Murdoch and Rothschild also serve on Genie’s strategic advisory board. Joining them on the board are Larry Summers, former Director of President Obama’s National Economic Council; former Trump senior advisor James Woolsey; Dick Cheney, former Vice-President under George W. Bush; and Bill Richardson, former Secretary of Energy under Clinton and Governor of New Mexico. Genie Oil & Gas has two main subsidiaries. One of them, Afek Oil & Gas, operates in Israel and is currently drilling in the Golan Heights, which under international law is recognized as Syrian territory. The Golan was captured by Israel from Syria in 1967, and unilaterally annexed in 1981 with the introduction of Israeli law to the territory. The other Genie subsidiary, American Shale Oil, is a joint project with the French major Total SA, and operates in Colorado’s Green River Formation. Screenshot of Murdoch part-owned Genie subsidiary On its website, the company offers an extraordinary declaration regarding its rationale for focusing on unconventional oil and gas resources: “The peaking of world oil production presents the US and the world with an enormous challenge. Aggressive action must be taken to avoid unprecedented economic, social and political costs.” This may well reveal much about the crisis-perceptions of those who influence the Trump regime. Trump’s administration has been further augmented by a man with especially extensive ties to the US Deep State: Henry Kissinger. Since December 2016, Kissinger, the notorious former Secretary of State convincingly accused of complicity in war crimes by the late Christopher Hitchens — who has played direct advisory roles in both the preceding Bush and Obama administrations — has become Trump’s unofficial foreign policy guru. Kissinger was a secret national security consultant to President Bush, and under Obama was directly involved in the US National Security Council’s chain-of-command. He now appears to be intimately involved in the evolution of Trump’s foreign policies toward China and Russia. His firm, Kissinger Associates, has for some years played a central role in easing the passage of numerous US corporations into lucrative Chinese investments. Trump’s peculiar brand of haphazard, unscripted and chaotic political announcements may well have endeared him to Kissinger, who has argued that “unpredictability” is a hallmark of the greatest statesmen. Such leaders act beyond the sort of “pre-vision of catastrophes” offered by established experts recommending caution, instead indulging in “perpetual creation, on a constant redefinition of goals.” The greatest statesmen are able to both “maintain the perfection of order” and “to have the strength to contemplate chaos”, where they can “find material for fresh creation.” Kissinger’s critical role in developing Trump’s eastward facing strategy was revealed by the German tabloid, Bild, which obtained a document from the Trump transition team. The document confirmed Kissinger’s role as the key mastermind brought in to craft a way to rebuild relationships with Russia. Kissinger’s plan would include lifting US economic sanctions — paving the way for a potentially lucrative partnership between American and Russian oil and gas companies — and recognizing Russia’s ownership of the Crimea. Kissinger’s advice on China policy, however, is not yet fully known. Writing in the South China Morning Post, Pepe Escobar argues that Kissinger’s record suggests Trump will deploy “a mix of ‘balance of power’ and ‘divide and rule’. It will consist of seducing Russia away from its strategic partner China; keeping China constantly on a sort of red alert; and targeting Islamic State while continuing to harass Iran.” Kissinger’s ‘unofficial’ advisory role in the Trump regime is solidified through the direct influence of one of his longtime acolytes. K.T. McFarland, who is to work under Michael Flynn as Trump’s Deputy National Security Adviser, was an aide to Henry Kissinger during the Nixon administration on the National Security Council from 1970 to 1976. In that capacity, she played a lead role in working on Kissinger’s notorious and originally classified 1974 National Security Study Memorandum 200 (NSSM200). The document advocated that population growth in poorer countries was the principal threat to US overseas security and other interests, especially by endangering US access to “mineral supplies”. Making America hate again It appears that there are common themes among the different groupings that comprise the Trump regime. Among them are experiences and recognition of crisis: Rex Tillerson and Steve Bannon, for instance, come from backgrounds acknowledging the reality of the planetary ecological crisis. Energy interests linked to Murdoch believe in an imminent social, economic and political crisis due to peak oil. Most Trump teamsters see their task as saving the fossil fuel industries from crises external to them, and now all ostensibly tend to deny the gravity of the industry’s environmental impacts. All are worried about the profits of their friends in Wall Street. A large number of Trump team associates have ties to John Tanton, whose proto-Nazi views are rooted in an eugenics-inspired belief that the environmental crisis is due to too many non-white people. And now Trump’s national security team draws on the parallel views of the old Nixon era Kissinger team concerning the threat of overpopulated poor countries undermining US access to the world’s food, energy and raw materials resources — for which the solution could be to ‘cauldronize’ countries of strategic interest. These crisis-perceptions, however, are not grounded in systemic insight: but are refracted through the narrow lenses of self-serving power. The crises are relevant only insofar that they represent a threat to their interests. But most importantly, their ensuing beliefs about how to respond to these crises end up being refracted through the ideological framework of the conservative-liberal polarity. 2. The Deep System Perhaps the most powerful takeaway from this examination of who the Trump administration actually is, is that the Trump regime is not external to the Deep State. On the contrary, the people who hold senior posts in his administration, both formal and otherwise, are key nodes that represent whole layers of social and institutional networks within and across the wider US Deep State. If this is not immediately obvious, it’s because there is much misunderstanding of what the Deep State actually is. The Deep State is not simply ‘the intelligence community’. When a more accurate understanding of the American Deep State and its symbiotic embeddedness in a transnational Deep System is adopted, the role of the Trump faction can be properly discerned. Secret state, opaque system In his book, Deep Politics and the Death of JFK (University of California Press, 1996), Professor Peter Dale Scott coined the term deep politics to designate the study of criminal and extra-legal practices linked to the state. He defined a deep political system or process as one in which institutional and non-institutional bodies, criminal syndicates, politicians, judges, media, corporations and leading government employees, resort to “decision-making and enforcement procedures outside as well as inside those sanctioned by law and society. What makes these supplementary procedures ‘deep’ is the fact that they are covert or suppressed, outside public awareness as well as outside sanctioned political processes.” Deep political analysis is therefore concerned with revealing the tendency of the state to enter into activity outside of the state’s own rule of law. From the viewpoint of conventional political science, law enforcement and the criminal underworld are opposed to each other, the former struggling to gain control of the latter. But as Scott observes: “A deep political analysis notes that in practice these efforts at control lead to the use of criminal informants; and this practice, continued over a long period of time, turns informants into double agents with status within the police as well as the mob. The protection of informants and their crimes encourages favours, payoffs, and eventually systemic corruption. The phenomenon of ‘organized crime’ arises: entire criminal structures that come to be tolerated by the police because of their usefulness in informing on lesser criminals.” This can lead to a form of state-crime symbiosis, blurring the defining parameters of which side controls the other. From the outside, this appears as the emergence of an invisible “deep” dimension to state activities tying it to organized crime, when in reality what is happening is that the state is inherently porous: its “deep” invisible side connects it to all manner of private, extra-legal actors who often seek to operate outside or in breach of the law — or to influence or bend the law to serve their interests. In his more recent opus, The American Deep State, (p. 14) Scott also acknowledges in this vein that the deep state “is not a structure but a system, as difficult to define, but also as real and powerful, as a weather system.” As I’ve shown in my paper published in the anthology, The Dual State (Routledge, 2016), one of the least understood features of deep politics, then, is that the “deep state” must inherently be inter-networked with a vast array of non-state and often transnational influencers across corporations, financial institutions, banks, and criminal enterprises. Capitalism, Covert Action and State-Terrorism: Towards a Political Economy of the Deep State In the name of fighting the post-9/11 "War on Terror" Western states have with increasing impunity bent, stretched and…www.academia.edu The postwar global deep system America’s historic role as the principal shaper of global capitalism means that the globalization of capitalism enabled the emergence and expansion of a US-dominated transnational Deep System — within this global Deep System, a US-dominated transnational financial elite has become inherently entangled with criminal networks. The expansion of global capitalism since 1945 was not an automated process. On the contrary, it was a deeply violent process led principally by the United States, Britain and Western Europe. Throughout, the CIA and Wall Street acted largely hand-in-hand. Globalization was tied directly to military interventions in over 70 developing nations designed to create the political conditions conducive to markets that would be ‘open’ to western capital penetration, and thus domination of local resources and labour. The logic of ‘deep politics’ required that much of this criminal political violence in foreign theatres be suppressed from public consciousness, or otherwise justified in different ways. This was privately acknowledged by US State Department planners working in partnership at the time with the Council on Foreign Relations: “If war aims are stated, which seem to be concerned solely with Anglo-American imperialism, they will offer little to people in the rest of the world… Such aims would also strengthen the most reactionary elements in the United States and the British Empire. The interests of other peoples should be stressed, not only those of Europe, but also of Asia, Africa and Latin America. This would have a better propaganda effect.” The number of people that died in the course of this forcible integration of former colonies across Asia, Africa, South America and the Middle East into the orbit of an emerging US-UK dominated global economy, is astonishing. In his book, Unpeople (2004), British historian Mark Curtis offers a detailed breakdown of the death toll at approximately 10 million — a conservative under-estimate, he qualifies. American economist Dr JW Smith, in his Economic Democracy (2005), argues that globalization was: “… responsible for violently killing 12 to 15 million people since WW II and causing the death of hundreds of millions more as their economies were destroyed or those countries were denied the right to restructure to care for their people… that is the record of the Western imperial centers of capital from 1945 to 1990.” On the back of this deep, transnational political violence — which remains obscured in mainstream media and history education — the US and UK erected a global financial architecture to serve the interests of their most powerful corporate and banking institutions, which hold overwhelming sway over the political class. State power was deployed to integrate the resources, raw materials, fossil fuel energy reserves, and cheap labour from these vast areas of the world into a global economy dominated by transnational elite interests based largely in the US, UK and Western Europe. This, too, opened the way for new forms of criminalization of state power. This can be illustrated with a powerful example from terrorism finance expert Loretta Napoleoni, who chaired the Club de Madrid’s terrorism financing group. She reports that financial deregulation pursued by successive US governments paved the way for different armed and terror groups to link up with each other and with organized crime, generating an overall criminal economy valued at about $1.5 trillion. This criminal economy consists of “illegal capital flights, profits from criminal enterprises, drug trading, smuggling, legal businesses, and so on”, most of which is recycled into Western economies through money laundering via mainstream financial institutions: “It is a vital element of the cash flow of these economies.” But the problem goes further. As the primary medium of exchange for this criminal economy is the US dollar, the latter’s role as the world reserve currency has cemented a structural situation in which the economic power of the US Treasury has become conditional on the economic immunity of transnational criminal networks, who systematically use US dollars for criminal transactions: The greater the stock of dollars held abroad, the greater the source of revenue for the US Treasury. These examples illustrate how the US Deep State operates as the chief regulator of a global Deep System, in which seemingly legitimate international financial flows have become increasingly enmeshed with transnational organized crime, powerful corporate interests who control the world’s fossil fuel and raw materials resources, and the privatization of the military-industrial complex. The Deep State faction behind Trump Trump fits into this system snugly. Among his draft executive orders is one that would open the door for US corporations to engage in secretive corrupt and criminal practices to buy conflict minerals from the Congo — which are widely used in electronic products like smartphones and laptops. From this broader perspective, it’s clear that far from representing a force opposed to the Deep State, the Trump regime represents an interlocking network of powerful players across sectors which heavily intersect with the Deep State: finance, energy, military intelligence, private defense, white nationalist ‘alt-right’ media, and Deep State policy intellectuals. According to Scott, this reflects a deepening “old division within Big Money — roughly speaking, between those Trilateral Commission progressives, many flourishing from the new technologies of the global Internet, who wish the state to do more than at present about problems like wealth disparity, racial injustice and global warming, and those Heritage Foundation conservatives, many from finance and oil, who want it to do even less.” So rather than being a nationalist ‘insurgency’ against the corporate globalist ‘Deep State’, the Trump regime represents a white nationalist coup by a disgruntled cross-section within the Deep State itself. Rather than coming into conflict with the Deep State, we are seeing a powerful military-corporate nexus within the American Deep State come to the fore. Trump, in this context, is a tool to re-organize and restructure the Deep State in reaction to what this faction believe to be an escalating crisis in the global Deep System. In short, the Deep State faction backing Trump is embarking on what it believes is a unique and special mission: to save the Deep State from a decline caused by the failures of successive American administrations. However, what they are actually doing is accelerating the decline of the American Deep State and the disruption of the global Deep System. Slide from lecture at Global Sustainability Institute, Anglia Ruskin University (Ahmed) 3. Systemic Crisis The Trump faction is correct that there is a crisis in US power, but they fail to grasp the true nature of the crisis in its global systemic context. Each grouping within the Trump faction, and the elite social and institutional networks they represent, has its own narrow understanding of the crisis, framed from within the ideological parameters of its own special interests and class position. Each grouping suffers serious epistemological limitations which mean they are not only incapable of grasping the systemic nature of the crisis and its impacts, but they hold self-serving views about the crisis which tend to project their insecurities onto all sorts of Others. The growth problem For instance, the ongoing failure to lift the US economy into a meaningful recovery is framed by the Trump faction as due to not putting ‘America first’ in trade relations. Trump’s plan is to boost infrastructure investment to create jobs at home, and to adopt more protectionist trade policies to protect American industries and manufacturing. The immediate reality here is that Trump’s money monsters are keenly aware that conventional neoliberal American economic and financial policies are no longer working: Under Obama, for instance, the median household income saw its first significant increase since the 2007–8 recession in 2015, rising by 5.2%. In real terms, though, little has changed. Median household income is at $56,516 a year, which when adjusted for inflation, is 2.4% less than what it was at the turn of the millennium. So while Obama managed to create over a million new jobs, purchasing power for the working and middle classes hasn’t increased — it’s actually decreased. Meanwhile, although the poverty rate dropped by 1.2% in 2015, the overall trend since the 2007 crash has seen the number of poor Americans increase from 38 million to 43.1 million people. But this problem goes beyond Obama — it’s systemic. Over the last century, the net value of the energy we are able to extract from our fossil fuel resource base has inexorably declined. The scientific concept used to measure this value is Energy Return on Investment (EROI), a calculation that compares the quantity of energy one extracts from a resource, to the quantity of energy used to enable the extraction. How global economic growth will drown in Trump’s oil glut after 2018 All the oil on the planet can’t save a financial system in overshoot, but another world is still possiblemedium.com There was a time in the US, around the 1930s, when the EROI of oil was a monumental 100. This has steadily decreased, with some fluctuation. By 1970, oil’s EROI had dropped to 30. Over the last three decades alone, the EROI of US oil has continued to plummet by more than half, reaching around 10 or 11. According to environmental scientist professor Charles Hall of the State University of New York, who created the EROI measure, global net energy decline is the most fundamental cause of global economic malaise. Because we need energy to produce and consume, we need more energy to increase production and consumption, driving economic growth. But if we’re getting less energy over time, then we simply cannot increase economic growth. Trump's Plans for Fossil Fuels Will Shrink the Economy - Motherboard As President-elect Trump spearheads plans to boost oil, coal and gas, a major new study by one of the world's foremost…motherboard.vice.com And this is why there has been an unmistakeable correlation between long-term global net energy decline, and a long-term decline in the rate of global economic growth. There is also an unmistakeable correlation between that long-term decline, the rise in global inequality, and the increase in global poverty. The self-styled liberal faction of the Deep State has convinced itself that capitalist growth helped halve global poverty since the 1990s, but there’s reason to question that. That success rate is calculated from the World Bank poverty measure of $1.25 a day, a level of very extreme poverty. But this poverty measure is too low. While the numbers of people living in extreme poverty has indeed halved, many of those people are still poor, deprived of their basic needs. A more accurate measure of poverty shows that the number of poor worldwide has overall increased. As the London-based development charity ActionAid showed in a 2013 report, a more realistic poverty measure lies between $5 and $10 a day. World Bank data shows that since 1990, the number of people living under $10 a day has increased by 25 percent, and the number of people living under $5 a day has increased by 10 percent. Today, 4.3 billion people — nearly two-thirds of the global population — live on less than $5 a day. So really, poverty has worsened in the Age of Progress. And now the unsustainability of this equation is coming home to roost even in the centres of global growth, where wealth is most concentrated. The UN's Sustainability Plan Is 'Doomed,' According to Linguistic Analysis - Motherboard The UN will launch its 2030 Sustainable Development agenda at the end of this month in New York City, where it will be…motherboard.vice.com As of mid-2016, the GDP of Europe has been stagnant for over a decade, and the US has reached a GDP growth rate of 1.1 percent, nearly the same as its population. This means that the US has actually experienced no average increase in “per capita wealth”, according to SUNY’s Charles Hall. To maintain this semblance of economic growth, we are using ingenious debt mechanisms to finance new economic activity. The expansion of global debt is now higher than 2007 pre-crash levels. We are escalating the risk of another financial crisis in coming years, because the tepid growth we’ve managed to squeeze out of the economy so far is based on borrowing from an energetically and environmentally unsustainable future. And that growth-by-debt mechanism is also occurring within the oil industry, which has amassed two trillion dollars worth of debt that, in the context of the chronic oil price slump, means the industry is not profitable enough to generate the funds to ever repay its debt. Exclusionary polarities Both pro- and anti-Trump factions of the Deep State are in denial of the fact that this escalating crisis is due, fundamentally, to the global net energy decline of the world’s fossil fuel resource base. In a time of fundamental systemic crisis, the existing bedrock of norms and values a group normally holds onto maybe shaken to the core. This can lead a group to attempt to reconstruct a new set of norms and values — but if the group doesn’t understand the systemic crisis, the new construct, if it diagnoses the crisis incorrectly, can end up blaming the wrong issues, leading to Otherization. Slide from lecture at Global Sustainability Institute, Anglia Ruskin University (Ahmed) The Trump faction ends up falling-back on the narrow pathways with which they are familiar, and believe that rather than requiring a different path, the problem is that we are not fully committed to pursuing the old path. They insist that the problem is not inherent to the structure of the fossil fuel industry itself, or the debt-infested nature of the parasitical global financial system. The problem is seen simply as insufficient exploitation of America’s fossil fuels; too much regulation of the financial system; constant economic pandering to unAmericans — Muslims, immigrants, Latinos, black people — who are either draining the financial system through crime, drugs and terror, or simply overburdening it with their huge numbers. While they believe that business-as-usual growth must now be monopolized by ‘America first’ (and particularly by a white nationalist definition of ‘America’), their liberal detractors cling to the belief that business-as-usual will in itself usher in continued growth, with a tad of technocratic tinkering and billionaire philanthropy spreading the gains throughout the world. Both worldviews suffer from serious ideological fallacies — but it’s the failure of the latter that has helped radicalize the former. Looking at the writing of Trump’s senior advisor Michael Anton throws significant light on how the crisis has radicalized the Trump faction into a delusional, binary worldview. For Anton, the key culprit is the moral and ideological bankruptcy of the liberal paradigm, which has destroyed the economy and is eroding American values; as well as the failure of the conservative establishment to do anything meaningful about it. Anton pined for a great disruptor to revitalize conservativism on a new footing: in the process tearing down liberals and old conservatives in one fell swoop. And so began his ideological love affair with Donald Trump. The result is Trump’s vision of himself as a sort of American messiah — but this is, of course, a grand construction. The Trump faction, following Anton’s line of argument, have simply framed all of America’s challenges through the narrow lens in which they see everything: the problem of liberals; and thus all America’s problems can be conveniently Otherized, pinned on the fatal combination of liberal decadence, and conservative bankruptcy. Thus, Trump’s proposed programme is seen by its proponents as a war on both the liberal and conservative establishments responsible for the crisis. The vision seems simple enough. Domestically and economically: kickstarting economic growth by ramping up massive investments in America’s remaining fossil fuel resources; using this to generate the revenues to fund the trillion dollar infrastructure plan; while refocusing efforts on revitalising American manufacturing; all of which will create millions of new American jobs. The foreign affairs extension is to partner with Russia to facilitate US-Russian cooperation on new oil and gas projects in the region; weakening the Russia-China partnership to facilitate American pressure on China to capitulate to US encroachment on untapped oil and gas resources in the South China Sea. The ‘war on terror’ corollary of the Trump vision is to rollback Iran’s expanding influence in the Middle East, which has greatly increased thanks to the 2003 Iraq War and the destabilization of Syria; thereby reconsolidating the regional geopolitical power of the Gulf states, where the bulk of the world’s remaining oil and gas resources are to be found. The domestic dimension of that ‘war on terror’ corollary involves cracking down on the increasing numbers of ‘useless eaters’, the hordes of non-white Others, who are seen ultimately as parasites gnawing at America’s financial, cultural and national security. Thus, the walling off of Mexico, the ‘Muslim ban’, the crackdown on immigrants, and the veiled threats to the Black Lives Matter movement that its ‘anti police’ attitude will not be tolerated, all become explicable as the result of what happens when a systemic crisis is not understood for what it is, but simply projected onto those who are affected the most by that very crisis. In all these areas, the common theme discernible across the Trump regime’s key appointments is to react to crisis-perceptions by attributing the crisis to various populations, both inside and outside the United States — invariably painted as out of control, rapidly growing in numbers, and thereby comprising an inherent threat to the ‘greatness’ of an ‘American’ identity that is increasingly defined in parochial, ethno-nationalist terms. But that’s obviously not going to work. Instead it will escalate the crisis. Slide from lecture at Global Sustainability Institute, Anglia Ruskin University (Ahmed) Global net energy decline is not going to go away by drilling harder and faster. The very act of drilling harder and faster will ultimately accelerate net energy decline. The geophysical brake on economic growth will harden, not weaken. And this means that Trump will be forced to rely on public private partnerships to bring in huge investment loans from the private sector to deliver his infrastructure plan. So whatever domestic low paid, sweatshop-style, factory jobs Trump manages to engineer in the near-term, American taxpayers will be forced to foot the bill for the trillions of dollars in repayment of those private loans. Trump’s plan will thus compound the already crisis-prone debt-levels in the American and global financial system. Meanwhile, climate change will accelerate, even as international order becomes more unstable while Trump spearheads a more aggressive military posture in the Middle East and South Asia, particularly toward Iraq, Iran and China; and cracks down harder on minorities at home. For every degree to which Trump upscales aggression, America’s real national security will be downgraded. And like any good despot, Trump’s failures will become food for his own propaganda, to be conveniently blamed on the myriad of Others who, in the small minds of the Trump faction, are preventing America from becoming ‘great again.’ 4. The future As global systemic crisis intensifies, the myriad of networks, forces and factions that comprise the American Deep State are turning on each other: Trump is not the cause, but the symptomatic outcome of this structural rupture within the US establishment. What this means is that defeating Trump in itself is not going to weaken or rollback the forces which his regime has unleashed. On the other hand, although this trajectory will produce immense upheaval and chaos while it lasts, the social support base for our Trumpian moment is dwindling. We are witnessing the reactionary death throes of the social forces behind the Trump faction. Exit polls show that only 37% of young people aged 18–29 years old voted Trump. However, while over 55% voted for Clinton, a large number of young people — approximately one million — who might have usually voted Democrat, simply didn’t come out to vote. That’s because while they may have disliked Trump, they didn’t particularly like Clinton either. One in ten millennial voters went for a third party candidate — though still a modest number, it’s three times higher than the number of third-party votes than in the previous election. At this rate of growth, the millennial shift to third party candidates could become fatal for Democrats. According to Republican strategist Evan Siegfried, if millennials had turned out to vote in 2016, they could have swung the election away from Trump decisively. This is because the party’s traditional support base consists largely of middle class white people, rural voters and baby boomers. “They are literally dying out,” said Siegried. “Every four years the white population decreases by two per cent, and the white non-college educated population decreases by four per cent.” Siegfried thus argues that Trump’s victory was won by trying to ensure that millennials and minorities who were unlikely to vote for him didn’t even come out to vote at all. But here’s the rub. While Siegfried concedes that the demographics continue to shift in favour of the Democrats in the long-run, Clinton was clearly a deeply uninspiring candidate, compromised utterly by her ties to Wall Street and the Deep State. Democrats looking at these demographic dynamics in the run up to 2016 fooled themselves into believing that a Clinton victory was inevitable. They were wrong, obviously. And while the demographics prove that the Trump support base in America will shrink, this proves that the millennial future won’t just be sceptical of Republicans, but Democrats too. Today, the composition of the Trump regime proves that Clinton’s loss was not a loss for the Deep State. On the contrary, the real problem is that the American electoral system reflects a form of regime-rotation within the Deep State itself. The rise of the Trump faction signals that the escalation of global systemic crisis has pushed the usual round of regime-rotation into a tipping point, where one branch of the Deep State is now at war with the other branch. Both sides of the US Deep State blame each other for the system’s failures, neither wishing to admit their own complicity in driving the systems responsible for those failures. One side wants to respond to the systemic crisis by accelerating market share of the old paradigm — extending the life of the fossil fuel system and deregulating predatory capital. While most are climate deniers, some even appear to recognize the dangers of environmental crisis and resource scarcity but wish to shore up the US Deep State against the crisis as a nationalist response: Fortress America. The other side hold a deep faith that technological progress will save the day and permit business-as-usual and endless extraction-premised growth to continue — they believe that digitally-driven technological innovations will allow Wall Street to have its cake and eat it: we can grow the economy, and enrich a tiny number of financiers in the West exponentially, and the dividends will trickle down to the Rest with a bit of technocratic tinkering, selective regulation and generous philanthropy. Neither side truly understands that they both remain locked into the old, dying industrial neoliberal paradigm. That both the conventional Republican and Democrat strategies have failed. And that if they continue to ignore and overlook the reality of the global systemic crisis and its escalating symptoms, they will both become increasingly disrupted and irrelevant to large sectors of the American population. In that scenario, politics will become increasingly polarized, not less so. Republicans will seek to shore up their white nationalist support base while Democrats will continue to lose credibility as a genuine critical voice due to their establishment myopia. In an alternative scenario, agents at different levels in both parties, third parties, and across civil society begin to see our Trumpian moment for what it really is. They realize that both the conservative and liberal polarities are being disrupted by the global systemic crisis. That the Deep State is being disrupted by the global systemic crisis. And that Trump is merely an effort by a branch of the Deep State to stave off the disruption. And that the failures of the other branch of the Deep State are precisely what enabled and emboldened this eventuality. An Applied Blueprint for the Restoration of Democracy At Exile, we have forged a new path aligning ecological, economic, journalistic and policy development.medium.com In that scenario, the current political tendencies of the millennial generation open the possibility for new paths forward for politics, whether conservative or liberal: to re-build their parties, organizations and paradigms in accordance with the emerging dynamics of a global system in transition to a new phase state: beyond carbon, beyond endless growth, beyond mass consumerism, beyond the banal polarities of left and right, white and black, native and foreign, and in service to people and planet.

Posted 15 Feb 2017 11:35 An electric display chart showing the afternoon trading trend of the blue chip Hang Seng Index is seen through a camera at a brokerage in Hong Kong, China July 8, 2015. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/Files Enlarge Caption  Email More A A HONG KONG: Hong Kong police are struggling to deal with digital pump-and-dump schemes targeting brokerages: a little-known type of computer-generated fraud that surged in the Chinese territory last year. Although the money involved was small - only about US$20 million worth of shares - there were 81 such incidents reported in 2016, more than triple the number in 2015, according to police. In the scheme, criminals invest in thinly traded penny stocks and then manipulate their share prices by ordering trades from hacked brokerage accounts. They earn profits by selling before the fraudulent trades are reported. After last year's cyber-heist of US$81 million at Bangladesh's central bank and a series of hacks of ATM's around the world, authorities fear such pump-and-dump schemes could be increasingly used for electronic theft. Hong Kong is a favoured place for such attacks because of the number of thinly-traded penny stocks in the territory and because its securities industry has fallen behind other financial centers in defending against cyber fraud. At least seven brokers and eight banks have been targeted in Hong Kong, including HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank of China International (BOCI) Securities, according to regulators and people familiar with confidential investigations. A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment. A spokeswoman for BOCI Securities said he could not comment on its case but the brokerage would continue to invest in IT security. "If you ask regulators in the industry what is the number one threat, not surprisingly it’s all about cyber attacks," Ashley Alder, CEO of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and chairman of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, said in a speech to the local legislature last week. "We've seen that happen not only in banking but also at brokers in Hong Kong, in particular recent attacks to do with basically hijacking share trading accounts." Such schemes surfaced more than a decade ago in the United States. Charles Schwab Corp, E*Trade Financial Corp and JP Morgan Chase & Co. were identified as victims of these schemes in a 2006 complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The pace of attacks reported in the United States has slowed in recent years after big brokerages implemented a variety of strategies to thwart the hacks, said John Reed Stark, a former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Office of Internet Enforcement. Some use algorithms to identify and halt unusual trading activity, others scrutinise Internet traffic for orders coming from suspicious servers and one stopped permitting customers to use its online trading platform from buying penny stocks, said Stark, who now runs cyber-security consulting firm John Reed Stark Consulting LLC. But such protections are rare in Hong Kong, where the government has only recently started suggesting security improvements to banks and brokerages which have traditionally considered stock trading to be low-risk. TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION The Hong Kong SFC last year told firms to increase surveillance of client transactions and data protection. Authorities believe that hackers accessed brokerage accounts using stolen or guessed passwords, according to investigators. This might have been thwarted if they were protected with two-factor authentication, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has said. Two-factor authentication typically includes a password and a piece of information only the user has, for instance an electronic token with changing numbers. "Hong Kong is being targeted because they have not instituted the same cyber protections that we see in the U.S. and certain parts of Europe," said Jeff Cramer, a former U.S. prosecutor. Cramer, who is managing director with cyber-security investigations firm Berkeley Research Group, said he expects to see more attacks in Hong Kong and perhaps other Asian nations, including China, Japan and South Korea that are also behind in cyber security. FIGHTING BACK Such pump and dump cases have proven tough to crack in the United States because the masterminds are typically overseas, using surrogates and pseudonyms to make investments. Brokerages are typically not required to go public when they are hacked, so cases often only surface when the government files a complaint against suspected cyber criminals, or the hack results in litigation. The attack involving BOCI Securities year became public after it was sued by a customer that claimed its account was breached. Trading firm Fast Track Holdings Limited alleged in court documents that somebody hacked into its brokerage account on the afternoon of September 23 using a valid user ID and password. Within 18 minutes, the intruder had emptied the account by spending HKUS$38 million to buy 49 million shares of thinly traded Pa Shun Pharmaceutical, according to Fast Track. The stock soared more than 30 percent after the purchase, which was made at a 36 percent premium to the previous day's closing price, Reuters data shows.     BOCI alerted Fast Track of the suspicious activity an hour later, but it has said in court documents it should not be held financially responsible, saying it found no evidence its systems had been compromised.     Peter Pang, Pa Shun's CFO, told Reuters the management "would keep an eye to the incident and report to the regulators and the public when necessary".     One person familiar with the case said Fast Track's management believes the incident was a pump and dump scam and that Pa Shun was targeted because it is thinly-traded, but it remained unclear who was responsible.     Fast Track's directors did not respond to requests for comment.

The EUR/USD pair bottomed for the day at 1.0521, its lowest level since January 11th, but the greenback changed course during the US afternoon, suddenly entering negative territory daily basis against all of its major rivals. Dollar's reversal came in spite of another strong tax headline from US President Trump, who said that a massive tax plan will see the light in the "not-too-distant future," when speaking with retail executives. The pair set a daily high of 1.0608, but settled a few pips below 1.0590. In the US, January Retail Sales rose by 0.4% when compared to the previous month, while the core reading, ex-autos, advanced 0.8%. Inflation in the same month surged by the most in four years, up by 0.6%, doubling expectations of 0.3%. The annual inflation rate printed 2.5%, above the 2.4% expected and previous 2.1%. Additionally, the New York Empire State Manufacturing index for February surged to 18.7, a strong bounce from previous 6.5, and the highest reading in over two years. The late recovery was not enough to revert the negative tone of the pair, as in the 4 hours chart, the recovery stalled right around a still bearish 20 SMA. Furthermore and in the same chart, technical indicators have posted moderate bounces from their mid-lines, but remain well into negative territory. The pair has briefly broke below the 1.0565 Fibonacci support before recovering above it, but renewed selling interest below the level will likely result in fresh weekly lows, particularly if hopes about the upcoming US tax reform keep fueling sentiment. Additional gains beyond 1.0625, the immediate resistance, could result in a recovery up to the 1.0660 region, en route to the critical 1.0705 price zone. Support levels: 1.0565 1.0520 1.0470 Resistance levels: 1.0625 1.0660 1.0705 USD/JPY The USD/JPY pair retreated from a fresh weekly high of 114.95 to close the day flat in the 114.20 region. The greenback got a boost from much better-than-expected inflation and retail sales January data, but was unable to sustain gains and plummeted to 113.85 as the dollar index suffered a sharp reversal after printing a 4-week high of 101.73. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda spoke early Wednesday, but said nothing new, noting that policy makers have no plan to raise the central bank's bond yield targets, and that inflation is still far from the 2% target. There are no major economic releases scheduled for this Thursday. From a technical point of view, the pair still has to firm up above 114.55, the 23.6% retracement of the November/December rally, to be able to recover further. In the 4 hours chart, the price is struggling around a bearish 200 SMA, whilst technical indicators turned south from near overbought readings, indicating that buying interest is still limited. The 100 SMA in the mentioned char stands flat around 113.35, with a break below it most likely resulting in a bearish extension during the following sessions. Support levels: 113.85 113.35 112.90 Resistance levels: 114.55 114.90 115.40 GBP/USD The GBP/USD pair closed the day marginally lower around 1.2445, with the Pound hit by mixed employment data coming from the UK. According to official numbers, the employment rate rose to 74.6% in the three months to December, the highest rate on record, whilst the unemployment rate remained steady at an eleven-year low of 4.8%. Average hourly earnings including bonus, however, rose 2.6% in the same period, below previous 2.8%, the slower pace in almost two years. In January, unemployment claims fell by 42.4K much better than the 0.8K expected. Weak earnings in a rising inflation environment, may affect overall economic growth during the upcoming months. The pair traded as low as 1.2382 before settling around 1.2440, and the 4 hours chart shows that a late spike was contained by selling interest around a bearish 20 SMA, whilst technical indicators maintain modest bearish slopes within negative territory. The pair has an immediate support at 1.2430, the 38.2% retracement of its latest bullish run, followed by the mentioned daily low. Below this last, the pair has scope to extend down to the 1.2330/50 region a major support area that will likely hold on a first attempt to break lower. Support levels: 1.2430 1.2380 1.2345 Resistance levels: 1.2500 1.2535 1.2585 GOLD Spot gold bounced sharply from a daily low of 1,216.64, ending the day around $1,231.60 a troy ounce. The recovery was limited, as US data released this Wednesday backed Yellen's Tuesday comments about being risky to wait too long to raise rates, as inflation pressures are increasing. Dollar bulls rushed to take profits after the currency reached some critical levels against its major rivals, resulting in a strong intraday reversal that anyway is not enough to confirm an interim top. In the case of stop gold, the daily chart shows that the price bounced sharply after testing its 20 DMA, still advancing below the 100 DMA, whilst technical indicators are attempting to recover after a modest downward correction from overbought readings. In the 4 hours chart, the price is slightly above a flat 20 SMA whilst technical indicators head higher around their mid-lines, with limited upward strength. While further gains are not technically confirmed the risk of a bearish move seems well-limited according to technical readings, with only a break below the 1,200 level indicating a steeper decline afterwards. Support levels: 1,221.80 1,210.10 1,200.00 Resistance levels: 1,237.10 1,244.70 1,252.90 WTI CRUDE West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures closed flat for a second consecutive day a few cents above $53.00 a barrel, as large US stockpiles builds dented optimism about OPEC's output cut. US crude stocks rose 9.5 million barrels according to the EIA, much more than the 3.7 million expected, while gasoline stockpiles rose by 2.8 million barrels, also far beyond market's expectations. A decline in distillate stocks and crude oil imports partially offset the headline reading. Technically, the daily chart maintains the neutral stance seen on previous updates, with the price still stuck around a flat 20 SMA and technical indicators heading nowhere around their mid-lines. In the 4 hours chart, the price is trapped within horizontal moving averages, the Momentum indicator is flat below its 100 level, whilst the RSI indicator has turned south around its mid-line. Overall, the fundamental background favors a bearish extension, but it will take a break below 52.60 to confirm such move, with WTI then poised to test the key 50.00 figure. Support levels: 52.60 52.00 51.40 Resistance levels: 53.70 54.40 55.20 DJIA The positive momentum of US equities sent the three major indexes to all-time highs for a fifth consecutive session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 107 points to close at 20,611.58. The Nasdaq Composite added 36 points, to end at 5,819.44 whilst the S&P settled at 2,349.25, up 0.50%. The unstoppable rally was fueled by comments from US President Trump, who reaffirmed a massive tax reform will come in the "not-too-distant future." Banks were again among the best performers, with JP Morgan Chase up 1.15% and Goldman Sachs adding 0.47%. The DJIA daily chart shows that technical indicators keep heading sharply higher, despite being in extreme overbought territory, with the RSI indicator at 81, whilst the index is far above a bullish 20 DMA, a reflection of the ongoing buying fever. In the 4 hours chart, the technical picture is quite alike, with the RSI indicator still heading north around 87, the Momentum barely retreating within extreme overbought readings and the benchmark far above bullish moving averages. As long as optimism about upcoming policies aimed to boost growth and inflation in the US persist, equities will continue rallying, despite whatever extreme readings indicators mark. Support levels: 20,609 20,552 20,506 Resistance levels: 20,650 20,700 20,750 FTSE 100 The FTSE 100 closed at 7,302.41, up by 33 points or 0.47%, with the banking sector leading the way higher across the region. The index reached an almost one month high, further fueled by a weakening Pound. Ashtead Group was the best performer, up 3.20%, followed by Barclays that added 2.97%. Standard Chartered gained 2.66% while Royal Bank of Scotland closed 2.07% higher. The mining sector ended mixed, with BHP Billiton up 2.90%, but Antofagasta down 1.98% and Anglo American closing 1.03% lower. The index retains the bullish tone in its daily chart, holding above a flat 20 SMA and with technical indicators heading north within positive territory, still poised to retest the record high posted last January at 7,354, now the immediate resistance. In the 4 hours chart, the index is well above a bullish 20 SMA, but the Momentum indicator continues diverging lower within positive territory, whilst the RSI lost upward strength in overbought territory, none of them enough to confirm a bearish move, but acting as an immediate warning over a possible correction. Support levels: 7,296 7,254 7,208 Resistance levels: 7,354 7,390 7,425 DAX European equities closed with modest gains, with the banking sector leading the way higher following hawkish comments made by Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen. The German DAX added 22 points or 0.19% to close at 11,793.93, with Deutsche Bank leading gainers' list, up 2.06%. Commerzbank added 2.01%. The German benchmark advanced to a fresh 3-week high of 11,848, and despite the lack of clear momentum coming from technical readings, sentiment favors a bullish extension for the upcoming days. In the daily chart, the DAX continues developing above a horizontal 20 DMA, but far above bullish 100 and 200 DMAs. Indicators in the mentioned chart are flat, with the Momentum around 100, but the RSI at 62, supporting the bullish case. In the 4 hours chart, the 20 SMA continues advancing below the current level, with an approach to it having been quickly reverted, whilst technical indicators are aiming higher after correcting overbought conditions reached earlier this week. Support levels: 11,745 11,694 11,640 Resistance levels: 11,848 11,891 11,935   About the Author HY Markets More from HY Markets: Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (15 February 2017) Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (14 February 2017) Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (13 February 2017) Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (10 February 2017) Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (09 February 2017) Latest in Technical Analysis Feb 16 09:22 GMT - EUR/USD Continues Rebound On Thurs...

REUTERS/File Photos 3/3 By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK NEW YORK A Florida software engineer and a New Jersey pastor engaged in lies and corruption to facilitate an illegal bitcoin exchange business whose operators wanted to take over a small credit union to evade scrutiny, a federal prosecutor said on Wednesday. At the start of a trial in Manhattan federal court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Won Shin told jurors that programmer Yuri Lebedev schemed with others to bribe Trevor Gross, the pastor and head of a Jackson, New Jersey-based credit union housed in his church. Shin said Gross accepted bribes including a $150,000 church donation in exchange for helping unlicensed bitcoin exchange Coin.mx's operator take over Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union. Coin.mx, which employed Lebedev while running through a front called "Collectables Club," in exchange could use the credit union to evade scrutiny of banks wary of processing payments by individuals buying the virtual currency. "The bribes and lies had a simple, shared purpose: For the defendants Lebedev and Gross and their co-conspirators to make money," Shin said. But lawyers for Lebedev, 39, and Gross, 52, said they did nothing wrong and were being blamed due to actions by Anthony Murgio, who ran Coin.mx and who they said manipulated people while trying to illegally grow the business. "Yuri was in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people," said Eric Creizman, Lebedev's lawyer. Kristen Santillo, Gross' lawyer, said he was tricked into believing Coin.mx was a memorabilia club, and thought there was nothing wrong about a donation to the church, and which did not benefit him personally. "He didn't know anything about what they were up to," she said. The trial followed an investigation rooted in a data breach that JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) disclosed in 2014 that exposed over 83 million accounts, leading to charges against nine individuals. Gross, Lebedev and Murgio were not accused of hacking. But prosecutors said Coin.mx was owned by an Israeli behind the breach, Gery Shalon. Prosecutors say Shalon, together with Maryland-born Joshua Samuel Aaron, orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million peoples' information. Prosecutors said they carried out the hackings to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with promotional emails. Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein have pleaded not guilty. Regulators took the credit union into conservatorship in 2015. Murgio pleaded guilty to charges related to Coin.mx in January.

By Nicole Rojas February 15, 2017 23:38 GMT Close Co-op bank up for sale after turnaround stalled IBTimesUK/Wochit US stocks continued on an upward trend Wednesday (15 February), closing at record highs for a fifth straight session. All three major indices posted the longest record-setting streak since January 1992 following President Donald Trump's promise of a "massive" tax plan. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 107.45 points, or 0.5%, to settle at 20,611.86. Gains in the blue chip gauge were led by Procter & Gamble Co, whose shares rose 3.7% after investor Trian Fund Management LP revealed a $3bn stake in the company, MarketWatch reported. CNBC noted that official filings released Tuesday (14 February) showed a number of US hedge fund investors transferred significant parts of their portfolios into the financial and pharmaceutical sectors. The S&P 500 index rose 11.67 points, or 0.5%, to finish at 2,349.25. A rise of nearly 1.2% in healthcare stocks led the S&P higher at the close of the session. The financials sector also contributed to gains, rising 0.7% on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite gained 36.87 points, or 0.6%, to end at 5,819.44. MarketWatch reported the tech-heavy index closed at a record for a seventh session in a row, marking the longest similar streak since 27 December 1999. Trump's comments on Wednesday echoed those made earlier in February when he promised to deliver a "phenomenal" tax plan. The president said that his administration is "focused on the issues that will bring economic growth. That's what we're all about." In economic news, the consumer price index (CPI) gained a more-than-expected 0.6% in January, CNBC reported. Retail sales also rose at a faster pace than what was expected, gaining 0.4% in January. Following the inflation report, economist at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan raised their expectations of a rate hike for March or May. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testified in front of Congress on Tuesday and raised expectations for a rate hike in March, saying it would be "unwise" for the Fed to delay. Gold futures for April delivery rose $7.40 to settle at $1,233.10 an ounce. Meanwhile US crude oil for March delivery dropped $0.09 to $53.11 a barrel. The dollar moved lower against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.06 and the yen 114.1 against the greenback. US Treasury yields jumped after the data releases, with the short-term two-year yield at 1.26% and the 10-year yield climbing above 2.5%.

"He didn't know anything about what they were up to," she said. The trial followed an investigation rooted in a data breach that JPMorgan Chase & Co disclosed in 2014 that exposed over 83 million accounts, leading to charges against nine individuals. Gross, Lebedev and Murgio were not accused of hacking. But prosecutors said Coin.mx was owned by an Israeli behind the breach, Gery Shalon. Prosecutors say Shalon, together with Maryland-born Joshua Samuel Aaron, orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million peoples' information. Prosecutors said they carried out the hackings to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with promotional emails. Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein have pleaded not guilty. Regulators took the credit union into conservatorship in 2015. Murgio pleaded guilty to charges related to Coin.mx in January.

The country's licensed lenders grew their loan books at the fastest pace in eight years in 2016, with $393.6 billion of loans and advances as at Dec. 31 from $364 billion a year earlier, according to KPMG's financial institutions performance survey. Still, skinnier net interest margins of 2.18 percent compared with 2.28 percent a year earlier, meant net profit fell 6.5 percent to $4.84 billion across the sector. While customer deposits rose 8.1 percent to $287.5 billion, it wasn't big enough to fund the credit expansion and lenders turned to wholesale funding lines overseas which were more expensive in what remains a low interest rate environment. Bank executives spoken to by the report's authors said the more expensive wholesale funding will be compounded by increased lending restrictions and capital requirements imposed on the big four Australian-owned banks' parents, which will see them "return billions of dollars in funding to their Australian parents over the next few years". That's expected to "slow lending growth in the upcoming year," the report said. This week ASB Bank chief executive Barbara Chapman noted the narrowing margins when the lender reported a 6 percent increase in first-half profit, saying deposits weren't keeping pace with credit growth. Just three banks were able to widen their margins in 2016, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (New Zealand), which its margin by seven basis points to 0.89 percent, and the New Zealand branches of JP Morgan Chase Bank, which increased it by eight basis points to 0.85 percent, and Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp, which eked out a three basis point gain to 1.85 percent. NZX-listed Heartland Bank retained the widest margin at 4.79 percent, down from 4.89 percent a year earlier. In 2015, New Zealand's lenders reaped their biggest margins in nine years in a period of strong lending growth, primarily in the residential and agricultural sectors. Since then banks have become more wary about the rural sector after a slump in dairy prices meant many farms faced another year operating at a loss, although dairy prices have since recovered somewhat. At the same time, the property market has slowed down after the Reserve Bank imposed new curbs to cool investor demand, which was seen driving up prices at an unsustainable pace, taking advantage of a housing shortage during a time of rapid population growth. The lenders themselves adopted tougher criteria, and ANZ Bank New Zealand chief executive David Hisco went as far as writing an op-ed piece in the New Zealand Herald newspaper last July warning property prices were overcooked. The banks' executive said they faced a "tough predicament" in the public eye over interest rates when the Reserve Bank lowered the official cash rate last year, as "they were unable to reduce deposit rates due to a decline in the volume of deposits because of already low rates, and at the same time they could not reduce home loan rates any further as they were already under margin pressure and starting to hit ROE (return on equity) and ROI (return on investment) limits."

Why Real Strength Begins With the Core The Only Core Workout You'll Ever Need Cutting Meat Without Cutting Muscle Tech Are Smartphone-Operated ATMs Safe? By  Dylan Love Credit: Getty Images Banks are currently pushing a new way for you to get cash. By extending the technology that already lives inside every modern phone, the banking sector wants its smartphone-wielding customers to be able to securely interact with their ATMs without so much as a card. The most popular means to make this happen is with NFC, or Near-Field Communication. It’s a wireless protocol that securely sends data between two electronic devices when they are within a few inches of each other. They can transfer files or data to confirm an identity or facilitate a purchase. This is the tech at work behind every Apple Pay transaction, for example. Now it may soon be headed to your ATM. RELATED: Protect Your Privacy: Apps That Go the Extra Mile With 18,000 domestic ATMs to its name, JPMorgan Chase is test-driving this technology on a few hundred machines in four American test cities. Bank of America and Wells Fargo will introduce cardless access to ATMs before the end of 2017. Forgetful bank customers everywhere seem bound to benefit — shunning the card might seem like a baby step, but it’s big news for two main reasons: security and convenience. MORE: How to Keep Your Data Safe While Traveling? Bankers have long been at war with “skimmers,” disguised hardware that malicious third parties install on an ATM to record card numbers as people swipe them, and their corresponding PIN codes as people punch them in. The all-important ATM card becomes the weakest point of attack here; by using a physical card, there is a mild yet inherent lack of security for a bad guy to take advantage of. For a similar attack to take place at an NFC-enabled ATM, the bad guy would have to steal your entire phone, and you’d notice a missing phone before a missing wallet.

"As long as we stay focused on that, the market is going to continue to go higher." The president continued to tout his economic agenda in a meeting with retail CEOs Wednesday. He said the administration remains "focused on the issues that will bring economic growth. That's what we're all about." The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) traded about two thirds of a percent higher. However, shares of H&R Block hit a session low after Trump said the company probably wouldn't like his tax reform plan. Shares recovered to trade about 0.7 percent lower. The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent, and the Nasdaq added 0.64 percent. "We're halfway through the first quarter, and ... people have to chase performance," said Peter Coleman, head trader at Convergex. "At the end of the day, the sentiment is you're going to get some tax reform and some infrastructure policy," he said. Stocks had closed at record highs again on Tuesday, lifted by the financials sector, which received a lift from higher interest rates. The major U.S. stock indexes had traded mostly sideways this year, until Trump said last week the administration will be releasing a "phenomenal" tax plan in the next two-to-three weeks. "I think what may have started off as short covering, then a short squeeze, has brought in some money off the sidelines into the more cyclical areas of the market," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. The financials sector is up more than 22 percent since the election as the top performer in the S&P 500. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) traded more than half a percent higher Wednesday at an all-time high. The initial pop in equities following Trump's election was mostly spurred by hopes of infrastructure spending, deregulation and lower corporate taxes. But the transition into Trump's presidency has been bumpy. On Monday, Trump's National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned from his post after days of speculation about his status within the administration and intense scrutiny into his discussions about Russia prior to Trump's inauguration. "The market has been surprisingly generous to Trump," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "If we learn that Trump did something unethical ahead of the election, then that would have some impact. But barring something of that magnitude, I think the market will continue to shrug off those issues." In economic news, the consumer price index (CPI) rose a more-than-expected 0.6 percent in January, the largest monthly gain since February 2013. In the 12 months through January, the CPI increased 2.5 percent, the biggest year-on-year gain since March 2012. After the inflation report, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan economists increased their expectations for a rate hike as soon as March or May. U.S. Treasury yields spiked following data releases, with the benchmark 10-year note yield breaking above 2.5 percent, while the shorter-term two-year note yield briefly climbed to 1.26 percent. The U.S. dollar traded lower against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.059 and the yen around 114.2. Retail sales also beat expectations, with the headline number showing a 0.4 percent rise for January after an upwardly revised 1 percent gain in December. The so-called core retail sales, excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, posted a 0.4 percent rise. "You can see that the picture is changing as inflation has picked up over in China and this is having a more prominent impact over in the U.S.," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, in a note. "The U.S. retail sales data was hot and it tells us how much investors are willing to dig deep into their pockets and how confident they are in their spending attitude." Other data released include business inventories for December, which rose 0.4 percent, and the February read on U.S. home builder sentiment, which showed a decline. "This market, for a long time, was hungry for a growth story," said Jim Davis, regional investment manager for The Private Client Group of U.S. Bank. "Every time we get a number supporting that, more people jump on the bandwagon." Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testified in front of Congress for the second straight day. On Tuesday, she said it would be "unwise" for the U.S. central bank to wait too long to raise interest rates, lifting market expectations for a March rate hike. "Our view is the over/under on rate hikes for this year is at two. But the data continue to come in stronger," said Michael Collins, senior investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income. "I think it gives the Fed more room to act how they've communicated." "But there are still a lot of risks in the global economy, and in the U.S. there is some policy risk," he said.

The economy's strengthening outlook was also bolstered by other data on Wednesday showing manufacturing and mining production rising last month as the drag from lower oil prices fades. The reports came as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen appeared to put a March interest rate hike on the table. "All things consumer show the economy is starting the year off with a bang," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. "Interest rates are too low and with an economy this strong rates need to be put on a preset course higher." The Commerce Department said retail sales increased 0.4 percent last month, buoyed by purchases of electronics and appliances. Households also spent more on dining out, sporting goods and hobbies. December's sales were revised up to show a 1.0 percent rise instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent advance. Sales rose despite motor vehicle purchases posting their biggest drop in 10 months. Compared to January last year retail sales were up 5.6 percent. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.4 percent after a similar gain in December. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales ticking up 0.1 percent and core sales gaining 0.3 percent last month. In the wake of the data financial markets were pricing in a 27 percent chance of an interest rate hike at the Fed's March 14-15 policy meeting, up from 18 percent late on Tuesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch programme. The dollar briefly rose to a one-month high versus a basket of currencies on the data, before surrendering gains to trade marginally lower. Prices for U.S. government bonds fell, while Wall Street extended its record-setting run for a fifth day. In a separate report, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index jumped 0.6 percent last month as households paid more for gasoline, new motor vehicles, airline fares and clothing. It was the largest increase since February 2013 and followed a 0.3 percent gain in December. In the 12 months through January, the CPI increased 2.5 percent, the biggest year-on-year gain since March 2012. The CPI rose 2.1 percent in the year to December. Inflation is trending higher as prices for energy goods and other commodities rebound in response to a pick-up in global demand. The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, rose 0.3 percent last month after increasing 0.2 percent in December. That lifted the year-on-year core CPI increase to 2.3 percent in January from December's 2.2 percent rise. The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.7 percent. Strengthening domestic demand together with firming inflation and a tightening labour market could allow the Fed to raise interest rates at least twice this year. Testifying before lawmakers on Wednesday, Yellen reiterated that it would be "unwise" for the U.S. central bank to wait too long to raise interest rates. HAWKISH RHETORIC The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year. The Fed hiked its overnight interest rate last December by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. Despite January's strong inflation and retail sales reports, many economists only expect two rate hikes in 2017. "Recent rhetoric from Fed officials has turned marginally more hawkish lately. We still think March is too early for them to hike, particularly given their propensity to prepare markets for a move," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. "We continue to look for two hikes this year." A third report from the Fed showed manufacturing production increased 0.2 percent in January after a similar rise in December. Output at mines shot up 2.8 percent, with oil and gas well drilling increasing further. While the reports on Wednesday suggested the economy regained momentum early in the first quarter, rising inflation means households have less spending power. Average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation fell 0.5 percent in January and were unchanged from a year ago. "This is not the best thing in the world for lower income households living paycheck-to-paycheck," said Chris Christopher, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. Still, Christopher said an improving labour market would support relatively robust consumer spending. "Household finances are in good shape, thanks to gains in both home prices and stock prices, along with debt deleveraging," he added.

Posted 16 Feb 2017 05:20 Updated 16 Feb 2017 05:42 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks jumped to record closes again on Wednesday (Feb 15) on fresh assurances that President Donald Trump intends to press ahead with tax cuts soon. For the fifth straight day, all three major US equity indices ended at all-time highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 107.45 points (0.52 per cent) to 20,611.86. The S&P 500 also rose 11.67 points (0.50 per cent) to 2,349.25, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 36.87 points (0.64 per cent) to 5,819.44. US stocks have been on a tear since last week when Trump vowed to release details of his promised tax cut plan within two to three weeks. On Wednesday, Trump told a White House meeting of retailers he would release specifics on the plan in the "not-too-distant future," and it will be "good and simpler." "It feels like investors might get the pro-growth part of the platform," Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich said, adding that questions about Trump's connections to Russia so far are not rattling investors. Analysts also said January data showing higher consumer inflation and retail sales helped to boost stocks. Sectors with strong gains included financials, with Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo all winning more than one per cent. Pharmaceuticals also outperformed: Pfizer gained 2.3 per cent, Gilead Sciences 3.3 per cent and Mylan 4.2 per cent. P&G jumped 3.7 per cent on news that activist investor Trian Fund Management led by Nelson Peltz holds 6.4 million shares worth US$575 million in the consumer products giant, according to a securities filing. Some news reports said Trian has added to the stake since the filing deadline and now holds more than US$3 billion in shares. Trian is known for pushing companies to reorganise businesses and return funds to shareholders. Insurer American International Group slumped 9.0 per cent after reporting a US$3 billion loss in the fourth quarter. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

For his bar mitzvah — the ceremony that welcomes 13-year-old Jewish boys into adulthood — Bloch received $7,000 in cash. It was 1998 and, like so many amateur traders at the time, he plunged his wealth into the stock market, mostly software and telecommunication names like Lucent and Nortel. He quickly tripled his money. By age 15, it was all gone. "This knocked me over the head and left a burning curiosity that I still carry today," said Bloch, now 31, from the San Francisco headquarters of his financial-tech start-up Digit. "I realized I didn't know s--- about how any of this was working." Now Bloch is playing into another trend that's taking over Silicon Valley: Machine learning. Using the combination of massive data sets, exploding compute capacity in the cloud and a host of analytics tools, entrepreneurs are training computers to make increasingly sophisticated decisions. Eventually, the experts say, we'll land at true artificial intelligence, where computers are smart enough to train computers. And it's going to upend the traditional banking industry. Helping consumers with their finances It's hardly a straight line from the dot-bomb blunder to Bloch's new gig developing an automated savings tool for millennials. But Bloch says he's been obsessed with finance for almost two decades, even while running his first software start-up Flowtown, a social media marketing platform. Bloch sold Flowdown to Demandforce for a few million bucks in 2011. The following year, having banked enough cash to follow his passion, Bloch set out on a mission to improve consumers' financial health. The tagline on his website is, "Save money, without thinking about it." The company is initially targeting younger consumers, who've grown up in an era dominated by smartphones and a loathing for brick-and-mortar banks. show chapters These five industries are being revolutionized by AI    14 Hours Ago | 02:23 Digit's software plugs into a user's checking account, analyzing expenses and income and determining how much money could be stashed away without the customer feeling it. Based on the personalized algorithm, Digit puts a few bucks or so a week into a savings account, notifying users with a simple text to help them pay off college or credit card debt or prepare for a wedding. It also serves up reminders to eliminate late fees and recently launched a notification bot on Facebook Messenger. Digit says that it's saved more than $350 million for its customers. That includes people like Jenn Chen, a former community manager at a San Francisco software company who's now in between jobs. Chen has saved close to $16,000 over the past three years using Digit, money that would have otherwise remained in her checking account and more than likely have been spent. "It started off small and as time went by, I started seeing different ways I could increase that amount and be OK," she said. The savings were of particular importance after a hit-and-run accident left her with a hefty out-of-pocket payment for hospital bills. The changing workforce According to Goldman Sachs, machine learning and AI will enable $34 billion to $43 billion in annual "cost savings and new revenue opportunities" within the financial sector by 2025, as institutions use technological advancements to maximize trading opportunities, reduce credit risk and lower compliance and regulatory costs. What that means for the labor force is a complicated equation. The banking sector contracted dramatically during last decade's financial crisis, with the failure of large institutions like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual and mass layoffs elsewhere. Three of the four largest U.S. banks — Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America — have fewer employees than they did in 2008. Jobs most in jeopardy from here are those that lend themselves to automation. Bank tellers will see an 8 percent decline between 2014 and 2024, and the number of insurance underwriters will drop by 11 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. On the flip side, financial firms are hiring software developers and data scientists, areas of employment growth. Arvind Purushotham, a managing director at Citigroup's venture investing arm, is backing start-ups in fraud detection and security whose technology can potentially be applied internally at the banking giant. While there's a shift in the skills required to meet the financial challenges of the future, the problems are still being solved by people. "We think of human-assisted AI and AI-assisted humans," said Purushotham, "There are some things that humans can do that software programs can't hope to catch up to in decades." Expanding the lending pool The problem Douglas Merrill is trying to tackle will require sophisticated machines. Merill, who spent five years as Google's chief information officer, is the founder and CEO of ZestFinance, a Los Angeles-based start-up that's out to end the predatory system of payday lending by building algorithms that can underwrite people with little to no credit history. (He's among a handful of ex-Googlers applying computer science to finance. Consumer lender Upstart was created by former Google executives and is led by Dave Girouard, who previously ran Google's enterprise business. PeerStreet, a marketplace that matches real estate with investors, was co-founded by Brett Crosby, a former product marketing director at Google.) Merrill, who has a Ph.D in cognitive science from Princeton University, lives and breathes this stuff. From his vantage point, true machine learning is almost entirely absent from the lending industry despite a rapid acceleration over the past half-decade in online banking and underwriting. Consumer lenders like LendingClub, Prosper and SoFi have built substantial Web-based businesses using technology, but they're still targeting borrowers with good, if not pristine, credit. Source: ZestFinance ZestFinance CEO Douglas Merrill. That approach does nothing for Americans who struggle to make ends meet and rely on cash advances from one of the country's 20,000 payday lenders that populate mostly low-income areas. ZestFinance is looking for non-traditional data — information that can't be found in credit files — to determine the types of behavior that can help predict whether someone will repay debt. It turns out that a prospective borrower who fills out an application in all capital letters is a greater-than-average credit risk. While mounds of data exist that would help in developing new credit models, much of it sits in places that are very difficult to reach. For example, finding out if a bank account is open can be "super challenging," Merrill said. "I didn't foresee how hard would be to get access to a large number of those third-party data streams," said Merrill, whose 100-person team includes more than 30 data science and machine learning experts. "To run a big data and machine learning shop you have to have big data and machine learning." This week, ZestFinance introduced the Zest Automated Machine Learning (ZAML) platform, opening up the technology to any bank, credit card issuer or auto finance company. Merrill is also testing his algorithms in perhaps the world's greatest ocean of messy data: China. Through partnerships with e-retailer JD.com and Internet search provider Baidu, ZestFinance is aiming to help create a system for lending to half a billion people who lack any credit history. "Lenders in China are beginning to use these advanced techniques that analyze non-traditional variables, whether search, shopping or other data, to form the backbone of a new credit infrastructure," Merrill wrote recently in Chinese business publication Boao Review. "The credit landscape in China is about to change drastically." show chapters Goldman's top tech banker on artificial intelligence    Wednesday, 19 Oct 2016 | 11:18 AM ET | 03:22 The revolution is coming, but slowly The data suggests human lenders in the U.S. are still safe, for the time being. According to the BLS, the number of loan officers will increase 8 percent annually through 2014. Since the election of Donald Trump, bank stocks have rallied as investors wager that a Republican-controlled government will ease regulations on big financial firms just as rising rates will help boost earnings. Shares of Citigroup, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America have each jumped more than 20 percent since Trump declared victory on Nov. 9. But as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon wrote in his letter to shareholders in 2015, "Silicon Valley is coming." Here's one reason. Adyen, a 500-person payments start-up with offices in Amsterdam, San Francisco and 10 other cities, generates more than $1 million in revenue per employee. That looks more like Google than JPMorgan, which is around $400,000 per employee. Over the last two years, Adyen has been staffing up on data scientists to develop systems for preventing fraud. Adyen's customers range from Airbnb, Netflix and Spotify to easyJet and NH Hotels. When consumers sign up or make purchases on those apps, Adyen's software gets to work determining how much it can trust the buyer and whether another form of authentication is needed. It's a tricky formula. Asking for more information, be it the answer to a secret question or a code that's sent to a mobile phone, makes it more likely the consumer will drop off without completing the transaction. Minimizing fraud while maximizing so-called conversions is the goal, and it requires a personalized experience. Adyen's engine analyzes the shopper to figure out in real time if it's a regular customer and if the device, e-mail address and account information are familiar. A trusted buyer can go right through, but any red flags may mean more information is needed. Adyen Sam Halse, Adyen's chief operating officer, said clients see a 1.4 percent increase in revenue using the software. "That's a huge number on the bottom line, which was in the past simply lost revenue," Halse said. For Adyen, the algorithm keeps getting smarter, learning more about individual shoppers and broadly how fraudsters behave. Suranga Chandratillake, a partner at London-based venture firm Balderton Capital, said artificial intelligence in finance represents the next stage of human capital replacement. The first big one was the automatic-teller machine. Then came internet and mobile banking. Now, it's what Chandratillake calls "pseudo white-collar jobs," where machines are being trained to recognize patterns on forms like mortgage applications and insurance claims and to act with better accuracy in less time than people. "These are jobs that require human judgment but that are very repetitive," said Chandratillake. "To crack these you need a smart AI founder and team but you also need someone who has expertise in some weird niche like this and can see how to exploit it."

Banks likely to scale bank lending growth as margins squeezed Paul McBeth Thursday February 16, 2017 4 Share ASB chief executive Barbara Chapman Play NBR radio on Banks profit margins have been hit and have fallen 6.5% across the sector. The banks are likely to wind back the pace of new lending this year as the margin squeeze caused by higher capital requirements for the big four Australian-owned institutions and greater use of more expensive wholesale funding weighed on their profits. The country's licensed lenders grew their loan books at the fastest pace in eight years in 2016, with $393.6 billion of loans and advances at the end of December from $364 billion a year earlier, according to KPMG's financial institutions' performance survey. Still, skinnier net interest margins of 2.18% compared with 2.28% a year earlier, meant net profit fell 6.5% to $4.84 billion across the sector. While customer deposits rose 8.1% to $287.5 billion, it wasn't big enough to fund the credit expansion and lenders turned to wholesale funding lines overseas which were more expensive in what remains a low-interest rate environment. Bank executives spoken to by the report's authors say the more expensive wholesale funding will be compounded by increased lending restrictions and capital requirements imposed on the banks' parents, which will see the local institutions "return billions of dollars in funding to their Australian parents over the next few years". That's expected to "slow lending growth in the upcoming year," the report says. This week ASB Bank chief executive Barbara Chapman noted the narrowing margins when the lender reported a 6 % increase in first-half profit, saying deposits weren't keeping pace with credit growth. Just three banks were able to widen their margins in 2016, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (New Zealand), which increased its margin by seven basis points to 0.89% and the New Zealand branches of JP Morgan Chase Bank, which increased it by eight basis points to 0.85%, and Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp, which eked out a three basis point gain to 1.85%. NZX-listed Heartland Bank retained the widest margin at 4.79%, down from 4.89% a year earlier. In 2015, New Zealand's lenders reaped their biggest margins in nine years in a period of strong lending growth, primarily in the residential and agricultural sectors. Since then banks have become more wary about the rural sector after a slump in dairy prices meant many farms faced another year of operating at a loss, although dairy prices have since recovered somewhat. At the same time, the property market has slowed down after the Reserve Bank imposed new curbs to cool investor demand, which was seen to be driving up prices at an unsustainable pace, taking advantage of a housing shortage during a time of rapid population growth. The lenders themselves adopted tougher criteria, and ANZ Bank New Zealand chief executive David Hisco went as far as writing an op-ed piece in the New Zealand Herald newspaper last July warning property prices were overcooked. The banks' executive said they faced a "tough predicament" in the public eye over interest rates when the Reserve Bank lowered the official cash rate last year, as "they were unable to reduce deposit rates due to a decline in the volume of deposits because of already low rates, and at the same time they could not reduce home loan rates any further as they were already under margin pressure and starting to hit ROE (return on equity) and ROI (return on investment) limits."

News RELATED STORIES Qatar equity market has broken out of technical downtrend: Credit Suisse RBA keeps rates unchanged Credit Suisse nearing Swiss bank spin-off with new unit As lira falls, Turkey’s central bank takes rare pause in rate cuts Credit Suisse plans Mideast growth as millionaires rise A tram passes the illuminated headquarters of Credit Suisse Group in Zurich. Credit Suisse plans to cut as many as 6,500 jobs this year and is keeping its options open as it prepares for a partial sale of its Swiss unit to strengthen capital. Text Size: A A A Bloomberg/Zurich Credit Suisse Group plans to cut as many as 6,500 jobs this year and is keeping its options open as it prepares for a partial sale of its Swiss unit to strengthen capital. The share sale “is a very good option, it’s on the table,” Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “But of course, as you would expect, it’s what we’re paid for, we look at other options as well, continuously.” The Swiss bank is stepping up cost cuts after a charge to settle a US investigation into the role of its mortgage securities business in the 2008 financial crisis led to a fourth-quarter loss of 2.35bn francs ($2.34bn). While the $5.3bn settlement dented the bank’s capital buffers, the damage was less severe than some analysts expected. Credit Suisse doesn’t need the initial public offering, according to Peter Casanova, a Zurich-based analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux who rates the stock buy. Thiam said the bank “will decide in the best interest of shareholders and that’s a hint he may not do it,” Casanova said. “It’s not in the interest of shareholders to sell the bank’s crown jewel.” Credit Suisse reported a common equity Tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, of 11.6% at the end of December, down from 12% at the end of September. The bank is targeting 13% by the end of 2018. Cost-cutting is ahead of schedule and an improved market sentiment for banks that boosted trading in the fourth quarter has continued this year, Thiam said in the interview. The bank eliminated 7,250 jobs last year, surpassing its target of 6,000 cuts for 2016, Chief Financial Officer David Mathers told reporters. The bank employs about 47,000. Thiam had said he was accelerating cost cuts when he updated investors on his turnaround plan in December. But he declined to give a target for job cuts at the time, except to say that the downsizing of the global markets unit, where most of last year’s cuts occurred, was largely completed. The CEO has long described the plan to raise 2bn francs to 4bn francs through a sale of 20% to 30% of the Swiss business as a cornerstone of his strategy to reshape the company to focus on wealth management. On a conference call with analysts Tuesday, he repeatedly referred to it as merely a “backstop.” “It’s not convincing that the IPO would have achieved any great benefit to the capital position of the bank,” said Ray Soudah, founder of Millenium Associates, a corporate finance advisory firm in Zurich. “They’ve now realised this and the IPO is unlikely to happen. There’s no merit to doing it, especially after the recent recovery in the share price.” The shortfall in fourth-quarter profit reflected a charge to settle with the US Justice Department. Thiam said the bank expects to pay only $2.55bn of the $5.3bn settlement. The agreement calls for $2.8bn in consumer relief for which the bank has set aside about $70mn, he told analysts. The settlement is a “game-changer” that “leaves us in a more comfortable position to look today at our capital planning,” Thiam said in the Bloomberg interview. Credit Suisse’s “capital ratio is much better than expected by 50 basis points, and the January outlook statement shall be seen as a strong start,” Kian Abouhossein, an analyst with JPMorgan, said in a note. “What we think Credit Suisse needs to illustrate now is that it can generate ongoing profit and book value growth to deserve a re-rating.” Like other big European lenders, Credit Suisse is reining in spending under pressure from low interest rates and rules requiring banks to hold more reserves. The bank is targeting an operating cost base of less than 17bn Swiss francs by 2018, down from an earlier goal of below 18bn francs. Restructuring costs amounted to 49mn francs, as Credit Suisse cut about 1,800 jobs during the quarter. That brought the total for the year to 540mn francs, below the bank’s guidance of about 600mn. The bank said in December the cost would remain about the same this year. The Swiss universal bank delivered the largest contribution to the bank’s pretax profit in the fourth quarter, with a pretax profit of 382mn francs. “The preparation for the IPO continues, however Credit Suisse stated that it will continue to assess the evolving regulatory environment to identify the best options for shareholders,” Jernej Omahen, an analyst at Goldman Sachs with a buy rating on the bank, said in a note to clients. “It is unclear to us what the possible alternatives to the IPO could be, but the market will no doubt focus on this in the immediate future.” 0 COMMENTS There are no comments.

(Bloomberg) The Competition Commission said it plans to prosecute more than a dozen international and local banks for alleged collusion in foreign currency trading. The commission, which has been investigating a case of price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand, has referred the case for prosecution, it said on Wednesday. The lenders included Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit, JPMorgan Chase & Co, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse Group, HSBC Holdings and Nomura Holdings. The commission said that, from at least 2007, banks had an agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving the dollar and rand currency pairing. — Bloomberg.   BNP Paribas Read More Contravention and collusion - issues the commission deals with on a daily basis Steep fines fail to deter collusion Maharaj dismisses alleged involvement in spy tape collusion Climate change: The secrets of our collusion Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Ramaphosa, Zuma cold war hits freezing point National | 2017-02-10 00:00:00 National | 2017-02-10 00:00:00 Editorial: Zuma’s fears erode democracy Editorials | 2017-02-10 00:00:00 Editorials | 2017-02-10 00:00:00 A not-so-proudly South African link to Trump's inner circle Opinion | 2017-02-08 11:08:00 Opinion | 2017-02-08 11:08:00 OkMalumKoolKat: The case of an escape artist Music | 2017-01-30 00:00:00 Music | 2017-01-30 00:00:00 ANC plans 'constitutional revolution' on land Politics | 2017-02-03 00:00:00 Politics | 2017-02-03 00:00:00 Most Read Client Media Releases Press OfficesAfroCentric HealthBarloworld LogisticsBoston City CampusCIO Council of South AfricaContinuitySACorporate TravellerDefencewebFaculty Training InstituteFCm Travel SolutionsFedGroup Financial ServicesFutureSenseGIBSHollardImperial LogisticsInternet SolutionsIpsosiStoreITWebJag MethodLime CapitalLottery ResultsKhulumani Support GroupMail and GuardianMandela Bay DevelopmentMiWayMiX TelematicsMessageLOUDMitelMTNNihilent TechnologiesNorth West UniversityOxbridge AcademyPragmaRosebank CollegeSANRALSAS InstituteSAP AfricaSentechSoarsoft InternationalTeraco Data EnvironmentsThe Innovation HubTiger BrandsVaal University of Technology North West University NRF recognises NWU professor's research Barloworld Logistics Paving the road ahead for young entrepreneurs Soarsoft International Lunch & Learn with Soarsoft International and iManage SANRAL SANRAL welcomes ConCourt judgment on N1/N2 Winelands iStore Introducing iStore Makers: the evolution of iPhoneography Want to publish your media releases here?

The Competition Commission identified lenders including  Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC Holdings Plc, BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse Group AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Nomura Holdings Inc. as having participated in price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand since at least 2007. It referred the case to an antitrust tribunal, concluding an investigation that began in 2015. Banking stocks traded in Johannesburg fell for the first day in six to head for their biggest decline in a week. The outcome of the probe comes as President Jacob Zuma and his governing African National Congress step up pressure to break the dominance of South Africa’s four largest lenders. Zuma and the banks are locked in a stand-off after the lenders closed the accounts of companies tied to his friends, the Guptas. He has accused banks of not doing enough to improve access to the economy that still eludes many of the country’s black majority almost 23 years since the end of apartheid. “The timing for banks couldn’t be worse,” said Adrian Saville, the chief strategist at Citadel Investment Services & Cannon Asset Managers. “They’ve been trying to capture the moral high ground on the Gupta issue. It comes at a time when they’re trying to demonstrate impeccable behavior. It makes a case for intervention.” Fictitious Bids The action by South African authorities also follows the sentencing by a U.S. federal judge in January of Citigroup Inc., Barclays Plc, JPMorgan and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, which all pleaded guilty in May 2015 to rigging currency rates. As part of an overall $5.8 billion settlement with multiple regulators, they agreed to pay about $2.5 billion to the Justice Department. South Africa’s central bank said the Competition Commission’s investigation related mainly to the rand-dollar in offshore markets. “The respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times,” the Pretoria, South Africa-based commission said in an e-mailed statement Wednesday. “They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives.” Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up South Africa’s central bank said in a statement it viewed the allegations as a serious matter and would allow proceedings to run their course. Some 30 percent of daily turnover in the rand takes place in South Africa, of which foreigners account for 58 percent. In April 2016, the daily average worldwide foreign-exchange trading involving the rand was about $49 billion, it said, citing Bank for International Settlements data, representing 1 percent of total turnover. Bad Reputation “Collusive practices must lead to consequences such as termination of the services of key management, executive and non-executive directors.,” said Asief Mohamed, chief investment officer at Cape Town-based Aeon Investment Management. “The banks, if guilty, will most likely be fined and this will have a negative impact on earnings and reputation. ” Bank of America, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered Plc, Commerzbank AG, Macquarie Group Ltd., Australia & New Zealand Banking Corp., Standard Bank Group Ltd., HSBC and BNP declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Investec Plc said it would cooperate with authorities, but was unable to comment further because it didn’t have details of their investigations.  Barclays Africa Group Ltd. also said it would cooperate with the authorities, while noting that the regulator had not sought penalties against it. Credit Suisse said it is looking into the matter. Stocks Fall Standard Bank led banking shares in Johannesburg lower on Thursday, falling 1 percent by 11:15 a.m. in the city. Nedbank Group Ltd. and FirstRand Ltd., which aren’t named in the probe, dropped 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent, while Barclays Africa declined 0.6 percent. “The profit-driven assault on the South African rand through such collusion and corruption by the banks flies in the face of efforts” to ensure prosperity for everyone in the country, the ANC said in a statement. “It is further an indication of how the markets are and can be manipulated by dominant oligopolies to cripple its functioning to suit their nefarious agenda.” The tribunal will now notify the banks of the complaint and ask them to respond, Chantelle Benjamin, a spokesman for the body, said by phone. The banks will then file statements and attend a preliminary meeting to set a date for a full hearing, she said. The commission has previously uncovered collusion in the country’s bread and flour industry, among cement producers and by construction companies that bid to build stadiums for the 2010 soccer World Cup. Those involved were forced to pay hefty fines.  Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Goldman Sachs Group Inc. climbed to a record high on optimism President Donald Trump’s administration will spur trading and dealmaking, slash corporate taxes and roll back costly regulations after installing the firm’s executives in top government posts. The shares rose 1.3 percent to $249.46 at 4 p.m. in New York, passing a record close set in late 2007, just before the industry plunged into a crisis that almost brought down the global financial system. Goldman’s stock recovered much of its loss in the years after that turmoil, and since Trump’s election has soared 37 percent, leading the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher. Investors are betting big U.S. banks can generate larger profits and pay out more to shareholders if Trump sidelines the industry’s sharpest critics, dismantles post-crisis rules and pursues policies that spur inflation and lift long-term interest rates. While Trump repeatedly attacked Goldman Sachs’s government influence during his campaign, the New York-based firm is now positioned to have its market philosophies expressed in policy in coming years. In December, Trump enlisted the investment bank’s then-president, Gary Cohn, to serve as the White House’s top economic adviser. On Monday, the Senate confirmed former Goldman partner Steven Mnuchin as U.S. Treasury secretary. Dina Powell, who ran the firm’s philanthropic arm, was named an assistant to the president, and Jim Donovan, a wealth manager, might also join the administration. Steve Bannon, who left the bank more than two decades ago, is Trump’s chief strategist. Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 28 requiring appointees such as Cohn to recuse themselves from decisions “directly and substantially related” to their former employers for two years. Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Baldwin called on Cohn this month to also withdraw from matters that may have “a significant indirect impact on Goldman” for as long as he serves in the administration. The Dow has climbed 12 percent since the Nov. 8 election, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. the second-best performer behind Goldman. The broader S&P 500 has gained 9.3 percent, with financial firms, oil drillers, rail and freight companies and airlines among those advancing. Apple Inc. shares reached a record this week on optimism the next iPhone will drive a resurgence in sales. Trump’s election already set off a flurry of market trading, boosting banks’ profits in the final months of 2016 as customers rushed to reposition their portfolios, generating fees. Such activity may remain elevated as the new president crafts policies and pushes companies to change practices, sometimes taking to Twitter. Goldman Sachs’s profits in recent years are still short of pre-crisis levels. Net income amounted to $7.4 billion in 2016, about 22 percent less than in 2006. Its revenue of $30.6 billion last year was about 19 percent lower. The firm expressed some concern this month about Trump’s ability to quickly jump-start growth. Chief economist Jan Hatzius and economist Jari Stehn wrote that they anticipate a delayed boost from increased government spending because legislation probably won’t pass until late 2017 or early 2018. “The more adverse parts” of Trump’s agenda remain substantial, they said. © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

Xinhua/Bao Dandan Washington - Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen set a relatively high hurdle for shrinking the central bank’s balance sheet, leading some analysts to conclude that such a move won’t occur this year. She told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that the Fed’s focus was on raising interest rates to keep the economy in balance, and not on reducing its holdings of bonds. Rates first need to reach sufficiently high levels that the Fed feels it has some room to cut them to offset a weakening economy. Only then would the central bank begin to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, she said. “What we would like to do is to find a time when we judge that our need to provide substantial accommodation to the economy in the coming years is minimal,” she said. The central bank also wants to be sure “that the economy is on a solid course and the federal funds rate has reached levels where we have some ability to address weakness by cutting it,” she added. Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist for Jefferies in New York, said that this meant no move to start shrinking the balance sheet in 2017. Policy makers expect to increase the fed funds rate to 1.4 percent by the end of 2017, according to the median of their projections released on Dec. 14. That would still leave it below the 20-year average of 2.3 percent. The timing and scope of any moves to reduce the Fed’s debt holdings could have big implications for the bond market and for the economy as a whole. That’s because, as Yellen herself noted, they would represent an effective tightening of monetary policy. “Allowing that process to take place,” Yellen said, “will show that the economy is doing well.” The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee has said it will continue to reinvest principal payments on the maturing bonds in its portfolio until “normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well underway.” Further guidance Yellen told the lawmakers Tuesday that the FOMC will discuss that strategy “in the coming months” with the aim of providing investors with “some further guidance” about its intentions. The central bank will want to telegraph its plans well advance of their implementation so as to avoid upsetting financial markets, said Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co in New York. He expects policy makers to do that in the second half of this year. The process of halting reinvestments though won’t begin until the middle of next year, according to Feroli. Yellen rejected recent suggestions by several Fed bank presidents that the central bank use its balance sheet as an active tool of monetary policy. Instead, the focus will remain on managing the fed funds rate in response to changes in the economy. The Fed chair also said that the reduction in the Fed’s bond portfolio would occur in a “gradual and orderly way.” Gradual taper That’s similar to the strategy the central bank employed when it tapered its asset purchases in 2014, reducing them in set amounts at each policy-making meeting. More than $600 billion in Treasury securities in the Fed’s portfolio are scheduled to mature this year and next, according to calculations by Bloomberg. Yellen’s four-year term as Fed chair expires on February 3, 2018, and she repeated that she has no plans to leave the central bank before then. McCarthy said the next Fed chair might well take a more aggressive approach to reducing the balance sheet, although Feroli said it might be difficult to change the Fed’s strategy once it has been put into place and digested by the markets. Yellen told lawmakers that she expects the central bank to eventually end up with “a balance sheet that’s substantially smaller than at the current time.” “In addition, we would like our balance sheet to again be primarily Treasury securities,” she said. Besides Treasuries, the Fed portfolio also contains mortgage-backed debt and agency securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. There’s a limit to how far the balance sheet can be reduced, however. At a minimum, it needs to be big enough to cover the roughly $1.5 trillion in currency now in circulation, which is increasing every year.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Ranbaxy deal to kick in, Halol overhang on Sun Pharma:Brokerages Most analysts noted that the Q3 results were below their estimates, but maintained their buy rating on the stock revising the target price slightly on lower side on hopes of Halol resolution, US specialty play kicking in and normalisation of India business. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Moneycontrol Bureau Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, India’s largest drug maker by sales on Tuesday posted a net profit decline of 5 percent to Rs 1471.8 crore in the third quarter ended December due to subdued sales growth in US and India. The revenues of the company grew by 8 percent to Rs 7683 crore in the third quarter. Most analysts noted that Q3 results were below estimates, but maintained their buy rating on the stock revising the target price on a lower side on hopes of early Halol resolution, Ranbaxy synergies, US specialty play kicking in and normalisation of India business.  Here is what brokerage firms have to say about Sun Pharma's Q3 results. Citi has a buy call on Sun Pharma, with reduced target price to Rs 900 from Rs 970. The brokerage house raised FY17 EPS estimates by 4 percent but cut FY18/19 estimates by 7 percent/5 percent. On the positive side Citi noted synergies on the Ranbaxy deal coming through as expected and good progress in building a specialty pipeline. On the flip side, it said a possible delay in fresh approvals from Halol plant, rising competitive intensity in the derma space and the ongoing US department of justice (DoJ) enquiry would remain overhangs in the medium term. Nomura maintained its neutral rating increasing the target price from Rs 726 to Rs 734. The brokerage firm cut FY17 earnings estimates for Sun Pharma by 9 percent, FY18 by 5 percent and FY19 by 3 percent after Q3 earnings missed analysts' expectations. Nomura noted that the generic business of Sun Pharma is under pressure, primarily due to price erosion in the US. Any further delay in resolution of the Halol situation presents risks to our near-term estimates. Nomura said that Sun’s efforts to build its specialty pipeline is critical to counter increasing completion in generic business in the medium term. "The specialty portfolio creates an option value that limits the risk of a significant P/E derating, in our view," it said. CLSA maintained a buy call, reducing the target price to Rs 790 from Rs 800. The research firm also cut FY17-F19 EPS by 1-4 percent and said Sun Pharma’s near-term outlook could remain soft in the absence of any major US launch. On a positive side it noted that Ranbaxy synergies remain on track while specialty pipeline will strengthen further. IDFC Securities maintained its buy call, but cut the target price by 17 percent to Rs 720. The brokerage house reduced FY17 and FY18 earnings by 6 percent and 14 percent, respectively. IDFC said any delay in Halol plant’s FDA issues resolution have added to near-term challenges arising out of heightened price erosion in Taro’s derma franchise. The stabilisation of India and EM business (+17 percent yoy growth in 9mFY17), continued cost optimization along with possible Halol issue resolution by H1FY18 should help to drive earnings recovery from H2FY18 onwards, it said. ICICI Securities maintained its buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 832 from earlier Rs 834 with downward revision of EPS by 2.4 percent in FY17, 6.4 percent in FY18 and 5 percent in FY19. The brokerage firm lists pickup in base US sales with potential for higher growth post Halol clearance, recovery in domestic formulations in FY18, 19.7 percent adjusted net profit CAGR over FY16-19E, and attractive valuations 20.2x FY18E and 17.2x FY19E and success on specialty front as key drivers for the company over FY18-19. Morgan Stanley retained its equal-weight rating on the stock, with reduced target price at Rs 690 from Rs 762. FY17, FY18 & FY19 EPS estimates cut buy 5.4 percent, 5.4 percent & 4.1 percent, it says. JPMorgan says Sun Pharma's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) miss was due to lower ex-Taro gross margins. Halol & ex-Taro performance are key drivers, it feels. The research firm is overweight on the stock, with reduced target at Rs 750 from Rs 775. Goldman Sachs has maintained buy rating on a favourable risk-reward on Sun Pharma but lowered target price to Rs 824 from Rs 836. It expects 14 percent EBITDA CAGR over FY16-19. Karvy has retained its hold rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 697, down from previous target price of Rs 737. The brokerage house reduced its EPS estimates for FY17E by 16.2 percent to Rs 27.1 and by 9.5 percent to Rs 30.3 for FY18E. On account of downgrade in earnings and possible long-term implications due to DOJ investigation we downgrade our price target to Rs 697 based on multiple 23x FY18E, Karvy said.

The firms have been loading up on data scientists and coders to deliver on the promise of quantitative investing and lift their ho-hum returns. But they are discovering that the marriage of old-school managers and data-driven quants can be rocky. Managers who have relied on gut calls resist ceding control to scientists and their trading signals. And quants, emboldened by the success of computer-driven funds like Renaissance Technologies, bristle at their second-class status and vie for a bigger voice in investing. Stories of this uneasy alliance abound. At Point72 Asset Management’s big data group, Aperio, the goals of Chief Data Scientist Michael Recce, a former professor of information systems, conflicted with the demands for fast results in the firm’s high-intensity culture, according to people familiar with the matter. Recce left Steve Cohen’s firm after about 15 months and Aperio is being rebuilt. At BlueMountain Capital Management, some quants frustrated with their subordinate role departed for the likes of  Google Inc., where technologists are the stars.  “You can’t just say, ‘Let’s hire some Ph.D.s and put them in the back room and they’ll figure it out,”’ Vladimir Novakovski, a former money manager who is chief technology officer at research firm Euclid Analytics, said about the industry. “That’s a very traditional way of thinking. They have to treat these folks like owners where they have some influence over the investment process.” BlackRock’s quants posted record losses last year. Read more Point72 and BlueMountain have been at the forefront of the push by fundamental firms to incorporate quantitative models and big data. But even they face challenges in wedding the old with the new. This story is based on interviews with more than 15 people who have knowledge of their efforts. Ted Smith, an external spokesman for the $21.5 billion BlueMountain, declined to comment. Point72 President Doug Haynes dismissed the existence of a clash between quants and fund managers at the $11 billion family office. “The notion that there was or is a conflict between technologists and money managers is a false premise,” Haynes said in an e-mailed statement. “Everyone wants to figure out how to use better science to drive better outcomes.” Aperio’s Ambitions Aperio, drawn from Latin word for discover, wasn’t Cohen’s first crack at quantitative investing. He set up a computer-driven unit many years ago that’s now called Cubist Systematic Strategies and operates separately from the rest of Cohen’s family office. With Aperio, he sought to bring together the distinct approaches of data scientists and the long-short equity managers who dominate Point72. Recce, who was hired in August 2014 to lead Aperio day-to-day, had big ambitions. A Ph.D. in neuroscience, Recce’s eclectic background included developing a handgun technology patent and algorithms for internet advertising. At Aperio, his mission was twofold: use big data sets to generate research and tools for discretionary managers as well as run a pool of money, according to the people, who asked not to be named. Scientists like Recce use machine learning algorithms to analyze the fire hose of data from credit cards, satellites and social media and find patterns, or signals. The goal is that these fresh insights will produce a winning wager. Quants, for instance, scrape social media and internet forums for consumer complaints about particular brands, helping investors decide whether to short retail stocks. For more on hedge funds embracing big data, click here Aperio had hired about 30 staffers by 2015. It worked from its own offices in New York, with a big kitchen and lounge in the mold of a startup, about 10 blocks away from Point72’s Manhattan office for discretionary managers. Several former Point72 employees don’t recall top management announcing the start of Aperio and were surprised to learn of the unit at events like the company’s holiday party. The lack of communication bred distrust of the quants and concerns about their influence, the people said. Intellectual Divide The divide between Aperio quants and fundamental money managers was also intellectual. They struggled to communicate about the basics, like how big data could inform investment decisions. Recce’s team, which was stacked with data scientists and coders, developed trading signals but didn’t always fully explain the margin of error in the analysis to make them useful to fund managers, the people said. The strained relations between scientists and managers could be likened to a meeting between the captains of a brainy chess team and a pumped-up football squad. “Data scientists and engineers working in isolation are very unlikely to deliver a product that satisfies the need of fundamental investors. There are so many different data sets and so many different things that can be done," said Emmett Kilduff, whose Eagle Alpha advises buy-side firms on technology. "A lot of time and money can be wasted." Haynes, who joined Stamford, Connecticut-based Point72 in early 2014 after about two decades at McKinsey & Co., and other senior managers grew dissatisfied with Aperio’s progress and impact on returns, the people said. When the group obtained new data sets, it spent too much time developing theories about how to process them rather than quickly producing actionable results. Quants Depart Haynes moved to narrow Aperio’s twin mission about two years ago, putting more focus on providing research for fund managers, the people said. Point72 said in July 2015 that it hired Matthew Granade, the former co-head of research at Bridgewater Associates, to oversee Aperio as well as economists and other research efforts. Recce was gone by October and several quants also left. They were frustrated with poor communication within the firm and what they saw as Aperio’s diminished ambitions, the people said. Recce was hired as chief data scientist at GIC Pte, Singapore’s big sovereign wealth fund, late last year. He declined to comment for this story. David Loaiza, who most recently worked in compliance analytics at JPMorgan Chase & Co., was hired as Aperio’s new leader in May of last year. Loaiza has made it clear that the group should provide useful information to analysts so the firm can make money, according to a person familiar with the matter. “We are engaged in a broad-based transformation, using these new data sources in every part of our business -- quant and discretionary -- as well as finding whole new ways to invest with it," Granade, chief market intelligence officer, said in an e-mailed statement. Seeking Influence Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up At BlueMountain, the New York hedge fund founded in 2003, quants have struggled to gain more influence over investing. Early on, they focused on valuing credit-default swaps and other derivatives that required heavy number crunching. After the 2008 financial crisis, the firm pushed into illiquid distressed debt and corporate credit markets, where quantitative trading signals may be harder to divine. BlueMountain traders have often viewed quants in the firm’s Quantitative Strategies group, which has about 50 staffers, as a sideshow to the investing process, according to people familiar with the matter. That rankled technologists, who wanted the group to be a driver of returns rather than seen as hired help for managers. When quants showed their risk analysis and trading signals to fundamental managers, they sometimes were rejected as nothing new, the people said. Quants at times wondered if managers simply didn’t want to give them credit for their ideas. The two sides also held regular meetings to hash out how they might use systematic strategies in discretionary trading. There was a lot of jawboning, but quants saw little progress in getting money managers to incorporate their signals, one of the people said. Systematic Fund The friction, as well as sexier jobs and perks at technology firms, have led to a revolving door of quants over the years, according to the people. At least eight quants who left BlueMountain last year joined high-frequency trading firms and tech companies including Google. Although collaboration between the two sides isn’t perfect at BlueMountain, it’s better than at many of its traditional peers and banks, several of the people said. BlueMountain is starting to let quants wield more power. The firm filed documents last year to establish a standalone systematic hedge fund. Yang Lu was hired from AQR Capital Management in 2014 to help manage the strategy, alongside Chief Technology Officer Perry Vais, which had grown to $400 million at the end of 2016. In coming years, quants will likely gain more clout as long as their strategies produce strong results. “The guys who run the funds today come from the fundamental side,” said Ronaldo Ama, who works with hedge funds to develop machine-learning technologies at Ayasdi, a software and consulting firm. “Where do you think they will come from 20 years from now? My theory is absolutely from the quant side.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

* SoftBank's PE play a break from telecoms and technology
    * New York-listed asset manager has Japan focus
    * SoftBank hired Fortress exec in 2014
    * Fortress shareholders to receive $8.08 per share

 (Adds graphic)
    By Thomas WilsonTOKYO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Japan'sSoftBank Group Corp
<9984.T> on Wednesday said it has agreed to buy Fortress
Investment Group LLC <FIG.N> for about $3.3 billion, looking to
add investment expertise as it prepares to launch the world's
largest private equity fund.
    The all-cash deal is SoftBank's first major investment in an
asset manager and represents yet another unpredictable gambit
for a group that has to date focused on telecoms and technology.
    It comes after founder Masayashi Son made the surprise
announcement in October that SoftBank is teaming up with Saudi
Arabia to set up a $100 billion technology fund. [nL8N1CJ6N8]
    Buying private equity and alternative investment heavyweight
Fortress could help SoftBank move to financing investments with
private equity cash instead of debt, said Gerhard Fasol of
Eurotechnology Japan, a consultancy.
    "Son's strategy appears to be to use Fortress's know-how to
move from debt financing to private equity. It's a logical
progression for the company," he said.
    SoftBank hired one of Fortress's senior executives, Rajeev
Misra, in 2014. Misra now runs the SoftBank-Saudi Arabia fund.
    New York-listed asset manager Fortress's investments span
real estate, hedge funds and private equity.
    It had $70 billion in investments under management at the
end of September 2016, and is one of few global foreign
investors with funds that are targeted at Japanese assets.
    In the wake of the global financial crisis, Fortress bought
bad loans in Italy and has a track record in Japan, where it
bought hotels held by Lehman Brothers after the bank collapsed
in 2008.

    "DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT"
    SoftBank's Son said in a statement that the deal would
"accelerate our SoftBank 2.0 transformation strategy of bold,
disciplined investment and world-class execution to drive
sustainable long-term growth".
    SoftBank executives were not available to comment further on
the deal.
    Though Fortress' performance in Japan may have impressed
SoftBank, its broader growth has been lacklustre. The first
among the major U.S. alternative asset managers to go public 10
years ago, Fortress was then valued at $14 billion.
    Despite its diversification into a range of hedge fund
strategies, from bitcoin to timber, Fortress failed to keep up
with the growth in assets under management of bigger peers such
as Blackstone.
    The companies said Fortress principals would continue to
lead the investment manager, which will operate within SoftBank
as an independent business, based in New York. Senior fund
managers would also remain with the group, it said.
    Fortress shareholders will receive $8.08 per share, a
premium of 38.6 percent to the closing price on Feb. 13.
    Fortress plans to maintain its current base dividend of 9
cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, the company said
in a statement. [nBw133Nkfa]
    JP Morgan Securities and Morgan Stanley & Co acted as
financial advisers for SoftBank and Fortress respectively.
    SoftBank shares rose 2 percent, compared with a 1 percent
gain for the wider TOPIX <.TOPX> index.

(FSC) Price Target Cut to $4.00 February 15th, 2017 - 0 comments - Filed Under - by Jeff Wilder Filed Under: Analyst Articles - US - Finance Tweet Fifth Street Finance Corp. (NASDAQ:FSC) had its target price reduced by investment analysts at National Securities from $6.00 to $4.00 in a report released on Monday. The firm currently has a “neutral” rating on the stock. National Securities’ price target indicates a potential downside of 13.04% from the stock’s previous close. The analysts wrote, “• NAV/share decreased 8% Q/Q from $7.97 to $7.31 as non-accruals at cost spiked to $358.0 million from $214.8 million. Non-accruals now represent 16.7% of the portfolio at amortized cost from 9.4% the quarter prior. • The quarterly dividend of $0.18 is being reduced to $0.125/share for the 9/30/17 quarter but will be $0.14/share for the quarter ended 3/31/17 and $0.02/share for the quarter ended 6/30/17. • Despite the new CEO and plan of action laid out by FSC we do not have much faith in the company to successfully execute on its initiatives. We had nothing against Mr. Owens and likewise have nothing against Mr. Dalton, but the genesis of value destruction at FSC is the external manager, which has used FSC as an asset gatherer for fee income rather than a true credit investor, as we see it. It took years of declining performance and staving off an activist investor for FSC to even modestly address the issues of fees and we do not think this is something the market will soon forget. Additionally, while we are happy the incentive fee will have a rolling three year look-back it will be from 1/1/17 and thus offers little consolation to shareholders who have paid untenable fees for poor performance in the past. • We are revising our fiscal 2017 NII/share estimate from $0.74 to $0.54 and our fiscal 2018 NII/share estimate from $0.71 to $0.50. “ Other equities analysts also recently issued reports about the stock.

She told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that the Fed’s focus was on raising interest rates to keep the economy in balance, and not on reducing its holdings of bonds. QuickTake The Fed’s Rate Tools Rates first need to reach sufficiently high levels that the Fed feels it has some room to cut them to offset a weakening economy. Only then would the central bank begin to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, she said. “What we would like to do is to find a time when we judge that our need to provide substantial accommodation to the economy in the coming years is minimal,” she said. The central bank also wants to be sure “that the economy is on a solid course and the federal funds rate has reached levels where we have some ability to address weakness by cutting it,” she added. Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist for Jefferies LLC in New York, said that this meant no move to start shrinking the balance sheet in 2017. Policy makers expect to increase the fed funds rate to 1.4 percent by the end of 2017, according to the median of their projections released on Dec. 14. That would still leave it below the 20-year average of 2.3 percent. The timing and scope of any moves to reduce the Fed’s debt holdings could have big implications for the bond market and for the economy as a whole. That’s because, as Yellen herself noted, they would represent an effective tightening of monetary policy. “Allowing that process to take place,” Yellen said, “will show that the economy is doing well.” The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee has said it will continue to reinvest principal payments on the maturing bonds in its portfolio until “normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well underway.” Further Guidance Yellen told the lawmakers Tuesday that the FOMC will discuss that strategy “in the coming months” with the aim of providing investors with “some further guidance” about its intentions. The central bank will want to telegraph its plans well advance of their implementation so as to avoid upsetting financial markets, said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York. He expects policy makers to do that in the second half of this year. The process of halting reinvestments though won’t begin until the middle of next year, according to Feroli. Yellen rejected recent suggestions by several Fed bank presidents that the central bank use its balance sheet as an active tool of monetary policy. Instead, the focus will remain on managing the fed funds rate in response to changes in the economy. The Fed chair also said that the reduction in the Fed’s bond portfolio would occur in a “gradual and orderly way.” Gradual Taper That’s similar to the strategy the central bank employed when it tapered its asset purchases in 2014, reducing them in set amounts at each policy-making meeting. More than $600 billion in Treasury securities in the Fed’s portfolio are scheduled to mature this year and next, according to calculations by Bloomberg. Yellen’s four-year term as Fed chair expires on Feb. 3, 2018, and she repeated that she has no plans to leave the central bank before then. McCarthy said the next Fed chair might well take a more aggressive approach to reducing the balance sheet, although Feroli said it might be difficult to change the Fed’s strategy once it has been put into place and digested by the markets. Yellen told lawmakers that she expects the central bank to eventually end up with “a balance sheet that’s substantially smaller than at the current time.” “In addition, we would like our balance sheet to again be primarily Treasury securities,” she said. Besides Treasuries, the Fed portfolio also contains mortgage-backed debt and agency securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. There’s a limit to how far the balance sheet can be reduced, however. At a minimum, it needs to be big enough to cover the roughly $1.5 trillion in currency now in circulation, which is increasing every year. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Furthermore, she downplayed the uncertainty on fiscal policy as just one of the factors to take into consideration when deciding a rate hike. The EUR/USD pair fell down to 1.0560, its lowest in over a month, further weighed by soft data coming from the EU earlier in the day. Growth in the area decelerated during the last quarter of 2016, with German Q4 GDP printing 0.4%, below the 0.5% expected, but above a previously revised 0.1%, while for the EU, the preliminary growth estimation printed 0.4%. In the US, the January PPI increased by 0.6% when compared to December, and by 1.6% from a year earlier, beating expectations. Technically, the EUR/USD pair reached a major support, the 23.6% retracement of the November/January decline, as the pair struggled two weeks around the level before being able to recover further. The ongoing political uncertainty in the EU alongside with soft data in one hand, and in the other rising inflation and a hawkish FED, the fundamentals have aligned with the technical picture in a bearish case for the pair, particularly on a bearish acceleration below the mentioned daily low. Technically, the 4 hours chart shows that a bearish 20 SMA, now around 1.0620 keeps capping the upside, whilst technical indicators have stabilized near oversold readings, as speculative interest has reached its first bearish target and left the price consolidating in a well-limited range below the 1.0590 level. Support levels: 1.0560 1.0520 1.0470 Resistance levels: 1.0590 1.0625 1.0660 USD/JPY The USD/JPY pair surged to 114.49, its highest since late January, reversing course following Yellen's hawkish statement before the US Congress. The FED's head woke up speculation of a March rate hike after saying that "at our upcoming meetings, the committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate." The USD/JPY pair traded with a soft tone at the beginning of the day, as risk aversion dominated the Asian session, following news that US President Donald Trump's national security advisor Michael Flynn quit, over his contacts with Russia, a clear sign of how vulnerable the pair is to any headline coming from the US new administration. The modest tone of worldwide equities is keeping the upside limited, and technically, a major resistance stands a few pips above the mentioned high, at 114.55, the 23.6% retracement of this year bullish run. A break above it could fuel the advance, but technical readings in the 4 hours chart, don't support the case, as the price is unable to advance beyond a bearish 200 SMA, whilst technical indicators are retreating within positive territory, not enough anyway to confirm a downward move. Support levels: 113.95 113.40 113.00 Resistance levels: 114.55 114.90 115.40 GBP/USD The Pound fell to a daily low of 1.2443, but not because of Yellen's hawkish stance before the Senate Banking Committee, but because of shockingly highs wholesale inflation figures. In fact, such low was achieved during the London session, with the pair confined to a tight 50 pips range afterwards, with the Sterling still reluctant to give up to dollar's strength. UK CPI rose 1.8% in January when compared to a year earlier, its highest level in almost three years, even despite the MoM reading came in at -0.5%. Producer price inflation (input prices), meanwhile, surged to 20.5% from a revised previous 17% and well ahead of its 18.5% consensus forecast, due to rising energy costs. Output prices also rose by more-than-expected, but at a slower pace, up by 3.5% YoY from previous 2.8% and against an expected advance of 3.2%. It won't take long until producers pass rising cost on to consumers, with CPI now seen rising beyond 3.0% during the upcoming months. The big question is how tolerant the BOE will be and for how long. The pair maintains the neutral stance seen on previous updates, although there's an increasing bearish potential, as in the 4 hours chart, the price is now below a bearish 20 SMA, the Momentum indicator turns lower around its 100 level, whilst the RSI indicator consolidates around 43. The pair has an immediate Fibonacci support at 1.2430 which if broken, can lead to a steady decline down to 1.2346, February low. The pair needs to firm up beyond 1.2540, on the other hand, to gain some bullish traction during the upcoming sessions. Support levels: 1.2430 1.2390 1.2345 Resistance levels: 1.2500 1.2535 1.2585 GOLD An early advance in gold prices was quickly reversed post-Yellen, with the commodity closing the day marginally higher at $1,228.50 a troy ounce. Risk aversion dominated the Asian session, with most local share markets closing in the red, amid Trump's security advisor resignation. Slackened physical demand from retailers, weighed on the commodity, but it was increasing speculation of an upcoming US rate hike this March what sent the bright metal lower. Technically, the commodity maintains the positive tone seen on previous updates, as the price remained above a bullish 20 DMA, whilst technical indicators turned flat well above their mid-lines, paring the downward correction from overbought conditions seen at the beginning of the week. In the shorter term, and according to the 4 hours chart, technical indicators are hovering around their mid-lines, whilst the price struggles around a bearish 20 SMA. A major Fibonacci resistance stands at 1,230.00, with an upward acceleration beyond it exposing this month high of 1,244.42. Support levels: 1,221.80 1,210.10 1,200.00 Resistance levels: 1,230.00 1,237.10 1,244.70 WTI CRUDE Crude oil prices made little progress this Tuesday, with West Texas Intermediate futures settling at $53.16 a barrel, ahead of US stockpiles reports. Crude advanced at the beginning of the day up to 53.70, but eased on the back of dollar's strength, still trapped between lingering concerns about rising US production and OPEC's compliance with its commitment to cut output. Upcoming US data could trigger some sharp moves either side of the board, particularly if stockpiles present another large build. From a technical point of view, the commodity presents a neutral stance in the daily chart, moving back and forth around a horizontal 20 DMA, and with technical indicators heading nowhere around their mid-lines. Shorter term, the 4 hours chart shows that the price remains stuck within a congestion of moving averages, but that technical indicators are entering bearish territory, indicating that the commodity may fall, particularly on a break below 52.60, the immediate support. Support levels: 52.60 52.00 51.40 Resistance levels: 53.70 54.40 55.20 DJIA US indexes closed at record highs for a fourth consecutive session, with the DJIA reaching a new milestone right ahead of the close, settling at 20,504.27, up by 92 points or 0.45%. The Nasdaq Composite added 18 points and closed at 5,782.57, while the S&P gained 0.40%, to 2,337.58. The banking sectors led the way higher on hopes US President Trump will cut corporate taxes, with  JP Morgan Chase leading winners' list within the Dow, up by 1.71%, and Goldman Sachs up 1.34%, closing at an all-time high. Apple also closed at an all-time high, up daily basis by 1.28%. The DJIA presents a strong bullish tone in the daily chart, as technical indicators keep heading north, although the RSI stands at 79, indicating extreme overbought conditions. Back in December, the indicator reached 86 before correcting lower, which means that current reading is hardly a sign of upward exhaustion. In the 4 hours chart, the index is far above its moving averages, with the 20 SMA heading sharply lower around 20,320, reflecting the buying fever around US equities, whilst technical indicators also head north in extreme overbought territory, with no aims to changing course.  Support levels: 20,489 20,432 20,385 Resistance levels: 20,550 20,600 20,650 FTSE 100 The FTSE 100 lost 10 points this Tuesday, closing the day at 7,268.58, despite a strong earnings report from TUI, as the travel firm added 5.18%, after the company reported that its first-quarter losses had narrowed. Royal Bank of Scotland was the best performer, up 5.29% as the banking sector benefited from improving sentiment, while Rolls Royce Holding topped losers' list, down 3.0% after reporting a pre-tax loss of £4.6bn. The index recovered some ground in after-hours trading, maintaining its positive tone in the daily chart, as it's still holding well above its moving averages, while technical indicators continue consolidating within positive territory. Shorter term, the 4 hours chart shows that the index remains above a bullish 20 SMA, but technical indicators are heading marginally lower, still within positive territory. The Footsie needs to break above 7,298, Monday's high to gather some upward strength, and advance up to 7,354, the record high posted last January. Support levels: 7254 7,208 7,163 Resistance levels: 7,298 7,354 7,390 DAX European equities closed mixed, but not far from their daily opening levels, with the German DAX down 2 points to 11,771.81, on poor local data, as GDP and ZEW sentiment survey disappointed, and a persistent cautious mood ahead of FED's Yellen testimony. Banks and automakers were the best performers, with Deutsche Bank up 1.77% and Commerzbank adding 1.76%. Volkswagen added 0.94%, but only eight out of thirty components closed in the green. In the daily chart, the index stands at the lower end of its weekly range, still above its 20 DMA and far above a bullish 100 DMA, but technical indicators continue to lack enough strength to confirm an upward extension, with the Momentum still stuck around 100 and the RSI flat around 62. In the 4 hours chart, technical indicators are barely retreating from overbought readings, whilst the 20 SMA maintains its bullish slope above the 100 SMA, both over 100 points below the current level. Support levels: 11,745 11,694 11,640 Resistance levels: 11,815 11,854 11,891   About the Author HY Markets More from HY Markets: Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (16 February 2017) Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (14 February 2017) Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (13 February 2017) Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (10 February 2017) Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (09 February 2017) Latest in Technical Analysis Feb 16 09:22 GMT - EUR/USD Continues Rebound On Thurs...

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/File PhotoMore By Michelle Price HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police are struggling to deal with digital pump-and-dump schemes targeting brokerages - a little-known type of computer-generated fraud that surged in the Chinese territory last year. Although the money involved was small - only about $20 million worth of shares - there were 81 such incidents reported in 2016, more than triple the number in 2015, according to police. In the scheme, criminals invest in thinly traded penny stocks and then manipulate their share prices by ordering trades from hacked brokerage accounts. They earn profits by selling before the fraudulent trades are reported. After last year's cyber-heist of $81 million at Bangladesh's central bank and a series of hacks of ATM's around the world, authorities fear such pump-and-dump schemes could be increasingly used for electronic theft. Hong Kong is a favored place for such attacks because of the number of thinly-traded penny stocks in the territory and because its securities industry has fallen behind other financial centers in defending against cyber fraud. At least seven brokers and eight banks have been targeted in Hong Kong, including HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank of China International (BOCI) Securities, according to regulators and people familiar with confidential investigations. A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment. A spokeswoman for BOCI Securities said he could not comment on its case but the brokerage would continue to invest in IT security. "If you ask regulators in the industry what is the number one threat, not surprisingly it’s all about cyber attacks," Ashley Alder, CEO of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and chairman of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, said in a speech to the local legislature last week. "We've seen that happen not only in banking but also at brokers in Hong Kong, in particular recent attacks to do with basically hijacking share trading accounts." Such schemes surfaced more than a decade ago in the United States. Charles Schwab Corp, E*Trade Financial Corp and JP Morgan Chase & Co. were identified as victims of these schemes in a 2006 complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The pace of attacks reported in the United States has slowed in recent years after big brokerages implemented a variety of strategies to thwart the hacks, said John Reed Stark, a former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Office of Internet Enforcement. Some use algorithms to identify and halt unusual trading activity, others scrutinize Internet traffic for orders coming from suspicious servers and one stopped permitting customers to use its online trading platform from buying penny stocks, said Stark, who now runs cyber-security consulting firm John Reed Stark Consulting LLC. But such protections are rare in Hong Kong, where the government has only recently started suggesting security improvements to banks and brokerages which have traditionally considered stock trading to be low-risk. TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION The Hong Kong SFC last year told firms to increase surveillance of client transactions and data protection. Authorities believe that hackers accessed brokerage accounts using stolen or guessed passwords, according to investigators. This might have been thwarted if they were protected with two-factor authentication, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has said. Two-factor authentication typically includes a password and a piece of information only the user has, for instance an electronic token with changing numbers. "Hong Kong is being targeted because they have not instituted the same cyber protections that we see in the U.S. and certain parts of Europe," said Jeff Cramer, a former U.S. prosecutor. Cramer, who is managing director with cyber-security investigations firm Berkeley Research Group, said he expects to see more attacks in Hong Kong and perhaps other Asian nations, including China, Japan and South Korea that are also behind in cyber security. FIGHTING BACK Such pump and dump cases have proven tough to crack in the United States because the masterminds are typically overseas, using surrogates and pseudonyms to make investments. Brokerages are typically not required to go public when they are hacked, so cases often only surface when the government files a complaint against suspected cyber criminals, or the hack results in litigation. The attack involving BOCI Securities year became public after it was sued by a customer that claimed its account was breached. Trading firm Fast Track Holdings Limited alleged in court documents that somebody hacked into its brokerage account on the afternoon of September 23 using a valid user ID and password. Within 18 minutes, the intruder had emptied the account by spending HK$38 million to buy 49 million shares of thinly traded Pa Shun Pharmaceutical, according to Fast Track. The stock soared more than 30 percent after the purchase, which was made at a 36 percent premium to the previous day's closing price, Reuters data shows. BOCI alerted Fast Track of the suspicious activity an hour later, but it has said in court documents it should not be held financially responsible, saying it found no evidence its systems had been compromised. Peter Pang, Pa Shun's CFO, told Reuters the management "would keep an eye to the incident and report to the regulators and the public when necessary". One person familiar with the case said Fast Track's management believes the incident was a pump and dump scam and that Pa Shun was targeted because it is thinly-traded, but it remained unclear who was responsible. Fast Track's directors did not respond to requests for comment.

Both companies, accused by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) of involvement in some fraudulent transactions in relation to the transaction, were in control of the OPL 245 (the subject of the Malabu Oil deal) before the January 26 orders. The order, obtained ex-parte by the EFCC, among others, allows the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) to manage the OPL 245 on behalf of the Federal Government, pending the conclusion of investigation and prosecution of “SNEPCO, Agip and other individuals named in connection with acts of conspiracy, bribery, official corruption and money laundering” contained in some charges already filed in court. Shell and Agip have however filed applications seeking the vacation of the order, arguing that the court was misled into granting it. When the case was called yesterday before Justice John Tsoho of the Federal High Court, Abuja, lawyers to Shell and Agip – Konyinsola Ajayi (SAN) and Babatunde Fagbohunlu (SAN) – informed the court about their pending applications. EFCC lawyer Jonson Ojoggbane confirmed that both applications were served on him, but that he was yet to respond to them. He sought a short adjournment to enable him address the applications and put forward the EFCC’s position to enable the court reach a just conclusion. Although Ajayi and Fagbohunlu agreed to come back next week, the judge informed parties about his official engagement next week outside the country. He adjourned till February 27 for hearing of the applications. At yesterday’s proceedings were some individuals linked to the deal, including the son of the late General Sani Abacha, Mohammed, and businessman Otunba Oyewole Fasawe, among others. The EFCC, while applying for the order, explained the alleged role played by Shell and Agip in the transaction, through which some highly placed Nigerians, including ex-ministers, and multinational oil companies purportedly defrauded the country of billions of dollars. The commission also revealed how former Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) Mohammed Adoke allegedly aided the payment of $1.2b bribe to ex-Petroleum Resources Minister Dan Etete, using his position in former President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration. EFCC stated, in a supporting affidavit, that: ”Sometime in April 1998, Malabo Oil and Gas Limited was incorporated in Nigeria with shareholders’ namely: Mohammed Sani (fronting for the late General Sani Abacha), Kwekwu Amafegha (representing Dan Etete, the then Minister of Petroleum Resources) and Hassan Hindu (on behalf of Ambassador Hassan Adamu). “In April 1998, the company was incorporated, the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources offered the company deep water oil block prospecting licence in respect of OPL 245 in line with the Federal Government’s indigenous policy in the upstream sector. “The oil prospecting licence, against all known government’s regulations, was awarded to Malabu Oil and Gas even before a formal application was submitted by the company. “In June 1998 Gen Sani Abacha died and between 1999 and 2000, the corporate status and shareholding structure were altered severally through forged resolutions which eventually divested Mohammed Sani of their shares, while new shareholders and directors were appointed fraudulently. “At the time the company, namely Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd was incorporated, Gen Sani Abacha and Dan Etete were Head of State and Minister of Petroleum Resources, while Hassan Adamu was Nigerian Ambassador to the United State of America between 1996 and 1999,” the EFCC said. It added that as at when they incorporated Malabu Oil, the Gen Abacha, Etete and Adamu were barred by extant laws from engaging in any form of business by virtue of their offices. “They used their positions to confer unfair advantage on themselves and cronies in allocating OPL 245 to themselves without due process. The company contracted Shell Petroleum and SNEPCO, in a joint venture scheme, for the purpose of prospecting and operating the said licence given by the Federal Government of Nigeria.” The EFCC said Shell know that the allocation of the oil well and the procedure adopted by the owners of Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd were fraught with fraud, but went ahead to consummate the transaction. The agency went on: “Sometime on 2nd July 2001, the Federal Government withdrew the title and allocation of OPL 245 to Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd on the directive of Mr. Funso Kupolokun, the then Presidential Adviser on Petroleum to President Olusegun Obansajo after which same was reallocated to Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep Ltd. “Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd sued the Federal Government over the revocation, but the suit was later withdrawn and settled out of court by the parties and the said oil well was reallocated to Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd. “Shell and Agip again went into a fraudulent agreement with Malabu Oil and Gas, in which the companies will pay signature bonus of $210m to the Federal Government of Nigeria while $1.2b would be paid to the owners of Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd. “Shell Petroleum was later to explain that the payment was for compensation, but investigation conducted revealed that the money was bribe to Dan Etete and his cronies. “Shell was aware at the time of consummating this transaction that Dan Etete, the owner of Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd, was already a convict and hence, was not willing to pay the said sum of $1.2b directly to Dan Etete and or Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd directly. “One Mohammed Adoke was the Federal Government counsel in series of arbitration instituted by Shell in London on the said oil well and, who later became the Attorney General of the Federation, conspired with Shell/Agip to route the payment of the $1.2b bribe money through Federal Government Escrow Account with JP Morgan Chase bank.” Adoke, the EFCC said, had written a letter dated 9th February 2011 seeking the advice of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) on whether to consummate the transaction involving Shell Ultra Deep Sea, Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd, NNPC, Nigeria Agip Exploration and production Company (SNEPCO). The DPR on April 1, 2011 advised against the transaction on the ground that it was highly prejudicial to the Federal Government’s interest. Despite the advice, Adoke approved the payment of the $1.2b bribe money through Federal Government Escrow Account with JP Morgan Chase Bank in London, the agency said, adding: “Sometime in May 2011 Nigeria Agip Exploration and SNEPCO instructed Chase Bank to release $1,092,040,000 into Escrow Account of the Federal Government. The money, on Adoke’s instruction, the EFCC claimed, was transferred from the Escrow Account to two banks accounts operated by Dan Etete and Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd. The EFCC went on: “The said amount was later laundered with several accounts of individuals and different companies. Investigation further revealed that the Federal Government was defrauded by SPDC and Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd by under paying $210m as signature bonus on OPL 245. “Investigation conducted revealed that Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd and SPDC secured OPL245 through fraudulent scheme involving high scale bribery and corruption by top management of the company. “Information available to the applicant (EFCC) is to the effect that a London judge, sitting in the Southwark Crown Court refused to release to Dan Etete and Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd $85m which is connected to the said fraudulent transaction by Shell Nigeria, Nigeria Agip Exploration and Malabu Oil and Gas in respect of OPL245. “The $85m formed part of the proceeds of the fraudulent transaction between Shell Nigeria, Nigeria Agip Exploration and Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd. The said sum was seized as a result of request by Italian prosecutors.” Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?

Ironically, the main catalyst is President Trump's promises to undo safeguards put in place to prevent another meltdown. File- A photograph of the exterior of a Goldman Sachs building. By Matt Egan NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Goldman Sachs has finally recovered from the 2008 financial crisis. Ironically, the main catalyst is President Trump's promises to undo safeguards put in place to prevent another meltdown. Goldman Sachs stock closed on Tuesday at a new all-time high, taking out the prior record that was set in October 2007. Virtually all bank stocks have been on fire since Trump's victory in anticipating of lighter regulation, higher interest rates and faster growth. But Goldman Sachs has been particularly hot, surging an incredible 37% since the election. That's quadruple the S&P 500's post-election advance. Clearly, Goldman Sachs has already emerged as a big winner of Trump's pledge to "do a big number" on Dodd-Frank, the 2010 Wall Street reform law. "If you really think deregulation is coming and banks are going to be cut loose, who's going to win? It's going to be them. We've seen that time and again," said Michael Block, chief market strategist at Rhino Trading. Goldman's market value surged by $4 billion on the day that Trump signed an executive order beginning the process of rolling back Dodd-Frank. The irony is that Trump slammed Wall Street and Goldman Sachs during the campaign. He even used an image of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein during his closing campaign ad while condemning the "global power structure." But Trump has gone from criticizing Wall Street and Goldman Sachs to hiring Goldman veterans to help him govern. Trump's two biggest economic hires are Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner, and top economic adviser Gary Cohn, who stepped down in December as chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs. Analysts say those hires may actually be helping Goldman stock. "With so many Goldman Sachs alums in the administration, maybe some think that policies will skew in the bank's favor," said Michael Wong, a Morningstar analyst who covers Goldman Sachs. Wong cautioned that he doesn't think "anyone should make an investment thesis based on that." Mnuchin, who was confirmed on Monday as treasury secretary, is in favor of reforming the Volcker Rule, which prevents big banks like Goldman Sachs from making risky bets with their own money. Goldman's post-election surge can't really be explained by higher interest rates. Higher rates provide a bigger boost to the profits of consumer-focused lenders like Bank of America and Wells Fargo than investment banks like Goldman. "Higher interest rates is not playing that much into Goldman Sachs' valuation," said Wong. But Goldman Sachs would benefit from faster growth and increased CEO confidence that could spark a wave of lucrative M&A and IPO deals. Goldman shares have made a remarkable rebound from the 2008 crisis when many investors feared the complete collapse of the financial system. Goldman is up 380% since its low of $52 in November 2008. While JPMorgan Chase returned to its pre-crisis high in 2013, it wasn't until now for Goldman stock. Other big banks like Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are nowhere near their all-time highs. But is the Goldman rally overdone? After all, not even Trump is talking about completely repealing Dodd-Frank and efforts to water regulation down are running into resistance, including from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen. Wong thinks Goldman shares are "slightly overvalued" at this point. "They're pricing in a lot of perfection in terms of deregulation and the ability to take advantage of that," Block said.

All three major US indices set records for the fourth straight session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.5 per cent to end the day at 20,504.41. The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.4 per cent to close at 2,337.58, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.3 per cent to 5,782.57. Yellen presented an upbeat view of the economy in her testimony to Congress, noting labor market conditions continue to improve and inflation is inching up to the Fed’s two per cent target. She confirmed the next rate increase could come at any time, which leaves open the possibility of a move at the March 14-5 policy meeting. Bank of America jumped 3.1 per cent and JPMorgan Chase rose 1.6 per cent following the Yellen hearing. Banks typically prosper from interest rate increases. US stocks have been on a tear since President Donald Trump last week said he planned to unveil a tax-cut plan within the next two to three weeks. Consumers stocks were strong with Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot both gaining 1.0 per cent. Technology giant Apple won 1.3 per cent to finish at an all-time high. General Motors jumped 4.8 per cent after French carmaker PSA said it was considering an acquisition of Opel and Vauxhall, GM’s loss-ridden European subsidiaries. GM confirmed the talks, cautioning that “there can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached.” Health insurer Anthem fell 0.2 per cent after rival Cigna announced it was suing Anthem for billions of dollars in breakup and other fees after a US court blocked their proposed merger on antitrust grounds. Anthem said the suit was invalid and that it was committed to completing the merger. Cigna gained 0.8 per cent. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Bank Negara: Ringgit began to stabilise towards end 4Q2016 Weaker ringgit dampens travel to Singapore Malaysia’s economy expands 4.2pc in 2016 Petronas Canada LNG plant buoyed by incentives to native groups Didi Chuxing faces new hurdles in China (VIDEO) Weaker ringgit dampens travel to Singapore Swedish company invests RM100m in Penang Another day, another mall: How KL Gateway Mall hopes to succeed in a crowded market Osram says gets US government approval for lamps unit sale Greece says will not accept ‘illogical’ demands in bailout review Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Related Articles Wall Street higher on strong jobs data; banks rise Tech, telecom boost Wall St as new year begins Six things to consider as stocks break records — Barry Ritholtz Wall Street rallies, ‘political intrigue’ boosts euro stocks US, Europe markets rise on rosy economic data Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Taxes are going up. And staff are terrified of Brexit. by Richard Vines @Richardvines More stories by Richard Vines February 16, 2017, 12:01 AM EST London restaurateurs are looking to the future. And many don’t like what they see. “As a restaurant operator, 2017 terrifies me,” said Russell Norman, co-owner of the Polpo, a popular mini-chain of Italian restaurants. “It really could be a perfect storm.” London’s dining scene is arguably more vibrant and successful than it’s ever been, and by one measure, at least, 2016 was a record year for openings. Many chefs think business will still improve this year, but they see strong headwinds. First there was Britain’s vote on June 23 to leave the European Union, which sent chefs into a spin: Restaurant owners rely heavily on hosts, waiters, and cooks from Spain, Italy, and France, and they fear Brexit will mean restrictions on the right to work in the U.K.  When the British pound tanked after the vote, restaurants had to pay more for imported food and wine. Some wine prices have increased as much as 10 percent, Norman says, and certain staples, such as olive oil, are at their highest prices in years in the U.K. Now they will have to swallow another increase: higher property taxes, known as business rates, that kick in in April. The size of the increase varies. The bill for Café Murano in Covent Garden, for example, will jump 46 percent, to £157,000 ($196,000). In Hoxton, Merchants Tavern’s bill will advance 27 percent, to £70,000. Café Murano in Covent Garden. Photographer: John Carey/Cafe Murano Covent Garden Some restaurants will be passing costs along to diners or squeezing other expenses where they can find pennies to save, said Chris Yates, managing director of Angela Hartnett restaurants, which include Café Murano and Merchants Tavern. “Why do you think we don’t see uniforms, tablecloths, etc., in restaurants any more?” he said. Des Gunewardena, whose D&D London group owns more than 25 London bars and restaurants, said he could be facing a tough year. “The reality of the Brexit deal is going to emerge,” he said. “There is a lot of pressure of costs on all fronts. The impact of the property-rates revaluation and the increasing cost of staff are likely to have as much, if not more, impact than the rising cost of ingredients.” Gunewardena said that corporate spending still increased last year but was noticeably less than exuberant. “If people are concerned that their business may be badly affected, they are not going to throw swanky parties,” he said. Restaurant managers are most worried about their staffing, though there’s little hard evidence that they’ll have trouble hiring. While it may be too soon to tell, there are some signs: Figures released Wednesday from the Office for National Statistics showed that the number of EU workers in the U.K. fell the most in five years during the final three months of 2016. Galvin at Windows, atop the London Hilton on Park Lane, employs more than 70 people as hosts, waiters, bartenders, and other front-of-house positions. Two are British. At Grain Store, in King’s Cross, it’s eight out of 70. At the Wolseley, on Piccadilly, 62 percent of employees are from Europe. “I wonder what will happen,” said Fred Sirieix, the French-born general manager of Galvin at Windows. “I still cannot find any British people. It is not a profession people think of doing. It is seen as subservient.” Jeremy King, whose Corbin & King group owns several of London’s most fashionable restaurants, including the Wolseley, the Delaunay, and Zedel, is just as worried. Leonid Shutov Photographer: Darren Gerrish/Getty Images for David Collins Studio “Brexit has had a terrible effect on the morale of our European staff,” he says. “Many have felt unwelcome in the country and have left. Let there be no misunderstanding: The absence of free movement across Europe will be a disaster for the hospitality industry.” One restaurateur who remains upbeat is Leonid Shutov. He owns the fancy Bob Bob Ricard in Soho, where diners can press a button at their table to order an emergency bottle of Champagne. He’s planning to open a 400-seat restaurant in the City financial district. How does he feel now that JPMorgan Chase & Co., HSBC Holdings Plc, and other banks are starting to outline plans to move staff overseas? Very relaxed, it seems. He’s not even concerned about the employment situation, though he estimates that about 80 percent of his staffers hold foreign passports. “I'm not worried,” he says. “I’m sure the U.K. and the EU will come up with a fair and equitable agreement that allows migration and is in everyone’s economic interest.” Let’s hope so.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 9:00 AM, February 16, 2017 TOKYO - Japan's SoftBank Group Corp <9984.T> on Wednesday said it has agreed to buy Fortress Investment Group LLC <FIG.N> for about $3.3 billion, looking to add investment expertise as it prepares to launch the world's largest private equity fund. The all-cash deal is SoftBank's first major investment in an asset manager and represents yet another unpredictable gambit for a group that has to date focused on telecoms and technology. It comes after founder Masayashi Son made the surprise announcement in October that SoftBank is teaming up with Saudi Arabia to set up a $100 billion technology fund. Buying private equity and alternative investment heavyweight Fortress could help SoftBank move to financing investments with private equity cash instead of debt, said Gerhard Fasol of Eurotechnology Japan, a consultancy. "Son's strategy appears to be to use Fortress's know-how to move from debt financing to private equity. It's a logical progression for the company," he said. SoftBank hired one of Fortress's senior executives, Rajeev Misra, in 2014. Misra now runs the SoftBank-Saudi Arabia fund. New York-listed asset manager Fortress's investments span real estate, hedge funds and private equity. It had $70 billion in investments under management at the end of September 2016, and is one of few global foreign investors with funds that are targeted at Japanese assets. In the wake of the global financial crisis, Fortress bought bad loans in Italy and has a track record in Japan, where it bought hotels held by Lehman Brothers after the bank collapsed in 2008. "DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT" SoftBank's Son said in a statement that the deal would "accelerate our SoftBank 2.0 transformation strategy of bold, disciplined investment and world-class execution to drive sustainable long-term growth". SoftBank executives were not available to comment further on the deal. Though Fortress' performance in Japan may have impressed SoftBank, its broader growth has been lackluster. The first among the major U.S. alternative asset managers to go public 10 years ago, Fortress was then valued at $14 billion. Despite its diversification into a range of hedge fund strategies, from bitcoin to timber, Fortress failed to keep up with the growth in assets under management of bigger peers such as Blackstone. The companies said Fortress principals would continue to lead the investment manager, which will operate within SoftBank as an independent business, based in New York. Senior fund managers would also remain with the group, it said. Fortress shareholders will receive $8.08 per share, a premium of 38.6 percent to the closing price on Feb. 13. Fortress plans to maintain its current base dividend of 9 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, the company said in a statement. JP Morgan Securities and Morgan Stanley & Co acted as financial advisers for SoftBank and Fortress respectively. Evercore acted as financial adviser to the Special Committee of Fortress's Board of Directors. SoftBank shares rose 2 percent, compared with a 1 percent gain for the wider TOPIX <.TOPX> index.

Continue Reading Below “My administration remains very focused on the issues that will encourage economic growth, that’s what we’re all about,” he said during a taped White House meeting with top U.S. retail CEOs, which included J.C. Penney CEO (JCP) Marvin Ellison and Target (TGT) CEO and Chairman Brian Cornell. “We have a lot of, a lot of companies moving back in, coming back into the country, bringing the jobs with them. We’re cutting regulations big league. We’re really cutting them by massive amounts,” Trump said. ICYMI Blog: Fed Chair Yellen Gets Grilled on Capitol Hill As Yellen Defends Slow Economy, Investors See Better Days Ahead Trump also trashed the regulatory environment that evolved under the Obama administration, and in some cases, with respect to Dodd-Frank, was implemented by the Federal Reserve. More From FOXBusiness.com... Exclusive: Fed's Bullard Takes Different View on Rate Hike vs. Yellen Fed's Bullard: We can afford to wait until later in year for rate hike “As you know the overregulation cost our economy an estimated $2 trillion a year which is incredible. It cost your businesses tremendous amounts of money and time. I’ve taken executive action of creating a permanent structure of regulatory reduction,” he said. Meanwhile, over on Capitol Hill, Yellen was telling members of the House Financial Services Committee that the U.S. is nearing full employment and wage growth is picking up, along with consumer spending. When asked about Trump, she declined to speculate on his looming fiscal policies. However she did acknowledge that several surveys have cited regulation, taxes and uncertainty as factors holding back investment. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT “We understand [those factors] could be contributing to slow growth in investment spending, but there are other factors like sales growth at those firms, and overall economic growth,” she explained. The U.S. economy has been averaging growth of around 2%, a level Yellen described as "very disappointing" during her testimony on Tuesday.     The relationship between the Fed chair and the president is shaping up to be an interesting one. Trump was a vocal critic of Yellen and the Fed’s extended, low-interest rate policy during his campaign, while Yellen maintains that the Fed is apolitical and independent. Yellen’s four-year term expires in Feb. 2018 and she said she intends to stay on for the duration. Daniel Tarullo, the Fed's top banking regulator, recently announced he will resign in April. Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer’s term expires in 2019. Along with these spots, there are two Fed vacancies President Trump can fill.  Since taking office the President has summoned CEOs from the auto, airline, pharma and manufacturing industries to the White House. He has also had pow-wows with financial executives including JPMorgan CEO (JPM) Jamie Dimon and Blackstone CEO (BX) Stephen Schwarzman, both of whom will be working with the new administration on business policies.   As Yellen and Trump made headlines in tandem, the U.S. stock market continued to hit fresh records, a trend the president is following closely. “There is a lot of confidence in our economy right now, there is great confidence level. You’ve been seeing that in the stock market” he said.  Suzanne O’Halloran is Managing Editor of FOXBusiness.com and a graduate of Boston College. Follow her on @suzohalloran    What do you think?

Continue Reading Below Integra, which makes products used in neurosurgery, reconstruction, wound and dental care, said Codman's devices would bolster its pipeline of offerings for tissue ablation, spinal cord repair and cranial stabilization. If the bid is accepted, it will add to Integra's adjusted earnings per share by at least 22 cents in the first full year after closing and increase thereafter. However, Integra said it expected some disruption in the Codman business in the first year following the purchase. The company forecast the business would grow 3-6 percent in the longer term. The Codman neurosurgery business, which is part of J&J's Depuy unit and markets devices for use in neuro-critical care and electrosurgery, generated sales of about $370 million in 2016.

Integra, which makes products used in neurosurgery, reconstruction, wound and dental care, made a "binding offer" for the Codman business, which will bolster its pipeline of offerings for tissue ablation, spinal cord repair and cranial stabilization. The companies will finalize the deal after receiving the green light from various works councils and regulators, a J&J spokeswoman told Reuters, adding that the deal would close in the fourth quarter, if approved. Integra said its adjusted earnings per share would increase by at least 22 cents in the first full year after closing and rise thereafter. The deal would enable the company to generate 30 percent or more of sales from international markets, Integra executives said on a conference call. However, Integra expects some disruption in the Codman business in the first year following the purchase, but forecast the business would grow 3-6 percent in the longer term. The Codman neurosurgery business, which is part of J&J's DePuy Synthes unit and markets devices for use in neuro-critical care and electrosurgery, generated sales of about $370 million in 2016. The deal excludes Codman's neurovascular and drug delivery businesses, J&J said. The U.S. healthcare giant, which is buying Swiss biotech company Actelion Ltd in a $30 billion deal, said last month it was reviewing strategic options for some of its diabetes care businesses. Integra's shares rose as much as 6 percent to $45.87 in morning trade, while J&J's stock was marginally up. As of Tuesday's close, Integra's shares had gained about 56 percent in the past 12 months, while J&J's stock had risen 14 percent. If the proposed deal is not closed, DePuy is entitled to receive a termination fee of $60 million, according to a regulatory filing.

(NYSE: TEVA) reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results before markets opened Monday. Only a few analysts weighed in initially, but the consensus is slowly growing more negative, despite the strong report. Across the board, analysts cut their price targets. 24/7 Wall St. has included some brief highlights from the earnings report as well as what a few analysts were saying after the fact. Teva beat estimates on earnings and revenues for both the quarter and the fiscal year, and its outlook for 2017 is better than the consensus estimates. Investors rewarded the stock with a boost of 5.6% in Monday’s session. As for the actual results, the company reported quarterly adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.38 and revenues of $6.5 billion. Thomson Reuters had consensus estimates that called for $1.35 in EPS and $6.25 billion in revenues. In the same period a year ago, Teva reported EPS of $1.28 on revenues of $4.88 billion. In its outlook statement, Teva said it expects full-year revenues of $23.8 billion to $24.5 billion for the 2017 fiscal year and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.90 to $5.30. Analysts had forecast 2017 revenues at $23.69 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.83. BTIG maintained a Neutral rating with a $34 price target. The firm went on to comment in its report: We maintain our Neutral rating on TEVA shares. While the shares were up ~6% today on better than expected 4Q16 top line revenues of ~$6.5B reported, and the Co. reaffirming its full year revenue guidance of $23.8 -$24.5B and EPS of $4.90 – $5.30, we believe downside risks remain with Copaxone. Management updated its downside case scenario, indicating that revenues could drop by $1 – $1.3B with the EPS impact being $0.75 – $0.95, assuming 1-2 generic competitors enter this month. A few other analysts weighed in as well: Susquehanna has a Positive rating but cut its price target to $41 from $50. Jefferies has a Hold rating and lowered its price target to $33 from $36. Deutsche Bank has a Buy rating and cut its price target to $45 from $48. JPMorgan cut its price target to $37 from $40. RBC reiterated an Outperform rating with a $42 price target. Shares of Teva were last seen up 2.3% at $34.80 on Tuesday, with a consensus analyst price target of $42.09 and a 52-week trading range of $31.90 to $59.35.

Japan’s SoftBank will pay $8.08 a share for New York-based Fortress, a 39 per cent premium to the company’s Feb. 13 closing price, according to a statement on Tuesday. Fortress principals Pete Briger, Wes Edens and Randy Nardone have agreed to continue leading the business, which will remain based in New York and operate independently within SoftBank, according to the statement. SoftBank’s founder Masayoshi Son is in the process of creating a $100 billion Vision Fund with Saudi Arabia and other backers that would make the Japanese billionaire one of the world’s biggest technology investors. The Fortress deal will be separate from that vehicle and is aimed at bringing investment talent in-house, according to a SoftBank spokeswoman. The acquisition, subject to approval by Fortress shareholders as well as regulators, is expected to close in the second half. "Fortress’s excellent track record speaks for itself, and we look forward to benefiting from its leadership, broad-based expertise and world-class investment platform,” Son, SoftBank’s chairman and chief executive officer, said in the statement. Shares of Fortress closed up 6.5 per cent at $6.21 on Tuesday, giving the New York-based company a market value of about $2.4 billion. SoftBank rose 1.6 per cent in Tokyo on Wednesday. "SoftBank is not doing a great job in communicating where this fits into their investment strategy,” said Tomoaki Kawasaki, an analyst at Iwai Cosmo Securities Co. "There isn’t enough information and some people have an impression that this is an investment by the Vision Fund.” Fortress was founded in 1998 by Edens, Nardone and Robert Kauffman, who came from Swiss bank UBS and New York-based BlackRock Financial Management Inc. Briger was hired from Goldman Sachs Group in 2002. The three founders became billionaires when the fund went public in 2007 raising $634.3 million in the first IPO by a private-equity firm. Fortress’s stock has slumped by nearly two-thirds since the listing, after the company booked losses over the first five years. The performance has come despite a more than doubling of assets managed by the firm, as dwindling performance by investment managers in the fallout of the global financial crisis has hit profitability. Fortress managed $70.1 billion in credit assets, private equity holdings, hedge funds and fixed-income investments as of Sept. 30. Logan Circle Partners, a traditional bond fund manager inside Fortress, accounted for nearly half of that. Fortress investments included distressed assets such as a railway operator in Florida and hotels in rural Japan, the film studio behind Oscar winners "Birdman” and "12 Years a Slave,” and a bitcoin startup. Nizar Al-Bassam and Dalinc Ariburnu of F.A.B. Partners arranged the Fortress transaction and will continue to advise SoftBank with respect to the firm. SoftBank’s ties to Fortress date back to 2014, when Son hired Rajeev Misra away from the asset manager. Misra will head the Vision Fund, and the buyout may reunite him with his former colleagues in overseeing investments for Son. The SoftBank chief has stepped up deal-making in recent years as he transforms his company from a Japanese telecom operator into a more diversified investment company. Since the beginning of 2015, SoftBank has announced at least $44 billion of investments or acquisitions, including its $30 billion takeover of UK chip designer ARM Holdings Plc and a $1.2 billion group-led investment in satellite startup OneWeb, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. SoftBank aims to close the first round of investment in the Vision Fund by the end of this month, according to people familiar with the matter. The Japanese company has said it will contribute $25 billion, while Saudis bring in $45 billion. Apple, Qualcomm and Oracle. Chairman Larry Ellison will also invest $1 billion each, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. "For SoftBank, this opportunity will immediately help expand our group capabilities, and, alongside our soon-to-be-established SoftBank Vision Fund platform,” Son said in the release. JPMorgan Chase acted as financial adviser to SoftBank, while Weil, Gotshal & Manges and Kirkland & Ellis provided legal counsel, and KPMG LLP acted as accounting and tax adviser. For Fortress, Morgan Stanley acted as financial adviser and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP provided legal counsel. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison provided legal counsel to the Fortress principals. Evercore acted as financial adviser, and Davis Polk & Wardwell provided legal counsel to the special committee of Fortress’s Board of Directors. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Ironically, the main catalyst is President Trump’s promises to undo safeguards put in place to prevent another meltdown. Goldman Sachs stock closed on Tuesday at a new all-time high, taking out the prior record that was set in October 2007. Virtually all bank stocks have been on fire since Trump’s victory in anticipating of lighter regulation, higher interest rates and faster growth. But Goldman Sachs has been particularly hot, surging an incredible 37% since the election. That’s quadruple the S&P 500’s post-election advance. Clearly, Goldman Sachs has already emerged as a big winner of Trump’s pledge to “do a big number” on Dodd-Frank, the 2010 Wall Street reform law. “If you really think deregulation is coming and banks are going to be cut loose, who’s going to win? It’s going to be them. We’ve seen that time and again,” said Michael Block, chief market strategist at Rhino Trading. Goldman’s market value surged by $4 billion on the day that Trump signed an executive order beginning the process of rolling back Dodd-Frank. The irony is that Trump slammed Wall Street and Goldman Sachs during the campaign. He even used an image of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein during his closing campaign ad while condemning the “global power structure.” But Trump has gone from criticizing Wall Street and Goldman Sachs to hiring Goldman veterans to help him govern. Trump’s two biggest economic hires are Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner, and top economic adviser Gary Cohn, who stepped down in December as chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs. Analysts say those hires may actually be helping Goldman stock. “With so many Goldman Sachs alums in the administration, maybe some think that policies will skew in the bank’s favor,” said Michael Wong, a Morningstar analyst who covers Goldman Sachs. Wong cautioned that he doesn’t think “anyone should make an investment thesis based on that.” Mnuchin, who was confirmed on Monday as treasury secretary, is in favor of reforming the Volcker Rule, which prevents big banks like Goldman Sachs from making risky bets with their own money. Goldman’s post-election surge can’t really be explained by higher interest rates. Higher rates provide a bigger boost to the profits of consumer-focused lenders like Bank of America and Wells Fargo than investment banks like Goldman. “Higher interest rates is not playing that much into Goldman Sachs’ valuation,” said Wong. But Goldman Sachs would benefit from faster growth and increased CEO confidence that could spark a wave of lucrative M&A and IPO deals. Goldman shares have made a remarkable rebound from the 2008 crisis when many investors feared the complete collapse of the financial system. Goldman is up 380% since its low of $52 in November 2008. While JPMorgan Chase returned to its pre-crisis high in 2013, it wasn’t until now for Goldman stock. Other big banks like Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are nowhere near their all-time highs. But is the Goldman rally overdone? After all, not even Trump is talking about completely repealing Dodd-Frank and efforts to water regulation down are running into resistance, including from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen. Wong thinks Goldman shares are “slightly overvalued” at this point. “They’re pricing in a lot of perfection in terms of deregulation and the ability to take advantage of that,” Block said.
