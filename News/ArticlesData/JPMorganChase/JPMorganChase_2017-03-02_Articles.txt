The main crux of the challenge, labeled Orellana vs JP Morgan, is very similar to the previous suit filed in late January. According to the lead plaintiff, who is seeking class certification for other similarly situated plan participants, the JP Morgan plan sponsors “violated their fiduciary duties by larding the plan with proprietary fund investment options that charged excessively high fees that inured to the benefit of affiliates of JPMorgan and one of JPMorgan’s closest business partners, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BlackRock”), at the expense of plan participants.” Plaintiffs argue that, instead of acting for the exclusive benefit of the plan and its participants and beneficiaries, “defendants acted for the benefit of themselves—by forcing the plan into costly investments managed by JPMorgan and BlackRock. Rather than engage in a systematic, arm’s-length review of available Plan investment options, JPMorgan sought out investment options that allowed its affiliates and business partners to reap outsized fees to the detriment of plaintiff and members of the Class. During the Class Period (defined herein), half of all Plan investment options were affiliated with JPMorgan entities, while more than 70% were affiliated with either JPMorgan or BlackRock.” Those retirement industry professionals closely following ERISA litigation will recognize many of the themes called up in this complaint—and they will probably disagree with many of them. For example, the complaint bemoans the inclusion of active management funds and argues their inclusion robbed investors of an opportunity to save on fees by investing passively. This is despite the well-established standard that investments have to be reasonably priced, rather than the cheapest possible, to meet the requirements of prudence and care under ERISA. This is how the plaintiffs make the case: “These funds were also actively managed, and therefore charged higher fees, even though passively managed investment options were available that would have allowed plan beneficiaries to utilize similar strategies during the class period at a significantly lower cost. For most of the class period, these JPMorgan-affiliated investment options were the priciest in the plan. For example, the JPMIM-managed Mid Cap Growth Fund charged fees of 0.93%, while the Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index Fund Admiral also utilized a mid-cap growth strategy and had an annualized expense ratio of only 0.08%.” For its part, JP Morgan tells PLANSPONSOR, “We are reviewing the complaint. We disagree with the fundamental allegations in the complaint and believe the case is without merit.”  NEXT: Reading further into the complaint  Prev 1 2 Next View Full Article Tagged: Litigation, Regulations, Litigation, 401k, related articles related research most e-mailed Cover On Guard From plansponsor.com JP Morgan 401(k) Plan Challenged Again American Century Self-Dealing Complaint Advances Judge Denies Oracle’s Motion to Dismiss 401(k) Fee Lawsuit T.

If the Federal Reserve follows through on its plan, JPMorgan Chase could earn an additional $2 billion in net revenue this year. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Mar 3, 2017 at 1:23PM JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has transformed into a powerful bank, and not just defensively, as can be assumed from CEO Jamie Dimon's obsession with a fortress balance sheet. Its offensive strength is equally strong, it just hasn't shown through as much because interest rates have been so low. The good news is that this could be about to change, with the Federal Reserve telescoping that it could raise rates multiple times this year. You can gather this from its latest dot plot, which shows that a plurality of members on its monetary policy committee believe its short-term interest rate benchmark should end the year between 1.25% and 1.5%. That benchmark, the Fed funds rate, which is how much banks charge to lend each other excess reserves on an overnight basis, is currently between 0.5% and 0.75%. That implies three hikes of 25 basis points each if the Fed continues its gradual rate of increase. For JPMorgan Chase, this would mean billions more in net interest income, which is high-margin revenue that largely falls to the bottom line. According to its recently filed 10-K, a 100 basis point increase in short- and long-term rates will translate into $2.4 billion worth of added net interest income. If rates go up twice that amount, JPMorgan Chase would earn $4 billion in extra net interest income. Scenario Increase in JPMorgan Chase's Net Interest Income Short- and long-term rates increase by 100 basis points $2.4 billion Short- and long-term rates increase by 200 basis points $4 billion Data source: JPMorgan Chase's 2016 10-K, page 122. It's worth pointing out that this is a fraction of JPMorgan Chase's annual net income. Last year, it earned $24.7 billion. Even if rates were to spike by a full 100 basis points, it would still increase JPMorgan Chase's bottom line by less than 10%. But if rates continue to head higher for multiple years, which could happen given where they are today, you could easily get the same boost to earnings for several consecutive years. These interest rate increases will add up for a bank like JPMorgan Chase. They'll help to reveal what a powerful franchise the bank built as a result of the financial crisis. It acquired Bear Stearns in March 2008 for pennies on the dollar, gaining control over Bear's lucrative primary brokerage business. Six months later, JPMorgan Chase bought Washington Mutual for $1.9 billion in exchange for $180 billion worth of Washington Mutual's deposits and $176 billion of its home loans. What will higher interest rates do for JPMorgan Chase? Image source: Getty Images. These acquisitions, both done at bargain-basement prices, added considerable heft to JPMorgan Chase's product lineup and helped the bank climb to the very top of the heap not only as a Wall Street bank, but also as a Main Street bank. But their value won't be obvious until rates rise and lending margins widen; that's when the $180 billion worth of additional cheap deposits become valuable. In short, while JPMorgan Chase could earn $2 billion or more in added net interest income this year, which will boost its bottom line, it's the prospect of more rate hikes in the future that makes this bank stock so attractive as a long-term hold.

By Expert Roundup Biography March 1, 2017 11:00 p.m. ET China’s annual National People’s Congress (NPC), which lays out the government’s economic and social development plan, will start on Sunday, March 5. Here are the views of several top economists on what to expect: JPMorgan JPM -0.9482758620689655% JPMorgan Chase & Co. U.S.: NYSE USD91.92 -0.88 -0.9482758620689655% /Date(1488837619927-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 14968492 AFTER HOURS USD91.8 -0.120000000000005 -0.13054830287206268% Volume (Delayed 15m) : 90686 P/E Ratio 14.849757673667206 Market Cap 331478167150.766 Dividend Yield 2.088772845953003% Rev. per Employee 421060 More quote details and news » JPM in Your Value Your Change Short position – Haibin Zhu Growth target. We expect the government will keep the growth target unchanged at [6.5%, 7%]. Note that in the previous two years the growth target was lowered from 7.5% to 7%, and then to [6.5%, 7%]. Economic activity (excluding financial services) experienced a notable recovery in 2016, and growth momentum remained stable in 4Q16 (6.7% quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annual rate). Our forecast expects 6.5% growth in 2017, driven by the turnaround in real estate investment (-), auto sales (-), financial services (+) and private investment (+). Uncertainty is largely related to housing market outlook, financial risk development and external risks (US-China trade relationship, euro-area election and outlook), hence balancing between growth and risk management is still a key challenge for Chinese policymakers. President Xi said in a recent speech that China can tolerate lower than 6.5% growth if it comes at excessive risks. Fiscal budget. Last year’s actual fiscal deficit was 3.8% of GDP (vs. a target of 3% of GDP), and if adding non-budgeting items such as policy bank lending and net land sales, augmented fiscal deficit was 10.8% of GDP based on our estimate (vs. 9.7% of GDP in 2015). For 2017, we expect the government will raise the budgetary fiscal deficit target to 3.5% of GDP, with bias to the downside (any number between 3% and 3.5% of GDP). Augmented fiscal deficit may rise further to 11.4% of GDP, supporting an expansionary fiscal policy stance (but the fiscal impulse is smaller than in 2016). Monetary policy. The targets related to monetary policy operation are inflation target and M2 and TSF (total social financing) growth target. We expect the inflation target will remain unchanged at 3%, and M2 and TSF growth target will be lowered to 12% (vs. 13% last year). Note that last year actual M2 growth was 11.3% and TSF growth was 12.8%, hence credit policy tends to be neutral in 2017. On the inflation front, the major change was the producer price index (PPI) reflation. PPI inflation jumped from -5.9% oya (over a year ago) in December 2015 to 6.9% oya in January 2017, improving corporate profits (especially upstream industries) and reducing near-term credit risk for the financial sector. PPI-reflation is most visible in upstream industries and passed through to intermediate sectors, but consumer goods prices are almost unaffected, leading to divergence between CPI and PPI inflation dynamics. In 2017, we expect CPI (consumer price index) will average 2.4% and PPI will average 5%-handle. The pace of rise in GDP deflator will further move up to 3.5% (vs. 1.3% in 2016), and nominal GDP growth will rise to 10% (vs. 8% in 2016). Bank of America Merrill Lynch – Helen Qiao, Sylvia Sheng We expect the government’s macro targets to be adjusted slightly in 2017. GDP growth target of around 6.5%: Given the focus on stability, as shown during the Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) in December, we expect the government to calibrate the GDP growth target to “around 6.5%”, from the range of”6.5-7.0%” previously. If verified, this move will potentially leave some room for structural reforms without stretching on short-term growth objectives, in our view. On the other hand, if the growth target range is unchanged at “6.5-7.0%”, it could be due to concerns about confidence levels before the 19th CPC. Since policy makers have become more complacent about growth resilience in 2016, there is also a low probability that such a growth target range is removed from the working report this year, to emphasize on the objective of managing high leverage-related risks. CPI inflation target at 3.0%: The government will likely maintain the CPI inflation target at 3.0%. Note the inflation target is a cap and not binding. We expect CPI inflation to rise modestly to 2.3% yoy in 2017 from 2.0% yoy in 2016 as the still-negative output gap and tapered policy support should keep inflationary pressure at bay. Therefore, we do not expect the benign CPI inflation outlook to trigger any major policy tightening such as hiking benchmark rate. M2 growth target at 12%: The government will likely lower the M2 growth target to 12.0% (vs the target of 13.0% and actual growth of 11.3% in 2016). Since the Central Economic Working Conference has set monetary policy stance as “prudently neutral”, we believe a case of lower M2 growth could be made. Given the rise in CPI inflation this year, a 12% M2 growth target would be supportive for maintaining growth without risking a significant pick-up in leverage. Maintain fiscal deficit at 3.0% of GDP: Given our assessment that policymakers are still in the “complacency phase” of the mini-cycle, we expect planned fiscal deficit-to-GDP target to remain unchanged at 3.0% of GDP in 2017. Nevertheless, the official fiscal deficit target does not constrain the overall fiscal stance. If growth decelerates notably, the government could step up its fiscal support through quasi-fiscal channels, such as policy banks. Standard Chartered STAN.LN -0.14820803018054432% Standard Chartered PLC U.K.: London GBP741.1 -1.1 -0.14820803018054432% /Date(1488899259000-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 866105 P/E Ratio N/A Market Cap 24493906503.7551 Dividend Yield 2.536207043583862% Rev. per Employee 166121 More quote details and news » STAN.LN in Your Value Your Change Short position – Shuang Ding, Se Yan We expect policy makers to prioritise stability amid external uncertainty, and ahead of the 19th Party Congress to be convened in the fall of this year. China’s annual NPC meetings – scheduled to commence on 5 March and last about 10 days – will approve the main economic and social targets, confirm the fiscal and monetary policy stances and set reform priorities for 2017. We expect policy makers to approve a slightly lower growth target, underscore the importance of containing financial risks, and promote reforms aimed at addressing the asset-price bubble and shutting down zombie enterprises. China will likely target growth of around 6.5%, versus 6.5-7.0% in 2016. GDP grew 6.7% in 2016, the first year of the 13th Five-Year Plan. Local governments have already set their 2017 growth targets, with six provinces adopting higher targets, 13 keeping targets unchanged and 12 lowering targets. Local governments generally appear to be more tolerant of slower growth. However, we do not think the central government will accept growth significantly below 6.5%, as it has committed to deliver average growth of at least 6.5% over 2016-20. The government may keep the CPI inflation target at 3.0% (average). We think more policy support will be needed to achieve the growth target, although the inflation target is less challenging. The M2 and total social financing (TSF) growth target is likely to be lowered to 12% from 13% in 2016. The government has indicated that monetary policy will be prudent and neutral in 2017. The wording and recent rate hikes by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) suggest monetary policy will be moderately tighter. We believe a tighter monetary policy is needed to counter the inflation uptrend, Renminbi depreciation expectations and rising leverage.

However, it is perfectly reasonable and rational — and also normal — after many years, and many many new rules and requirements, to pause and step back and take a look at the entirety of them, individually and together,” the chief financial officer for JPMorgan Chase said during an investor presentation Tuesday. “The industry has come an extremely long way, and the time does feel right to provide more consistency and flexibility.” At the event, Lake shared the bank's wish list, or "principles for responsible regulation." It includes coordination and consistency among agencies and eliminating the "gold-plating" that has made U.S. rules more stringent than others internationally, among other things. Bloomberg News Robo-skeptic: JPMorgan Chase’s Mary Callahan Erdoes is still skeptical about robo-advisers. The asset and wealth management head said in her investor presentation Tuesday that the Wealthfronts and Betterments of the bustling digital advice ecosystem have succeeded in a mostly benign market environment, where people will seek human interaction when prices drop and anxiety rises. “Human beings need human beings to explain the world to them: that is our job,” said Erdoes, who is JPMorgan’s CEO of asset management. “Siri is not going to hold your hand and help you to get through these tough markets.” As you may recall, Erdoes has previously expressed skepticism over the value robos provide. The bank, which has been slower than its peers to jump into digital advice, is giving in to the robo trend and launching its own service later this year. Water your plants: After 60 years in banking, Alice Dittman has a lot of wisdom to share. “Here’s a little story I heard one time about a man who came in and wanted to close his account at his bank,” Dittman, the former chairman and chief executive of Cornhusker Bank in Lincoln, Neb., said in an interview with the local newspaper. “The banker said, ‘May I ask you why?’ And he answered, ‘Because your plants died and it makes me wonder how are you taking care of my money.’” The 86-year-old Dittman, who officially retired in 2013, but remains Cornhusker’s chairman emeritus, said banks must treat customers with respect – and that shines through in every little detail. “One day I saw John (Dittman’s oldest son and Cornhusker’s current chairman) picking up a piece of trash in the parking lot. You have to care about the little things to show people can trust you with the big things.” Dittman also talked about her experiences with innovation in a small bank, why progress for women is synonymous with progress for the bank and her affinity for farmers. Toxic workplaces: Of 40 applicants for a recent opening at her company — a senior analyst position — only two were women, laments Hazel Moore, chair and co-founder of the investment bank FirstCapital. When she told the head of HR she wanted more female candidates, Moore said he cited some statistics that she finds “profoundly disturbing:” One in four entry level positions in investment banking are filled by women, but at the associate level (year four) their numbers have dwindled to one in 18. After looking into why women are stampeding out the door, Moore concluded that the work culture in the investment banking world is the biggest factor. She called on the industry to address the issue urgently. “Investment banks in general have pretty toxic cultures, and are not very nice places to work,” she said. “Unless the leadership teams in the investment banking industry start to care about and value their junior staff, to engage them and understand their motivations and to work to actively overcome their toxic culture, the women will continue to leave in droves. Moreover they will find it increasingly difficult to attract and retain the top talent, male or female, for whom the lure of money will no longer be enough.” Remembering Melanie: The banking industry continues to mourn the loss of Melanie Dressel, the longtime president and CEO of Columbia Bank who passed away last month. Thomas Michaud, president and CEO of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, penned a BankThink piece to laud not just her leadership and career success, but her humanity. “Melanie always appreciated those around her and gave credit to those who earned it,” he said. “She was honest and sincere and I will forever remember her going out of her way at our KBW conferences to thank our staff who organized our events. She treated people with respect and frequently spoke about the broader community and how she wanted to make it better. … Melanie Dressel was an all-around exceptional person.” As one of the few women leading a community bank, Dressel spoke frequently about her experience in banking and the opportunity women have to succeed in the male-dominated industry. A tribute to a mentor in Michigan: Gloria Butler, a Michigan credit union innovator, died Feb. 15. She was 88. Butler was the former CEO of Wyandotte Federal Credit Union and served on the Downriver Credit Union’s executive board before retiring in 1994. “Gloria was one of the first female managers of a credit union Downriver,” wrote Irene Zelenak, the retired manager of Detroit Marathon Employees Federal Credit Union. “She expanded the reach of the Marathon Oil Employees Federal Credit Union in Lincoln Park. When facing a new job with a competing entity, Gloria always recommended that a woman of competent quality would be appointed to fill her vacancy. In her last stint as CEO of Wyandotte … Gloria served as both boss and mentor to dozens of women who found a place for their own banking skills.” Role call Citigroup promoted Julie Bell Lindsay to deputy head of its new global regulatory affairs team in Washington, D.C. The team is being led by Kevin Bailey, a former official at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Previously Lindsay was general counsel on Citi’s capital markets and corporate reporting legal team. Vivienne Artz, general counsel for intellectual property at Citi in the U.K., was named president of Women in Banking and Finance, a networking and development group. Beyond banking Natural caregivers?: Research from the Harvard School of Public Health found that female doctors are outperforming their male counterparts. There would be 32,000 fewer patients’ deaths each year if male physicians achieved the same outcomes as female physicians, according to the study, which tracked hospitalized elderly patients for a one-month period. One factor is that female doctors tend to “provide more patient-centered care” than male doctors. And yet, there are significant gender pay gaps among U.S. physicians (on average women are paid 8% less than men). Speaking of gender pay gaps: A separate study of the gender pay differences for physicians, dentists and lawyers found a much larger gap than 8% for all three professions. The unexplained pay gap between male and female lawyers was the smallest of the three professions, but also grew the most over the 10-year period of the study, increasing from 34% in 1990 to 45% in 2010. So a big congrats here: Intel achieved 100% pay equality for women and underrepresented minorities in 2016, it disclosed in its most recent diversity and inclusion report. It also achieved promotion parity, increased diverse hires and met its retention goal. Roughly 45% of its new hires in 2016 were of diverse backgrounds, it reported. In addition, Intel said that in 2017, a support service it established, called the WarmLine, for employees to contact when they are considering leaving the company, will help it further improve its inclusion efforts. As regular readers of this newsletter may recall, Intel was one of the first Silicon Valley firms to announce its success with gender pay equality. It did so last spring after a trio of activist investors — Arjuna, Pax, and Trillium — began demanding tech giants disclose data about employee compensation. The activist investors have since started pushing the banking industry to do the same.

Republicans and Independents found it “unifying,” though Democrats were slower to come around on that measure. The President gained support for his policy plans among viewers: Interviewed before and after the address, they came away from it more positive on his ideas for the economy, immigration, terrorism, crime and Obamacare. As is often the case in addresses to Congress, those who watched were more likely to be from the president’s party – in this case, Republicans. And they described a president they felt was keeping campaign promises and offering an “inspiring” message. While half of Democrats found the speech “divisive,” about one-third of them also said Mr. Trump was “specific” and “knowledgeable”; neither label drew a majority, but nonetheless sizeable numbers compared to the more negative reactions Democrats have had to other aspects of his presidency. And viewers of all stripes described the speech as at least somewhat positive in tone. Overall, most watchers approved of the speech. Republicans did tune in to watch it in much greater numbers than Democrats (as a president’s party typically does) which bolstered those approval numbers. Forty percent of Democrats at least somewhat approved; 18 percent strongly approved. The president moved opinion among viewers on his plans for a number of policy issues, comparing their views before and after the speech. The percent favoring his plans for fighting terrorism, addressing crime, improving the economy, handling illegal immigration, and dealing with Obamacare all jumped. Republicans and Democrats did see the president’s description of the country quite differently. Most Republicans think Mr. Trump’s depiction of the state of America is accurate, while six in 10 Democrats think the President’s description is worse than the country really is. There is agreement across party lines that Mr. Trump is trying to do what he said he’d do during the campaign.   David Fuller's view Rub your eyes, gently pinch your cheek – yes, you are not dreaming – Trump actually gave a good presidential speech.  He deserves credit for this, and I think those behind the scenes, probably including sensible daughter Ivanka and Reince Priebus, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, deserve even more credit for keeping Trump focussed and on track. Interestingly, the real, politically moderate Trump featured in this speech.  I assume Bernie Sanders loved his promise of a $1trillion infrastructure bill, presumably over two terms.  I imagine the Democrats’ Trump impeachment files will quietly be placed in boxes for at least the short term.     What about the markets? This item continues in the Subscriber’s Area.   Dimon Says U.S. Future Very Bright If Trump Can Enact Reforms Here is the opening of this topical article from Bloomberg: JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon expressed broad optimism for U.S. growth and his own industry if Donald Trump’s administration succeeds in reshaping taxes and regulation. Still, he said, international crises could pose risks. Addressing investors in New York on Tuesday, Dimon predicted banks will lend more to small businesses, and that employers will raise wages and lure millions of people back into the job market, if the government eases rules and cuts corporate taxes. The nation’s biggest lenders are strong and poised to expand operations into more countries, he said. “The future is very bright,” said Dimon, who is both CEO and chairman of the nation’s biggest bank. “If you have tax reform, regulatory reform, infrastructure reform, I believe you could see the United States growing much faster.” He said he joined a panel of business leaders advising the president because “the U.S. needs better policy.” Read More: Trump turns to Dimon, Schwarzman for policy advice The embrace marked a shift from October, before the election, when Dimon signaled disagreement with Trump’s comments on immigration and Muslims. At the time, the banker emphasized that all people are “completely welcome” at JPMorgan, mentioned his Greek grandparents, and set off loud applause by subtly predicting Americans were about to elect the first woman to the presidency. Those topics didn’t arise on Tuesday. Instead, Dimon echoed Trump’s frustrations with a maze of regulations that hold back business investments and infrastructure projects. “Do you know that this country hasn’t built an airport for 40 years?” Dimon asked. “We haven’t put a tunnel or a bridge in New York City for I think maybe even longer than that. You hear the horror stories of how long it takes to build a highway, a road, a grid, a tunnel, an airport.”   David Fuller's view Fair points from Dimon on infrastructure and Trump clearly agrees.  The question for markets is, will they hold let alone extend current gains if Trump’s stimulative measures are delayed well into 2017, let alone 2018? Probably not because that would be like running over the cliff in terms of expectations. Trump’s team will not be able to do everything at once.  Therefore they need to be realistic and practical in terms of what can be achieved on a step by step basis, outlining a clear plan in terms of what is achievable.    No Brexit Deal Is a Scenario U.K. Must Prepare for, Davis Warns Here is the opening of this informative article from Bloomberg: U.K. Brexit Secretary David Davis told cabinet colleagues to prepare for the possibility of Prime Minister Theresa May failing to reach a divorce deal with her European counterparts in the two years allowed by European Union rules. Describing talks to quit the bloc as the “most important peacetime operation,” Davis called on government departments to “support a smooth exit from the EU” at the weekly cabinet meeting on Tuesday, May’s spokesman Greg Swift told reporters in London. The Brexit secretary underlined “the need to prepare not just for a negotiated settlement but also for the unlikely scenario in which no mutually satisfactory agreement can be reached,” Swift said. “It’s important departments understand the challenges ahead.” There was also a plea for optimism from May. “She reiterated the need for an orderly process but stressed we must be optimistic, that our message is we’re not going to fail,” Swift said. Separately, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told delegates at the British Chambers of Commerce annual conference that a deal can be done within the two-year window allowed by Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. May has pledged to trigger the process by the end of March.   David Fuller's view For Brexit ministers, the challenges are immense but the opportunity to regain sovereign independence could not be more important for this country’s long-term development.  They have to deal with everything from querulous, angry Lords motivated by hubris - to nervous foreign corporate investors in search of reassurances - and disillusioned, bitter Eurocrats who cannot see or think beyond their own collective panic. The UK team is doing well, led by our increasingly assured Prime Minister Theresa May, ably supported by the highly experienced wise heads of David Davis, the articulate Iain Duncan Smith and many others. Assuming Article 50 is invoked this month, it is impossible to tell how long discussions will persist given Europe’s many elections.  Nevertheless, I maintain that the UK’s position is stronger than ever.   Economists May Be Underestimating How Fast the Robots Are Coming Here is the opening of this informative article from Bloomberg: Economists may be underestimating the impact on labor markets of increasing automation and the rise of artificial intelligence, according to a post published on the Bank of England’s staff blog on Wednesday. “The potential for simultaneous and rapid disruption, coupled with the breadth of human functions that AI might replicate, may have profound implications for labor markets,” BOE regional agents Mauricio Armellini and Tim Pike wrote in the Bank Underground post. “Economists should seriously consider the possibility that millions of people may be at risk of unemployment, should these technologies be widely adopted.” Robots and intelligent machines threaten to replace workers in industries from finance to retail to haulage, with BOE Chief Economist Andrew Haldane estimating in 2015 that 15 million British jobs and 80 million in the U.S. could be lost to automation. Past periods of technological upheaval, such as the industrial revolution, may not be a useful guide as the pace of change was slower, giving society longer to mitigate the potential consequences of increasing job displacement and inequality, according to Armellini and Pike. “Economists looking at previous industrial revolutions observe that none of these risks have transpired,” they wrote. “However, this possibly underestimates the very different nature of the technological advances currently in progress, in terms of their much broader industrial and occupational applications and their speed of diffusion.” “It would be a mistake, therefore, to dismiss the risks associated with these new technologies too lightly,” they said.   David Fuller's view It is easy to overlook the speed of technological innovation which is occurring.  After all, we have not experienced it previously and we have also lived through eight difficult years of slow GDP growth due to the severe credit crisis recession commencing in 2008. Nevertheless, just consider for a moment the dramatic technological changes that you have witnessed and often benefited from over the last decade.  Consider just three of many examples which may be personal to you: 1) changes in your mobile phone over the last decade; 2) improvements in your computer software; 3) the advanced technology in your car if you purchased a new one in the last year or two. Think how few of the technologies which you take for granted today were not available only twenty years ago.  Ten years from now the changes will be even more dramatic because we are living in an era of accelerating technological innovation, which will not end because we run out of new ideas. Yes, it will include many more robots.  However, very few of them will have visually human characteristics.  The big robots will be ever smarter industrial machines.  Many others will be miniature and all but invisible.  Most of these will be in the form of smart, fast chips or processors in computers and also larger machines.  There is no limit to their usefulness.      European Stocks Surge on Fed Hike Bets With FTSE 100 at a Record This article by Blaise Robinson for Bloomberg may be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section: European stocks jumped the most since the U.S. election, led by banks and miners, as increasing prospects for a Federal Reserve rate increase and robust China factory data boosted optimism about global growth. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 1.4 percent at the close, as all 19 industry groups gained. The benchmark extended gains in afternoon trading as U.S. equities scaled new peaks. The U.K’s FTSE 100 Index and FTSE 250 Index rose to all-time highs, while Germany’s DAX Index rallied 2 percent to close above 12,000 for the first time since April 2015. Traders are betting there’s an 82 percent chance of a rate increase at the Fed’s March 15 decision, about double the odds from Friday, after two influential officials from the central bank signaled a greater willingness to tighten monetary policy.   Eoin Treacy's view With President Trump’s first speech to Congress out of the way attention has returned to the prospect of additional Fed tightening this year and when the first of three anticipated rate hikes is likely to occur?     Eoins personal portfolio stock market longs opened   Eoin Treacy's view The full details of these trades are posted in the Subscriber's Area.   A Patent Decision on Crispr Gene Editing Favors MIT This article from Wired.com may be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section: Someone is going to make a lot of money licensing Crispr. And someone is going to make lot of money on therapies based on Crispr. That’s why, the day before the decision, the National Academy of Sciences released a long document laying out what kind of Crispr-based human therapies were kosher—so no one goes the full Gattaca. In fact, the moneymaking part has already begun. Startups are getting funding based on Crispr-based business plans. Editas Medicine, which licenses the Broad patents to work on treatments for genetic disorders in human beings, had a 30 percent stock bump on word of the patent decision. “It certainly caused some concerns, because depending on how the courts were going to rule on the two claims, if you went with one, you could lose, right?” says Edison Liu, CEO of the Jackson Laboratory, a major source of genetically modified mice used in research. Jackson Labs has licenses from both sides, and since it aims at academic uses, gets better terms than a Silicon Valley biotech startup might.   Eoin Treacy's view The acrimonious patent battle over exactly who controls the intellectual property relating to CRISPR-Cas9 DNA editing has been dragging on for a year. Since the three main protagonists are well funded there is ample scope for additional suits and counter suits since the potential rewards are so large.   Email of the day on the rollout of 5G I would very much appreciate your thoughts about Sierra Wireless (NASDAQ:SWIR) who are also involved in this space. I continue to be a big fan of your service and your daily video commentary is a welcome addition.   Eoin Treacy's view Internet connectivity is as essential to the modern economy as electricity and water and bandwidth needs to increase in order to cater to the number of additional connected devices coming on stream. If you think about how many devices in your home connect to your modem and compare that to how many used it a decade ago you’ll likely notice a big change. My children barely watch TV. When they want to see something they go on YouTube or Netflix both of which are streaming services.     Email of the day on a US venue for The Chart Seminar: Are you planning a USA chart seminar? Thanks   Eoin Treacy's view Thank you for your interest in The Chart Seminar and I’d be more than happy to organise a seminar in the US if there is sufficient interest. So far we have received the most interest for venues in Singapore and the UK which is why we have scheduled events at those locations.   Email of the day on Continuous Professional Development credit at The Chart Seminar: Can you please elaborate on the part of the sentence marked in red below taken from your advert in Fuller Treacy  Comment of the Day? Is this only for those who are members of the CFA or does it apply to delegates in general? “The CFA Institute has once more agreed to co-host the Singapore event and I will also provide certificates for continuous professional development to anyone who wants one.”   Eoin Treacy's view Thank you for this question which may be of interest to other subscribers. Financial regulators, particularly in the UK but just about everywhere these days require financial intermediaries to engage in continuous professional development. A number of subscribers over the years have told me they would have an easier time justifying the two days away from the office if they could get CPD credit for The Chart Seminar. With that in mind I approached the CFA in Singapore who are prepared to issue a CPD certificate to anyone attending the seminar. Since it is from the CFA it should be acceptable outside of Singapore. We can also issue a certificate from FullerTreacyMoney to confirm attendance at the seminar containing a summary of what was covered if you need it. I am also in discussions with a London based partner to get full CISI accreditation for the seminar in the UK which would allow delegates to fulfil almost 50% of their annual requirement in one sitting.   Fuller Treacy Money Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version The information provided on this website (www.FTMoney.com) is for the purposes of information only.  This website and its content is not and should not be considered or deemed to be an offer of or invitation to engage in any investment activity.  Nothing FT Money does and nothing on this website is intended to operate or be construed as the giving of advice or the making of a recommendation by FT Money to any investor or prospective investor.

Economy Yellen: March Rate Hike 'Appropriate,' Sees Three Hikes In 2017 JED GRAHAM 3/03/2017 Reprints Fed chief Janet Yellen sealed the deal for an interest-rate hike on March 15, saying it "would likely be appropriate," as long as the economy doesn't flash unexpected weakness. Yellen also endorsed three rate hikes in 2017 as appropriate, though decisions will remain data-dependent. Dow financials JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) closed modestly higher after Yellen's remarks, while the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq closed slightly higher. Yellen's speech followed a wave of hawkish Fed comments and strong economic data, which continued on Friday. Yellen noted that job growth of around 180,000 per month is "notably above the level estimated to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor force growth — between 75,000 and 125,000 per month." Earlier Friday, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said that the central bank must act pre-emptively in raising interest rates or it risks a repeat of the disastrous inflation experience of the 1970s. Even from a reliable hawk, the warning was surprising. Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management gauge of nonmanufacturing activity surged to 57.6 in February, the highest level since October 2015. That news made a Fed rate hike on March 15 seem like even more of a slam dunk. Markets now see an 86% chance of an increase, a dramatic turnaround since the beginning of the week, when a hike was seen as a distant possibility. Markets now see a 55% chance of at least three hikes by the December meeting. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, one of the more dovish officials on the central bank, said he still favors gradual tightening. Yellen put the idea of a March hike on the table last month when she warned of the risks of waiting too long. Yellen could lock in market expectations for March rate hike or reintroduce investor doubts. Although the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite were almost unchanged Friday intraday, bank stocks continued to rise on hopes for stronger growth and higher rates. JPMorgan Chase rose 0.7% to 92.80, while Goldman Sachs advanced 0.7% to 252.89. Wells Fargo (WFC) crept up 0.3% to 58.89 and Bank of America (BAC) added 0.8% to 25.44. All four banks hit all-time or post-crisis highs this week. Banks benefit from a wider yield spread, letting them borrow short and lend long. The 10-year Treasury yield has soared in the last few days, but the curve has continued to flatten as the two-year yield spikes to its highest level since 2008. IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve is getting impatient to raise interest rates even though prospects for a near-term economic stimulus from President Trump are diminishing. On Tuesday, New York Fed President William Dudley, generally seen as a dovish policymaker, said the case for a March hike had "gotten a lot more compelling." On Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing activity gauge hit a 30-month high of 57.7 as new orders surged. The data seemed to support Dudley's contention that the "animal spirits" of business decision makers were emboldened by the election of President Trump. Weekly initial jobless claims tumbled to their lowest level in nearly 44 years, the Labor Department said Thursday.

March 3, 2017 • Ben Steverman Loading Other Articles... JPMorgan Chase created a sensation last year with a new credit card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, crafted from “a proprietary mix of embedded metals.” Also sensational, and pretty crafty, was the annual fee of $450. A turnoff? So many people signed up, Chase ran out of embedded metals, and the card cost the company some profits in the fourth quarter. Fighting back, American Express sweetened some of the perks on its own, 33-year-old premium card, the Amex Platinum. Included in the company’s latest enticement? An increase in Platinum’s annual fee from $450 to $550. There’s something strange about the credit card business. It’s technically possible to justify paying $450, maybe even $550, for the privilege of using a credit card. Look at the long list of perks, the points and credits toward trips and hotels, the freebies and upgrades. Then do the math. Will you actually use enough to justify the fee -- or have the time and patience to obsess over the reward program’s complicated rules and requirements? If so, go ahead and sign up. If not, you might be better off with a simple, no-fee card, maybe one with a generous cash-back bonus or an especially low interest rate. But that’s no fun. Part of the appeal of a premium credit card is that it’s a premium card. It might not save you a dime, but it will get you on a plane earlier or, even better, in the lounge sipping cocktails while everyone else on your flight lines up to board. It makes you feel special, just holding that solid metal rectangle in your hand. When you flash it, everyone knows you can afford it. Of the nearly 350 million U.S. credit card accounts (up from about 275 million since 2010, according to the American Bankers Association), the vast majority of cards don’t charge any annual fee at all -- though they still bring in plenty of revenue from penalties, interest, and the interchange fees paid by merchants. Will American Express customers pay an extra $100 to keep carrying around their Platinum cards? Each customer will have to make his or her own decision, based on rational, or irrational, considerations. Recently, Mark Jackson was thinking about canceling his Platinum. The 27-year-old resident of Scottsdale, Ariz., realized he probably wasn’t getting the full benefit from the card’s $450 annual fee. Now that the card is an extra $100 ... he’s planning to stick with it. In the end it was hard to imagine giving up access to American Express’s airport lounges. Jackson has stopped in the Centurion lounges in Miami and San Francisco on layovers. At the lounge in Dallas, he got a free 15-minute massage. “It’s kind of nice to pamper yourself,” said Jackson, who writes for a deals website. “It’s nice to have a place, if you have an hour to kill, to get a nice cup of coffee or a cocktail.” American Express is betting that most of its customers act like Jackson, and not like coldly rational bargain hunters. Charlotte Fuller, a spokeswoman, points out that the Platinum fee increase is the first in 10 years. The company is hoping customers pay more attention to the new perks, which include $200 a year toward Uber rides and extra rewards for hotel and airline purchases. Platinum customers also have exclusive access to events and dinner reservations at famous restaurants. “This means more tables held every night for our card members,” Fuller said. Premium cards don’t always make it easy to get the perks. Jackson, who doesn’t own a car, is excited about the Amex Platinum’s new $200 Uber credit, but one feature annoys him. The $200 is doled out at $15 a month (with an extra $20 in December). You use that credit each month or lose it. If Jackson doesn’t hail an Uber in April, there’s no way to claim that $15 in May or June. “It really is going to depend on what the customer values,” said Tiffani Montez, senior analyst at Aite Group. “People are going to have to dissect the rewards structures and see if it makes sense for them.” After a long day of travel, a $550 massage might just make sense for you.

Bloomberg Ben Steverman 3 days ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL 10 tips for saving money at Costco and big box stores Donald Trump's superyacht and other billionaire boats © Image Source/Getty Images Credit card JPMorgan Chase created a sensation last year with a new credit card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, crafted from “a proprietary mix of embedded metals.” Also sensational, and pretty crafty, was the annual fee of $450. A turnoff? So many people signed up, Chase ran out of embedded metals. Fighting back, American Express sweetened some of the perks on its own, 33-year-old premium card, the Amex Platinum. Included in the company’s latest enticement? An increase in Platinum’s annual fee from $450 to $550. There’s something strange about the credit card business. It’s technically possible to justify paying $450, maybe even $550, for the privilege of using a credit card. Look at the long list of perks, the points and credits toward trips and hotels, the freebies and upgrades. Then do the math. Will you actually use enough to justify the fee—or have the time and patience to obsess over the reward program’s complicated rules and requirements? If so, go ahead and sign up. If not, you might be better off with a simple, no-fee card, maybe one with a generous cash-back bonus or an especially low interest rate. But that’s no fun. Part of the appeal of a premium credit card is that it’s a premium card. It might not save you a dime, but it will get you on a plane earlier or, even better, in the lounge sipping cocktails while everyone else on your flight lines up to board. It makes you feel special, just holding that solid metal rectangle in your hand. When you flash it, everyone knows you can afford it. Of the nearly 350 million U.S. credit card accounts (up from about 275 million since 2010, according to the American Bankers Association), the vast majority of cards don’t charge any annual fee at all—though they still bring in plenty of revenue from penalties, interest, and the interchange fees paid by merchants. © Ben Steverman BC-550-FOR-A-CREDIT-CARD-AMEX-PLATINUM-BATTLES-CHASE-SAPPHIRE Will American Express customers pay an extra $100 to to keep carrying around their Platinum cards?

The weird logic of Platinum, Sapphire, and the rest of the premium crowd. by Ben Steverman @bsteverman More stories by Ben Steverman March 3, 2017, 5:00 AM EST There’s something strange about the credit card business... Illustration: Getty Images JPMorgan Chase created a sensation last year with a new credit card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, crafted from “a proprietary mix of embedded metals.” Also sensational, and pretty crafty, was the annual fee of $450. A turnoff? So many people signed up, Chase ran out of embedded metals. Fighting back, American Express sweetened some of the perks on its own, 33-year-old premium card, the Amex Platinum. Included in the company’s latest enticement? An increase in Platinum’s annual fee from $450 to $550. There’s something strange about the credit card business. It’s technically possible to justify paying $450, maybe even $550, for the privilege of using a credit card. Look at the long list of perks, the points and credits toward trips and hotels, the freebies and upgrades. Then do the math. Will you actually use enough to justify the fee—or have the time and patience to obsess over the reward program’s complicated rules and requirements? If so, go ahead and sign up. If not, you might be better off with a simple, no-fee card, maybe one with a generous cash-back bonus or an especially low interest rate. But that’s no fun. Part of the appeal of a premium credit card is that it’s a premium card. It might not save you a dime, but it will get you on a plane earlier or, even better, in the lounge sipping cocktails while everyone else on your flight lines up to board. It makes you feel special, just holding that solid metal rectangle in your hand. When you flash it, everyone knows you can afford it. Of the nearly 350 million U.S. credit card accounts (up from about 275 million since 2010, according to the American Bankers Association), the vast majority of cards don’t charge any annual fee at all—though they still bring in plenty of revenue from penalties, interest, and the interchange fees paid by merchants. Will American Express customers pay an extra $100 to to keep carrying around their Platinum cards? Each customer will have to make his or her own decision, based on rational, or irrational, considerations. Recently, Mark Jackson was thinking about canceling his Platinum. The 27-year-old resident of Scottsdale, Ariz., realized he probably wasn’t getting the full benefit from the card’s $450 annual fee. Now that the card is an extra $100 ... he’s planning to stick with it. In the end it was hard to imagine giving up access to American Express’s airport lounges. Jackson has stopped in the Centurion lounges in Miami and San Francisco on layovers. At the lounge in Dallas, he got a free 15-minute massage. “It’s kind of nice to pamper yourself,” said Jackson, who writes for a deals website. “It’s nice to have a place, if you have an hour to kill, to get a nice cup of coffee or a cocktail.” Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up American Express is betting that most of its customers act like Jackson, and not like coldly rational bargain hunters. Charlotte Fuller, a spokeswoman, points out that the Platinum fee increase is the first in 10 years. The company is hoping customers pay more attention to the new perks, which include $200 a year toward Uber rides and extra rewards for hotel and airline purchases. Platinum customers also have exclusive access to events and dinner reservations at famous restaurants. “This means more tables held every night for our card members,” Fuller said. Premium cards don’t always make it easy to get the perks. Jackson, who doesn’t own a car, is excited about the Amex Platinum’s new $200 Uber credit, but one feature annoys him. The $200 is doled out at $15 a month (with an extra $20 in December). You use that credit each month or lose it. If Jackson doesn’t hail an Uber in April, there’s no way to claim that $15 in May or June. “It really is going to depend on what the customer values,” said Tiffani Montez, senior analyst at Aite Group. “People are going to have to dissect the rewards structures and see if it makes sense for them.” After a long day of travel, a $550 massage might just make sense for you.

The Federal Reserve recently signaled that rates could be increased at the March 15 conclusion of its two-day meeting. Such a move would make financial stocks extraordinarily attractive. If...

Lawrence Obracanik, 42, pleaded guilty to wire fraud affecting a financial institution on Thursday before U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams in Manhattan, according to an announcement from U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine, according to Bharara’s office. Obracanik is scheduled to be sentenced by Abrams on July 7. A lawyer for Obracanik did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday evening. Obracanik, a resident of Fort Worth, Texas, turned himself in to authorities in New York in December. Following a court appearance on the day of his arrest, he was released on a $100,000 bond. He was instructed as part of his bail conditions to seek employment and attend counselling for gambling, according to court records. The criminal complaint against Obracanik did not identify JPMorgan by name. But a profile for him on LinkedIn said that he had worked for the New York-based bank in Texas. A spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment at the time of Obracanik’s arrest. Representatives of the bank could not immediately be reached on Thursday. Prosecutors say that, between July 2014 and February 2016, Obracanik was responsible for wire transfers of more than $5 million from an account at the bank where he worked to an account at another bank belonging to an unnamed individual. The complaint said that during an interview with two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents in August, Obracanik admitted wiring the money to that person’s account and said that he had done so to pay personal debts. The case is U.S. v. Obracanik, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-mj-7732.

That doesn’t mean it’s cheap. The company has 20,000 developers and plans to spend $9.6 billion on tech, or about 9 percent of its projected revenue — double the industry average. The bank also created bots for some customer-service tasks — such as resetting passwords — doing the work of 140 people. It’s all more fodder for the basic income crowd. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up 2) Oprah realizes you don't need experience to be president In in interview with Bloomberg Television that aired this week, billionaire Oprah Winfrey was asked whether she would consider running for president. “I never considered the question even a possibility,” she told host David Rubenstein, co-CEO of the Carlyle Group LP. “I thought, ‘Oh, gee. I don’t have the experience. I don’t know enough.’ And now I'm thinking, ‘Oh!’” She said she won’t run.  Oprah Realizes You Don't Need Experience to Be President 3) Uber is having an awful year First there was the #DeleteUber campaign. Then a former employee alleged she was sexually harassed. This week, Bloomberg obtained a video of Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick arguing with his driver about declining fares. In the video, Kalanick said: “Some people don’t like to take responsibility ... they blame everything in their life on somebody else.” Kalanick was quick to apologize. “To say that I am ashamed is an extreme understatement,” he wrote in an email to staff. “This is the first time I’ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.” Watch him shimmy before it all goes bad. Uber CEO, Travis Kalanick (video) 4) You can lease a dog? People joke that their pets own them, not the other way around. Some have learned neither’s the case. Pet stores across the U.S. are renting out dogs and cats in contracts similar to car leases. One dog, for example, cost $2,400 down and $165.06 a month for 34 months. That means Fido can become a financial liability if he runs away, and he can be repossessed if the family misses a payment. “This cat is ruining my credit score,” one customer lamented. 5) It’s been a great year for the really rich The world’s 500 richest people earned an extra $217 billion so far this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Mexico’s Carlos Slim has lost about $16 billion since President Donald Trump launched his campaign, but he became a whole lot more popular. China’s richest, in contrast, have raked it in under the new U.S. leader. The new index shows the winners and losers.   Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

 JPMorgan is hiring bankers in a city near you Matt Turner Feb. 28, 2017, 10:24 AM 5,475 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan JPMorgan is looking to hire bankers in a city near you. The US bank hosted its annual investor day Tuesday February 28, and Doug Petno, chief executive of commercial banking at the company, delivered a presentation. Commercial banking looks after Middle Market Banking (MMBSI) clients, or companies with between $20 million and $500 million in revenue, and Corporate Client Banking (CCBSI), which covers those with $500 million to $2 billion in revenue. Smaller companies are served by Chase Business Banking and bigger companies are served by the Corporate and Investment Banking division. The commercial banking business has been expanding, adding more than 150 revenue-producing bankers between 2014 and 2016, according to a slide. There has been a 17% year-on-year increase in specialized industry bankers, according to another slide.  The bank has pushed into new markets like Palo Alto and Memphis, and plans to have a presence in the top 50 Metropolitan Statistical Areas ranked by population by the end of this year. Right now, it's in 48. The number of client calls was up 13% year-on-year, while the number of new relationships is up 14%. The long term target is to generate $1 billion in revenues from expansion markets, up from $411 million in 2016.  Asked by an analyst about the expansion effort, Petno said that "it's not easy to hire good bankers." "There's not a banker tree ... The good ones are entrenched in the banks, and they're hard to pry out." He added that employment growth had been limited by JPMorgan's ability to develop its own bankers in certain markets, and acquire bankers in others.  "We've been building very steadily," he said.  JPMorgan   SEE ALSO: Warren Buffett just shared his best investment advice, and said the 'elite' have wasted $100 billion ignoring it NOW WATCH: This is why Wall Street is able to stay one step ahead of federal investigations Loading video...

The criminal complaint against Obracanik did not identify JPMorgan by name. But a profile for him on LinkedIn said that he had worked for the New York-based bank in Texas. A spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment at the time of Obracanik's arrest. Representatives of the bank could not immediately be reached on Thursday. Prosecutors say that, between July 2014 and February 2016, Obracanik was responsible for wire transfers of more than $5 million from an account at the bank where he worked to an account at another bank belonging to an unnamed individual. The complaint said that during an interview with two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents in August, Obracanik admitted wiring the money to that person's account and said that he had done so to pay personal debts. The case is U.S. v. Obracanik, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-mj-7732.

The choices banks are making are steering financial blockchains in a direction that is far from the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto’s conception of it, and closer to more traditional technologies out there today — a Google Docs of sorts for banks with immutability and security built in. 1. Things are moving faster than expected; blockchain technology should be ready for broad use by banks within a year. Only last spring, analysts were declaring that mainstream adoption of blockchain technology was 10 years away. Following the fever pitch of blockchain chatter in 2015, observers expected 2016 to be the year where expectations were tempered. But bankers and several other financial blockchain experts at a conference hosted by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corp. Wednesday referred to 2017 as the year of the blockchain pilot, and 2018 as the year blockchain technology will be used in production in financial services. "To use a flying analogy, we've got the landing gear out and we're preparing the final descent," said Emmanuel Aidoo, head of blockchain and distributed ledger strategy at Credit Suisse. "All of us are focused on making this real in 2017," said Todd McDonald, co-founder and chief operating officer of R3, a bank consortium that has developed a “blockchain inspired” platform called Corda. “We all need to make this real this year into next.” The list of financial blockchains in or close to prime time is growing. Digital Asset Holdings, the blockchain technology company founded by former JPMorgan Chase executive Blythe Masters, plans to have a blockchain product ready for banks to use by the end of 2017, said Chris Church, its chief business development officer. Northern Trust recently went live with a blockchain for private equity funds, based on technology from the Linux Foundation Hyperledger Project and IBM. “I believe 2017 is the year we see live networks versus proof of concepts,” said Jerry Cuomo, fellow and vice president of blockchain technologies at IBM. “I think we’re seeing the real evidence that blockchain is not going to come, it’s here.” Microsoft's Blockchain as a Service, a set of blockchain building blocks that runs on the Azure cloud, is also market ready. Bank of America has been using it to create a blockchain to automate trade finance. JPMorgan Chase has developed a blockchain called Quorum that’s based on Ethereum. In February, the DTCC completed a distributed ledger proof of concept with Digital Asset to better manage the netting process for repurchase agreement transactions. The DTCC also plans to shift its Trade Information Warehouse, which keeps records on derivatives contracts, to a distributed ledger in collaboration with IBM, R3 and other partners. 2. Bankers see blockchain technology mainly as a way to save money. It’s not surprising that bankers would want to save money. Most have to reduce their cost and efficiency ratios to survive and stay in regulators’ good graces. But when you think about the original premise of the blockchain — a means of recording anonymous digital currency transactions that would circumvent the traditional payment system and pass under the radar of the government, this is a leap. Credit Suisse, for one, has conducted 10 proofs of concept with blockchain startups to achieve cost reductions. "We tend to look at projects that can give us, if I'm being honest, 50% or greater cost reductions," Aidoo said. "If I'm being more pragmatic, it's more like 35%. Anything less than that doesn't warrant execution." "We've got the landing gear out and we're preparing the final descent," said Emmanuel Aidoo, head of blockchain and distributed ledger strategy at Credit Suisse. Northern Trust, which has done 20 proofs of concept for blockchain technology and recently went public with its blockchain for private equity funds, also focuses on streamlining, which would lead to cost cuts. “We decided to embark on a mission to improve efficiency,” said Justin Chapman, global head of market advocacy and innovation research at Northern Trust. During its earlier stages, there was hope that blockchain could be a way to to offer new products and services and automate certain things, like supply chains and international remittances, that in the past couldn’t be digitized with one technology. While some are still pondering revenue opportunities on blockchain, the promise of efficiency is what is driving bankers’ interest today. 3. The idea of "permissionless" blockchains has pretty much been dropped by the industry. Looking back at blockchain developments over the past year, Church at Digital Asset Holdings said the financial world agreed to abandon the idea of permissionless distributed ledgers. In other words, blockchains anybody could join. Banks have gravitated toward permissioned blockchains that can only be used by those who are invited — say, counterparties to derivatives contracts or trade finance partners. "The permissioned environment is going to prevail because it meets the requirements of this marketplace," Church said. "That was a very important intellectual understanding people got to." 4. Integration/collaboration is the biggest perceived hurdle. Asked what presents the greatest challenge to blockchain adoption — data security, privacy, scalability, business case or integration — about half of the DTCC conference audience picked integration. Last year at a similar conference, about a third of the audience chose this option. Integration in this context seems to mean the ability to work with other banks’ and partners’ blockchain technology. “Interoperability is key: if you look at obvious challenges, privacy and scalability are solved,” Church said. “If you do get interoperability, which will require collaboration, all sorts of things become possible. If you have a single source of truth, services can be built off of that, and there's a huge market opportunity. Cross processes allow new products and services to be created.” Aidoo noted that privacy is still tricky, because even with a permissioned, invitation-only blockchain, there can still be certain data elements not everyone on the chain should see. “We talk about public versus private blockchains, but it's more complicated than that,” he said. For instance, the “Chinese walls” Wall Street firms have to maintain mean people in some parts of the organization should not be able to access certain information. Aidoo also expressed anxiety about collaboration. “I worry about execution risk, meaning things like, do we have the right partners, do we have the right ecosystem, do we have the right partners from a collaboration perspective?” he said. One thing many agree on: Blockchain technology is inevitable for this industry. “This is not going to stop,” Aidoo said. “This technology will be as pervasive as SQL servers and databases.” Editor at Large Penny Crosman welcomes feedback at penny.crosman@sourcemedia.com.

Redesigned in stainless steel, the card will cost new holders $550 starting on March 30, a $100 increase that will take effect for existing users when they renew after Sept. 1. It’s the first fee hike in more than a decade, according to Janey Whiteside, AmEx’s senior vice president for global charge products, benefits and services. But AmEx, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ken Chenault, is providing more sweeteners. In addition to the credit for Uber Technologies Inc.’s car-hailing service, users will be able to earn five-times rewards points at eligible hotels booked through the lender’s website. And AmEx is expanding its collection of airport lounges. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up The largest U.S. credit-card issuer by purchases is under pressure to defend its dominance. Rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. made a splash in August with a Sapphire Reserve card featuring an initial sign-up bonus of 100,000 points, drawing so many applicants it temporarily ran out of materials to mint it. Earlier this week, AmEx consumer services chief Doug Buckminster called the offer “a full-frontal assault” on the Platinum portfolio, noting that attrition temporarily increased among those holders after the Sapphire Reserve’s debut. Stop Bleeding “We view today’s announcement as an attempt to stop the bleeding,” Bill Carcache, a Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst who recommends investors sell AmEx shares, said Thursday in a note to investors. “A significant portion” of Platinum card billings shifted to Sapphire Reserve last quarter, when AmEx “increased its investments to record levels without moving the needle on billings growth,” he wrote. AmEx shares fell 1.4 percent to $80.77 at 11:28 a.m. in New York, the worst performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Still, Whiteside said American Express’s changes are a response to customer feedback, not to competitors. The company declined to specify the new Platinum card’s sign-up bonus and the number of users in that portfolio. “We’ve worked to refine and evolve the card,” Whiteside said in an interview. “We’re really redefining the playing field here.” Read more: Chenault’s war for parity AmEx said in October that it’s putting “ renewed emphasis” on Platinum offerings. Attrition after the Sapphire Reserve’s launch abated within about two weeks, and AmEx ended the year with record growth in the number of new Platinum cardholders, pushing membership to the highest ever. JPMorgan eventually lowered its signup bonus. And while CEO Jamie Dimon has hailed the card’s popularity, he said it shaved as much as $300 million off the bank’s fourth-quarter profit.

 Chase QuickPay processed $28 billion in 2016 BI Intelligence Mar. 2, 2017, 10:44 AM 962 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Venmo's monetization will be worth watching Venmo's latest feature is now available to all users Amazon and Chase introduce Prime credit card This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. At its investor day, JPMorgan Chase announced that Chase QuickPay, its proprietary peer-to-peer (P2P) payments offering, saw 94 million transactions worth $28 billion in 2016. For context, that marks a 38% increase from the $21 billion that the firm processed last year. In general, that’s strong performance, especially considering that just 25% of US adults have made a mobile P2P payment. But it’s worth paying attention to third-party competitors, like Venmo, which are starting to creep up on QuickPay. QuickPay once dwarfed Venmo’s volume, but that’s no longer the case. In 2015, Venmo’s volume of $7.5 billion was just over a third of QuickPay’s total. But Venmo is growing fast — the platform processed $17.6 billion in 2016, marking a remarkable 135% growth and significantly shrinking the gap between it and QuickPay. That’s particularly notable considering Venmo’s limited use cases. Venmo hasn’t disclosed customer totals, but its user base is likely smaller than Chase’s 26.5 million mobile banking users plus its online banking customer pool. In addition, though both Venmo and QuickPay offer both online and mobile transfer options, Venmo is used predominantly on mobile devices only, which means online functionality may not be a substantial volume add for P2P firms.  That leaves a clear incentive for banks to catch up. For banks, capturing a share of rising mobile P2P payments matters. That’s because mobile banking is a key engagement tactic for these players, since mobile banking users have considerably lower rates of attrition and tend to consume more banking products on average than other customers. If customers are opting to make P2P payments on a third-party service rather than within a banking app, that’s a missed opportunity for mobile banking engagement.   But Zelle, a bank-owned and -affiliated P2P consortium, could be the ticket. Zelle, which launched on Bank of America last week and will ultimately include 19 banks with over 70 million potential customers once it launches in full, is poised to connect bank-based P2P platforms so that it’s easier for users to transfer funds to peers at other banks. That’s critical, because P2P platforms thrive on network effect, and simplifying interbank transfer broadens that network by bringing more potential users into the fold. That might make banking apps' convenience more appealing than a third-party player. As Zelle goes live on more providers’ platforms, it will be critical to see if it can pull users from its eligible base, whether that’s in the form of converting existing third-party customers or bringing a new group to P2P payments.  Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, defined as informal payments made from one person to another, have long been a prominent feature of the payments industry. That’s because individuals transfer funds to each other on a regular basis, whether it's to make a recurring payment, reimburse a friend, or split a dinner bill.   Cash and checks have historically dominated the P2P ecosystem, and they’re still a popular tool. But as smartphones become a primary computing device, top digital platforms, like Venmo and Google Wallet, have enabled customers to turn away from cash and make those payments digitally with ease. Over the next few years, though overall P2P spend will remain constant, a shift to mobile payments across the board and increased spending power from the digital-savvy younger generation will cause the mobile P2P industry to skyrocket.  That poses a problem for firms providing these services, though. Historically, most of these players have taken on mobile P2P at a loss because it’s a low-friction way to onboard users and won’t catch on unless it’s free, or largely free, to consumers. But as it becomes more popular and starts to eat into these firms’ traditional streams of revenue, finding ways to monetize is increasingly important. That could mean moving P2P functionality into more profitable environments, leveraging existing networks of friends to encourage spending, or offering value-added services at a nominal fee. Jaime Toplin, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile P2P payments that examines what’s driving this shift to mobile P2P and explains why companies need to find a way to capitalize on it quickly. It discusses how firms can use the tools they have to gain in the P2P space, details several cases, and evaluates which strategies might be the most effective in monetizing these platforms. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Consumers still want mobile P2P services, and they’re turning to them. Individuals pay their peers on a regular basis, and as smartphones are increasingly used as computing devices, these consumers look to such services for fast and easy ways to pay.  Monetizing P2P is more important than ever. Initially, P2P was a valuable onboarding tool for companies, and when it was still a small segment, taking it on at little value or a loss didn’t have major implications. But as volume grows and user bases scale fast, finding ways to monetize quickly should be a priority for firms looking to stay ahead. New technology could put some apps ahead of their peers. P2P continues to rely on networks, especially for informal, social transactions. But rather than having a large network, it’s becoming important for firms to understand their user bases and the networks within them. This means that chat apps, and leveraging bot and AI technology, may offer a distinct advantage. In full, the report: Forecasts the growth of the P2P market, and what portion of that will come from mobile channels, through 2021. Explains the factors driving that growth and details why it will come from increased usage, not increased spend per user. Evaluates why mobile P2P isn’t profitable for companies, and details several cases of attempts to monetize. Assesses which of these strategies could be most successful, and what companies need to leverage to succeed in the space.

The bank is using new software called “COIN”—short for Contract Intelligence—to review commercial loan agreements, according to Bloomberg News. The software reviews documents in seconds, doing work that once required 360,000 hours of work each year by lawyers and loan officers, the story reports. The bank says the software has helped reduce loan-servicing mistakes that were often attributable to human error in interpreting 12,000 new contracts per year. “JPMorgan is scouring for more ways to deploy the technology,” the story says, “which learns by ingesting data to identify patterns and relationships. The bank plans to use it for other types of complex legal filings like credit-default swaps and custody agreements. Someday, the firm may use it to help interpret regulations and analyze corporate communications.” At least one law firm, DLA Piper, is using artificial intelligence software for due-diligence document review in mergers and acquisitions. The software searches text in contracts and then creates a summary and an analysis. Reed Smith, meanwhile, is testing artificial intelligence software by RAVN Systems, CNBC reports. The law firm used the software to review hundreds of pages of documents to identify and pull out certain items in contracts. RAVN made some mistakes, but it improved when lawyers added information to their queries. The platform also picked up some mistakes missed on a first review by lawyers. Another company called LawGeex uses artificial intelligence to review contracts and spot missing or problematic clauses, PCWorld reported last April.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 March 2017 by Military News JPMorgan Chase Institute’s Local Consumer Commerce Index Shows a 0.1 Percent Decrease in Consumer Spending Growth in November 2016 WASHINGTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Today, the JPMorgan Chase Institute released its Local Consumer Commerce Index (LCCI) for November 2016, which showed that 9 of the 15 US cities analyzed had higher year-over-year consumer spending growth rates in November than they did in October. While overall year-over-year consumer spending growth declined by 0.1 percent in November – making it the fifth consecutive month of negative growth – the magnitude of those contractions has continually decreased since August. Across all 15 cities, fuel spending contributed 0.1 percentage points to growth, breaking a trend of negative growth contributions in virtually every month since October 2014. This report provides a timely view of how the following cities and surrounding metro areas are faring economically, both individually and in aggregate: Atlanta, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, Portland (OR), San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle. By looking at actual de-identified financial transactions, LCCI offers an ongoing, dynamic view of the health and vibrancy of the U.S. consumer and the places where businesses operate. “While we are still seeing an overall contraction in year-over-year local commerce growth, it’s encouraging to see the magnitude of these contractions decreasing over time,” said Diana Farrell, President and CEO of the JPMorgan Chase Institute. “Many changes contributed to this positive trajectory including notably strong growth in spending at small businesses but also a rare, if small, increase in fuel spending growth.” The key highlights from the latest Index include: Houston registered a 3.3 percent decline in November 2016—a smaller contraction compared to the 6.1 percent drop in August 2016, but a larger contraction in comparison to the 2.9 percent drop in September 2016. Detroit experienced flat growth in November 2016, breaking a trend of declines in growth that started in July 2016. Small business growth rebounded significantly to contribute 0.9 percentage points in November, but this growth was offset by a 0.9 percentage point contraction in mid-sized business growth in that same month. Other services, like barbers, health providers, and gyms, contributed 0.9 percentage points to growth in November 2016, the largest contribution across all product types in that month. At the same time, durables spending subtracted 1.1 percentage points from growth, the largest detraction of any product type in November 2016. Durables have been a consistent drag on growth since August 2015. The LCCI offers unique advantages over existing measures of consumer spending. The LCCI captures actual transactions, instead of self-reported measures of how consumers think they spend. The LCCI provides timely data on spending in 15 major metropolitan areas; such geographic granularity is unavailable in most other spending measures. These 15 cities mirror the geographic and economic diversity of larger metropolitan areas in the United States and account for 32 percent of retail sales nationwide. The index also presents a more granular view of local consumer commerce through five important lenses: consumer age, consumer income, business size, product type, and consumer residence relative to the location of the business. For each lens, we show how different segments contributed to year-over-year spending growth. The LCCI captures economic activity in sectors that previously have not been well understood by other data sources. These include sectors such as food trucks, new merchants, and personal services. Each release of the LCCI will describe the economic picture of local communities and provide a powerful tool for city development officials, businesses, investors, and statistical agencies to better understand the everyday economic health of consumers, businesses, and the places they care about.

Ryan, which has its offices in the Galleria Towers on LBJ Freeway, has purchased just over 6 acres on the south side of State Highway 121 at Communications Drive. The site Ryan has acquired is between the huge corporate campuses being built by JPMorgan Chase and Liberty Mutual Insurance. The purchase, which has been in the works for several months, closed this week. Ryan representatives were unable to provide details about the timing of the project. The purchase was financed with a $9.4 million loan from Prosperity Bank, Collin County deed records show. The land is one of the last remaining tracts in the hugely successful 250-acre Legacy West project. Toyota Motor, Liberty Mutual and JPMorgan Chase plan to open their offices at Legacy West this year. Ryan's site could be used to build a tower of 30 floors or more to house its offices and other tenants. The purchase agreement says Ryan can't build a tower smaller than 12-stories or a building with less than 240,000 square feet. Ryan is one of the largest office tenants at the Galleria complex with almost 150,000 square feet and still has several years left on its current leases. Legacy West was started in 2014 and is one of the most successful real estate projects ever built in North Texas. Almost 20,000 people will work in the development by 2018. The $400 million Legacy West Urban Village, with high-end shops, restaurants and boutique office space, will open this spring. Subscribe to our new weekly real estate newsletter. Ryan LLC will join Toyota, Liberty Mutual Insurance, JPMorgan Chase and FedEx with offices in the mixed-use Legacy West project. Karahan Cos.

Quest for social justice drives banks probe By Bongani Nkosi | 2017-03-02 13:44:15.0 Back to Home Tweet Just what drives Tembinkosi Bonakele, under whose tutelage the Competition Commission is taking on mega banks for currency exchange fixing? CAPTION: Thembinkosi Bonakele, the head of the Competition Commission. Photo: Brett Eloff Related articles 'Cooking oil fix' - Unilever South Africa faces huge fine Food prices to fall further Ramaphosa distances ANC from Manyi on FICA bill No pensioner must go without their grant‚ says Zuma Tshwane Council approves R4.52bn capital budget for 2016/17 Bonakele, commissioner of the commission, cites an unflinching commitment to social justice as his main driver. "It inspires my whole life and not necessarily any individual investigation that the commission does," he told Sowetan in an interview. "It's my philosophy. This is what I bring to the position that I hold, to communities where I live and the organisations that I serve." But that is not to say he personally has a bone to pick with the banks the commission wants fined for colluding in currency trading prices. "I can't necessarily say that I'm on a crusade against anybody. But social justice imbues my consciousness." The commission announced on February 15 that it had referred a collusion case against almost 20 banks to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution. Producing prima facie evidence that the banks had been fixing the price at which the rand was traded to the US dollar, the commission wants the banks fined 10% of their annual turnover. Most of the implicated banks are multinationals. They include Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase & Co, JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A, Standard New York Securities and HSBC Bank. Their South African counterparts with a case to answer are Investec, Absa and Standard Bank. One bank, Citibank, reached a settlement agreement with the Competition Commission. It agreed to a fine of R69-million. Bonakele said other banks had the option to settle before prosecution. "I hope they do [settle]. We do like early settlements. But that being said, we are ready to run the case." The commission started its investigation in 2015, just a year after Bonakele was appointed its commissioner. At that time, he had already served the commission for about 10 years. An admitted attorney, Bonakele holds a BJuris and an LLB from the University of Fort Hare and an MBA from the University of Pretoria's Gordon Institute of Business Science. He previously practised with Cheadle Thompson and Hayso, a leading law firm in Johannesburg. His story of life begins in the Eastern Cape. "I was born in a small village in King Williams Town and grew up in Mthatha in part, which is where my mom is from. "But for the most part I grew up in East London. I went to high school from 1990 to 1994 in East London. "It was a very interesting time, during the transition. I always say that I'm the child of transition because that's when I really started knowing what's going on. "I went to study law at Fort Hare. I was very involved in the student movement. "I was president of the Student Representative Council at Fort Hare at some point and a member and leader of the South African Students Congress. "I think my background is where my commitment to social justice comes from." For what he described as one of the commission's biggest and complex investigations, Bonakele thanked his team for its hard work. "It was not an easy area. Currency trading itself is very complex and even understanding the terms is complicated. "We delved into this and I'm very proud of what we've been able to achieve." nkosib@sowetan.co.za Email Print Tweet Back to top Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

 A tiny London firm run by a couple of 30-somethings won a slice of Snap's IPO at the last minute Matt Turner Mar. 3, 2017, 2:17 PM 24,442 facebook linkedin twitter email print Drew Angerer/Getty Snap Inc. just raised a greater-than-expected $3.4 billion in the largest US tech initial public offering in over two years. Given that the typical IPO raises less than $500 million, pulling off a sale of this size takes a lot of work. Naturally, Snap drafted some heavyweight banks with huge sales forces for the job. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs led the deal, along with a long list of banks including the likes of JPMorgan, Allen & Company, and UBS. But the list also includes a less familiar name: Connaught (UK) Limited. Connaught, a small London firm set up in 2014, wasn't named in Snap's first IPO filing in early February. But it did appear in Snap's updated filing just a few days ago. It is listed as having sold 307,692 shares, worth about $5.2 million at the IPO price of $17. There's not a lot of information out there about Connaught. It has a basic website with a mailing address and an email address. It was incorporated December 29, 2014, and has three directors: Ian Osborne, Alex Usher-Smith, and Dr. Marcel Reichart. Osborne and Usher-Smith, ages 33 and 35, specialize in advising tech, media, and internet companies. Osborne set up Osborne & Partners, an international strategic advisory firm that once hosted a Davos, Switzerland, party with tech billionaire Sean Parker and Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff. Usher-Smith is a former Lazard and Greenhill banker. Reichart is the executive vice president of digital development and partnerships at the German media company Bertelsmann, according to his LinkedIn profile. The role on the Snap IPO is a coup for the firm, which has fewer than 10 employees, according to its LinkedIn profile. Connaught is not a US registered broker-dealer, and so any shares it sold in the US had to pass through Global Alliance Securities. Osborne and Usher-Smith did not return messages seeking comment in time for publication.

DRC/Tomas Gonzalez By Jenna Duncan Follow @jennafduncan Jenna Duncan Denton Record-Chronicle Staff Writer jduncan@dentonrc.com Published: 03 March 2017 01:37 PM To finance seven ongoing construction projects across the University of North Texas system, system officials had to sell bonds in January to pay for the work.  In addition to the regular finance team, James Verfurth, a senior finance major, accompanied the team for a two-day trip to New York to work with financial service companies JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays to sell $264.1 million worth of bonds. Over two days, Verfurth sat in meetings with UNT and bank officials, watched the bonds go to market and met with a variety of executives at both companies.  "It was an eye-opening experience," Verfurth said of the early January trip. "I genuinely enjoy finance and it was an opportunity I couldn't pass up — I observed something that directly impacts students." After, he presented about the experience and bond sales to the Board of Regents last week in Dallas.   Over the course of eight minutes, Verfurth explained the sale of new bonds and refinancing of others, totaling $264.1 million. With refinancing, the system saves $7.1 million and reduces the average debt service the system has to pay.  "We definitely entered at a good time and it was a favorable entry point for us into the market," he told the board. "That gave us a phenomenal focus, and we were definitely center stage and center of attention, as far as what institutions and investors were looking at."  Board members whispered among themselves during his presentation. Neal Smatresk, UNT president, turned back from his seat to Luke Lybrand, the UNT System treasury manager who intoduced Verfurth, to tell him "good job."  At the end of his presentation, board President Brint Ryan asked if Verfurth was sure he wanted to move to Philadelphia for a job with Wells Fargo in June.  After the meeting, Ryan, who has been on the board since 2009, said he had never seen a student give this level of presentation to the board before.  "I was very impressed with James' presentation," he said in an email. "I've never seen a student present to the Board at this level and I would have hired him on the spot it — if he wasn't already headed to Wells Fargo."

According to SEC filings, lead underwriter Morgan Stanley got 60 million Snap shares, or, 30.2 percent of the shares given to underwriters — which would mean $25.71 million in fees, the biggest cut of any bank. The second biggest —Goldman — sold nearly 50 million shares, or 24.8 percent, amounting to about $21.08 million. Other big chunks went to JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank, while a slew of more than 20 other banks sold slivers, each less than 10 percent. (Some of these banks could also have been paid additional fees that haven't yet been disclosed.) Getty Images Signage for Snap Inc., parent company of Snapchat, is displayed on monitors on the floor New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) before the opening bell, March 2, 2017 in New York City. Here's how it works: A group of banks work with Snap and potential early IPO buyers -- mainly large institutional investors -- to figure how how many shares they'll be able to sell at what price. The banks keep a percentage of the total amount raised, and give the rest to Snap. That percentage is subject to negotiation. Snap's $3.4 billion IPO raised more than twice as much as every 2016 venture-backed tech IPO combined, according to Renaissance Capital. But the 2.5 percent underwriting fee for the banks could be the third-lowest ever for a major technology offering, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year. show chapters Snap gets snapped up    Friday, 3 Mar 2017 | 6:35 AM ET | 01:07 Snap's IPO underwriters had a difficult task, Recode reports: They wanted to make sure the IPO price was not too high or too low before it hit the public market, as early investors and founders of the company wanted a fair deal.

That includes one unlikely addition: chief strategy officer Imran Khan. Khan, only at Snap for about two years, has been granted $145 million worth of shares, the company said in a filing on February 2. Those shares will likely be worth a lot more at the IPO price. And he was paid a $5 million bonus last year. Not bad for a guy who, not long ago, was working for “some bucket research shop.” That’s how one Wall Streeter described Khan’s early career. (He did indeed work at a small company, called Fulcrum Global Partners, until about 2004; it shut its doors in 2006.) Khan, 39, joined Snap in early 2015, in part to help chart the company’s path to an initial public offering, though his official role has been to build up revenue, expand the business, and run ad sales. He was hired from Credit Suisse, where he was head of global internet investment banking and was perhaps best known for his leading role on the initial public offering of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group in 2014, the largest share sale ever. When news of his move to Snap broke it made headlines, but Khan is not the only Wall Streeter to wind up playing the “grown-up” in a technology startup. Anthony Noto, once the head of technology banking at Goldman Sachs, was already Twitter’s finance chief. Ruth Porat would make the move from Morgan Stanley to Alphabet, Google’s parent. For Khan, this wasn’t the first major pivot in his then 15-year career. ‘A very strategic thinker’ Business Insider spoke with six executives who worked directly with Khan at various points in his career. They all asked not to be identified for this story. Through a spokesman, Khan declined to comment for this story. Khan’s career has taken him from an investment-banking job at ING Barings, the Dutch financial-services firm, to conducting sell-side research at JPMorgan and eventually running the technology banking franchise at Credit Suisse. His former colleagues describe him as ambitious and strategic in his career choices. Though most spoke in friendly terms, it’s clear that his rise and transition from research analyst to internet banker and now tech-industry millionaire rubbed some the wrong way. One person, for example, felt that Khan failed to credit others for helping him make the switch from research to banking, saying Khan “clawed his way up.” But that kind of talk was dismissed by other colleagues as plain old jealousy among bankers who once would’ve been peers but perhaps have found themselves courting Khan for a role on Snap’s IPO, likely to be the biggest tech flotation since Alibaba’s sale in September 2014. Born and raised in Bangladesh, Khan came to the US as a student, to Colorado, where he graduated from the University of Denver ‘s Daniels College of Business in 2000. After a stint at a tiny Denver-based satellite-broadband startup called WildBlue, he wound up at ING Barings in New York in 2000, according to his profile on BrokerCheck . After the banking business was sold to ABN Amro in 2001, he wound up at Fulcrum (the “bucket research shop”). There, he began to conduct “sell-side” research on technology companies such as Yahoo, Amazon, and eBay. Khan moved to JPMorgan in 2004 where he eventually became head of global internet and US entertainment equity research. He’s been described as steeped in the tech industry, close to executives, and is married to an executive at an Amazon-owned e-commerce company. At JPMorgan, Khan became one of the top-ranked internet analysts on the Street, landing the coveted top or second spot in Institutional Investor’s annual rankings of researchers. He was also one of the youngest managing directors at JPMorgan, having attained the title at 29. Khan’s meteoric rise and the accolades were carefully cultivated, one person said. “He’s a very strategic thinker,” the person said. “He’s the type of guy who ranked at JPMorgan as a research analyst not because he’s the smartest guy or the best stock picker ... but he’s a very affable, likable guy. He knew how to work the system.” This person said that Khan would build up relationships with company CEOs so that he could get the first question on quarterly-earnings calls. “He’s always thinking about that stuff.” ‘A testament to his scrappiness’ That strategic thinking soon had Khan building relationships with China’s budding technology companies, which were flocking to the US IPO market in the mid-2000s. The payoff on those came with his first big switch. He felt like a banker in a research analyst’s clothing.

Check out the latest theme park experiences and attractions Business Uber rides, fancy lounges among credit cards' perks intended to win your business Credit card security in the U.S. French digital security company Oberthur Technologies is hoping to revolutionize credit cards by developing a digital display powered by a micro-thin battery and what it calls Motion Code technology. French digital security company Oberthur Technologies is hoping to revolutionize credit cards by developing a digital display powered by a micro-thin battery and what it calls Motion Code technology. Jonnelle MarteWashington Post Privacy Policy The battle for credit card users is heating up again. On Thursday, American Express announced that it will start offering Platinum cardholders up to $200 a year in Uber credits, expanded access to airport lounges and other perks. It is the second time since October that the company has sweetened its reward system in what credit card experts say is a clear effort to compete against the Chase Sapphire Reserve card, which generated a ton of buzz last summer when it launched with a lucrative 100,000 point sign-up bonus. "More than anything Amex wants to hold on to the customers they currently have," says Zach Honig, editor in chief of ThePointsGuy.com, a site that tracks and compares credit card rewards. As part of the changes, Amex Platinum members can receive $15 in Uber credits each month, with an extra $20 in December. Cardholders can also earn up to five times the rewards points on hotel stays if they book through Amex's website. That follows a similar change the company made in October for flights booked directly through airlines or through Amex. JPMorgan Chase disrupted the premier credit card market last year when it introduced the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card with a new customer bonus worth up to $1,500 in rewards for cardholders, credit card experts say. Wells Fargo's collateral damage: Customers' credit scores A Wells Fargo Bank in Palo Alto shown on April 19, 2010. (Associated Press) The unwanted accounts created by Wells Fargo & Co. employees trying to hit aggressive sale goals have already forced the bank to provide some 100,000 customers with refunds averaging $25 for fees and other expenses. But that may be the easy part. There also is the collateral financial damage caused by the scandal, which involved not only more than 1 million savings and checking accounts, but applications for more than 500,000 credit cards.

See more videos Demand was so high the bank temporarily ran out of the metal being used to make the flashy cards. The eye-popping offer yielded a lot of attention from millennials and so-called credit card churners, who have a habit of opening new credit cards just to cash in on the signup bonuses. The bold move was not cheap, reducing the bank's profit by up to $300 million in the fourth quarter, chief executive Jamie Dimon said during an investor conference in December. Competitors mostly sat on the sidelines at first, waiting to see how sustainable the move would be, analysts say. But after Chase slashed the sign-up bonus in half to 50,000 points in January, Amex is stepping up its game and other card companies may follow, says Sean McQuay, a credit card expert for the personal finance website NerdWallet. Financial world eyes interest rates, regulatory rollbacks Marco Santana A continually improving economy should boost the banking industry and consumer finance in 2017, but there's also uncertainty about the impact of the Trump Administration. On one hand, efforts in Washington D.C. to kill regulations like the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 could help banks, but others warn...

On one hand, efforts in Washington D.C. to kill regulations like the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 could help banks, but others warn... (Marco Santana) "The Chase Sapphire Reserve demonstrated that there is a much larger premium credit card market than anyone thought," says McQuay. "The other premium credit card players have wanted to fight back." While these kind of cards can be attractive, experts say there's on major factor to consider before making the leap: their hefty annual fee. As a part of the latest change, Amex upped the annual fee for the Platinum card to $550 from $450. That makes it more expensive than the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card and the Citi Prestige, which each charge $450 a year. Consumers should also make sure the card they choose offers that match their spending habits, credit card experts say. For example, people who don't use Uber regularly throughout the year may not be able to take full advantage of the new rewards from Amex, which will expire unused credits at the end of each month.

BlackRock has said the inclusion of yuan debt in global indexes could be announced in 2017, and that the firm has hired for credit research in China. Text Size: A A A Bloomberg/Hong Kong Speculation that China’s 56.3tn yuan ($8.2tn) bond market is about to go more global is spurring investment funds to hire in the nation. A central bank official said at the end of last year that China will create conditions for the inclusion of yuan debt in global indexes. BlackRock has said inclusion could be announced in 2017, and that the firm has hired for credit research in the nation. Invesco says such a development may come in the next 12 months, and also aims to expand in the country. Adding Chinese notes to global indexes including those from Bloomberg Barclays, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup would bring cash into the nation from yield-hungry investors from New York to Tokyo. Managers of that wealth will need to navigate rising defaults and local ratings that many have questioned. Investment firms also want to sell more products to a growing legion of wealthy Chinese investors, after greater market access was allowed. “We are seeing increased interest among global asset managers to develop an investment capability for the onshore Chinese bond market,” said Nick Aylwin-Foster, who runs headhunting firm Sheffield Haworth’s asset management practice for Asia. “Within fixed income, hiring is primarily into the credit research teams.” BlackRock has hired a couple of people in Shanghai who focus on credit research in the domestic bond market, according to Gregor Carle, head of Asia-Pacific fixed income product strategy. “We continue to build that coverage because we see this greater opportunity set coming out of China, and of course, the potential index inclusion that’s further down the line,” he said. Fidelity International is building out its investment team in Shanghai, Jackson Lee, country head for China, said in January. A spokeswoman for the money manager said there is no update to that plan. Amid shifting regulations and hiring challenges, many funds are still deciding on such a move. They must weigh downsides that include “a gap between when you commit to a new market and when you actually start seeing returns,” according to Aylwin-Foster at Sheffield Haworth. Timing on index inclusion is also uncertain. Joining global debt indexes isn’t a priority at this stage and the nation is in no rush for its shares to enter the MSCI Inc’s benchmark indexes, Fang Xinghai, vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said in January. The People’s Bank of China and other departments will work to improve rules to give foreign investors easier access to the interbank bond market and create conditions for the inclusion of yuan debt in global indexes, Ma Jun, chief economist of the PBoC’s research bureau, said in December. Still, China presents a unique opportunity for fixed-income fund managers. Foreign holdings account for only about 1.4% of the nation’s interbank bond market, making it “one of the most untapped opportunities” in global asset management, according to Nicholas Britz, senior associate at Shanghai-based consulting firm Z-Ben Advisors. Fidelity International said in January that its wholly foreign-owned enterprise in Shanghai became the first global asset manager to register with the Asset Management Association of China as a private fund management company. The qualification allows the firm to create onshore investment products for Chinese institutional and high-net-worth investors for the first time, it said in a statement. Andrew Lo, chief executive officer at Invesco Asia-Pacific, said in an e-mail interview that the firm has plans for its own wholly foreign-owned enterprise and aims to register it with AMAC to become a private fund management company. “The WFOE will provide on-the-ground support to our Hong Kong-based Greater China investment team that is offering Chinese investment products to global investors,” said Lo. Invesco already has a joint venture with Chinese partners including Great Wall Securities Co and Lo added that the firm is “very committed” to expand its presence in the country. He said he sees “growing demand” from Chinese institutions to diversify fund managers and investment strategies. “The game of managing renminbi fixed income is very much moving to the onshore market,” said Britz at Z-Ben Advisors. “Assuming you can build out an effective renminbi credit team, you’ll definitely be pulling ahead of your global rivals.” Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, owns the former Barclays Risk Analytics and Index Solutions business, including the benchmark indexes, which have been co-branded as “Bloomberg Barclays” indexes. Bloomberg Barclays overhauled its China fixed-income gauges and started a Global Aggregate + China index on March 1, while stopping short of adding the nation to major benchmark indexes. 0 COMMENTS There are no comments.

U.S. equities suffered their largest one-day loss since January on Thursday, in a dramatic attitude shift after Wednesday’s massive “meltup” that pushed the Dow Jones industrials index over the 21,000 level for the first time. That jump was at least in part due to apparent excitement over President Donald Trump’s more moderate tone in his address to Congress on Tuesday night. But less than 24 hours later, investor sentiment was chilled by more “Russian influence” headlines for the Trump White House and increasingly hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve ahead of a speech by Chair Janet Yellen on Friday. Other headwinds include a rapid marking down of first-quarter GDP growth expectations, tepid earnings growth and very extended sentiment measures. Investors would do well to use this opportunity to cautiously consider trimming their exposure, rebalancing out of relatively expensive stocks. Watch: Trump to zero in on economy, security in first Congress speech Instead, mom-and-pop investors seem to be doing the exact opposite: A recent report by JPMorgan shows retail investors have poured more than $80 billion into “passive” index funds while institutional investors are backing away.  Here are three good reasons to be nervous. First, the Fed is suddenly making very hawkish noises heading into the March policy meeting in less than two weeks. Futures market odds of another quarter-point hike have pushed above 90 percent, well more than the threshold that triggered rate hikes in December 2015 and December 2016.  Consider this collection of comments this week sharing a common theme that more rate hikes are needed soon: New York Fed President William Dudley said the case for tightening had become a lot more compelling.San Francisco Fed President John Williams said he expects a rate hike to receive a “serious consideration” at the March policy meeting.Fed Governor Lael Brainard, one of the most dovish Fed policymakers, said continued removal of policy accommodation was likely to be appropriate soon. She cited positive momentum in incoming data, evidence of a labor market near full employment and rising inflation pressures.And Fed Governor Jerome Powell told CNBC that the case for a March rate hike had “come together,” while reiterating his expectations for three rate hikes in 2017. A more aggressive pace of rate hikes is a huge change in the monetary policy stance that, frankly, isn’t getting the attention it deserves. Consider that the Fed has raised interest rates only twice in the last 10 years, but it’s poised to accelerate that to two hikes in just three months.  Second, GDP growth expectations are actually moving lower, in sharp contrast to the post-election triumphalism about deregulation, tax cuts and more stimulus from Mr. Trump. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow real-time estimate of first-quarter growth has fallen to just 1.7 percent.  As for earnings, while analysts are looking for S&P 500 profits to grow 9.8 percent in 2017, an aggressive market rally has pushed the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio to 17.9 vs. a 10-year average of 14.4. Third, turning back to Mr. Trump, Wall Street is cooling to hopes that proposed tax cuts and other reforms will be forthcoming. Goldman Sachs has warned taxes are increasingly a story for 2018, not 2017.  UBS strategist Yianos Kontopoulos, in a recent note to clients, warned amid rising complacency that “the market is learning that new U.S. policy initiatives may also be slower to come.” While he doesn’t believe this could necessarily lead to a sell-off, he thinks the “upside in stocks may be moderate” and investors should consider adding some long-term bond holdings to rebalance their risk profile. Wells Fargo strategist Paul Christopher noted that while the president’s “sweeping and conciliatory” speech was well received on Tuesday, a lack of clear policy guidance from the White House means “Congress may struggle with divisions over crucial decisions.” Witness internal stifle within the GOP over plans to reform health care. Amid tepid economic growth and policy tightening from the Fed, investors may realize their enthusiasm went a little too far as Mr. Trump’s economic initiatives get bogged down by typical Washington gridlock.   Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Rhonda Schaffler Mar 3, 2017 10:56 AM EST Many families aren't prepared for unexpected bills, and it can take them a year to dig out of the debt they cause. That's one of the findings from a new survey by JPMorgan Chase Institute, which looked at the financial health of American households. The survey found that almost four in 10 families faced unplanned medical, auto repair or tax bills, which cost about $1,500 on average. In some cases, it took those families a full year to recover financially after the payment. Fiona Greig, the institute's director of consumer research, discussed the study with TheStreet's Rhonda Schaffler in New York.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jonnelle Marte By Jonnelle Marte March 3 Follow @jonnelle Credit card companies are stepping up their efforts to compete for high spending customers. (BernardaSv/iStock) The battle for credit card users is heating up again. On Thursday, American Express announced that it will start offering Platinum cardholders up to $200 a year in Uber credits, expanded access to airport lounges and other perks. It is the second time since October that the company has sweetened its reward system in what credit card experts say is a clear effort to compete against the Chase Sapphire Reserve card, which generated a ton of buzz last summer when it launched with a lucrative 100,000-point sign-up bonus. “More than anything Amex wants to hold on to the customers they currently have,” says Zach Honig, editor in chief of ThePointsGuy.com, a site that tracks and compares credit card rewards. As part of the changes, Amex Platinum members can receive $15 in Uber credits each month, with an extra $20 in December. Cardholders can also  earn up to five times the rewards points on hotel stays if they book through Amex’s website. That follows a similar change the company made in October for flights booked directly through airlines or through Amex. JPMorgan Chase disrupted the premier credit card market last year when it introduced the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card with a new customer bonus worth up to $1,500 in rewards for cardholders, credit card experts say. Demand was so high the bank temporarily ran out of the metal being used to make the flashy cards. The eye-popping offer yielded a lot of attention from millennials and so-called credit card churners who have a habit of opening new credit cards just to cash in on the signup bonuses. The bold move was not cheap, reducing the bank’s profit by up to $300 million in the fourth quarter, chief executive Jamie Dimon said during an investor conference in December. Competitors mostly sat on the sidelines at first, waiting to see how sustainable the move would be, analysts say. But after Chase slashed the sign-up bonus in half to 50,000 points in January, Amex is stepping up its game and other card companies may follow, says Sean McQuay, a credit card expert for the personal finance website NerdWallet. “The Chase Sapphire Reserve demonstrated that there is a much larger premium credit card market than anyone thought,” McQuay says. “The other premium credit card players have wanted to fight back.” Although these kinds of cards can be attractive, experts say there’s one major factor to consider before making the leap: their hefty annual fee. As a part of the latest change, Amex upped the annual fee for the Platinum card to $550 from $450. That makes it more expensive than the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card and the Citi Prestige, which each charge $450 a year. (This is the first time it has increased the annual fee in more than a decade, an Amex spokeswoman said, noting that the higher fee comes with more generous rewards.) Cardholders can earn some of those fees back in the form of statement credits offered for travel purchases and other perks, the company said. For example, Amex offers a $200 credit for airline fees, in addition to the new Uber credits. The Chase Sapphire Reserve offers a $300 annual credit for travel purchases, such as flights and hotels. Consumers should also make sure the card they choose offers perks that match their spending habits, credit card experts say. For example, people who don’t use Uber regularly throughout the year may not be able to take full advantage of the new rewards from Amex, which will expire unused credits at the end of each month. Basically, the decision should come down to whether consumers think they will be able to take advantage of credits and how savvy they will be about redeeming their points, McQuay says.

That jump was at least in part due to apparent excitement over President Donald Trump’s more moderate tone in his address to Congress on Tuesday night. But less than 24 hours later, investor sentiment was chilled by more “Russian influence” headlines for the Trump White House and increasingly hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve ahead of a speech by Chair Janet Yellen on Friday. Other headwinds include a rapid marking down of first-quarter GDP growth expectations, tepid earnings growth and very extended sentiment measures. Investors would do well to use this opportunity to cautiously consider trimming their exposure, rebalancing out of relatively expensive stocks. Play Video CBS This Morning Trump to zero in on economy, security in first Congress speech President Trump will speak to a joint session of Congress Tuesday for the first time, laying out his legislative priorities for the year to come.... Instead, mom-and-pop investors seem to be doing the exact opposite: A recent report by JPMorgan shows retail investors have poured more than $80 billion into “passive” index funds while institutional investors are backing away. Here are three good reasons to be nervous. First, the Fed is suddenly making very hawkish noises heading into the March policy meeting in less than two weeks. Futures market odds of another quarter-point hike have pushed above 90 percent, well more than the threshold that triggered rate hikes in December 2015 and December 2016.  Consider this collection of comments this week sharing a common theme that more rate hikes are needed soon: New York Fed President William Dudley said the case for tightening had become a lot more compelling. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said he expects a rate hike to receive a “serious consideration” at the March policy meeting. Fed Governor Lael Brainard, one of the most dovish Fed policymakers, said continued removal of policy accommodation was likely to be appropriate soon. She cited positive momentum in incoming data, evidence of a labor market near full employment and rising inflation pressures. And Fed Governor Jerome Powell told CNBC that the case for a March rate hike had “come together,” while reiterating his expectations for three rate hikes in 2017. A more aggressive pace of rate hikes is a huge change in the monetary policy stance that, frankly, isn’t getting the attention it deserves. Consider that the Fed has raised interest rates only twice in the last 10 years, but it’s poised to accelerate that to two hikes in just three months. Play Video CBS Evening News What's behind the stock market's Trump rally A new CBS News poll found that 61 percent of Americans believe the economy is in good shape, the highest number since the Great Recession. A surg... Second, GDP growth expectations are actually moving lower, in sharp contrast to the post-election triumphalism about deregulation, tax cuts and more stimulus from Mr. Trump. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow real-time estimate of first-quarter growth has fallen to just 1.7 percent.  As for earnings, while analysts are looking for S&P 500 profits to grow 9.8 percent in 2017, an aggressive market rally has pushed the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio to 17.9 vs. a 10-year average of 14.4. Third, turning back to Mr. Trump, Wall Street is cooling to hopes that proposed tax cuts and other reforms will be forthcoming. Goldman Sachs has warned taxes are increasingly a story for 2018, not 2017.  UBS strategist Yianos Kontopoulos, in a recent note to clients, warned amid rising complacency that “the market is learning that new U.S. policy initiatives may also be slower to come.” While he doesn’t believe this could necessarily lead to a sell-off, he thinks the “upside in stocks may be moderate” and investors should consider adding some long-term bond holdings to rebalance their risk profile. Wells Fargo strategist Paul Christopher noted that while the president’s “sweeping and conciliatory” speech was well received on Tuesday, a lack of clear policy guidance from the White House means “Congress may struggle with divisions over crucial decisions.” Witness internal stifle within the GOP over plans to reform health care. Amid tepid economic growth and policy tightening from the Fed, investors may realize their enthusiasm went a little too far as Mr. Trump’s economic initiatives get bogged down by typical Washington gridlock.   © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc..

Alts Equities Smart-Beta New ETFs ETF Ecosystem Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel 2017 Outlook Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2017 → March → Bank ETFs are Raking in New Assets as Sector Soars Bank ETFs are Raking in New Assets as Sector Soars March 3, 2017 at 9:00 am by Tom Lydon Big financial services exchange traded funds are getting bigger as investors flock to these ETFs as the sector continues soaring. The Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLF), the largest financial services exchange traded fund, iShares U.S. Financials ETF (NYSEArca: IYF) and Vanguard Financials ETF (NYSEArca: VFH) are gathering assets at a rapid pace as the second-largest sector weight in the S&P 500 ascends to its highest levels in about a decade. “This year, investors have poured a combined $2.4 billion into three exchange-traded funds focused on banks — State Street Corp.’s Financial Select Sector SPDR fund, ticker XLF, BlackRock Inc.’s iShares U.S. Financials ETF, ticker IYF, and the Vanguard Financials ETF, ticker VFH — as a bet that the firms will benefit from Trump’s deregulation policies. The funds’ top holdings are global lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co.,” reports Carolina Wilson for Bloomberg. The Trump administration’s expansionary policies would be especially beneficial for banks since the segment is sensitive to the overall economy. Moreover, the expansionary policies have fueled bets of increased Federal Reserve interest rate hikes to rein in a potentially overheating economy and rising inflation, which further supports lending revenue and their bottom line among bankers and insurers. For target exposure to banks, the First Trust NASDAQ ABA Community Bank Index Fund (NasdaqGM: QABA), PowerShares S&P SmallCap Financials Portfolio (NYSEArca: PSCF) and PowerShares KBW Regional Bank Portfolio (NYSEArca: KBWR) include large tilts toward small- and micro-cap bank stocks. Bank ETFs are benefiting from speculation that the Federal Reserve will boost interest rates multiple times this year. With a steepening yield curve or wider spread between short- and long-term Treasuries, banks could experience improved net interest margins or improved profitability as the firms borrow short and lend long. XLF is coming off one of its best annual performances since the global financial crisis. While the financial services sector, the second-largest sector allocation in the S&P 500, has some doubters after last year’s impressive rally, some market observers believe the sector can keep tracking higher this year. “Strong fundamentals are also helping to drive finance firms higher. Banks posted a 5 percent increase in profits in 2016, according to a recent report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Financials have been the best performing industry in the S&P 500 over the past 12 months, rising more than 42 percent, and were leading the market higher on Wednesday following Trump’s speech before Congress,” according to Bloomberg.

The February 15 short interest data have been compared with the previous figures, and short interest in the selected cybersecurity stocks mostly increased. FireEye Inc. (NASDAQ: FEYE) saw its short interest increase to 25.01 million shares from the previous reading of 23.70 million. Shares were last seen at $11.31, in a 52-week trading range of $10.60 to $19.63.

Shares were trading at $98.72, in a 52-week range of $74.34 to $101.77. The number of Palo Alto Networks Inc.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 March 2017 by Military News Foresight Solar Fund Limited : Initial Placing, Offer for Subscription, Introduction of Placing Programme, South African Secondary Listing and Private Placement, and Net Asset Value Update THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, INCLUDING THE APPENDIX, IS RESTRICTED AND IS NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO U.S. PERSONS, OR IN OR INTO, THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN OR INTO ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO MIGHT CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OR BREACH OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW. PLEASE SEE THE IMPORTANT NOTICE AT THE END OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO CONTAIN INSIDE INFORMATION. This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for, or to buy shares in any jurisdiction. This announcement is an advertisement and not a prospectus.  Any investment in any shares referred to in this announcement may be made only on the basis of information in a prospectus to be published by Foresight Solar Fund Limited on or around 3 March 2017, in connection with an initial placing, offer for subscription, private placement and a placing programme of ordinary shares of no par value each, to be admitted to the premium listing segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority and to trading on the Main Market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange plc (“the Prospectus“).  3 March 2017   Foresight Solar Fund Limited Initial Placing, Offer for Subscription, Introduction of Placing Programme, South African Secondary Listing and Private Placement, and Net Asset Value Update   The Board of Foresight Solar Fund Limited (the “Company“) is pleased to announce its intention to raise in excess of £50 million by way of an Initial Placing and Offer for Subscription (the “Initial Placing and Offer“) and a secondary listing (“Secondary Listing“) on the main board of the securities exchange operated by the JSE Limited (“JSE“) and Private Placement in South Africa (the “Private Placement“) of new Ordinary Shares (“New Shares“) (together the “Initial Issues“). The Board of the Company is also pleased to announce its intention to implement a Placing Programme in relation to up to 250 million New Shares less any New Shares issued under the Initial Issues. The Initial Issues and the Placing Programme are together known as the “Issues“.   A prospectus in relation to the Issues and a pre-listing announcement in relation to the Secondary Listing and Private Placement are expected to be published shortly.    The Company also announces its unaudited NAV as at 23 February 2017 of £360 million, resulting in a NAV per share of 105.6 pence (31 December 2016: 102.9 pence). For the avoidance of doubt, this includes the impact of the acquisition of Shotwick and Sandridge announced in February 2017. The Company’s equity discount rate used to value its assets remains unchanged at 7.5% and the methodology for calculating the NAV remains consistent with that used to calculate the 31 December 2016 NAV.   Rationale for the Issues   The Board believes that the UK solar market remains attractive, particularly given the recent recovery in wholesale power prices. Furthermore, the Company and Foresight Group CI Limited (the “Investment Manager“) continue to see attractive investment opportunities in both the primary and secondary UK solar market and wish to be in a position to take advantage of these opportunities as and when they arise. The recent acquisitions of the Shotwick and Sandridge solar plants, which represent the Company’s two largest acquisitions to date, are evidence of the attractive investment opportunities available in the market, which the Investment Manager has been able to source.   The Investment Manager is currently evaluating an investment pipeline of operational UK based solar power plants representing an installed capacity of approximately 250MW.   To date, the Company has used the net proceeds from its equity fundraisings and its Bank Facilities to acquire 18 ground based solar power plants. All of these assets are fully operational and have received accreditation under the RO scheme. The Portfolio has a total operational capacity of approximately 470 MW. Following the recent acquisitions of Shotwick and Sandridge, the Company has drawn down, in aggregate, £255 million under its Bank Facilities (£160 million under its Term Loan Facilities and £95 million under its Revolving Credit Facilities).   The Board has therefore been discussing with its advisers a proposal to raise additional equity by means of the issue of up to 250 million New Shares in aggregate over the following twelve months.   It is currently intended that the net proceeds of the Initial Issues will be used, in the first instance, to repay the Revolving Credit Facilities either in full or in part. The Group may then draw down again under the Revolving Credit Facilities or it may use any remaining net proceeds to invest in or commit to further ground based solar power plants in accordance with the Company’s investment policy.   Any proceeds raised under the Placing Programme will be used to take advantage of investment opportunities in accordance with the Company’s investment policy and/or to repay debt.   Rationale for the Secondary Listing and Private Placement in South Africa   The success of the South African Renewable Energy Program has created a sophisticated understanding and appreciation of solar and other renewable energy assets in South Africa, and interest in the Company.  Due to South African exchange control regulations, South African investors’ ability to invest and hold shares outside of South Africa is restricted in terms of size.  In order to facilitate participation by South African investors in the Issues, the Company has applied and has been granted approval by the Financial Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank for an inward listing of the Company on the JSE and a Private Placement of New Shares to Qualifying South African Investors.  The inward listed shares will be classified as domestic investment on the JSE and will allow South African investors the opportunity to invest in the Company on an unrestricted basis.  The Company believes that the Secondary Listing and Private Placement will: improve the depth and spread of the shareholder base of the Company which should, as a result improve the liquidity and tradability of the Ordinary Shares; provide the Company with access to a wider pool of international capital; and provide the Company with an additional platform to raise equity funding to pursue growth and investment opportunities in the future. Following the Secondary Listing and Private Placement, the Ordinary Shares will be fully transferrable between the UK and South African share registers.  Rand Merchant Bank, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited (“RMB“), has been appointed by the Company as South African Bookrunner and JSE Sponsor for the Secondary Listing and Private Placement.    The Initial Issues   The Initial Placing and Offer is being conducted, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, through a bookbuild process which will be launched immediately following this announcement.  Stifel Nicolaus Europe Limited (“Stifel“) is acting as sponsor and joint bookrunner in connection with the Initial Placing and Offer and Placing Programme and J.P. Morgan Securities plc, which carries on its UK investment banking activities as J.P. Morgan Cazenove (“J.P. Morgan Cazenove“), is acting as joint bookrunner in connection with the Initial Placing and Offer and Placing Programme.   The Offer for Subscription is being made in the UK only. The public generally (unless they are located or resident outside the UK) may apply for New Shares through the Offer for Subscription.   The price at which the New Shares will be issued pursuant to the Initial Placing and Offer (“Initial Placing and Offer Price“) will be equal to the NAV per Share on 23 February 2017 plus a premium as determined by the Board and is expected to be announced via RIS on or around 14 March 2017.   The price at which the New Shares will be issued pursuant to the Private Placement (“Private Placement Price“) will be equal to the ZAR equivalent of the Initial Placing and Offer Price determined based on the ZAR/GBP spot rate at the closing of the Private Placement (as quoted on Bloomberg).  The Private Placement Price will be announced by the Company through SENS on 29 March 2017.   The total number of New Shares issued under the Initial Issues will be determined by the Company, Stifel, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and RMB. The Board has reserved the right, in consultation with Stifel, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and RMB, to increase the number of New Shares offered pursuant to the Initial Placing and Offer and the Private Placement to up to the maximum amount for which the Board is seeking shareholder authority pursuant to the Issues, being 250 million New Shares.   The New Shares will be entitled to receive the interim dividend of 1.55p per Ordinary Share in respect of the period from 1 October 2016 to 31 December 2016 which will be paid on 5 May 2017 provided the holders of the New Shares are on the Register on 7 April 2017.   Extraordinary General Meeting   The Issues are subject to Shareholder approval to be sought at an extraordinary general meeting (“EGM“) to be held at 4:30pm on 22 March 2017 at Elizabeth House, 9 Castle Street, St. Helier, Jersey JE4 2QP. A circular and notice of EGM (the “Circular“) to approve, amongst other proposals, the issue of the New Shares without having to first offer those New Shares to existing Shareholders, and to approve by ordinary resolution the Related Party Transaction that may arise if any of BlackRock, Inc. and its Associates, including funds controlled by it or any of them wish to take part in the Issues, are expected to be posted shortly.   Words and expressions that are defined in the Prospectus and the Circular shall have the same meaning where they are used in this announcement, except where the context requires otherwise.   Timetable   The expected timetable for the Issues is as follows:   Event Date Initial Placing and Offer   Initial Placing and Offer opens 3 March 2017 Initial Placing and Offer Price Announced 14 March 2017 Latest time and date for return of Forms of Proxy for the General Meeting 4.30 p.m. on 20 March 2017 General Meeting 4.30 p.m. on 22 March 2017 Results of General Meeting 22 March 2017 Latest time and date for receipt of Application Forms under the Offer 11 a.m. on 28 March 2017 Latest time and date for commitments under the Initial Placing 11 a.m. on 29 March 2017 Results of Initial Placing and  Offer announced  29 March 2017 Admission and dealings in New Shares on the Main Market of the LSE commence 8.00 a.m. on 31 March 2017 Crediting of CREST accounts in respect of the New Shares 31 March 2017 Share certificates in respect of New Shares despatched (if applicable) on or around 10 April 2017 Secondary Listing and Private Placement   Publication of the Pre-listing Announcement on SENS in South Africa 3 March 2017 JSE Private Placement opens 3 March 2017 Publication of the Pre-listing Announcement in the South African press 6 March 2017 Latest time and date for commitments under the Private Placement  12 p.m. (SAST) on 29 March 2017 JSE Private Placement closes 12 p.m. (SAST) on 29 March 2017 JSE Private Placement Price announced 29 March 2017 Results of the Private Placement released on SENS in South Africa 29 March 2017 Notification of allotments 29 March 2017 Anticipated Secondary Listing Date and commencement of trading on the Main Board of the JSE 8.00 a.m. (SAST) on 3 April 2017 Accounts at CSDPs or brokers updated and accounts debited in respect of the Private Placement Shares at the commencement of trade 3 April 2017 Placing Programme   Placing Programme opens 4 April 2017 Publication of Placing Programme Price in respect of each Issue At the time of each Issue Admission and dealings in New Shares commence 8.00 a.m. on each day New Shares are issued Crediting of CREST in respect of New Shares 8.00 a.m. on each day New Shares are issued Share certificates in respect of New Shares despatched (if applicable) Approximately one week following the issue of any New Shares Last date for New Shares to be issued under the Placing Programme 2 March 2018 The dates and times specified above and mentioned throughout this document are subject to change.

With the fourth-quarter earnings season drawing to a close, Stoxx Europe 600 Index members have recorded an 11 percent rise in profits from a year earlier -- the strongest in two years -- versus a 5 percent growth in S&P 500 companies, according to data from JPMorgan Chase & Co. Among factors seen boosting them further in 2017 are a weaker euro, rising commodity prices and a recovery in the previously battered banking sector. Europe’s long-awaited earnings rebound should continue this year as key sectors such as banks and basic resources recover and data signal an acceleration in the economy, according to Emmanuel Cau, an equity strategist at JPMorgan. “The base is low, as euro-zone earnings are still depressed in the historical context,” he said by phone. “Financials’ earnings have been a significant drag on the overall market earnings over the last few years, but they are starting to rebound. Banks have seen more net upgrades than the overall market over the last three months, as bond yields rebounded and credit growth accelerated.” The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up There are signs the robust results from the fourth quarter herald better times ahead. Earnings forecasts are in fact improving following actual reports, breaking the typical pattern of downgrades seen at such times, according to JPMorgan data. Since the start of the year, estimates for European profits have increased by 1 percent, led by upgrades to cyclical shares including miners. By contrast, forecasters have cut predictions for U.S. earnings by 1.7 percent in the same period. There are other positive indications as well. The ratio of the number of European stocks that have seen upgrades in consensus earnings estimates over the past three months versus those that have seen downgrades stands at 1.02, according to strategists at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Anything above parity is historically a strong signal for the region’s equities, they wrote in a Feb. 28 note. Lack of earnings growth over the past years in Europe has been the main reason behind European stocks trailing the performance of Wall Street peers, Barclays equity strategists including Dennis Jose wrote in a Feb. 27 note. That has continued so far in 2017, with the Stoxx 600 up 3.6 percent versus a 6.4 percent rally in the S&P 500. “European companies have failed to grow earnings for nearly seven years now at a time when U.S. earnings have accelerated to prior-cycle highs,” the strategists wrote, saying that companies have struggled to raise their prices given the lack of inflation, which has hit margins. “If inflation picks up, we think pricing should improve, thereby driving an increase in European profit margins.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

A central bank official said at the end of last year that China will create conditions for the inclusion of yuan debt in global indexes. BlackRock Inc. has said inclusion could be announced in 2017, and that the firm has hired for credit research in the nation. Invesco Ltd. says such a development may come in the next 12 months, and also aims to expand in the country. Adding Chinese notes to global indexes including those from Bloomberg Barclays, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. would bring cash into the nation from yield-hungry investors from New York to Tokyo. Managers of that wealth will need to navigate rising defaults and local ratings that many have questioned. Investment firms also want to sell more products to a growing legion of wealthy Chinese investors, after greater market access was allowed. “We are seeing increased interest among global asset managers to develop an investment capability for the onshore Chinese bond market,” said Nick Aylwin-Foster, who runs headhunting firm Sheffield Haworth’s asset management practice for Asia. “Within fixed income, hiring is primarily into the credit research teams.” Read more: Getting ready for China’s entry into global bond indexes BlackRock has hired a couple of people in Shanghai who focus on credit research in the domestic bond market, according to Gregor Carle, head of Asia-Pacific fixed income product strategy. Expanding Presence “We continue to build that coverage because we see this greater opportunity set coming out of China, and of course, the potential index inclusion that’s further down the line,” he said. Fidelity International is building out its investment team in Shanghai, Jackson Lee, country head for China, said in January. A spokeswoman for the money manager said there is no update to that plan. Amid shifting regulations and hiring challenges, many funds are still deciding on such a move. They must weigh downsides that include “a gap between when you commit to a new market and when you actually start seeing returns,” according to Aylwin-Foster at Sheffield Haworth. Timing on index inclusion is also uncertain. Joining global debt indexes isn’t a priority at this stage and the nation is in no rush for its shares to enter the MSCI Inc.’s benchmark indexes, Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said in January. The People’s Bank of China and other departments will work to improve rules to give foreign investors easier access to the interbank bond market and create conditions for the inclusion of yuan debt in global indexes, Ma Jun, chief economist of the PBOC’s research bureau, said in December. Still, China presents a unique opportunity for fixed-income fund managers. Foreign holdings account for only about 1.4 percent of the nation’s interbank bond market, making it “one of the most untapped opportunities” in global asset management, according to Nicholas Britz, senior associate at Shanghai-based consulting firm Z-Ben Advisors. Fidelity International said in January that its wholly foreign-owned enterprise in Shanghai became the first global asset manager to register with the Asset Management Association of China as a private fund management company. The qualification allows the firm to create onshore investment products for Chinese institutional and high-net-worth investors for the first time, it said in a statement.

Sign Up Andrew Lo, chief executive officer at Invesco Asia-Pacific, said in an email interview that the firm has plans for its own wholly foreign-owned enterprise and aims to register it with AMAC to become a private fund management company. “The WFOE will provide on-the-ground support to our Hong Kong-based Greater China investment team that is offering Chinese investment products to global investors,” said Lo.  Invesco already has a joint venture with Chinese partners including Great Wall Securities Co. and Lo added that the firm is “very committed” to expand its presence in the country. He said he sees “growing demand” from Chinese institutions to diversify fund managers and investment strategies. “The game of managing renminbi fixed income is very much moving to the onshore market,” said Britz at Z-Ben Advisors. “Assuming you can build out an effective renminbi credit team, you’ll definitely be pulling ahead of your global rivals.” Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, owns the former Barclays Risk Analytics and Index Solutions business, including the benchmark indexes, which have been co-branded as “Bloomberg Barclays” indexes. Bloomberg Barclays overhauled its China fixed-income gauges and started a Global Aggregate + China index on March 1, while stopping short of adding the nation to major benchmark indexes Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

 After interviewing more than 50 of Wall Street's best investors, Tony Robbins found the best investing advice for average people is remarkably simple Richard Feloni Mar. 2, 2017, 5:42 PM 29,330 facebook linkedin twitter email print Performance coach Tony Robbins. Sarah Jacobs Tony Robbins, the performance coach best known for his high-energy speeches, has made a crusade of spreading personal finance education the past couple of years. He has conducted interviews with 50 of the top investors in the United States, including Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, and JP Morgan Asset Management CEO Mary Callahan Erdoes. Robbins recently came by Business Insider's New York office for a Facebook Live Q&A where he discussed his latest book based on these interviews, "Unshakeable," a much slimmer version of his 2014 book "Money: Master the Game," with additional insights from Peter Mallouk, who was rated the No. 1 wealth adviser in the US by Barron's three times, and who brought Robbins into his firm Creative Planning in 2016. Robbins told the audience that while all of his interviews with brilliant investors explored different strategies the average person could use, the most important advice he could offer was remarkably simple. He said that Bogle told him, "Tony, the secret is do nothing. Just stand there." That is, invest your money and make use of compound interest, the interest that accrues on top of the principal and interest from previous periods. "People don't invest because they're afraid of losing," Robbins said. "They're afraid of losing because they see corrections or crashes or imagine them coming." But the bottom line is while over time, the market will see many peaks and valleys — sometimes wild moves — the trend for the last 200 years is that the overall market continues to grow over the long term thanks to inflation, productivity, and population growth. Robbins cited a study from the Charles Schwab Corporation that took into account four hypothetical investors investing $2,000 annually over a 20-year period. It found that starting to invest early is more effective in the long term than saving in cash, and more effective than trying to "time the market," or pull your funds in and out as it swells and dips. Charles Schwab The study clearly showed that even an investor who started investing in a mutual fund in a bear market made significantly more money than the investor who kept all of their money in cash. So, as Robbins said, even if you're afraid that the market will crash tomorrow, you're still better off investing your money rather than keeping it in savings account where it will accrue a minuscule amount of interest. That doesn't mean you shouldn't have any cash — Robbins says you should have an emergency cash fund that covers at least three months' salary, and you shouldn't start investing until you have that money set aside. Robbins and Mallouk go into detail in "Unshakeable" about how to consider diversifying your investments, but say anyone should consider investing in an index fund, which allocates money across companies in an index, essentially giving you representative ownership of that market — which, again, will grow over time regardless of short-term performance. Warren Buffett, in his latest letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, announced that he was on his way to winning this year the $1 million bet he made in 2007: that his investment in an S&P 500 index fund would outperform five hedge funds over a decade. Robbins asked Buffett a few years ago how he amassed a net worth of around $60 billion at the time (now estimated at around $78 billion). Buffett smiled and told him, "Three things: Living in America for the great opportunities, having good genes so I lived a long time, and compound interest."

Houston's year-over-year consumer spending growth dropped 3.3 percent in November 2016. Photo: Marie D. De Jesus, Staff Houston consumer spending down in November 2016 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Houston's year-over-year consumer spending dropped 3.3 percent in November 2016, according to JPMorgan Chase Institute's Local Consumer Commerce Index released Thursday. That year-over-year drop is greater than October's decline of 2.9 percent, but it is smaller than the August 2016 decline of 6.1 percent. RELATED: Houston consumer spending growth down in October 2016 Overall, consumer spending across the 15 cities analyzed declined by 0.1 percent in November. And nine of the 15 U.S. cities analyzed had higher year-over-year consumer spending rates in November than October. "While we are still seeing an overall contraction in year-over-year local commerce growth, it's encouraging to see the magnitude of these contractions decreasing over time," Diana Farrell, president and CEO of the JPMorgan Chase Institute, said in the news release. "Many changes contributed to this positive trajectory including notably strong growth in spending at small businesses but also a rare, if small, increase in fuel spending growth."

 JPMorgan's traders made $80 million a day in 2016 Matt Turner Feb. 28, 2017, 11:39 AM 21,614 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan had a perfect year in trading in 2016.

JPMorgan generated around $21 billion in fixed income and equity sales and trading revenues in 2016. Market volatility was broadly flat, meanwhile. Pinto said in his presentation that the bank spends a lot of time discussing the appropriate level of risk it should run.

The company originally priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $17 per share, above the expected price range of $14 to $16 per share. However, the stock actually entered the market at $23.50.

The company calls each of those short videos or images a Snap. On average, 158 million people use Snapchat daily, and over 2.5 billion Snaps are created every day. On average, more than 60% of daily active users (DAUs) use the chat service every day to send Snaps and talk with friends. Snap benefits from the frequency with which its user base communicates with one another because each message invites a user back to the application when they receive a push notification. On average, DAUs visit Snapchat more than 18 times each day. Snap detailed its finances in its filing: Worldwide advertising spend is expected to grow from $652 billion in 2016 to $767 billion in 2020. The fastest growing segment is mobile advertising, which is expected to grow nearly 3x from $66 billion in 2016 to $196 billion in 2020. We believe that one of the major factors driving this growth is the shift of people’s attention from their televisions to their mobile phones. This trend is particularly pronounced among the younger demographic, where our Daily Active Users tend to be concentrated. According to Nielsen, people between the ages of 18 and 24 spent 35% less time watching traditional (live and time-shifted) television in an average month during the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2010. The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. The firm may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. However, it does not have agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions at this time. Shares of Snap were last seen up nearly 50% at $25.32, with a range of $23.50 to $25.42 as of midday. Also over 111 million shares had moved on the day.

With financial markets trying to anticipate which parts of the economy will thrive under President Donald Trump, investors have targeted at least one area -- finance. This year, investors have poured a combined $2.4 billion into three exchange-traded funds focused on banks -- State Street Corp.’s Financial Select Sector SPDR fund, ticker XLF, BlackRock Inc.’s iShares U.S. Financials ETF, ticker IYF, and the Vanguard Financials ETF, ticker VFH -- as a bet that the firms will benefit from Trump’s deregulation policies. The funds’ top holdings are global lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co., according to Bloomberg data. Strong fundamentals are also helping to drive finance firms higher. Banks posted a 5 percent increase in profits in 2016, according to a recent report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Financials have been the best performing industry in the S&P 500 over the past 12 months, rising more than 42 percent, and were leading the market higher on Wednesday following Trump’s speech before Congress. Still, despite the run-up in finance stocks, investors need to look carefully at the funds they buy to make sure they’re getting the right exposure to the industry, Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual funds at CFRA, said. “I think investors are often choosing the product based on the name and the cost and not looking at the underlying holdings,” Rosenbluth said. For example, 29 percent of XLF’s portfolio is in insurance companies and asset managers such as BlackRock Inc., while 20 percent of IYF is in real estate investment trusts, Bloomberg data show. “The performance of that product is definitely going to be different because it has REITs,” Rosenbluth said. The lack of due diligence by investors may be one reason why the $3.35 billion SPDR S&P Bank ETF, ticker KBE, is seeing outflows this year even though it offers better exposure to large-cap banks than several competing funds that have added hundreds of millions, according to Sebastian Mercado, an ETF strategist at Deutsche Bank AG.

The Labor Department says unemployment claims dropped by 19,000 from 242,000 the previous week, Thursday, March 2, 2017, to the lowest level since March 1973 when President Richard Nixon was in the White House. The less volatile four-week average fell by 6,250 to 234,250, lowest since April 1973. (AP Photo/Alan Diaz, File) comments In another sign of a tightening labor market, the number of Americans filing initial unemployment insurance claims fell to a 44-year low last week. First-time jobless claims, a reliable gauge of layoffs, fell 19,000 to 223,000 in the week ending February 25, the lowest level since March 1973, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists expected a slight rise to 245,000. The President’s Day holiday can lead to volatile claims totals, says economist Daniel Silver of JPMorgan Chase. But the four-week moving average, which tends to smooth out volatility, dropped 6,250 to 234,250, lowest since April 1973.  “The data are unambiguous evidence that the labor market in the U.S. continues to tighten,” Barclays economist Rob Martin wrote in a note to clients. “Workers are not being laid off in large numbers.” Making the four-decade low even more impressive is that the population has grown about 50% since the early 1970s, Silver wrote in a research note. With the unemployment rate near a 10-year low at 4.8%, many employers are struggling to find workers and are reluctant to lose the ones they have. Employers added a better-than-expected 227,000 jobs in January and many economists expect next week’s payroll report for February to record another 200,000-plus gain.

And the US media, for its part, entered a phase that might be described as "learning to love the Donald." Almost universally, the major media outlets -- many of which were denounced only last week by Trump as "the enemies of the people" -- presented Trump's speech as a tour de force, a truly "presidential" address that marked a "pivot" for his administration. Trump's language and tone in the address were interpreted as a signal that he is serious about getting Congressional approval for his right-wing, pro-corporate measures, that he will not let factional infighting get in the way of showering Wall Street with riches. The stock markets followed suit, with the Dow-Jones Industrial Average rising more than 300 points Wednesday to end above 21,000 for the first time ever. Financial stocks led the rally, with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup up more than 3 percent in one day. ExxonMobil and Boeing gained more than 2 percent, as did American Express and Travelers. The broader S&P 500 index, the Nasdaq Composite Index of mainly tech stocks, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller firms all closed at record levels. As Trump boasted in his speech, since his election victory last November 8, the Dow has soared nearly 3,000 points, as part of a stock market boom that has added an estimated $3 trillion in value to the shares of American banks and corporations. Wall Street had plenty to celebrate even before the speech in which Trump laid out his pro-corporate agenda. The first six weeks of the Trump administration have featured a series of executive orders loosening regulations on corporate polluters, particularly in the fossil fuel industries, and on banks, hedge funds and other swindlers whose operations led to the 2008 financial crash. Trump has reiterated his support for major tax cuts for US corporations and for wealthy individuals. He has also pledged a major increase in military spending that will benefit the giant defense contractors and an infrastructure program to funnel hundreds of billions into the coffers of private construction companies and manufacturers like Caterpillar. - Advertisement - These themes were spelled out in Trump's address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, to general enthusiasm from Republicans, near-universal praise from the media and significant backing from congressional Democrats. Trump also pledged to wage war against public education, intensify the brutal assault on immigrant workers, slash social programs and otherwise further redistribute wealth to the financial aristocracy. For the media, the consensus reaction to the speech appeared fully-formed within seconds of the end of the speech. On CNN, one of several outlets deliberately barred from a briefing at the White House by press secretary Sean Spicer last week, every panelist declared the speech at least a relative success. Van Jones, a former Obama White House aide and Bernie Sanders supporter, declared that Trump's crass exploitation of the death of Navy SEAL William Owens, in the closing section of his speech, was "one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics, period" and that it was the moment Trump "became president of the United States." This was only the most grotesque prostration before Trump on the part of the media. The Democratic response to Trump, both in the hall and afterwards, spoke volumes about the reactionary and politically bankrupt character of the so-called opposition party. Senator after senator applauded the speech: Bernie Sanders clapped for Trump's profession of economic nationalism; Tammie Baldwin cheered his reference to Harley-Davison motorcycles, built in her state; Debbie Stabenow applauded his support for the auto industry; Amy Klobuchar praised his pledge to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. Wall Street watched it all, and liked what it saw. The stock exchange has long known it can count on Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer -- the biggest single recipient of Wall Street campaign contributions. The newly cooperative "tone" struck by Trump, and responded to in kind by the Democrats, is of greatest importance to finance capital, since some of most important policy changes promised by Trump, especially tax cuts for business and the wealthy, require significant Democratic support. - Advertisement - Divisions remain within the ruling class, centered on foreign policy. In its editorial commenting on the speech, the New York Times, a mouthpiece for the Democratic Party, focused criticism on Trump's failure to spell out a policy "to deal with an increasingly aggressive Russia, which the Pentagon considers America's No. 1 threat, or China, which has become more assertive in the South China Sea." The newspaper brought up again what it called Trump's "murky ties to Russia" to explain what dominant sections of the military-intelligence apparatus consider to be an overly accommodative attitude toward Putin. Yet the dominant tone, including from the Times, was one of celebration of what unites the ruling class. The perspective of the financial aristocracy is that the twentieth century was one big mistake. Corporate America was compelled to make concessions to working people, because of fears provoked first by the Russian Revolution of 1917, then by the upsurge of the labor movement in the 1930s, and the extended struggles for civil rights and social gains in the 1960s. All this is to be taken back, in a rampage of reaction in which the watchword is that American corporations can do whatever they want. Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad. The American financial aristocracy is gripped by the delusion that they can roll back history without paying any price, counting on the role of the Democratic Party, the trade unions, and other instruments for the disorganization and disorientation of the working class.

Investing Tools Jeff Engel March 1st, 2017 @JeffEngelXcon @xconomy Like Us Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LinkedIn Email Reprints As artificial intelligence begins creeping into virtually every industry, it makes sense that Wall Street would be one of the first places where it makes an impact—there’s a ton of data to crunch, and money to be made if software can help make better decisions more quickly. Kensho Technologies is one of the startups gaining traction with A.I. technologies for the finance sector. And Wall Street is pouring a lot of money into the Boston-area company. Kensho has raised $50 million in a Series B round that values the startup at more than $500 million, according to reports by Forbes and the Boston Business Journal. The round was led by S&P Global, which also announced a partnership with Kensho that involves collaborating on products. Other investors in the round reportedly include six big banks: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo. Kensho previously raised at least $47.8 million in equity funding, SEC filings show. The startup was founded by Daniel Nadler (its CEO) in 2013, while he was pursuing a PhD at Harvard University. Kensho’s staff includes veterans of Apple, Google, Facebook, and academia, according to the company’s website. Kensho says its machine learning software can comb through huge amounts of data to find correlations between world events and the resulting effects on publicly traded stocks and other financial assets. The company’s first product was an intelligent virtual assistant dubbed Warren, which was designed to enable investors to perform research using natural-language queries. For example, “What happens to the share prices of energy companies when oil trades above $100 a barrel and political unrest has recently occurred in the Middle East?” The idea was to create a Siri for finance professionals. Kensho has dropped the name “Warren” in its marketing materials, but it still offers “user-friendly analytics platforms and tools,” as well as products that help customers visualize data. The startup is profitable, Nadler told Forbes. Kensho says its customers include big global banks and investment firms. Its website also lists a national security division, although visitors can’t click through to find more information. Kensho employs around 80 people, 50 of whom are based in its Cambridge, MA, office, the Business Journal reported. Kensho also has offices in New York and just outside of Washington, DC. Plenty of startups are developing A.I. products for the financial industry. Clinc, a University of Michigan spinout, has created something similar to Kensho’s Warren, but for consumers. Clinc’s Finie is a voice-controlled, automated personal financial assistant that can perform banking tasks and provide financial insights based on info from a user’s bank account. Back in Boston, Cinch Financial is developing A.I.-related tools to help people make smarter financial decisions. And Quantopian’s software enables people to develop and test algorithms aimed at making better investment choices than humans. Jeff Engel is a senior editor at Xconomy.

"It has fortified its position as a premier B-School with the successful completion of the placement season for its largest batch size till date in the flagship Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGPM)," IIM-Shillong Officer (Placement and PR) Merlvin J. Mukhim said. With its consistent performance this season, the Institute recorded a median CTC (cost to company) of 14 LPA (lakh per annum) whereas the highest domestic CTC stood at 24 LPA, he said. Noting that the recruitment drive saw 43 recruiters and 156 participants, Mukhim said: "The mean CTC for the batch was Rs 14.18 LPA. Noticeably, the mean for the top quartile of the batch stood at Rs 19 LPA and that for the top half increased to Rs 16.62 LPA." Sales and marketing continued to be the most sought after domain with 30 per cent of the total offers being made in this domain, he said. Mukhim said multiple offers were also made by prominent recruiters such as Dabur, IDEA Cellular, Kohler, Piramal Enterprises, TATA Steel, Titan, GSK Pharmaceuticals, Coffee Day Beverages, and TATA Motors to name a few. "The season recorded an increase in the number of finance roles with noteworthy companies such as Yes Bank, ICICI Bank, RBL Bank, JP Morgan Chase & Co., HSBC, Fidelity Management Research, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, SBI Bank and SBI Capital Markets offering roles to 25 per cent of the candidates," the official said. Consulting emerged as the highest paying domain, with candidates grossing an average CTC of Rs 17 lakh per annum for offers from Deloitte (Strategy & Operations), Cognizant Business Consulting and Stellium Consulting among others. Mukhim said the highest CTC of the season was offered in the Strategy & General Management domain. Other than the regular recruiters such as Mahindra GMC and TATA Steel, companies such as AscendasSingbridge, GroupM and Lava International representing diverse industries also recruited for this profile. BFSI and IT & Analytics once again emerged as the two most preferred sectors with 31 per cent and 20 per cent of the students securing offers in these sectors respectively. Earlier this year, IIM Shillong completed its most successful summer placement season to date securing 185 offers with a highest stipend of Rs 2,50,000 and a significant jump of 16 per cent in the average total stipend compared to the previous year. With the institute breaking records every year, IIM Shillong continues to strengthen its position as a premier B-School in India. --IANS rrk/pgh/vt SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Go to Pakistan!

(REUTERS/Patrick Andrade) Join us on our podcast each weekday for an interesting story, well told, from Charisma News. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York is seeking permission for a $100 million mortgage on some of its valuable Manhattan property to fund its compensation program for people sexually abused by its priests, a spokesman said on Wednesday. The archdiocese said last October it would compensate people who had accused priests of abusing them as children, including those prevented by statutes of limitations from filing civil lawsuits. It said at the time it would seek loans to fund the payouts, which are being decided by two independent arbitrators. On Monday, the archdiocese filed a petition in New York state court in Manhattan seeking approval for a one-year mortgage from JPMorgan Chase on land it owns behind St. Patrick's Cathedral; the Lotte New York Palace hotel is located on the site. The petition was necessary under a New York law governing the use of church property, Joseph Zwilling, an archdiocese spokesman, said in a telephone interview. "Because we have begun the process of paying out the compensation to victims, the archdiocese has taken this short-term loan to cover the payments," Zwilling said. The archdiocese is accepting new applications from victims who had not previously come forward, and it will take out a longer-term loan once it has a clearer idea of the total compensation amount later this year, Zwilling said. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1864659899" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1864659899" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement Under the first phase of the compensation program, 144 people who had previously complained of abuse filed claims. The archdiocese has made 64 offers of compensation so far, of which 44 have been accepted, Zwilling said. He said the archdiocese would not discuss the size of the payouts until the program was completed. Most cases of abuse happened two or three decades ago. All of the accused priests are either dead or have been removed from ministry after an internal board reviewed the accusations, Zwilling said. The archdiocese is asking victims who had not previously come forward to make claims under the second phase of the program. Those victims must also make their accusations to police, Zwilling said. If any priests end up being accused for the first time, they will also be scrutinized by the internal review board, he said. The Catholic Church has grappled for years with complaints from around the world that some of its clergy sexually abused children. On Wednesday, the last remaining survivor of abuse serving on the Vatican's three-year-old Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors quit her position, blaming "shameful" resistance from church officials. © 2017 Thomson Reuters.

The new plastic provides fancy perks such as a $200 credit toward Uber rides each year, an invite to an exclusive pop-up restaurant in the Hamptons and another $200 for airline fees. "For some, platinum is a color. For us, it is a commitment," said Janey Whiteside, who leads American Express's Platinum card business. "We created the premium card category 33 years ago and now we are reimagining it." Source: American Express The card's facelift doesn't come cheap. American Express is raising its annual fee for the card from $450 to $550. It is the first annual fee increase for the card in more than a decade, and the card would have the highest fee among similar cards offered by other issuers. The move comes after JPMorgan Chase blitzed the market with its Chase Sapphire Reserve card and a huge sign-up bonus last year, only to cut that bonus in half this month. The revamped Platinum card will feel metallic, like ones provided by Chase Sapphire Reserve. "American Express is still in there swinging when it comes to high-end credit cards," said Matt Schulz, senior credit card analyst at CreditCards.com. Schulz said that the Uber offer is likely to attract millennial cardholders who may not have otherwise considered a card with such a hefty annual fee. More from Your Money Your Future: Trump wants to expand health savings accounts. Here's how they work 3 ways to invest like Warren Buffett as detailed in his annual shareholder letter The top 10 companies with the best 401(k) plans A large and growing portion of Platinum cardholders use Uber regularly, said an American Express spokeswoman. American Express has been working with Uber since June 2014. Platinum cardholders can automatically access their Uber perks without signing up for the credits. Uber itself has faced challenges in the past few weeks: A recently released video showed CEO Travis Kalanick arguing with one of the company's drivers; a former employer publicized a sexual harassment complaint; and Alphabet's self-driving car subsidiary, Waymo, sued the company over trade secrets. American Express isn't the only card issuers with an Uber partnership. Capital One has an Uber promotion for its Quicksilver cardholders. What to know before signing up Rewards cards are typically not the lowest-rate cards people with great credit can find. It's important to make sure the rewards the card offers fit with your lifestyle, Schulz said. For example, rewards cards that offer you credits for travel won't make financial sense if you're a homebody. Finally, any of the perks from a fancy credit card are quickly negated if you carry a monthly balance.

You can get our headlines via email as well, or follow us on Twitter. Borrowers are ditching traditional banks in their droves in favor of financial institutions that do not offer savings or checking accounts. According to the Washington Post, what we’re seeing is a “major shift” in mortgage borrower behavior, as the top three banks’ share of mortgage loan originations declined from 50 percent in 2011 to just 21 percent in Sept. 2016. The Washington Post defines the top three banks as JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. However, it also ranks six non-banks in its top ten list of mortgage lenders by volume, including Quicken Loans, loanDepot, and PHH Mortgage. Back in 2011, only two non-banks made it into the top ten. “For consumers, it doesn’t really matter whether you get your loan through a bank or a non-bank, although in some ways, non-banks are a little more nimble and can offer more loan products,” Paul Noring, managing director of Washington, D.C.–based financial risk management firm Navigant Consulting, told the Washington Post. “The impact is bigger on the housing market overall because without the non-banks, we would be even further behind where we should be in terms of the number of transactions.” Part of the reason is that some traditional banks have shied away from mortgages after the introduction of new financial regulations that came into force after the 2006 housing crisis. Meg Burns, managing director of Collingwood Group, told the Washington Post that the regulatory atmosphere has changed from one of risk management to one of zero-tolerance and 100 percent compliance. “Not only were new regulations implemented, but new regulators like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were created,” Burns said. “At the same time, the CFPB and other agencies became more assertive in their enforcement practices.” The new regulations made banks warier of lending, said Jeffery Taylor, managing partner of Digital Risk, a mortgage services processing firm. “Now banks only approve ‘perfect’ loans, not ‘good-enough’ loans. This created an opportunity for non-banks that focus entirely on mortgages and are less regulated than big banks,” he said. Non-banks have stepped in quickly to fill the breach, the Washington Post reports. These institutions offer more opportunities to those with less-than-stellar credit scores, though they still shy away from making risky loans.

The archdiocese is seeking a one-year mortgage from JPMorgan Chase on land across the street from St. Patrick's Cathedral, where the Lotte New York Palace Hotel now sits, according to documents filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, per Reuters. State law requires court approval before a church can mortgage its property. Archdiocese rep Joe Zwilling says "the loan would be used to cover the settlement costs" that have sprung out of the Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program, which was set up last October, reports the New York Daily News. The program seeks to compensate victims of clergy sex abuse who vow not to take their cases to court. In many cases, the statute of limitations has already expired; victims must identify themselves by age 23. A mediator says 144 people have filed claims so far—more claims are expected—and 64 settlement offers have been made, though she refused to say how much money victims were being awarded. Even so, an attorney representing one alleged victim doubts $100 million will be enough to settle all the claims. Zwilling appears to agree. He tells CBS New York that "once we know later this year what the final number will be, we will be negotiating a longer-term loan to pay out the costs of the program."   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   22% Hilarious 9% Intriguing 39% Depressing 7% Brilliant 6% Scary 17% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 45 comments You Might Like Sponsored by ZergNet Next on Newser: Flint Residents Iffy About Water Get More Bad News Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 45 comments GodSAveAmerica Mar 4, 2017 6:30 AM CST You know how MUCH monthly mortgage payment would be on a 100 million loan? Jeez. The Church needs to boot any "priest" found guilty and send them to prison. ts Mar 2, 2017 6:18 PM CST No problem. Catholics have plenty of money. If it's one thing they know how to do, it's make money. A million years ago, when I was in Catholic School ( I had a great time by the way), every so often in a blue moon, a priest would show up at the classroom door, and call a boy out. I'm starting to wonder what that was for now. We thought nothing of it at the time. I don't understand how I never got wind of this stuff in all the years I was there. Winston_Smith Mar 2, 2017 1:26 PM CST In legal terms the Catholic Church seems to be not a single organization but something more akin to a franchising operation. So far as I know McDonald's has the legal right to discipline their franchisees, but little or no legal obligation to do anything about their conduct, and I doubt that Rome did either.

Trump's big new policy promises are behind schedule, tied up in court or causing his congressional allies to cower from angry constituents who want to save the Affordable Care Act. Yet some pundits think Trump's agenda of tax cuts and deregulation caused the rally after Trump's Tuesday night speech to Congress. Getty Images The Charging Bull sculpture in the Financial District of New York City Everyone is looking to Trump — not just Trump himself, who noted the market had added $3 trillion in value since his election during the congressional address — as the stock market's chief motivator. Longtime bull Prof. Jeremy Siegel of Wharton said the speech removed any "thin ice" from the rally. But the best reasons to think the rally will continue are fairly apolitical. The Dow's last 300-point gain before Wednesday was the day before Trump's election. For apolitical bulls, the first thing to remember is that the market has been rising for a year now — not just since the election. February 2016 marked the bottom of a market panic over China, and fears of a new European recession, that pushed the S&P 500 down 15 percent since June 2015. Then it rose 16 percent before Trump's election on Nov. 8. The surge that followed last October's market lull began the day before the election, when prediction models put Trump's odds of winning at anywhere from 28 percent to as little as 1 percent. That was happening because third-quarter macroeconomic data was strengthening, leading to a strong October as well, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. The U.S. economy grew 3.5 percent in the third quarter, which ended September 30, joblessness reached 4.6 percent by November, and especially strong readings on January manufacturing sentiment and construction spending sent first-quarter growth expectations much higher. Growth was also picking up outside the United States. And global stocks have kept pace with S&P 500 gains this year. At the same time, earnings forecasts for this year were rising, as higher crude-oil prices drove estimates for energy companies to four times' 2016 profits, according to CFRA Research chief strategist Sam Stovall. "Valuations are at best fairly valued and at worst overvalued." -Sam Stovall, CFRA Research chief strategist In fact, economic data actually slowed down after the election as stocks kept moving higher, dragging fourth-quarter growth down to a 1.9 percent annual rate and the unemployment rate back up to 4.8 percent, according to government reports. Then it picked up again, with January purchasing-managers surveys that hit Feb. 1 and 2 that showed bullishness, especially in manufacturing, that wasn't fully backed up by the industrial production report Feb. 15, which shaved half a percentage point off the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank's GDPNow tracking forecast for the first quarter. Today even the Fed is giving conflicting advice. GDPNow revised downward its projection from 2.4 percent to 1.8 percent annualized growth for the first quarter, after Wednesday's personal-income report fell well short of expectations. The New York Fed's NowCast says growth will come in at a more robust 3.1 percent, but it hasn't been updated in a week. Neither forecast includes any effect from the new administration's policies, which haven't been enacted yet. To be sure, some specific sectors of the market have performed exceedingly well specifically due to Trump's election. The Financial Select Sector SPDR is up 26 percent since the election, and only 23 percent since what is called the Dimon Bottom in mid-February 2016. That is when JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon bought 500,000 of his bank's shares in a vote of confidence. But broader equity markets have rallied strongly, not just since Trump's election, but since mid-February 2016. Biggest ETFs since Nov. 9 ETF Return since Nov. 9 (%) Return since February 2016 bottom (%) SPDR S&P 500 12 28.6 Vanguard Total Stock Market 12.7 31 iShares MSCI EAFE 6.2 16.9 Vanguard Emerging Markets 3.7 32 PowerShares QQQ 12.2 34 (Source: Google Finance and XTF.com) Investor sentiment has not been this high since 1987 — two market bubbles ago. That brings up the most apolitical reason to be skeptical of the rally, according to Sam Stovall, chief market strategist at CFRA Research: Valuation. Stocks are trading at 18.4 times this year's projected profits. And the market is defying a past pattern of going through at least one 5 percent correction between each thousand-point milestone on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow made it from 19,000 to 20,000 without a setback, and made it 21,000 on Tuesday. "Valuations are at best fairly valued and at worst overvalued," Stovall said. "Yet all of the bulls justify their forecasts by saying that tax cuts are not currently included in the 10.8 percent projected rise in S&P 500 earnings for 2017. They surmise that the forecasted gain will double when tax cuts are added in." David Rubenstein, the co-founder of private equity giant Caryle Group, said Trump's tax cuts are more likely to be a 2018 event than something that gets through Congress this year. Betting on 2018 in 2017 Prospects for valuations are worsened by the rising likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at least twice this year, and maybe three times, since higher rates historically reduce the premium investors will pay for a given level of corporate earnings. The likelihood that the Fed raises in March has shot up, doubling this week from 33 percent to 66 percent. One important reason: The Consumer Price Index has risen 2.5 percent in the past year, making more investors conclude the Fed's target for core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, will soon be reached. That gain wiped out all of the 2016 average increase in hourly compensation, the Labor Department says. More from ETF Strategist: Why Warren Buffett violates his No. 1 rule of investing A growing, hidden risk to all investors from the boom in bond ETFs Trump said these stocks 'getting away with murder.' Right now, they're killing it. Politics does play some role in the bear case, just as it has been a part of the bull case since the election. Disorder in the new administration, highlighted by a court fight over Trump's order barring travelers from seven mostly-Muslim countries from entering the U.S., caused delays in proposals Trump had vowed to make in the first days of his term, Goldman Sachs economists Jan Hatzius and Sven Stehn said. The revised order is expected imminently. But the immigration ban chaos already caused Goldman to trim its views of how rapidly any boost in growth may come, and how much it might be offset by trade restrictions. "Longer term, we still expect a fiscal boost, but the timeline for passage of a fiscal bill has moved into late 2017 or maybe even early 2018," the Goldman team says. "Meanwhile, the downside risks from the more adverse parts of Mr. Trump's agenda remain significant. An increase in the effective tariff rate on imports seems likely and we now assume a somewhat bigger decline in net immigration flows than we did immediately after the election." show chapters Trump's tone exactly what market wanted to hear: Trader    Wednesday, 1 Mar 2017 | 12:00 PM ET | 05:56 Those risks include a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, as well as a corporate tax bill on which retailers like Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart have faced off with manufacturers, with retailers worried the changes will raise the cost of imported goods. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton has criticized other GOP representatives over the border tax idea, saying it would "see working Americans railroaded." CNBC contributor Larry Kudlow, who is close to Trump and his team, said on Wednesday that the White House is leaning toward the border tax. At the same time, Wall Street is increasingly skeptical that Trump's plans to boost mostly private-sector infrastructure investment by $1 trillion over 10 years using tax credits would make it through Congress. "I think the Trump rally is very vulnerable," said Zandi. "It's about corporate tax cuts and lots less regulation. Stock investors are attaching a high probability to both this year. It's almost a done deal in their minds. I doubt it. The odds that the Trump Administration and the Republican Congress get it sufficiently together to pass tax reform and make big regulatory changes are dropping." The same political chaos has led to the boldest speculation of all about Trump's presidency: it won't last, either because he gets impeached or resigns before his term expires in 2021. While the president held the first rally of his re-election campaign on Feb. 18 in Florida, British betting house Ladbroke's is laying 10-11 odds his administration will end prematurely — the same odds it is offering on Trump serving a full term. Trump's speech to Congress was judged by both sides of the political divide as his most "presidential" moment, at least in tone, providing relief to the likes of Wharton's Siegel. But, oddly, the unlikely chance that a Trump term ends early might be even better for stocks, Zandi said. Vice President Mike Pence, who would take over if Trump left, is a fan of tax cuts and deregulation without posing the worries about trade wars that his boss does. "This is interesting. And a reasonable question," Zandi said. "Pence would be an establishment Republicans' dream come true." It also points to a simple fact, neither all good or all bad, that both bulls and bears need to evaluate: You're dreaming if you think this rally is all about Trump. — By Tim Mullaney, special to CNBC.com Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change XLF --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Dr Reddy's Labs Credit Suisse has underperform rating on Dr Reddy's Labs as it is wary about high product concentration at company playing out, which could impact its earnings per share (EPS) for FY18 and market share. Intas received an approval Decitabine, a drug currently generating USD 80-100 million sales for DRL.

Coal India With maintaining outperform call on Coal India, Credit Suisse says e-auction volumes at 7.5 million tonne & pricing remained healthy.

Morgan Stanley has an underweight rating on the stock, with a target price at Rs 268 as volumes continued to improve in second half of FY17 but lagged target. Production & dispatches grew 6 percent and 5 percent in February 2017, respectively. Higher dispatches was a result of reduction in coal inventory at power plants.

That is the takeaway from data tracking money flows into and out of stocks  JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) said in a report Tuesday The telltale sign retail investors are behind the longest string of US stock highs in decades is a $83-B surge of cash into passive strategies so far this year amid a $15-B withdrawal from actively managed funds. That is on top of evidence that institutional traders have backed away, the bank said. “Investors are normalizing their equity fund buying; this is a return to normal,” a global market strategist at the bank said. After years of snubbing the asset class in favor of fixed income, retail investors are showing pent-up demand for stocks amid an escalation in risk-taking and projections for economic growth since the November election. From the $86-B plowed into equity exchange-trade funds so far this year, analysts calculate that Y 2017 as a whole may see equity funds absorb a net $442-B of new retail-driven money if the YTD pace is sustained. That would be almost 6 X larger than last year’s volume, according to JP Morgan. Institutional investors from risk-parity to mutual fund managers have decreased their exposure to stocks, the team concludes from assessing various active managers’ returns, another sign that the flows to passive strategies are likely dominated by retail investors. So far this year, 3 of the 4 ETFs with the biggest inflows are those tracking American shares, according to data compiled. Vanguard’s S&P 500 fund has seen $3-B in inflows alone, while 2 iShares funds tracking small and mid-sized companies have brought in a combined $5.5-B. The strengthening retail-driven bid is driving stocks higher, and it is reshaping the outlook for daily liquidity. A spate of end-of-day fluctuations in the S&P 500 Index recently is probably a knock-on effect of the rush into passive funds, whose managers rebalance their exposures daily to absorb new inflows.

Masayoshi Son, the billionaire technology entrepreneur from Japan, promised President Donald Trump late last year that he would create 50,000 new jobs in the United States through a $100 billion technology fund. Now, Son and his financial advisers are weighing several major possible deals for Sprint, the struggling U.S. wireless operator controlled by Son’s SoftBank. Be it a tie-up with T-Mobile U.S., Sprint’s closest competitor, or a more ambitious marriage with cable colossus Comcast, a transaction would allow Son to fulfill a long-held ambition to invest aggressively in U.S. wireless networks and enable next-generation mobile technology. Last month, several executives from SoftBank spent a day in Washington talking to senior members of Trump’s economic team, according to bankers briefed on these meetings. The talks and the rush to assess potential deals for Sprint, the country’s fourth-largest mobile operator, highlight how the Trump administration’s push for lighter regulation and lower taxes has been a powerful lure for cash-rich investors the world over. In their presentations, the SoftBank executives said that because of a lack of advanced digital investments, the competitiveness of the U.S. economy was at risk. And the executives made the case, quite strongly, that Son was committed to playing a major role in addressing this issue through a spate of job-creating investments. The discussions were purposely broad in nature, according to investment bankers who were briefed on the discussions. Until the latest government-sponsored auction for spectrum bands finishes in late April, wireless companies are prohibited, owing to concerns about collusion, from pursuing various tie-ups. A Sprint hookup with T-Mobile U.S., Comcast, or any large wireless or cable operator is no slam dunk. For years, federal regulators have opposed such transactions for fear of hurting consumers. Nevertheless, SoftBank seems to be seizing the opportunity of the moment — one highlighted by numerous analyst reports arguing for Sprint and T-Mobile U.S. to come together. Through a spokesman, SoftBank declined to comment on its plans for Sprint. A move this week by the SoftBank-controlled OneWeb, the satellite internet access provider, to merge with Intelsat, the indebted satellite company, is the latest evidence of Son’s ambition, bankers and analysts say. This emphasis on big technology investments as a selling point for the merger rides in part on a wave of hope that the Trump administration will push for a sharp increase in infrastructure investing as a way to kick-start higher levels of U.S. growth. Analysts, however, note that in the past six years when Washington frowned upon wireless mergers — first between AT&T and T-Mobile U.S., and then Sprint and T-Mobile U.S. — consumers benefited from the ruthless price war among the four major carriers. Moreover, this cutthroat environment has forced the two smaller players, Sprint and T-Mobile U.S., to become more innovative and efficient. “The Federal Communications Commission looks very smart for blocking the AT&T T-Mobile deal,” said Philip Cusick, a telecommunications expert with JPMorgan Chase. “Five years ago, Sprint and T-Mobile were irrelevant. Now we are seeing them drive down prices. Why would you want to change that?” While this four-way price-slashing frenzy has led to lower phone bills, a view is also taking hold that the time has come to focus less on the next great plan for unlimited minutes and more on upgrading U.S. digital infrastructure. That would mean pushing the companies to invest aggressively in the type of fiber technology that will support the next generation of wireless investments before it is too late. “You want these companies to invest and compete,” said Jonathan Chaplin, a telecommunications expert at New Street Research who has argued in recent research reports for a Sprint merger with T-Mobile U.S. “This infrastructure will underlie the entire digital economy, and if it remains weak, compared to Japan and China, then the competitiveness of our economy is at risk.” This sums up the view of Son and his top SoftBank executives. And while for regulatory reasons they have been extremely careful to not — publicly or privately — advocate for a merger, they have not been shy in warning about what might happen to the U.S. economy if it continues to fall behind in the race for global digital supremacy. Those in favor of a Sprint deal have also pointed out that the two giants, AT&T and Verizon Communications, while making their own digital investment bets, have been diversifying by pursuing media deals, like Verizon’s acquisition of Yahoo and AT&T’s purchase of DirectTV. So, the argument goes, with the two leading players focused on their media ambitions and with T-Mobile U.S. and Sprint not generating enough cash to invest at the needed scale, a Sprint hookup with its slightly larger peer has never been more critical. Of course, a deal could happen only if Deutsche Telekom, which owns T-Mobile U.S., agreed to merge. Bankers also do not discount the possibility of a cable deal titan like John C. Malone swooping in to buy T-Mobile U.S. At a bit over $70 billion in combined revenue, a merged company would still trail far behind Verizon and AT&T, which generate about $125 billion and $163 billion in sales respectively. Yet a larger third operator could immediately increase investments from the current $5 billion (for the two smaller companies combined) as Son pulls out the stops to make his network the class of the competition, as he has done in Japan. Bankers who have spoken to SoftBank executives say a merged company could easily double its annual outlay to more than $10 billion. While SoftBank and Son have pitched a merger as a boon for investment-starved digital America, it is also true that Sprint, as the smallest, most financially challenged of the four companies, needs to do some kind of deal to stay relevant. Thanks to the financial engineering talents of Rajeev Misra, the former Deutsche Bank executive who has emerged as one of Son’s more influential advisers, Sprint has been able to reduce punitive financing by issuing cheaper bonds secured by the company’s access to spectrum airwaves. These types of flashy innovations are not a long-term strategy, however. And as the company continues its policy of slashing prices to keep pressure on its larger competitors, its financial position will remain precarious, with a debt pile of $33 billion. Sprint, under Son, has become more profitable, and the quality of its network has improved sharply. But analysts and investors remain divided as to how long Sprint can remain a stand-alone company. “It is completely binary,” said Chaplin, the analyst from New Street. “There are those who believe in Masa’s vision and those who believe the company is a house of cards.” What is more, with phone prices still falling, regulators need not be in a hurry to sign off on a merger. “For Sprint,” Chaplin said, “the waiting is more complicated.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Here comes the Fed By Ben White 03/03/17 08:00 AM EST HERE COMES THE FED — It’s becoming clear that Janet Yellen and the Fed will pull the trigger on a rate hike at their meeting later this month potentially setting up a clash with a Trump White House that may not like the central bank pumping the brakes on the economy or the stock market rally that the president loves to brag about. The president has shown a bit more restraint on the Twitters lately but one can imagine something like: “Fed kept rates low for Obama. Now hikes? Sad! JOBS!” We’ll see how it goes. Of course even if Yellen moves, rates will still be really, really low and a hike would be very well communicated to markets in advance. Story Continued Below Manulife’s Megan Greene: “We have changed our view for the next Fed rate hike from June to the FOMC meeting held on March 15th … Fed officials have increasingly spoken publicly to sign post a rate hike would happen fairly soon. … “Notorious dove Lael Brainard said in a speaking gig across the river in Cambridge that she thinks a rate hike could be coming fairly soon. … In addition to recent Fed communication, the market-based probability of a rate hike has soared from around 35 percent last week to nearly 90 percent.” MM SIDENOTE — That could be Brainard’s hip-hop name: “The Notorious Dove.” Pantheon’s Ian Shephardson: “Speeches by Chair Yellen and Vice-Chair Fischer give the two most important Fed officials the perfect platform today to signal to markets whether rates will rise this month. … Chair Yellen and Dr. Fischer have both made it clear that their key focus is on the labor market. Neither official, in our view, is a permanent dove; over the past few years they have been doves by circumstance. “Given that monetary policy works with long lags, and is currently very accommodative … we think the case for further near-term tightening is compelling. We expect both Chair Yellen and Vice-Chair Fischer to suggest today that the Fed will act again soon, leaving the door to a hike this month wide open” DOES YELLEN STILL HAVE A CHOICE? — Mohamed A. El-Erian on Bloomberg View: “[T]he dramatic repricing of market expectations of an interest hike in March — from close to 30 percent to more than 80 percent in just a few days — may even force the hand of … Yellen when she delivers a speech on Friday. “Yellen faces a tricky situation when she speaks … In a perfect world, she would have liked to retain greater policy optionality, especially ahead of the jobs report and, to a lesser extent, given the political fluidity in Europe. … [A]ny meaningful attempt to guide the probability significantly lower risks triggering quite a chorus of complaints about inconsistent Fed messaging” WHY SESSIONS MATTERS — The saga over Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s interactions with the Russian ambassador and subsequent decision to recuse himself from any possible DoJ probes into the Trump campaign and Russia is not directly related to finance and economics. But the speed with which the story eclipsed Trump’s well-reviewed joint address to Congress is. The White House got less than 24 hours to bask in the afterglow of the speech before the Sessions story blew it away (and drove Trump back to angry Tweets). Sessions went from denying any misstatements in his Senate confirmation testimony (and getting a strong defense from the White House) to recusal in one day. And last night the WSJ reported that Sessions paid for his travel to the GOP convention in Cleveland, where he claims to have met with the ambassador in his official capacity, with campaign funds. We have no idea what the end game with Sessions will be or what will ultimately be revealed about the many interactions between Trump associates and the Russians. But if the White House can’t get beyond the story and establish a firm political footing, how can it drive its ambitious tax and regulatory agenda through Congress on the extraordinary fast-track that Wall Street expects? Stocks took a slight pause in the bull run Thursday as the Sessions story and Fed expectations dominated headlines. A preview of things to come? SPEAKING OF THAT … . Bloomberg: “Asian equity investors stepped back from Thursday’s gains, following U.S. shares lower as … Yellen prepares to weigh in on the path for interest rates. The dollar weakened after its longest winning streak since May. “‘The markets are in the short-term overextended,’ said Mark Matthews, Singapore-based head of Asia research at Bank of Julius Baer. ‘Longer term, the reason why rates are going up is because the economy is getting better, and that’s good for stocks.’” Read more. TAX REFORM DOMINATES EARNINGS CALLS — According to an analysis of all public company earnings call transcripts by the BUILD Coalition dating to release of the House GOP tax reform blueprint in June of 2016: “Out of the 471 earnings transcripts that discussed tax reform, BAT was the most discussed component of the Blueprint (24.4 percent). … “However, coming in at a close second was interest deductibility (16.6 percent), which was more frequently discussed than repatriation (14.9 percent).” Full report DEBT LIMIT CLOCK — Via The Bipartisan Policy Center: “[A]bsent congressional action, the Treasury Department will no longer be able to pay all of its bills in full and on time at some point in October or November this year. … “The suspension of the federal debt limit expires on March 16, 2017, resetting the limit at around $20 trillion. At that time, the Treasury’s outstanding debt will be up against the limit, forcing the Treasury secretary to take so-called ‘extraordinary measures in order to avoid missing or delaying federal payments” GOOD FRIDAY MORNING — Happy weekend everyone.

Similarly, it took President Obama 14 months to pass the Affordable Care Act … at a time when he had bigger majorities in Congress and a higher approval rating than President Trump currently enjoys” Read more. REAL TALK ON RUSSIA — Horizons’ Greg Valliere: “It will be an endless annoyance for the White House, with hearings that will drag on and on. This will become the Republicans' Benghazi, or worse. We don't think the Russians played a major role in Hillary Clinton's defeat, but that allegation will not die — and neither will speculation about who knew what, and when … “We're still bullish — these … developments aren't powerful enough to derail the surging economy — but it strikes us that the stock market's exuberance is getting frothy. A modest pullback would actually be healthy, as Fed officials undoubtedly have concluded.” KEYSTONE GETS A “BUY AMERICAN” PASS — POLITICO’s Ben Lefebvre: “The Keystone XL pipeline will not be subject to … Trump's executive order requiring infrastructure projects to be built with American steel, a White House spokeswoman said today. … ‘The Keystone XL pipeline is currently in the process of being constructed, so it does not count as a new, retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipeline,’ the White House spokeswoman said” Read more. WARREN FLIPS ON CARSON — POLITICO’s Elana Schor: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren opposed the confirmation of Ben Carson as HUD secretary today, a reversal that comes after taking heat from the left for previously voting for him. After liberals lashed out at Warren for backing Carson during a Senate Banking Committee vote in January, the Massachusetts Democrat explained her decision in a lengthy Facebook post .. “Warren's office did not immediately return a request for comment on the reason for her change of heart. The full Senate approved Carson's nomination on a 58-41 vote. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), a fellow liberal and the top Democrat on the banking committee, voted to confirm Carson, despite anger from progressives” Read more. SESSIONS RECUSES — POLITICO’s Louis Nelson: “Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Thursday that he will recuse himself from any investigations related to campaigns for president, including any probe into potential contacts between Trump's campaign and Russian officials. … Sessions, who maintained support from the White House and President Donald Trump himself, said he consulted senior DOJ staff for their ‘candid and honest opinion about what I should do.’ … “After riding high on Trump’s well-received first address to Congress on Tuesday, the White House found itself mired once again in the scandal over whether Trump campaign officials had frequent contact with Russian officials last year, as Obama officials were looking into allegations that the Russian government was engaging in cyberattacks to try to tilt the election Trump’s way” Read more. THE FREEWHEELING MIKE MAYO — The Street’s Bradley Keoun: “Rabble-rousing bank analyst Mike Mayo is down but not out. After learning during a half-hour meeting late Monday that his brokerage firm, CLSA, was shutting down its U.S. stock-analysis unit immediately, Mayo showed up early the next morning at JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) annual investor conference, where he peppered executives with questions, identifying himself as ‘a freelance analyst.’ “Later in the day, CEO Jamie Dimon publicly lauded his doggedness. Then on Wednesday, Mayo, 53, took the next step toward his future. He visited a Charles Schwab branch in midtown Manhattan to buy at least two shares of every bank he covered, from Bank of America to Zions, he said. The motivation? So he can have the option of attending their upcoming annual meetings as a shareholder” Read more. SNAP SOARS — WSJ’s Maureen Farrell, Corrie Driebusch and Sarah Krouse: “Snap Inc. shares soared on the first day of trading Thursday in an initial public offering that will likely hand the disappearing-message app’s founders, investors and underwriters big profits and provide a boost for the sluggish new-issue market. “The newly public shares, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ‘SNAP,’ surged 44 percent above their offering price to close at $24.48 as investors clamored for a piece of the fast-growing social network. That made for the biggest one-day pop for a U.S.-listed IPO raising at least $1 billion in more than two years” Read more. CATERPILLAR RAIDED — NYT’s Hiroko Tabuchi: “Federal agents raided three Caterpillar buildings near its Illinois headquarters on Thursday, company and law enforcement officials said, in an escalation of an inquiry into the heavy equipment manufacturer’s offshore tax practices. “Caterpillar has been dogged by accusations that it slashed its domestic tax bill by shifting corporate profits from the United States to a subsidiary in Switzerland. A 2014 congressional investigation concluded that a scheme to move cash between the company’s American and foreign subsidiaries cut its tax bill in the United States by $2.4 billion over 13 years” Read more. NO CLEAR BAT SIGNAL FROM TRUMP — FT’s Barney Jopson and Shawn Donnan: “Trump’s refusal to take a clear position on a controversial import tax is perpetuating uncertainty over tax reform and underscoring divisions in the administration and Congress over policies rooted in economic nationalism. “With business desperate for a tax overhaul but specific sectors worried about being hurt, Mr Trump’s elliptical remarks this week on tax — his first big economic test — have muddied the waters for markets struggling to gauge the chances of change. The president’s mixed messages have become emblematic of how his leadership style and reluctance to get involved in policy details is hampering efforts to advance his agenda on Capitol Hill” Read more. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — NEW BLOOMBERG BOND SHOW — Via Bloomberg: “Bloomberg Television is launching Bloomberg Real Yield, a new weekly show focused solely on fixed income. Hosted by Jonathan Ferro, Bloomberg Real Yield will air every Friday from 12:00-12:30pm ET” NEW AT CARLYLE — Via Carlyle: “Dave Marchick (Global Head of External Affairs) just hired Stacey Dion from Boeing to join the Carlyle External Affairs team as a Managing Director. Stacey joins March 27th and will be based in the DC office. At Boeing, which she joined in 2008, she was Vice President, Corporate Public Policy. In this role, Stacey will lead our government relations activities for the Americas, reporting to Dave” ** A message from The Americans for Affordable Products: House Republicans’ proposed Border Adjustment Tax would have a devastating impact on the pocketbooks of middle-class Americans. Families in every community across America would pay more for food, gasoline, clothing and other essentials to foot the $1 trillion bill so that highly profitable, multinational companies already exploiting U.S. tax loopholes could pay virtually nothing.

Yellen's declaration, in a speech in Chicago, capped an intensification in the Fed's communication in recent days as officials put investors on notice that a rate increase was coming sooner than had been widely expected. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link "On the whole, the prospects for further moderate economic growth look encouraging, particularly as risks emanating from abroad appear to have receded somewhat," Yellen said. Photo: AP "At our meeting later this month, the committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate," Yellen said, referring to the Fed's policymaking arm, the Federal Open Market Committee. The committee is scheduled to meet in Washington on March 14-15. Financial markets have taken the Fed's language in stride, which is likely to reinforce the confidence of Fed officials that they can safely raise rates. The Fed last lifted its benchmark rate in December, to a range of 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent. Rates remain at a low level by historical standards, supporting economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. But Fed officials have increasingly concluded that the economy is nearing the end of its recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, and that maintaining low rates could increase growth to an unsustainable pace. Advertisement The unemployment rate, at 4.8 per cent in January, is in a range Fed officials regard as healthy, and inflation is rising back toward the 2 per cent level that the Fed considers optimal. Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, echoed Yellen in separate but simultaneous remarks Friday at a conference in New York. "We've seen a lot of substantial change in a relatively short time," Fischer said at the US Monetary Policy Forum, noting what he described as a marked change in the economic weather since the presidential election on November 8. "There is almost no economic indicator that has come in badly in the last three months." Asked whether Fed officials were engaged in a coordinated campaign to prepare markets for a rate increase later this month, Fischer replied, "If there has been a conscious effort, I'm about to join it." Economic outlook 'encouraging' Yellen said she expected the Fed to raise rates by the end of the year to a level that would effectively end the central bank's stimulus campaign—something she said was likely to require three increases, each of 0.25 percentage points. She added that further increases were likely to be necessary in coming years to maintain a neutral stance. "On the whole, the prospects for further moderate economic growth look encouraging, particularly as risks emanating from abroad appear to have receded somewhat," she said. Just a few weeks ago, Wall Street analysts were sceptical that the Fed would raise rates in March. The Fed issued a measured statement after its last policy meeting in early February, and the meeting minutes, published three weeks later, conveyed little sense of urgency. Now, analysts regard a March increase as highly likely. Michael Feroli, the chief US economist at JPMorgan Chase, described the shift in Fed language as "remarkably swift and decisive". Investors put the chances at almost 80 per cent in trading on Friday, according to a CME Group analysis of asset prices. Brainard, Powell unusually blunt The shift began earlier this week. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor who in recent years has been one of the most consistent advocates of raising interest rates slowly, suggested Wednesday that she, too, was ready to lift the benchmark rate. "We are closing in on full employment, inflation is moving gradually toward our target, foreign growth is on more solid footing, and risks to the outlook are as close to balanced as they have been in some time," Brainard said at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. "Assuming continued progress, it will likely be appropriate soon to remove additional accommodation, continuing on a gradual path." Fed officials often bury their latest views on monetary policy at the end of their speeches; Brainard's remarks came at the beginning, to make sure no one missed the point. Another Fed governor, Jerome H. Powell, issued a similarly blunt notice of intent in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. "I think the case for a rate increase for March has come together, and I think it's on the table for discussion," he said. Advertisement HuffPost Australia Pleas For Government To Not Ditch $1b ...

Investors have cited several issues as roadblocks, including lengthy registration processes and confusion over tax rules on capital gains, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) said in a report yesterday. In the past year, China has rolled out various measures to attract foreign money, including opening its US$9 trillion (S$12.7 trillion) bond market to overseas investors, and launching a trading link between the Hong Kong and Shenzhen bourses. The link lets foreigners trade the shares of some of China's fastest-growing companies. Last week, regulators allowed foreign investors in the bond market to buy financial products traded domestically that will let them hedge currency risks, said the report. But while foreigners might have long sought to invest in stocks and bonds in China, where annual economic growth is nearly 7 per cent, they seem hesitant to put their money in the Asian giant, it added. According to WSJ research, overseas investors' Chinese bond holdings had dropped to 1.3 per cent of the total outstanding by the end of last year - down from 1.4 per cent before the market's broad opening in February last year. NO CLEAR INVESTMENT AGENDA No one wants to be at a cocktail party saying they don't have a China strategy. But for most firms, it's more lip service than action. MS CHANTAL GRINDERSLEV, senior adviser at Z-Ben Advisors, a Shanghai-based strategic consultancy. Money flowing into Shenzhen stocks from Hong Kong has been tepid, averaging just 5 per cent of the daily 13 billion yuan (S$2.66 billion) quota. A similar trend was witnessed for a link between Shanghai and Hong Kong set up in 2014. Investors say they have hesitated partly because of concerns over time-consuming registration procedures and confusing tax rules on capital gains. Some say markets in China are too expensive, the WSJ reported, while the yuan's slide last year has held back many investors. State interventions in the markets, such as massive share buying by government-backed funds whenever stock prices dip, is another reason investors are holding back, as are worries over whether they will be able to get their money out of China given tight capital controls. "There's a risk that at any point the authorities can step in. That risk must be compensated for by, for example, a cheaper market," Mr Lukas Daalder, the chief investment officer at Robeco Investment Solutions, told the WSJ. Restrictions on capital withdrawals have kept stock-index provider MSCI from including mainland-listed Chinese stocks in its key indexes. HSBC analysts have estimated that US$500 billion would pour into China shares if they were included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Capital controls and market regulation are also keeping Chinese bonds from being included in major bond indexes run by banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup that are commonly tracked by global fund managers. Goldman reckons some US$250 billion could eventually flow into Chinese debt markets if the bonds were admitted, said the WSJ report. Yet, there are others who have been eager to jump into China. With regulatory issues gradually being clarified, and investors being given more ability to hedge risks, many are feeling comfortable about making their move. "We're ready, we're finalising" plans to invest in the onshore market, said Mr Jean-Charles Sambor, the deputy head of emerging-market fixed income at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in London. Still, few foreign asset managers have created funds dedicated to China's onshore bond market, given lack of investor demand, said Ms Chantal Grinderslev, a senior adviser at Z-Ben Advisors, a Shanghai-based strategic consultancy. "No one wants to be at a cocktail party saying they don't have a China strategy. But for most firms, it's more lip service than action,"she said.

It was actually sort of an inside day inside of and inside day inside of an inside day because all daily ranges subsequent to Tuesday’s have been further compressed. # Concerns over dry weather in eastern Brazil potentially creeping west into Mato Grosso to be a detriment for the second corn crop have shifted to worries over wet weather being a threat to quality for the soybean crop. More rain looks to be on the way for central Brazil over the next five days. # Brazil’s soybean export program is starting off at a record clip. Crops were ready early in the season and had been making their way into shipping position without much trouble before heavy rains cut off the flow of trucks headed to ports along the Amazon River. # The next update of the Supply and Demand tables will come from the USDA on Thursday of next week. Estimates for the South American crop will be the main attraction. Analysts are reaching as high as 108 million tons for Brazil’s soybean crop, which the USDA in January pegged at 104 mt. # Most analysts surveyed by Bloomberg do not see it likely that USDA makes any change to the U.S. corn carryout estimate. The average trade guess looks for soybean ending stocks to drop 5 million bushels to 415 mbu. # The new-crop soybean/corn ratio came in slightly this week as traders begin to do more to price in expectations for acres switch. The multiple currently stand at 2.55 versus 2.33 this time last year. # Active oil rigs in the U.S. increased by two last week, not a big gain, but the total of 756 rigs is up 267 from the 489 in use this time last year. Oil futures were trading higher on the last session of the week despite talk of U.S. inventories growing, in part because of rising imports. # The dollar index initially did not budge much from the day’s low after Fed Chair Yellen mentioned that a March Fed funds rate hike was “likely appropriate.” A notable currency move was the appreciation of the Mexican peso, which was firmer on talk about changes to NAFTA being potentially supportive. # Stocks were mixed with banks the only sector making solid gains. Money lenders like JPMorgan and Bank of America stand to benefit if interest rates are on their way up. ***** April live cattle down $0.17 with the deferred contracts fractionally firmer; feeders up $0.47 to $1.02; hogs drop $1.17 to $1.52. ***** # Better wholesale beef prices and a premium for the cash market help to support cattle futures, but upside looks to be limited by the projections for a rising number of animals slated to come off of feed starting this spring. # Cash hogs turned defensive in reflection of an eroding packer margin. Most cash trades were made at $1 under Thursday’s levels. Slaughters are still running high and have the potential to plug the pipeline before demand can catch up, even though consumption is still pacing robustly.

Record Differential The latest "State of the Automotive Finance Market" report from Experian released on Thursday showed that average loan amount for a new vehicle was a record $30,621 in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $19,329 for used vehicle, with the gap at $11,292. This compares to a differential of $10,701 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Melinda Zabritski, Experian's senior director of automotive finance, attributed this widening gap to the rising cost of new vehicles. "This upward trend is causing many consumers to find alternative methods like extending loan terms, getting a short-term lease or opting for a used vehicle to get what they want while staying within their monthly budget," Zabritsk added. Related Link: 9 Mistakes To Avoid When Getting A Car Loan Average Term, Payment Rise About 48.12 percent of new borrowers choosing to lease belonged to the prime category, 28.15 percent to the super prime category, 16.32 percent to non-prime and 6.93 percent to subprime. The percentage of prime+ new borrowers choosing to lease increased to 34.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 from 32.7 percent for the year-ago period. The average term of loan for a new vehicle was 68 months or roughly 5-1/2 years in the fourth quarter of 2016, up from 67 months in 2015, compared to 36 months for a used vehicle in the fourth quarter of 2016. Average payment for new vehicle loans hit a record at $506 in Q4 2016 from $493 in Q415. Lease payment for new vehicle loans was $414 versus $412 last year. In comparison, average payment for used vehicles was $364. Delinquencies Rise Bloomberg Gadfly columnist Lisa Abramowicz said in a recent column that delinquencies among lower-rated borrowers are at the highest level since 2009. The amount of outstanding auto loans is rising at a record rate and now accounts for a bigger proportion of total U.S. household liabilities in about 14 years, Abramowicz noted. The Bloomberg column also noted that auto lenders such as Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE: COF), Ally Financial Inc (NYSE: ALLY), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc (NYSE: SC) have reported a rising proportion of net charge-offs in recent years. The broader pain in the auto industry and broader consumer creditworthiness will also extend to smaller independent lenders and the captive financing arms at auto companies, the column said. Rising delinquencies and losses would impact the bottom line of these companies. In the eventuality, these companies could underwrite more auto loans at narrower yields. Abramowicz believes the troubles in the auto loan market will cause a lot of headaches and possible insolvencies. Auto lenders, however, cannot afford to be aggressive, as eventually they will be left straddled with worse losses.

In fact, eight out of the 10 largest tech IPOs in history declined between 15 and 71 percent in their first year on the public market. Related Link: Will Snap Be The Comeback Of The Tech IPO? The Snap short trade is a popular idea among retail investors, but shortable shares will initially be hard to come by. Retail investors who were unable to short shares of Snap on Thursday may have better luck on Friday. According to a representative from E*Trade, the firm expects to have Snap shares available to short immediately after the market open on Friday. The representative told Benzinga customers must be enrolled in the firm’s Hard to Borrow program due to Snap being listed as a hard to borrow security. IPO underwriters are forbidden by rule from lending out shares of the IPO stock within the first 30 days of trading. That means that firms such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Credit Suisse will not be able to lend their shares for the time being. Fortunately for potential short sellers, they didn’t appear to have missed an opportunity on Thursday. Snap shares are up another 4.9 percent in Friday’s pre-market session.

The EFCC had in December filed related charges against two former Nigerian ministers, Mohammed Adoke and Dan Etete, and others after concluding investigations on the 2011 controversial‎ sale of OPL 245. The alleged fraud committed by the ex-Nigerian officials and officials of the oil firms, has also led to investigations and charges in Italy. The EFCC had also secured a court order ensuring the return of the OPL 245 to the Nigerian government, pending the determination of the court case against the defendants. Although Shell and ENI have appealed that court order obtained on January 26, both companies were not charged for their roles by the Nigerian government until Thursday. The defendants according to the fresh charge include the Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited; Nigerian Agip Exploration Limited; ENI SPA: the then directors of the oil firms, Ralph Wetzels, Casula Roberto, Pujati Stefeno, and Burrafato Sebastiano; Dauzia Lauya also known as Dan Etete;Mohammed Adoke; Aliyu Abubakar, and Malabu Oil and Gas Limited. ‎Messrs Casula and Etete were also among those ‎indicted‎ by Italian prosecutors who have indicated their intentions to file charges against them. According to the charges filed on Thursday, the defendants were accused of committing the crime of conspiracy to commit felony against the provisions of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences, ICPC, Act. The oil firms and their then directors were also alleged to have fraudulently paid $801 million to Messrs. Adoke, Etete, Aliyu, and Malabu for the oil block. OPL 245 is considered one of Nigeria’s richest oil blocks and estimated to contain over nine billion barrels of crude. Investigations had revealed that former President Goodluck Jonathan ordered the handing over of OPL 245 to Malabu, shortly after assuming office in 2010. According to investigations, Mr. Jonathan asked the then Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke, to solidify the transfer of OPL 245 to Malabu, a company then controlled by a fellow Nigerian from the Niger-Delta region, Dan Etete. Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block. Based on advice from desperate businessmen, including an Israeli, Ednan Agaev, Mr. Etete decided to cash in on the block. Through various middlemen, the former minister approached oil giants, Shell and ENI, to buy the block. Knowing Mr. Etete’s history, including the fact that he had been convicted in France for money laundering, the oil firms would not do a direct deal. For the transaction to continue, a legally recognised mediator would have to be found. That mediator turned out to be the Nigerian government, represented by Mr. Adoke. The agreements that were sealed led to Shell and ENI paying the $1.1 billion into a Nigerian government account in JP Morgan Chase in London. The money was to then be transferred to Malabu accounts controlled by Mr. Etete. Although Shell and ENI have repeatedly claimed they did not know the money was going to end up with Malabu, investigations in Nigeria and Italy as well as leaked documents revealed that claim to be false. Mr. Adoke himself would later admit that he, on behalf of the federal government, only acted as a mediator for two willing parties – Malabu and the oil majors. Mr. Adoke was, however, aware of the various fraudulent manipulations of Malabu by Mr. Etete when he authorised the transaction, multiple sources have told PREMIUM TIMES. TRANSFERS TO FRAUDULENT FIRMS To ensure no one stopped the shady transfer of the $1.1 billion to Mr. Etete, the money had to be quickly transferred. More so, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was set to assume office as Nigeria’s Finance Minister and the officials involved were not sure she would play ball. On August 16, 2011, a day before Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala was to assume office, Mr. Adoke and the then Minister of State for Finance, Yerima Ngama, authorised the transfer of the money to Malabu accounts in Nigeria controlled by Mr. Adoke. However, all the $1.1 billion could not be transferred. Emeka Obi, a man who claimed he helped broker the deal between Malabu and the oil majors filed a suit in the UK, that ensured $215 million was frozen of the money. The remaining $801 million was subsequently transferred to Mr. Etete: $400 million was transferred to a Bank PHB account while $401 million was transferred to a First Bank account. Immediately Mr. Etete received the money, curious transfers began. PREMIUM TIMES investigations, now confirmed by the EFCC, reveal that shady companies linked to Abubakar Aliyu received about $479 million dollars from Mr. Etete. Our investigations later showed that most of the companies were non-existent and used fake addresses in their registration documents. The companies – Rocky Top Resource Ltd, Imperial Union Ltd, Novel Properties & Dev. Co. Ltd, A-Group Construction Ltd, and Megatech Engineering Ltd – were all charged in the suit filed by the EFCC last December. While Mr. Etete later admitted that only $250 million of the money paid into his account was his, Mr. Aliyu is believed to have acted as a front for officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration, including Mr. Adoke.

City Lawyers @arabakpura:disqus Mohammed Adoke could be ex-President Jonathan’s Achilles’ heel for assuring Jonathan and the general public that no criminal or civil liability would follow Jonathan’s private business as A BROKER of a private deal between SHELL OIL and MALABU OIL on the illegal sale of OPL 245 under the table in criminal side-step of Nigeria’s Off-Shore and Petroleum laws. Mohammed Adoke, an ignorant fellow, was of course dead wrong on point of law. He said the federal government – i.e. President Jonathan – merely acted as an ‘obligor’ – to sound confident that no liability would ensue. But an obligor does not mean an innocent bystander in law but rather means a full participant as counter-party to a transaction. In June 2015, the United States Justice Department in Washington D.C said it has begun criminal investigation of two counter-parties to Dan Etete’s OPL 245 fraud transaction. On the wording of ‘obligor’ that the daft Muhammed Adoke as attorney general inserted, ex-President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan may just be one of the two ‘counter-parties’ now under investigation for money-laundering in the United States of America for wangling out a whopping $1.2 billion Arabakpura Thanks a lot! … and Jonathan is a good and Peaceful man! sammyctu ode When the people of A country vote for a president it’s cos they have faith and confidence in him to ensure that the interest of that country is well protected by that president. However it’s not the case with Jonathan he chose his personal greedy corrupt immature interest over that of Nigeria thereby giving away one of the most priced assets of Nigeria to foreign companies and a few evil Nigerians. As far as i am concerned Jonathan is a rouge thief an immature boy who should have never be president of Nigeria. He must be indicted for this OPL 245 corruption cos without his instructions and approval this corruption saga would never have occurred. emmanuel Osinbade should note that this Oil Block cannot go to any foolani man – period. It must remain in the South South. Those who have handled his visits and the negotiations should inform him. Nigeria must re-open the processes of all Oil blocks allocated in the past or renewed by Buhari last year. They all suffered same fate, so they cannot make the World believe that this is the only one that went through payment of commissions or cuts. Sheer hypocrisy. Buhari’s Magu should re-open the blocks held by Indimi, one of the considerations for the latest marriage; since that automatically remove IBB from the picture (After Mohammed and Indimi’s daughter broke up – the initial seal on the block). Abi dem think say Nigerians dey blind? emmanuel Shhhhhhhh, all Oil blocks allocated from Buhari in 1985 to Obj went through very similar process. Those who transact in the Oil sector and finace Industry know this. You can demonise Jonathan, but what is done here is similar hype that sent Jonathan from office. The SS cannot be the weeping child all the time. We all suffered the back lash in Crude shut-in from February 2016 to February 2017. When it relates to foolani and Yoruba, it is a no discuss issue, but once it is South South and Igbo, then the media is deployed to malign. Shell and Eni are fighting back, because they know that all other blocks traded in the past by any other IOC had same thing, including Buhari new in-laws’.

News Reader How Adoke, Etete, Alhaji Abubakar and General Gusau robbed Nigeria “(MILAN, Oct 1). Italian prosecutors investigating state-backed firm Eni SpA over the purchase of a Nigerian oil field three years ago allege that at least half of the $1.1 billion paid was used to bribe local politicians, intermediaries and others, according to official documents and a person close to the investigation. The Malabu oil scam, which has been under investigation for over four years, relates to the billions of dollars paid by oil giants, Shell and ENI, into a Federal Government account for OPL 245, considered the richest oil block in Africa. The money was allegedly diverted by Adoke and paid into private accounts. Alhaji Abubakar Aliyu, who is the Chairman of the A. A. Group and Rocky Top Services, allegedly received $336,456,906.78.” emmanuel Was Indimi, Mai Deribe, Theophlus Danjuma and the severl foolanis ans Southerners used as their fronts for all other Oil block IOC’s? They all registered their companies to acquire the Oil blocks. Please tell us another story. Etete was Oil Minister, Alakija was a hair dresser, Indimi was a commodity trader, Danjuma was a soldier. nonsense! We dey hear “Without competitive tendering and with full, unconditional exemption from all national taxes, the OPL 245 block was bought illegally in contravention of domestic laws. In total, $801.5 million was allegedly transferred to Etete’s Malabu accounts; and $466 million out of the amount was used for remunerating government officials, including Jonathan and Alison-Madueke. A suspected “agent” of Jonathan, named Abubakar Aliyu, is alleged to have withdrawn a further $54 million and beneficiaries of the money went on a shopping spree buying property, aeroplanes, armoured cars.” ……..Italy Prosecutors’ filed charges in Italian Court (December, 2016) The Revolutionaries @shahokaya:disqus There’s no peaceful way to resolve Nigeria’s theft crisis. Blood must flow. No country can move forward surrounded by heinous thefts – of stolen money, stolen lands, stolen cars, and stolen status. All treasury thieves in Nigeria now need to be physically attacked and killed. The families of treasury thieves – wives and children – must also be swiftly laid to rest in perfect peace since they are not entitled to inherit stolen assets under any written will. The thefts since October 1st 1960 must all be brought to revolutionary justice on the streets under the death penalty in the Constitution. The deciders of who shall get the death penalty will be the youths – armed as ordinary citizens and formed into cells as well-organized militias. In 30 days of swift and bloody justice on the streets, the story of corruption will end in Nigeria for the grave-diggers to then bury the remains of those consumed by the people’s revolution. Nigerians may delay or dither over this final solution but that is what’s going to happen. The longer it is delayed, the worse for the country now stolen into darkness. Sanssouci We all get ur point but pls consider the following: 1) mohammed bello adoke, aliyu abubakar and aliyu gusau are all northern muslims, and all neck deep in this shit. 2)if indimi, alakija and danjuma all got their oil blocks by performing international fraud why have international authorities not gone after them in the past? 3) since u have facts about indimi, alakija, danjuma that most of us dont, why didnt u urge GEJ to go after them when he was at helm of affairs? 4) doesnt it bother u one bit that a bloc containing 9.23 billion barrels probable reserves was sold for 1.1billion$ at a time a barrel was higher than 100$? Do u sincerely think dan ete and GEJ worked in SS people’s interest in doing so? speechtherapy With due respect bros, there are many sides to this transaction that you and the public in general are unaware of but sadly are quick to jump to judgment about. For one thing, it was not the GEJ govt that agreed a settlement with Malabu, it was OBJs government but were unable to implement it because Shell took them to court to stop it. In fact Shell was close to securing a claim of $2B against the Nigerian govt for same. I work in the oil industry and have followed this case from the onset, the real crime here does in no way include withholding money from the Nigeria purse, in fact the Nigerian govt got $201M in signature bonus themselves instead of the original $20M it had charged for same. Like I said, too many sides to this, I suggest we wait till the court cases commence. Forensics @shahokaya:disqus How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering Goodluck Jonathan may just have been led by the nose into a deadly minefield of international moneylaundering by his usually moronic attorney-general, Adoke Muhammed, but alas, Jonathan may not exit this criminal tangle for the next 20 years, just as Dan Etete himself has not exited it since the year 1998. Goodluck Jonathan is his own undoing. He is a slow thinker and a bad decider of sensible options. Even in his choice of attorney-general he picked the most atrocious of the 100,000 lawyers on offer. Now he has to stew in his own juices. He doesn’t deserve any sympathy. It is even a crime of abetment of felony to support Jonathan over this OPL 245. Were both Jonathan and Adoke possessed of average intelligence the duo could have easily resolved the Malabu Oil tussle with Shell Oil company over OPL 245 without their getting implicated, as has happened, in moneylaundering offences at home and abroad, following from the very daft options both men selected. But see. Adoke does not know the law and Jonathan too does not know the logic. Forensics …….(2) How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering It was Goodluck Jonathan who authorised that Eni Oil company pay $1.1billion. into JP Morgan’s New York bank account of Nigeria’s NNPC state oil company to disguise it as official payment. Within weeks Jonathan then authorised that the entire funds be transferred to JP Morgan’s branch in London en route Dan Etete; where the loot was then shared out to seven criminal co-conspirators, including a Russian citizen. Already the Italians have signaled intention to subpoena Dan Etete for trial. The currently filed case in Nigeria will not preclude simultaneous criminal trial in Italy because no double jeopardy doctrine is legally invocable for distinct criminal offences committed in two different jurisdictions. Dan Etete himself is now frustrated and flustered and has begun to squeal on his accomplices. Dan Etete has said late last year that $800 million out of the $1.1 billion bribe money was pocketed by other people in the deal, as he only took $250million. That means he will now be ready to squeal on all those other people who spirited away the $800million., most likely including Goodluck Jonathan and General Aliyu Gusau whom Italian investigators have specifically fingerpointed in the charges filed in court in Milan, Italy, to begin the criminal prosecution of all the bribe-takers. Reckoned in historical years, Dan Etete who practically stole OPL 245 (by corrupt self-award as Petroleum Minister) has been struggling in vain since the year 1998 to get away with the 250 million dollars loot he got from his criminal brace, but he’s only got more entangled as defendant in severe criminal prosecutions; both in Italy and Nigeria. Even in his self-chosen profession of looting Dan Etete is a failure after 20 years of failing to run away from his own crime scene. But now, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Adoke Muhammed may become Dan Etete’s heirs or successors, and locked into this criminal case with him; having been his privies in the daft conspiracy to coax Eni oil company in Italy to fork out the $1.1billion. Pastor J.J.Jones “The love of money is the root of all evil; which, while some coveted after, they erred from faith and pierced themselves with sorrows. For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro, of those who seek death. There are thorns and snares on the path of the crooked. One who guards himself prudently will stay far from the crooked”. Forensics Reckoned in historical years, Dan Etete who practically stole OPL 245 (by corrupt self-award as Petroleum Minister) has been struggling in vain since the year 1998 to get away with the 250 million dollars loot he got from his criminal brace, but he’s only got more entangled as defendant in severe criminal prosecutions; both in Italy and Nigeria.

Kaykay @shahokaya:disqus : Goodluck Ebele Jonathan did not have any spatial awareness in office or ever understood the duties and functions of the office of president he occupied by chance and happenstance. He was lost in space and lost in thoughts unable to think anything through.

Despite incredible odds, this businessman has been able to attract the support from heavyweight patrons of all faiths, including Theodore McCarrick, the archbishop emeritus of Washington, D.C.; Prince Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, a senior member of the royal family of Saudi Arabia; and, more controversially, Sheikh Muhammad A. Hussein, the grand mufti of Jerusalem, the Sunni Muslim in charge of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. show chapters The billionaire who’s saving Bethlehem    Friday, 3 Mar 2017 | 8:00 AM ET | 00:57 The task requires a tenacious spirit. On one hand, the unassuming Athens-based construction magnate, one of the family that owns the $5.3 billion Consolidate Contractors Company, is dealing with the Israeli occupational government, which has a say in much of what happens in Bethlehem. The Palestinian city lies just beyond the wall that separates Israel and Palestine, in between Jerusalem and the Jordan River. Khoury also has to cope with Palestinian politics, which are in a perpetual state of disarray depending on support — or the lack of it — from the international community. The long conflict and military occupation have exacted a heavy toll on Bethlehem, which could otherwise be one of the most visited tourism destinations in the world. The GDP per capita in the West Bank and Gaza is $4,300. Bethlehem remains a poor city, where some families live in one-room homes and many young people lack jobs. Last month U.S. President Donald Trump signaled he was backing away from the U.S. commitment to a Palestinian state, as he rebuked Israel for its continual appropriation of Palestinian land in the West Bank. Many observers took Trump's moves — which have knocked both sides and neighboring Jordan off balance — as a sign he intends to reopen peace negotiations. A political morass  Fractured politics mirror the fractured religions: The main attraction in Bethlehem is the Church of the Nativity, said to the be birthplace of Christ. It has been governed for centuries by three denominations whose defense of their "zones" in the church is legendary and has sometimes come to blows: the Franciscan order of Roman Catholics, the Greek Orthodox Church and Armenian Apostolic Church. "They are not businesspeople," said Khoury, sounding pained, recounting the difficulties of getting the lights strung to decorate the Church at Christmas. But, moved by his family's Greek Orthodox and Palestinian roots, Khoury has a new vision for Bethlehem: Within 10 years, he wants to see 3 million tourists a year thronging the narrow streets. Three years in, he said, "We're 5 percent to 10 percent there." Paying it forward Khoury's late father, Said, founded the Bethlehem Development Foundation, a nonprofit that has so far spent $30 million. It aims to raise and spend another $70 million by 2027. "It's a sad city when you enter," said Khoury. "This is the center of Christianity, important for 2 billion people. My father said: 'It is going to be a ghetto if nobody does anything.'" David Silverman | Getty Images A pilgrim lays her hand on the silver star in the Grotto under the Church of the Nativity, which according to tradition marks the sport Jesus was born. Khoury, who picked up the reigns after his father died in 2014, wants to do everything from spur tourism with a new hotel and new agreements with Israeli bus companies, to helping develop jobs-training programs for students at a local university. The streets of Bethlehem are lined with tiny shops, many selling olive wood trinkets and beautifully carved nativity sets, but they are struggling. Bassem Giacaman, one of the shopkeepers, said before the Second Intifada, his shop had revenue of $400,000 a year, and employed 12. Now, it brings in about $100,000 a year, enough to employ three people and earn him a tiny profit, perhaps $10,000. Still, he stays, he said, because he wants to keep his family's workshop alive and because he loves the Church of the Nativity. In 1948, the Christian population of the Holy Land was 18 percent; it's now 2 percent, according to the Holy Land Christian Ecumenical Foundation. Giacaman has tried to make his shop welcoming for everyone: it carries menorahs, nativity sets, Arabic calligraphy— and welcomes tourists who need to use the toilet. "We just try to open the door and keep things going," he said. Khoury said he was in part inspired to continue his father's work when he talked to people like Giacaman. The Foundation, with the initial donation of $30 million from the Khourys in 2011, is helping the Palestinian government manage the much-lauded restoration of the Church, refurbished Manger Square, where tourist buses park, helped start a small museum, and financed a strategic solid waste management plan for the area. It's now working on plans to build a small shopping center and car park, a solar power station that could power small factories, and a small hotel of about 100 rooms. More from Global Investing Hot Spots: Who will win the world's biggest IPO? A $100 billion global arms race Trump wants to win Saudi Aramco taps JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley for IPO; HSBC a contender Some of the projects may be funded via investments – he said he believes some projects could yield 10 percent annually—and some via donations. Though between 1 and 2 million people visit the Church every year – exact numbers are hard to come by – few stay overnight and little economic benefit comes to the town of about 25,000 people. A philanthropic cause Khoury's late father was a Greek Orthodox Palestinian who immigrated to Lebanon, founded CCC, and then moved it to Greece. "He was a true believer," Samer Khoury said of his father. CCC, now run by his three sons, has about 100,000 employees worldwide and had revenue of $5.3 billion in 2016, Khoury said. It builds projects of enormous scale: CCC builds or is a partner on projects such as the giant 60 kilometer Riyadh Metro in Saudi Arabia, a giant expo center in Kazakhstan, and -- in the near future -- oil platforms off the East Coast of Africa, Khoury said. CCC is a part owner of the power plant in Gaza, the southern part of the Palestinian Territory. In Bethlehem, the scale of projects is much smaller. Sometimes, in the complicated politics of the town, the goals can get tripped up by something as small as a string of lights. For instance, stringing lights on the Church of the Nativity opened a fraught negotiation between the three denominations. An extra light hanging on the wrong side of a wall might have been taken as a sign one of the denominations had ceded territory in the church to another. In the Church of the Nativity, the walls, the windows and even a crack in the floor are claimed by one of the three. "It is funny," said Khoury, without laughing even a little bit. "It is not practical." He is a little frustrated, but he is not giving up. Issam Rimawi | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images The Church of the Nativity is seen during its restoration in Bethlehem, West Bank on November 28, 2016. Though there are many nonprofits and aid agencies working in Bethlehem, Khoury's effort is different, observers said, because of its breadth, Khoury's business acumen, the money behind it and the expertise CCC is putting to the task. "What Samer Khoury has developed is an entire mechanism to restore and rebuild Bethlehem; a city whose international reputation precedes it, but whose infrastructure, and most importantly, its people have been neglected for far too long. (He) is working … to bring hope back to the city's inhabitants," said Sir Rateb Rabie, CEO of the Holy Land Christian Ecumenical Foundation and a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre, named by the pope for services in the Holy Land. The Bethlehem Development Foundation has an engineer working in Bethlehem on restoration of the Church, which started three years ago and will probably last for another three or four years, Khoury says. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas first convinced the three denominations to allow the restoration, but Khoury's foundation stepped in to manage payments for the highly specialized contractors doing the work, which has included replacing the 500-year old wooden roof. Now, the restoration is moving on to restoring beautiful golden icons on the walls and an ancient mosaic under the floor that tourists tramp over on their way into the grotto said to mark the birthplace of Christ. Among the discoveries during the restoration: a hole left from a stray bomb that fell during the 1967 War. Against all odds The difficulties of existing in Bethlehem, which lies just beyond the wall that separates Israel from Palestine, have defeated big companies. The InterContinental Hotels Group, for instance, withdrew its contract with the famous Jacir Palace Hotel in Bethlehem after a series of stabbings in Israel and reprisals in the West Bank. Tourists generally travel through Israel, and come via buses from Israeli touring companies, which drive in and out of the town, headed to more developed destinations on the Israeli side, as rapidly as they can. The GDP per capita in Israel is $34,800 a year. Khoury is unfazed. "This is Israel and Palestine," he said. "You have to expect that." He believes that if Bethlehem had more to offer tourists, their numbers would grow, and they would stay and spend more money. Both Israel and Palestine are seen as tourism markets with enormous untapped potential. For instance, in 2010, a comparison between Israel and Jordan found the former got about 2.8 million in tourists, compared with Jordan's 4.5 million. About 648,000 Americans visited Israel in 2016, up 5 percent compared to the last record year. Khoury remains hopeful. To cope with the complicated politics of the region, and the complicated religious politics, Khoury assembled an board of heavyweight patrons of many faiths. Khoury said he invited two Jewish board members and hopes to have one join this year. To raise more money for Bethlehem Khoury is turning to wealthy individuals, especially those with roots in Palestine. "It is like with any startup, you need a track record," he said. "We have that now." On his list of targets: Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire whose father was from Lebanon. Khoury said he believes he'll find many people willing to help. Donations have already begun coming, such as a $1.2 million gift from the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, he said. "I made a big list. These people, like our family, have connections to Palestine and have succeeded." He's convinced the story of Bethlehem will attract givers. He paused, unexpectedly poetic for a businessman. "My song that I sing, I bring many people along," he said. — By Elizabeth MacBride, special to CNBC.com Elizabeth MacBrideSpecial to CNBC.com To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

This Guy Bought the World’s Saddest Bag of Chips For the First Time You Will Be Able To Get Eggslut Sandwiches On The East Coast By Phil Wahba Posted March 03, 2017 Costco Wholesale on Thursday announced a membership fee hike, even as it reported disappointing revenues and profit for its second fiscal quarter. The company, the second largest U.S. retailer after Walmart, will raise the price of its Gold Star membership by $5 per year to $60, and lift its Executive membership fee $10 a year to $120 as of June 1. Costco last increased the fee November 2011 and raises it about every five or six years. The hike was widely anticipated by Wall Street analysts and is revenue that will go straight to Costco’s bottom line: Costco’s 86.7 million card holders spent $2.6 billion on membership fees in fiscal 2016, essentially making up nearly three-quarters of its $3.6 billion in operating income. And the increase could prove to be a boon. Last year, Costco switched its Citi-issued membership credit card to Visa from American Express, making Costco membership available to far more households and vastly increasing Costco’s potential customer base. In a research note earlier this week, UBS predicted consumers would not balk at an increase and noted that the increased incentives from the Visa card, which gives customers 2% cash back on Costco transactions, compared to 1% with the previous AmEx cards, mean that “Costco credit card customers would need to spend just $500 in a year to break even on a $5 membership fee hike.” The Wall Street Journal has reported that J.P. Morgan Chase projects a membership fee increase could add another three to five percentage points to annual earnings growth over the next two years. That would be a welcome boost for a company whose profit growth has slowed in recent years. Still, the news of hike were not enough to overshadow Costco’s results, which sent its shares down 4% in after hours trading. Revenue in the quarter ended Feb. 12, was $29.13 billion, below Wall Street forecasts for $29.86 billion, while earnings per share were $1.17, compared to $1.36. Comparable sales were up 3%, missing expectations for a 3.5% increases. This article originally appeared on Fortune.

The EFCC had in December filed related charges against two former Nigerian ministers, Mohammed Adoke and Dan Etete, and others after concluding investigations on the 2011 controversial‎ sale of OPL 245. The alleged fraud committed by the ex-Nigerian officials and officials of the oil firms, has also led to investigations and charges in Italy. The EFCC had also secured a court order ensuring the return of the OPL 245 to the Nigerian government, pending the determination of the court case against the defendants. Although Shell and ENI have appealed that court order obtained on January 26, both companies were not charged for their roles by the Nigerian government until Thursday. The defendants according to the fresh charge include the Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited; Nigerian Agip Exploration Limited; ENI SPA: the then directors of the oil firms, Ralph Wetzels, Casula Roberto, Pujati Stefeno, and Burrafato Sebastiano; Dauzia Lauya also known as Dan Etete;Mohammed Adoke; Aliyu Abubakar, and Malabu Oil and Gas Limited. ‎Messrs Casula and Etete were also among those ‎indicted‎ by Italian prosecutors who have indicated their intentions to file charges against them. According to the charges filed on Thursday, the defendants were accused of committing the crime of conspiracy to commit felony against the provisions of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences, ICPC, Act. The oil firms and their then directors were also alleged to have fraudulently paid $801 million to Messrs. Adoke, Etete, Aliyu, and Malabu for the oil block. OPL 245 is considered one of Nigeria’s richest oil blocks and estimated to contain over nine billion barrels of crude. Investigations had revealed that former President Goodluck Jonathan ordered the handing over of OPL 245 to Malabu, shortly after assuming office in 2010. According to investigations, Mr. Jonathan asked the then Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke, to solidify the transfer of OPL 245 to Malabu, a company then controlled by a fellow Nigerian from the Niger-Delta region, Dan Etete. Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block. Based on advice from desperate businessmen, including an Israeli, Ednan Agaev, Mr. Etete decided to cash in on the block. Through various middlemen, the former minister approached oil giants, Shell and ENI, to buy the block. Knowing Mr. Etete’s history, including the fact that he had been convicted in France for money laundering, the oil firms would not do a direct deal. For the transaction to continue, a legally recognised mediator would have to be found. That mediator turned out to be the Nigerian government, represented by Mr. Adoke. The agreements that were sealed led to Shell and ENI paying the $1.1 billion into a Nigerian government account in JP Morgan Chase in London. The money was to then be transferred to Malabu accounts controlled by Mr. Etete. Although Shell and ENI have repeatedly claimed they did not know the money was going to end up with Malabu, investigations in Nigeria and Italy as well as leaked documents revealed that claim to be false. Mr. Adoke himself would later admit that he, on behalf of the federal government, only acted as a mediator for two willing parties – Malabu and the oil majors. Mr. Adoke was, however, aware of the various fraudulent manipulations of Malabu by Mr. Etete when he authorised the transaction, multiple sources have told PREMIUM TIMES. TRANSFERS TO FRAUDULENT FIRMS To ensure no one stopped the shady transfer of the $1.1 billion to Mr. Etete, the money had to be quickly transferred. More so, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was set to assume office as Nigeria’s Finance Minister and the officials involved were not sure she would play ball. On August 16, 2011, a day before Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala was to assume office, Mr. Adoke and the then Minister of State for Finance, Yerima Ngama, authorised the transfer of the money to Malabu accounts in Nigeria controlled by Mr. Adoke. However, all the $1.1 billion could not be transferred. Emeka Obi, a man who claimed he helped broker the deal between Malabu and the oil majors filed a suit in the UK, that ensured $215 million was frozen of the money. The remaining $801 million was subsequently transferred to Mr. Etete: $400 million was transferred to a Bank PHB account while $401 million was transferred to a First Bank account. Immediately Mr. Etete received the money, curious transfers began. PREMIUM TIMES investigations, now confirmed by the EFCC, reveal that shady companies linked to Abubakar Aliyu received about $479 million dollars from Mr. Etete. Our investigations later showed that most of the companies were non-existent and used fake addresses in their registration documents. The companies – Rocky Top Resource Ltd, Imperial Union Ltd, Novel Properties & Dev. Co. Ltd, A-Group Construction Ltd, and Megatech Engineering Ltd – were all charged in the suit filed by the EFCC last December. While Mr. Etete later admitted that only $250 million of the money paid into his account was his, Mr. Aliyu is believed to have acted as a front for officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration, including Mr. Adoke.

City Lawyers @arabakpura:disqus Mohammed Adoke could be ex-President Jonathan’s Achilles’ heel for assuring Jonathan and the general public that no criminal or civil liability would follow Jonathan’s private business as A BROKER of a private deal between SHELL OIL and MALABU OIL on the illegal sale of OPL 245 under the table in criminal side-step of Nigeria’s Off-Shore and Petroleum laws. Mohammed Adoke, an ignorant fellow, was of course dead wrong on point of law. He said the federal government – i.e. President Jonathan – merely acted as an ‘obligor’ – to sound confident that no liability would ensue. But an obligor does not mean an innocent bystander in law but rather means a full participant as counter-party to a transaction. In June 2015, the United States Justice Department in Washington D.C said it has begun criminal investigation of two counter-parties to Dan Etete’s OPL 245 fraud transaction. On the wording of ‘obligor’ that the daft Muhammed Adoke as attorney general inserted, ex-President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan may just be one of the two ‘counter-parties’ now under investigation for money-laundering in the United States of America for wangling out a whopping $1.2 billion Arabakpura Thanks a lot! … and Jonathan is a good and Peaceful man! sammyctu ode When the people of A country vote for a president it’s cos they have faith and confidence in him to ensure that the interest of that country is well protected by that president. However it’s not the case with Jonathan he chose his personal greedy corrupt immature interest over that of Nigeria thereby giving away one of the most priced assets of Nigeria to foreign companies and a few evil Nigerians. As far as i am concerned Jonathan is a rouge thief an immature boy who should have never be president of Nigeria. He must be indicted for this OPL 245 corruption cos without his instructions and approval this corruption saga would never have occurred. emmanuel Osinbade should note that this Oil Block cannot go to any foolani man – period. It must remain in the South South. Those who have handled his visits and the negotiations should inform him. Nigeria must re-open the processes of all Oil blocks allocated in the past or renewed by Buhari last year. They all suffered same fate, so they cannot make the World believe that this is the only one that went through payment of commissions or cuts. Sheer hypocrisy. Buhari’s Magu should re-open the blocks held by Indimi, one of the considerations for the latest marriage; since that automatically remove IBB from the picture (After Mohammed and Indimi’s daughter broke up – the initial seal on the block). Abi dem think say Nigerians dey blind? emmanuel Shhhhhhhh, all Oil blocks allocated from Buhari in 1985 to Obj went through very similar process. Those who transact in the Oil sector and finace Industry know this. You can demonise Jonathan, but what is done here is similar hype that sent Jonathan from office. The SS cannot be the weeping child all the time. We all suffered the back lash in Crude shut-in from February 2016 to February 2017. When it relates to foolani and Yoruba, it is a no discuss issue, but once it is South South and Igbo, then the media is deployed to malign. Shell and Eni are fighting back, because they know that all other blocks traded in the past by any other IOC had same thing, including Buhari new in-laws’.

News Reader How Adoke, Etete, Alhaji Abubakar and General Gusau robbed Nigeria “(MILAN, Oct 1). Italian prosecutors investigating state-backed firm Eni SpA over the purchase of a Nigerian oil field three years ago allege that at least half of the $1.1 billion paid was used to bribe local politicians, intermediaries and others, according to official documents and a person close to the investigation. The Malabu oil scam, which has been under investigation for over four years, relates to the billions of dollars paid by oil giants, Shell and ENI, into a Federal Government account for OPL 245, considered the richest oil block in Africa. The money was allegedly diverted by Adoke and paid into private accounts. Alhaji Abubakar Aliyu, who is the Chairman of the A. A.

We dey hear “Without competitive tendering and with full, unconditional exemption from all national taxes, the OPL 245 block was bought illegally in contravention of domestic laws. In total, $801.5 million was allegedly transferred to Etete’s Malabu accounts; and $466 million out of the amount was used for remunerating government officials, including Jonathan and Alison-Madueke. A suspected “agent” of Jonathan, named Abubakar Aliyu, is alleged to have withdrawn a further $54 million and beneficiaries of the money went on a shopping spree buying property, aeroplanes, armoured cars.” ……..Italy Prosecutors’ filed charges in Italian Court (December, 2016) The Revolutionaries @shahokaya:disqus There’s no peaceful way to resolve Nigeria’s theft crisis. Blood must flow. No country can move forward surrounded by heinous thefts – of stolen money, stolen lands, stolen cars, and stolen status. All treasury thieves in Nigeria now need to be physically attacked and killed. The families of treasury thieves – wives and children – must also be swiftly laid to rest in perfect peace since they are not entitled to inherit stolen assets under any written will. The thefts since October 1st 1960 must all be brought to revolutionary justice on the streets under the death penalty in the Constitution. The deciders of who shall get the death penalty will be the youths – armed as ordinary citizens and formed into cells as well-organized militias. In 30 days of swift and bloody justice on the streets, the story of corruption will end in Nigeria for the grave-diggers to then bury the remains of those consumed by the people’s revolution. Nigerians may delay or dither over this final solution but that is what’s going to happen. The longer it is delayed, the worse for the country now stolen into darkness. Sanssouci We all get ur point but pls consider the following: 1) mohammed bello adoke, aliyu abubakar and aliyu gusau are all northern muslims, and all neck deep in this shit. 2)if indimi, alakija and danjuma all got their oil blocks by performing international fraud why have international authorities not gone after them in the past? 3) since u have facts about indimi, alakija, danjuma that most of us dont, why didnt u urge GEJ to go after them when he was at helm of affairs? 4) doesnt it bother u one bit that a bloc containing 9.23 billion barrels probable reserves was sold for 1.1billion$ at a time a barrel was higher than 100$? Do u sincerely think dan ete and GEJ worked in SS people’s interest in doing so? speechtherapy With due respect bros, there are many sides to this transaction that you and the public in general are unaware of but sadly are quick to jump to judgment about. For one thing, it was not the GEJ govt that agreed a settlement with Malabu, it was OBJs government but were unable to implement it because Shell took them to court to stop it. In fact Shell was close to securing a claim of $2B against the Nigerian govt for same. I work in the oil industry and have followed this case from the onset, the real crime here does in no way include withholding money from the Nigeria purse, in fact the Nigerian govt got $201M in signature bonus themselves instead of the original $20M it had charged for same. Like I said, too many sides to this, I suggest we wait till the court cases commence. Forensics @shahokaya:disqus How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering Goodluck Jonathan may just have been led by the nose into a deadly minefield of international moneylaundering by his usually moronic attorney-general, Adoke Muhammed, but alas, Jonathan may not exit this criminal tangle for the next 20 years, just as Dan Etete himself has not exited it since the year 1998. Goodluck Jonathan is his own undoing. He is a slow thinker and a bad decider of sensible options. Even in his choice of attorney-general he picked the most atrocious of the 100,000 lawyers on offer. Now he has to stew in his own juices. He doesn’t deserve any sympathy. It is even a crime of abetment of felony to support Jonathan over this OPL 245. Were both Jonathan and Adoke possessed of average intelligence the duo could have easily resolved the Malabu Oil tussle with Shell Oil company over OPL 245 without their getting implicated, as has happened, in moneylaundering offences at home and abroad, following from the very daft options both men selected. But see. Adoke does not know the law and Jonathan too does not know the logic. Forensics …….(2) How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering It was Goodluck Jonathan who authorised that Eni Oil company pay $1.1billion. into JP Morgan’s New York bank account of Nigeria’s NNPC state oil company to disguise it as official payment. Within weeks Jonathan then authorised that the entire funds be transferred to JP Morgan’s branch in London en route Dan Etete; where the loot was then shared out to seven criminal co-conspirators, including a Russian citizen. Already the Italians have signaled intention to subpoena Dan Etete for trial. The currently filed case in Nigeria will not preclude simultaneous criminal trial in Italy because no double jeopardy doctrine is legally invocable for distinct criminal offences committed in two different jurisdictions. Dan Etete himself is now frustrated and flustered and has begun to squeal on his accomplices. Dan Etete has said late last year that $800 million out of the $1.1 billion bribe money was pocketed by other people in the deal, as he only took $250million. That means he will now be ready to squeal on all those other people who spirited away the $800million., most likely including Goodluck Jonathan and General Aliyu Gusau whom Italian investigators have specifically fingerpointed in the charges filed in court in Milan, Italy, to begin the criminal prosecution of all the bribe-takers. Reckoned in historical years, Dan Etete who practically stole OPL 245 (by corrupt self-award as Petroleum Minister) has been struggling in vain since the year 1998 to get away with the 250 million dollars loot he got from his criminal brace, but he’s only got more entangled as defendant in severe criminal prosecutions; both in Italy and Nigeria. Even in his self-chosen profession of looting Dan Etete is a failure after 20 years of failing to run away from his own crime scene. But now, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Adoke Muhammed may become Dan Etete’s heirs or successors, and locked into this criminal case with him; having been his privies in the daft conspiracy to coax Eni oil company in Italy to fork out the $1.1billion. Pastor J.J.Jones “The love of money is the root of all evil; which, while some coveted after, they erred from faith and pierced themselves with sorrows. For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro, of those who seek death. There are thorns and snares on the path of the crooked. One who guards himself prudently will stay far from the crooked”.

Kaykay @shahokaya:disqus : Goodluck Ebele Jonathan did not have any spatial awareness in office or ever understood the duties and functions of the office of president he occupied by chance and happenstance. He was lost in space and lost in thoughts unable to think anything through. Goodluck Jonathan left no moral legacy behind but instead left a wrecked country tossed all around in criminal docks for high crimes and untold thefts. ::????????

The EFCC had in December filed related charges against two former Nigerian ministers, Mohammed Adoke and Dan Etete, and others after concluding investigations on the 2011 controversial‎ sale of OPL 245. The alleged fraud committed by the ex-Nigerian officials and officials of the oil firms, has also led to investigations and charges in Italy. The EFCC had also secured a court order ensuring the return of the OPL 245 to the Nigerian government, pending the determination of the court case against the defendants. Although Shell and ENI have appealed that court order obtained on January 26, both companies were not charged for their roles by the Nigerian government until Thursday. The defendants according to the fresh charge include the Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited; Nigerian Agip Exploration Limited; ENI SPA: the then directors of the oil firms, Ralph Wetzels, Casula Roberto, Pujati Stefeno, and Burrafato Sebastiano; Dauzia Lauya also known as Dan Etete;Mohammed Adoke; Aliyu Abubakar, and Malabu Oil and Gas Limited. ‎Messrs Casula and Etete were also among those ‎indicted‎ by Italian prosecutors who have indicated their intentions to file charges against them. According to the charges filed on Thursday, the defendants were accused of committing the crime of conspiracy to commit felony against the provisions of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences, ICPC, Act. The oil firms and their then directors were also alleged to have fraudulently paid $801 million to Messrs. Adoke, Etete, Aliyu, and Malabu for the oil block. OPL 245 is considered one of Nigeria’s richest oil blocks and estimated to contain over nine billion barrels of crude. Investigations had revealed that former President Goodluck Jonathan ordered the handing over of OPL 245 to Malabu, shortly after assuming office in 2010. According to investigations, Mr. Jonathan asked the then Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke, to solidify the transfer of OPL 245 to Malabu, a company then controlled by a fellow Nigerian from the Niger-Delta region, Dan Etete. Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block. Based on advice from desperate businessmen, including an Israeli, Ednan Agaev, Mr. Etete decided to cash in on the block. Through various middlemen, the former minister approached oil giants, Shell and ENI, to buy the block. Knowing Mr. Etete’s history, including the fact that he had been convicted in France for money laundering, the oil firms would not do a direct deal. For the transaction to continue, a legally recognised mediator would have to be found. That mediator turned out to be the Nigerian government, represented by Mr. Adoke. The agreements that were sealed led to Shell and ENI paying the $1.1 billion into a Nigerian government account in JP Morgan Chase in London. The money was to then be transferred to Malabu accounts controlled by Mr. Etete. Although Shell and ENI have repeatedly claimed they did not know the money was going to end up with Malabu, investigations in Nigeria and Italy as well as leaked documents revealed that claim to be false. Mr. Adoke himself would later admit that he, on behalf of the federal government, only acted as a mediator for two willing parties – Malabu and the oil majors. Mr. Adoke was, however, aware of the various fraudulent manipulations of Malabu by Mr. Etete when he authorised the transaction, multiple sources have told PREMIUM TIMES. TRANSFERS TO FRAUDULENT FIRMS To ensure no one stopped the shady transfer of the $1.1 billion to Mr. Etete, the money had to be quickly transferred. More so, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was set to assume office as Nigeria’s Finance Minister and the officials involved were not sure she would play ball. On August 16, 2011, a day before Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala was to assume office, Mr. Adoke and the then Minister of State for Finance, Yerima Ngama, authorised the transfer of the money to Malabu accounts in Nigeria controlled by Mr. Adoke. However, all the $1.1 billion could not be transferred. Emeka Obi, a man who claimed he helped broker the deal between Malabu and the oil majors filed a suit in the UK, that ensured $215 million was frozen of the money. The remaining $801 million was subsequently transferred to Mr. Etete: $400 million was transferred to a Bank PHB account while $401 million was transferred to a First Bank account. Immediately Mr. Etete received the money, curious transfers began. PREMIUM TIMES investigations, now confirmed by the EFCC, reveal that shady companies linked to Abubakar Aliyu received about $479 million dollars from Mr. Etete. Our investigations later showed that most of the companies were non-existent and used fake addresses in their registration documents. The companies – Rocky Top Resource Ltd, Imperial Union Ltd, Novel Properties & Dev. Co. Ltd, A-Group Construction Ltd, and Megatech Engineering Ltd – were all charged in the suit filed by the EFCC last December. While Mr. Etete later admitted that only $250 million of the money paid into his account was his, Mr. Aliyu is believed to have acted as a front for officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration, including Mr. Adoke.

City Lawyers @arabakpura:disqus Mohammed Adoke could be ex-President Jonathan’s Achilles’ heel for assuring Jonathan and the general public that no criminal or civil liability would follow Jonathan’s private business as A BROKER of a private deal between SHELL OIL and MALABU OIL on the illegal sale of OPL 245 under the table in criminal side-step of Nigeria’s Off-Shore and Petroleum laws. Mohammed Adoke, an ignorant fellow, was of course dead wrong on point of law. He said the federal government – i.e. President Jonathan – merely acted as an ‘obligor’ – to sound confident that no liability would ensue. But an obligor does not mean an innocent bystander in law but rather means a full participant as counter-party to a transaction. In June 2015, the United States Justice Department in Washington D.C said it has begun criminal investigation of two counter-parties to Dan Etete’s OPL 245 fraud transaction. On the wording of ‘obligor’ that the daft Muhammed Adoke as attorney general inserted, ex-President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan may just be one of the two ‘counter-parties’ now under investigation for money-laundering in the United States of America for wangling out a whopping $1.2 billion Arabakpura Thanks a lot! … and Jonathan is a good and Peaceful man! sammyctu ode When the people of A country vote for a president it’s cos they have faith and confidence in him to ensure that the interest of that country is well protected by that president. However it’s not the case with Jonathan he chose his personal greedy corrupt immature interest over that of Nigeria thereby giving away one of the most priced assets of Nigeria to foreign companies and a few evil Nigerians. As far as i am concerned Jonathan is a rouge thief an immature boy who should have never be president of Nigeria. He must be indicted for this OPL 245 corruption cos without his instructions and approval this corruption saga would never have occurred. emmanuel Osinbade should note that this Oil Block cannot go to any foolani man – period. It must remain in the South South. Those who have handled his visits and the negotiations should inform him. Nigeria must re-open the processes of all Oil blocks allocated in the past or renewed by Buhari last year. They all suffered same fate, so they cannot make the World believe that this is the only one that went through payment of commissions or cuts. Sheer hypocrisy. Buhari’s Magu should re-open the blocks held by Indimi, one of the considerations for the latest marriage; since that automatically remove IBB from the picture (After Mohammed and Indimi’s daughter broke up – the initial seal on the block). Abi dem think say Nigerians dey blind? emmanuel Shhhhhhhh, all Oil blocks allocated from Buhari in 1985 to Obj went through very similar process. Those who transact in the Oil sector and finace Industry know this. You can demonise Jonathan, but what is done here is similar hype that sent Jonathan from office. The SS cannot be the weeping child all the time. We all suffered the back lash in Crude shut-in from February 2016 to February 2017.

Forensics …….(2) How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering It was Goodluck Jonathan who authorised that Eni Oil company pay $1.1billion. into JP Morgan’s New York bank account of Nigeria’s NNPC state oil company to disguise it as official payment. Within weeks Jonathan then authorised that the entire funds be transferred to JP Morgan’s branch in London en route Dan Etete; where the loot was then shared out to seven criminal co-conspirators, including a Russian citizen. Already the Italians have signaled intention to subpoena Dan Etete for trial. The currently filed case in Nigeria will not preclude simultaneous criminal trial in Italy because no double jeopardy doctrine is legally invocable for distinct criminal offences committed in two different jurisdictions. Dan Etete himself is now frustrated and flustered and has begun to squeal on his accomplices. Dan Etete has said late last year that $800 million out of the $1.1 billion bribe money was pocketed by other people in the deal, as he only took $250million. That means he will now be ready to squeal on all those other people who spirited away the $800million., most likely including Goodluck Jonathan and General Aliyu Gusau whom Italian investigators have specifically fingerpointed in the charges filed in court in Milan, Italy, to begin the criminal prosecution of all the bribe-takers. Reckoned in historical years, Dan Etete who practically stole OPL 245 (by corrupt self-award as Petroleum Minister) has been struggling in vain since the year 1998 to get away with the 250 million dollars loot he got from his criminal brace, but he’s only got more entangled as defendant in severe criminal prosecutions; both in Italy and Nigeria. Even in his self-chosen profession of looting Dan Etete is a failure after 20 years of failing to run away from his own crime scene.

The EFCC had in December filed related charges against two former Nigerian ministers, Mohammed Adoke and Dan Etete, and others after concluding investigations on the 2011 controversial‎ sale of OPL 245. The alleged fraud committed by the ex-Nigerian officials and officials of the oil firms, has also led to investigations and charges in Italy. The EFCC had also secured a court order ensuring the return of the OPL 245 to the Nigerian government, pending the determination of the court case against the defendants. Although Shell and ENI have appealed that court order obtained on January 26, both companies were not charged for their roles by the Nigerian government until Thursday. The defendants according to the fresh charge include the Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited; Nigerian Agip Exploration Limited; ENI SPA: the then directors of the oil firms, Ralph Wetzels, Casula Roberto, Pujati Stefeno, and Burrafato Sebastiano; Dauzia Lauya also known as Dan Etete;Mohammed Adoke; Aliyu Abubakar, and Malabu Oil and Gas Limited. ‎Messrs Casula and Etete were also among those ‎indicted‎ by Italian prosecutors who have indicated their intentions to file charges against them. According to the charges filed on Thursday, the defendants were accused of committing the crime of conspiracy to commit felony against the provisions of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences, ICPC, Act. The oil firms and their then directors were also alleged to have fraudulently paid $801 million to Messrs. Adoke, Etete, Aliyu, and Malabu for the oil block. OPL 245 is considered one of Nigeria’s richest oil blocks and estimated to contain over nine billion barrels of crude. Investigations had revealed that former President Goodluck Jonathan ordered the handing over of OPL 245 to Malabu, shortly after assuming office in 2010. According to investigations, Mr. Jonathan asked the then Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke, to solidify the transfer of OPL 245 to Malabu, a company then controlled by a fellow Nigerian from the Niger-Delta region, Dan Etete. Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block. Based on advice from desperate businessmen, including an Israeli, Ednan Agaev, Mr. Etete decided to cash in on the block. Through various middlemen, the former minister approached oil giants, Shell and ENI, to buy the block. Knowing Mr. Etete’s history, including the fact that he had been convicted in France for money laundering, the oil firms would not do a direct deal. For the transaction to continue, a legally recognised mediator would have to be found. That mediator turned out to be the Nigerian government, represented by Mr. Adoke. The agreements that were sealed led to Shell and ENI paying the $1.1 billion into a Nigerian government account in JP Morgan Chase in London. The money was to then be transferred to Malabu accounts controlled by Mr. Etete. Although Shell and ENI have repeatedly claimed they did not know the money was going to end up with Malabu, investigations in Nigeria and Italy as well as leaked documents revealed that claim to be false. Mr. Adoke himself would later admit that he, on behalf of the federal government, only acted as a mediator for two willing parties – Malabu and the oil majors. Mr. Adoke was, however, aware of the various fraudulent manipulations of Malabu by Mr. Etete when he authorised the transaction, multiple sources have told PREMIUM TIMES. TRANSFERS TO FRAUDULENT FIRMS To ensure no one stopped the shady transfer of the $1.1 billion to Mr. Etete, the money had to be quickly transferred. More so, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was set to assume office as Nigeria’s Finance Minister and the officials involved were not sure she would play ball. On August 16, 2011, a day before Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala was to assume office, Mr. Adoke and the then Minister of State for Finance, Yerima Ngama, authorised the transfer of the money to Malabu accounts in Nigeria controlled by Mr. Adoke. However, all the $1.1 billion could not be transferred. Emeka Obi, a man who claimed he helped broker the deal between Malabu and the oil majors filed a suit in the UK, that ensured $215 million was frozen of the money. The remaining $801 million was subsequently transferred to Mr. Etete: $400 million was transferred to a Bank PHB account while $401 million was transferred to a First Bank account. Immediately Mr. Etete received the money, curious transfers began. PREMIUM TIMES investigations, now confirmed by the EFCC, reveal that shady companies linked to Abubakar Aliyu received about $479 million dollars from Mr. Etete. Our investigations later showed that most of the companies were non-existent and used fake addresses in their registration documents. The companies – Rocky Top Resource Ltd, Imperial Union Ltd, Novel Properties & Dev. Co. Ltd, A-Group Construction Ltd, and Megatech Engineering Ltd – were all charged in the suit filed by the EFCC last December. While Mr. Etete later admitted that only $250 million of the money paid into his account was his, Mr. Aliyu is believed to have acted as a front for officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration, including Mr. Adoke.

City Lawyers @arabakpura:disqus Mohammed Adoke could be ex-President Jonathan’s Achilles’ heel for assuring Jonathan and the general public that no criminal or civil liability would follow Jonathan’s private business as A BROKER of a private deal between SHELL OIL and MALABU OIL on the illegal sale of OPL 245 under the table in criminal side-step of Nigeria’s Off-Shore and Petroleum laws. Mohammed Adoke, an ignorant fellow, was of course dead wrong on point of law. He said the federal government – i.e. President Jonathan – merely acted as an ‘obligor’ – to sound confident that no liability would ensue. But an obligor does not mean an innocent bystander in law but rather means a full participant as counter-party to a transaction. In June 2015, the United States Justice Department in Washington D.C said it has begun criminal investigation of two counter-parties to Dan Etete’s OPL 245 fraud transaction. On the wording of ‘obligor’ that the daft Muhammed Adoke as attorney general inserted, ex-President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan may just be one of the two ‘counter-parties’ now under investigation for money-laundering in the United States of America for wangling out a whopping $1.2 billion Arabakpura Thanks a lot! … and Jonathan is a good and Peaceful man! sammyctu ode When the people of A country vote for a president it’s cos they have faith and confidence in him to ensure that the interest of that country is well protected by that president. However it’s not the case with Jonathan he chose his personal greedy corrupt immature interest over that of Nigeria thereby giving away one of the most priced assets of Nigeria to foreign companies and a few evil Nigerians. As far as i am concerned Jonathan is a rouge thief an immature boy who should have never be president of Nigeria. He must be indicted for this OPL 245 corruption cos without his instructions and approval this corruption saga would never have occurred. emmanuel Osinbade should note that this Oil Block cannot go to any foolani man – period. It must remain in the South South. Those who have handled his visits and the negotiations should inform him. Nigeria must re-open the processes of all Oil blocks allocated in the past or renewed by Buhari last year. They all suffered same fate, so they cannot make the World believe that this is the only one that went through payment of commissions or cuts. Sheer hypocrisy. Buhari’s Magu should re-open the blocks held by Indimi, one of the considerations for the latest marriage; since that automatically remove IBB from the picture (After Mohammed and Indimi’s daughter broke up – the initial seal on the block). Abi dem think say Nigerians dey blind? emmanuel Shhhhhhhh, all Oil blocks allocated from Buhari in 1985 to Obj went through very similar process.

The EFCC had in December filed related charges against two former Nigerian ministers, Mohammed Adoke and Dan Etete, and others after concluding investigations on the 2011 controversial‎ sale of OPL 245. The alleged fraud committed by the ex-Nigerian officials and officials of the oil firms, has also led to investigations and charges in Italy. The EFCC had also secured a court order ensuring the return of the OPL 245 to the Nigerian government, pending the determination of the court case against the defendants. Although Shell and ENI have appealed that court order obtained on January 26, both companies were not charged for their roles by the Nigerian government until Thursday. The defendants according to the fresh charge include the Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited; Nigerian Agip Exploration Limited; ENI SPA: the then directors of the oil firms, Ralph Wetzels, Casula Roberto, Pujati Stefeno, and Burrafato Sebastiano; Dauzia Lauya also known as Dan Etete;Mohammed Adoke; Aliyu Abubakar, and Malabu Oil and Gas Limited. ‎Messrs Casula and Etete were also among those ‎indicted‎ by Italian prosecutors who have indicated their intentions to file charges against them. According to the charges filed on Thursday, the defendants were accused of committing the crime of conspiracy to commit felony against the provisions of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences, ICPC, Act. The oil firms and their then directors were also alleged to have fraudulently paid $801 million to Messrs. Adoke, Etete, Aliyu, and Malabu for the oil block. OPL 245 is considered one of Nigeria’s richest oil blocks and estimated to contain over nine billion barrels of crude. Investigations had revealed that former President Goodluck Jonathan ordered the handing over of OPL 245 to Malabu, shortly after assuming office in 2010. According to investigations, Mr. Jonathan asked the then Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke, to solidify the transfer of OPL 245 to Malabu, a company then controlled by a fellow Nigerian from the Niger-Delta region, Dan Etete. Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block. Based on advice from desperate businessmen, including an Israeli, Ednan Agaev, Mr. Etete decided to cash in on the block. Through various middlemen, the former minister approached oil giants, Shell and ENI, to buy the block. Knowing Mr. Etete’s history, including the fact that he had been convicted in France for money laundering, the oil firms would not do a direct deal. For the transaction to continue, a legally recognised mediator would have to be found. That mediator turned out to be the Nigerian government, represented by Mr. Adoke. The agreements that were sealed led to Shell and ENI paying the $1.1 billion into a Nigerian government account in JP Morgan Chase in London. The money was to then be transferred to Malabu accounts controlled by Mr. Etete. Although Shell and ENI have repeatedly claimed they did not know the money was going to end up with Malabu, investigations in Nigeria and Italy as well as leaked documents revealed that claim to be false. Mr. Adoke himself would later admit that he, on behalf of the federal government, only acted as a mediator for two willing parties – Malabu and the oil majors. Mr. Adoke was, however, aware of the various fraudulent manipulations of Malabu by Mr. Etete when he authorised the transaction, multiple sources have told PREMIUM TIMES. TRANSFERS TO FRAUDULENT FIRMS To ensure no one stopped the shady transfer of the $1.1 billion to Mr. Etete, the money had to be quickly transferred. More so, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was set to assume office as Nigeria’s Finance Minister and the officials involved were not sure she would play ball. On August 16, 2011, a day before Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala was to assume office, Mr. Adoke and the then Minister of State for Finance, Yerima Ngama, authorised the transfer of the money to Malabu accounts in Nigeria controlled by Mr. Adoke. However, all the $1.1 billion could not be transferred. Emeka Obi, a man who claimed he helped broker the deal between Malabu and the oil majors filed a suit in the UK, that ensured $215 million was frozen of the money. The remaining $801 million was subsequently transferred to Mr. Etete: $400 million was transferred to a Bank PHB account while $401 million was transferred to a First Bank account. Immediately Mr. Etete received the money, curious transfers began. PREMIUM TIMES investigations, now confirmed by the EFCC, reveal that shady companies linked to Abubakar Aliyu received about $479 million dollars from Mr. Etete. Our investigations later showed that most of the companies were non-existent and used fake addresses in their registration documents. The companies – Rocky Top Resource Ltd, Imperial Union Ltd, Novel Properties & Dev. Co. Ltd, A-Group Construction Ltd, and Megatech Engineering Ltd – were all charged in the suit filed by the EFCC last December. While Mr. Etete later admitted that only $250 million of the money paid into his account was his, Mr. Aliyu is believed to have acted as a front for officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration, including Mr. Adoke.

News Reader How Adoke, Etete, Alhaji Abubakar and General Gusau robbed Nigeria “(MILAN, Oct 1). Italian prosecutors investigating state-backed firm Eni SpA over the purchase of a Nigerian oil field three years ago allege that at least half of the $1.1 billion paid was used to bribe local politicians, intermediaries and others, according to official documents and a person close to the investigation. The Malabu oil scam, which has been under investigation for over four years, relates to the billions of dollars paid by oil giants, Shell and ENI, into a Federal Government account for OPL 245, considered the richest oil block in Africa. The money was allegedly diverted by Adoke and paid into private accounts. Alhaji Abubakar Aliyu, who is the Chairman of the A. A. Group and Rocky Top Services, allegedly received $336,456,906.78.” emmanuel Was Indimi, Mai Deribe, Theophlus Danjuma and the severl foolanis ans Southerners used as their fronts for all other Oil block IOC’s? They all registered their companies to acquire the Oil blocks. Please tell us another story. Etete was Oil Minister, Alakija was a hair dresser, Indimi was a commodity trader, Danjuma was a soldier. nonsense! We dey hear “Without competitive tendering and with full, unconditional exemption from all national taxes, the OPL 245 block was bought illegally in contravention of domestic laws. In total, $801.5 million was allegedly transferred to Etete’s Malabu accounts; and $466 million out of the amount was used for remunerating government officials, including Jonathan and Alison-Madueke. A suspected “agent” of Jonathan, named Abubakar Aliyu, is alleged to have withdrawn a further $54 million and beneficiaries of the money went on a shopping spree buying property, aeroplanes, armoured cars.” ……..Italy Prosecutors’ filed charges in Italian Court (December, 2016) The Revolutionaries @shahokaya:disqus There’s no peaceful way to resolve Nigeria’s theft crisis. Blood must flow. No country can move forward surrounded by heinous thefts – of stolen money, stolen lands, stolen cars, and stolen status. All treasury thieves in Nigeria now need to be physically attacked and killed. The families of treasury thieves – wives and children – must also be swiftly laid to rest in perfect peace since they are not entitled to inherit stolen assets under any written will. The thefts since October 1st 1960 must all be brought to revolutionary justice on the streets under the death penalty in the Constitution. The deciders of who shall get the death penalty will be the youths – armed as ordinary citizens and formed into cells as well-organized militias. In 30 days of swift and bloody justice on the streets, the story of corruption will end in Nigeria for the grave-diggers to then bury the remains of those consumed by the people’s revolution. Nigerians may delay or dither over this final solution but that is what’s going to happen. The longer it is delayed, the worse for the country now stolen into darkness. Sanssouci We all get ur point but pls consider the following: 1) mohammed bello adoke, aliyu abubakar and aliyu gusau are all northern muslims, and all neck deep in this shit. 2)if indimi, alakija and danjuma all got their oil blocks by performing international fraud why have international authorities not gone after them in the past? 3) since u have facts about indimi, alakija, danjuma that most of us dont, why didnt u urge GEJ to go after them when he was at helm of affairs? 4) doesnt it bother u one bit that a bloc containing 9.23 billion barrels probable reserves was sold for 1.1billion$ at a time a barrel was higher than 100$? Do u sincerely think dan ete and GEJ worked in SS people’s interest in doing so? speechtherapy With due respect bros, there are many sides to this transaction that you and the public in general are unaware of but sadly are quick to jump to judgment about. For one thing, it was not the GEJ govt that agreed a settlement with Malabu, it was OBJs government but were unable to implement it because Shell took them to court to stop it. In fact Shell was close to securing a claim of $2B against the Nigerian govt for same. I work in the oil industry and have followed this case from the onset, the real crime here does in no way include withholding money from the Nigeria purse, in fact the Nigerian govt got $201M in signature bonus themselves instead of the original $20M it had charged for same. Like I said, too many sides to this, I suggest we wait till the court cases commence. Forensics @shahokaya:disqus How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering Goodluck Jonathan may just have been led by the nose into a deadly minefield of international moneylaundering by his usually moronic attorney-general, Adoke Muhammed, but alas, Jonathan may not exit this criminal tangle for the next 20 years, just as Dan Etete himself has not exited it since the year 1998. Goodluck Jonathan is his own undoing. He is a slow thinker and a bad decider of sensible options. Even in his choice of attorney-general he picked the most atrocious of the 100,000 lawyers on offer. Now he has to stew in his own juices. He doesn’t deserve any sympathy. It is even a crime of abetment of felony to support Jonathan over this OPL 245. Were both Jonathan and Adoke possessed of average intelligence the duo could have easily resolved the Malabu Oil tussle with Shell Oil company over OPL 245 without their getting implicated, as has happened, in moneylaundering offences at home and abroad, following from the very daft options both men selected. But see. Adoke does not know the law and Jonathan too does not know the logic. Forensics …….(2) How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering It was Goodluck Jonathan who authorised that Eni Oil company pay $1.1billion. into JP Morgan’s New York bank account of Nigeria’s NNPC state oil company to disguise it as official payment. Within weeks Jonathan then authorised that the entire funds be transferred to JP Morgan’s branch in London en route Dan Etete; where the loot was then shared out to seven criminal co-conspirators, including a Russian citizen. Already the Italians have signaled intention to subpoena Dan Etete for trial. The currently filed case in Nigeria will not preclude simultaneous criminal trial in Italy because no double jeopardy doctrine is legally invocable for distinct criminal offences committed in two different jurisdictions. Dan Etete himself is now frustrated and flustered and has begun to squeal on his accomplices. Dan Etete has said late last year that $800 million out of the $1.1 billion bribe money was pocketed by other people in the deal, as he only took $250million. That means he will now be ready to squeal on all those other people who spirited away the $800million., most likely including Goodluck Jonathan and General Aliyu Gusau whom Italian investigators have specifically fingerpointed in the charges filed in court in Milan, Italy, to begin the criminal prosecution of all the bribe-takers. Reckoned in historical years, Dan Etete who practically stole OPL 245 (by corrupt self-award as Petroleum Minister) has been struggling in vain since the year 1998 to get away with the 250 million dollars loot he got from his criminal brace, but he’s only got more entangled as defendant in severe criminal prosecutions; both in Italy and Nigeria. Even in his self-chosen profession of looting Dan Etete is a failure after 20 years of failing to run away from his own crime scene. But now, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Adoke Muhammed may become Dan Etete’s heirs or successors, and locked into this criminal case with him; having been his privies in the daft conspiracy to coax Eni oil company in Italy to fork out the $1.1billion. Pastor J.J.Jones “The love of money is the root of all evil; which, while some coveted after, they erred from faith and pierced themselves with sorrows. For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro, of those who seek death. There are thorns and snares on the path of the crooked. One who guards himself prudently will stay far from the crooked”.

Kaykay @shahokaya:disqus : Goodluck Ebele Jonathan did not have any spatial awareness in office or ever understood the duties and functions of the office of president he occupied by chance and happenstance. He was lost in space and lost in thoughts unable to think anything through. Goodluck Jonathan left no moral legacy behind but instead left a wrecked country tossed all around in criminal docks for high crimes and untold thefts. ::????????

News Reader How Adoke, Etete, Alhaji Abubakar and General Gusau robbed Nigeria “(MILAN, Oct 1). Italian prosecutors investigating state-backed firm Eni SpA over the purchase of a Nigerian oil field three years ago allege that at least half of the $1.1 billion paid was used to bribe local politicians, intermediaries and others, according to official documents and a person close to the investigation. The Malabu oil scam, which has been under investigation for over four years, relates to the billions of dollars paid by oil giants, Shell and ENI, into a Federal Government account for OPL 245, considered the richest oil block in Africa. The money was allegedly diverted by Adoke and paid into private accounts. Alhaji Abubakar Aliyu, who is the Chairman of the A. A. Group and Rocky Top Services, allegedly received $336,456,906.78.” emmanuel Was Indimi, Mai Deribe, Theophlus Danjuma and the severl foolanis ans Southerners used as their fronts for all other Oil block IOC’s? They all registered their companies to acquire the Oil blocks. Please tell us another story. Etete was Oil Minister, Alakija was a hair dresser, Indimi was a commodity trader, Danjuma was a soldier. nonsense! We dey hear “Without competitive tendering and with full, unconditional exemption from all national taxes, the OPL 245 block was bought illegally in contravention of domestic laws. In total, $801.5 million was allegedly transferred to Etete’s Malabu accounts; and $466 million out of the amount was used for remunerating government officials, including Jonathan and Alison-Madueke. A suspected “agent” of Jonathan, named Abubakar Aliyu, is alleged to have withdrawn a further $54 million and beneficiaries of the money went on a shopping spree buying property, aeroplanes, armoured cars.” ……..Italy Prosecutors’ filed charges in Italian Court (December, 2016) The Revolutionaries @shahokaya:disqus There’s no peaceful way to resolve Nigeria’s theft crisis. Blood must flow. No country can move forward surrounded by heinous thefts – of stolen money, stolen lands, stolen cars, and stolen status. All treasury thieves in Nigeria now need to be physically attacked and killed. The families of treasury thieves – wives and children – must also be swiftly laid to rest in perfect peace since they are not entitled to inherit stolen assets under any written will. The thefts since October 1st 1960 must all be brought to revolutionary justice on the streets under the death penalty in the Constitution. The deciders of who shall get the death penalty will be the youths – armed as ordinary citizens and formed into cells as well-organized militias. In 30 days of swift and bloody justice on the streets, the story of corruption will end in Nigeria for the grave-diggers to then bury the remains of those consumed by the people’s revolution. Nigerians may delay or dither over this final solution but that is what’s going to happen. The longer it is delayed, the worse for the country now stolen into darkness. Sanssouci We all get ur point but pls consider the following: 1) mohammed bello adoke, aliyu abubakar and aliyu gusau are all northern muslims, and all neck deep in this shit. 2)if indimi, alakija and danjuma all got their oil blocks by performing international fraud why have international authorities not gone after them in the past? 3) since u have facts about indimi, alakija, danjuma that most of us dont, why didnt u urge GEJ to go after them when he was at helm of affairs? 4) doesnt it bother u one bit that a bloc containing 9.23 billion barrels probable reserves was sold for 1.1billion$ at a time a barrel was higher than 100$? Do u sincerely think dan ete and GEJ worked in SS people’s interest in doing so? speechtherapy With due respect bros, there are many sides to this transaction that you and the public in general are unaware of but sadly are quick to jump to judgment about. For one thing, it was not the GEJ govt that agreed a settlement with Malabu, it was OBJs government but were unable to implement it because Shell took them to court to stop it. In fact Shell was close to securing a claim of $2B against the Nigerian govt for same. I work in the oil industry and have followed this case from the onset, the real crime here does in no way include withholding money from the Nigeria purse, in fact the Nigerian govt got $201M in signature bonus themselves instead of the original $20M it had charged for same. Like I said, too many sides to this, I suggest we wait till the court cases commence. Forensics @shahokaya:disqus How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering Goodluck Jonathan may just have been led by the nose into a deadly minefield of international moneylaundering by his usually moronic attorney-general, Adoke Muhammed, but alas, Jonathan may not exit this criminal tangle for the next 20 years, just as Dan Etete himself has not exited it since the year 1998. Goodluck Jonathan is his own undoing. He is a slow thinker and a bad decider of sensible options. Even in his choice of attorney-general he picked the most atrocious of the 100,000 lawyers on offer. Now he has to stew in his own juices. He doesn’t deserve any sympathy. It is even a crime of abetment of felony to support Jonathan over this OPL 245. Were both Jonathan and Adoke possessed of average intelligence the duo could have easily resolved the Malabu Oil tussle with Shell Oil company over OPL 245 without their getting implicated, as has happened, in moneylaundering offences at home and abroad, following from the very daft options both men selected. But see. Adoke does not know the law and Jonathan too does not know the logic. Forensics …….(2) How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering It was Goodluck Jonathan who authorised that Eni Oil company pay $1.1billion. into JP Morgan’s New York bank account of Nigeria’s NNPC state oil company to disguise it as official payment. Within weeks Jonathan then authorised that the entire funds be transferred to JP Morgan’s branch in London en route Dan Etete; where the loot was then shared out to seven criminal co-conspirators, including a Russian citizen. Already the Italians have signaled intention to subpoena Dan Etete for trial. The currently filed case in Nigeria will not preclude simultaneous criminal trial in Italy because no double jeopardy doctrine is legally invocable for distinct criminal offences committed in two different jurisdictions. Dan Etete himself is now frustrated and flustered and has begun to squeal on his accomplices. Dan Etete has said late last year that $800 million out of the $1.1 billion bribe money was pocketed by other people in the deal, as he only took $250million. That means he will now be ready to squeal on all those other people who spirited away the $800million., most likely including Goodluck Jonathan and General Aliyu Gusau whom Italian investigators have specifically fingerpointed in the charges filed in court in Milan, Italy, to begin the criminal prosecution of all the bribe-takers. Reckoned in historical years, Dan Etete who practically stole OPL 245 (by corrupt self-award as Petroleum Minister) has been struggling in vain since the year 1998 to get away with the 250 million dollars loot he got from his criminal brace, but he’s only got more entangled as defendant in severe criminal prosecutions; both in Italy and Nigeria. Even in his self-chosen profession of looting Dan Etete is a failure after 20 years of failing to run away from his own crime scene. But now, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Adoke Muhammed may become Dan Etete’s heirs or successors, and locked into this criminal case with him; having been his privies in the daft conspiracy to coax Eni oil company in Italy to fork out the $1.1billion. Pastor J.J.Jones “The love of money is the root of all evil; which, while some coveted after, they erred from faith and pierced themselves with sorrows. For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro, of those who seek death. There are thorns and snares on the path of the crooked. One who guards himself prudently will stay far from the crooked”.

Kaykay @shahokaya:disqus : Goodluck Ebele Jonathan did not have any spatial awareness in office or ever understood the duties and functions of the office of president he occupied by chance and happenstance. He was lost in space and lost in thoughts unable to think anything through. Goodluck Jonathan left no moral legacy behind but instead left a wrecked country tossed all around in criminal docks for high crimes and untold thefts. ::????????

The EFCC had in December filed related charges against two former Nigerian ministers, Mohammed Adoke and Dan Etete, and others after concluding investigations on the 2011 controversial‎ sale of OPL 245. The alleged fraud committed by the ex-Nigerian officials and officials of the oil firms, has also led to investigations and charges in Italy. The EFCC had also secured a court order ensuring the return of the OPL 245 to the Nigerian government, pending the determination of the court case against the defendants. Although Shell and ENI have appealed that court order obtained on January 26, both companies were not charged for their roles by the Nigerian government until Thursday. The defendants according to the fresh charge include the Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited; Nigerian Agip Exploration Limited; ENI SPA: the then directors of the oil firms, Ralph Wetzels, Casula Roberto, Pujati Stefeno, and Burrafato Sebastiano; Dauzia Lauya also known as Dan Etete;Mohammed Adoke; Aliyu Abubakar, and Malabu Oil and Gas Limited. ‎Messrs Casula and Etete were also among those ‎indicted‎ by Italian prosecutors who have indicated their intentions to file charges against them. According to the charges filed on Thursday, the defendants were accused of committing the crime of conspiracy to commit felony against the provisions of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences, ICPC, Act. The oil firms and their then directors were also alleged to have fraudulently paid $801 million to Messrs. Adoke, Etete, Aliyu, and Malabu for the oil block. OPL 245 is considered one of Nigeria’s richest oil blocks and estimated to contain over nine billion barrels of crude. Investigations had revealed that former President Goodluck Jonathan ordered the handing over of OPL 245 to Malabu, shortly after assuming office in 2010. According to investigations, Mr. Jonathan asked the then Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke, to solidify the transfer of OPL 245 to Malabu, a company then controlled by a fellow Nigerian from the Niger-Delta region, Dan Etete. Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block. Based on advice from desperate businessmen, including an Israeli, Ednan Agaev, Mr. Etete decided to cash in on the block. Through various middlemen, the former minister approached oil giants, Shell and ENI, to buy the block. Knowing Mr. Etete’s history, including the fact that he had been convicted in France for money laundering, the oil firms would not do a direct deal. For the transaction to continue, a legally recognised mediator would have to be found. That mediator turned out to be the Nigerian government, represented by Mr. Adoke. The agreements that were sealed led to Shell and ENI paying the $1.1 billion into a Nigerian government account in JP Morgan Chase in London. The money was to then be transferred to Malabu accounts controlled by Mr. Etete. Although Shell and ENI have repeatedly claimed they did not know the money was going to end up with Malabu, investigations in Nigeria and Italy as well as leaked documents revealed that claim to be false. Mr. Adoke himself would later admit that he, on behalf of the federal government, only acted as a mediator for two willing parties – Malabu and the oil majors. Mr. Adoke was, however, aware of the various fraudulent manipulations of Malabu by Mr. Etete when he authorised the transaction, multiple sources have told PREMIUM TIMES. TRANSFERS TO FRAUDULENT FIRMS To ensure no one stopped the shady transfer of the $1.1 billion to Mr. Etete, the money had to be quickly transferred. More so, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was set to assume office as Nigeria’s Finance Minister and the officials involved were not sure she would play ball. On August 16, 2011, a day before Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala was to assume office, Mr. Adoke and the then Minister of State for Finance, Yerima Ngama, authorised the transfer of the money to Malabu accounts in Nigeria controlled by Mr. Adoke. However, all the $1.1 billion could not be transferred. Emeka Obi, a man who claimed he helped broker the deal between Malabu and the oil majors filed a suit in the UK, that ensured $215 million was frozen of the money. The remaining $801 million was subsequently transferred to Mr. Etete: $400 million was transferred to a Bank PHB account while $401 million was transferred to a First Bank account. Immediately Mr. Etete received the money, curious transfers began. PREMIUM TIMES investigations, now confirmed by the EFCC, reveal that shady companies linked to Abubakar Aliyu received about $479 million dollars from Mr. Etete. Our investigations later showed that most of the companies were non-existent and used fake addresses in their registration documents. The companies – Rocky Top Resource Ltd, Imperial Union Ltd, Novel Properties & Dev. Co. Ltd, A-Group Construction Ltd, and Megatech Engineering Ltd – were all charged in the suit filed by the EFCC last December. While Mr. Etete later admitted that only $250 million of the money paid into his account was his, Mr. Aliyu is believed to have acted as a front for officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration, including Mr. Adoke.

City Lawyers @arabakpura:disqus Mohammed Adoke could be ex-President Jonathan’s Achilles’ heel for assuring Jonathan and the general public that no criminal or civil liability would follow Jonathan’s private business as A BROKER of a private deal between SHELL OIL and MALABU OIL on the illegal sale of OPL 245 under the table in criminal side-step of Nigeria’s Off-Shore and Petroleum laws. Mohammed Adoke, an ignorant fellow, was of course dead wrong on point of law. He said the federal government – i.e. President Jonathan – merely acted as an ‘obligor’ – to sound confident that no liability would ensue. But an obligor does not mean an innocent bystander in law but rather means a full participant as counter-party to a transaction. In June 2015, the United States Justice Department in Washington D.C said it has begun criminal investigation of two counter-parties to Dan Etete’s OPL 245 fraud transaction. On the wording of ‘obligor’ that the daft Muhammed Adoke as attorney general inserted, ex-President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan may just be one of the two ‘counter-parties’ now under investigation for money-laundering in the United States of America for wangling out a whopping $1.2 billion Arabakpura Thanks a lot! … and Jonathan is a good and Peaceful man! sammyctu ode When the people of A country vote for a president it’s cos they have faith and confidence in him to ensure that the interest of that country is well protected by that president. However it’s not the case with Jonathan he chose his personal greedy corrupt immature interest over that of Nigeria thereby giving away one of the most priced assets of Nigeria to foreign companies and a few evil Nigerians. As far as i am concerned Jonathan is a rouge thief an immature boy who should have never be president of Nigeria. He must be indicted for this OPL 245 corruption cos without his instructions and approval this corruption saga would never have occurred. emmanuel Osinbade should note that this Oil Block cannot go to any foolani man – period. It must remain in the South South. Those who have handled his visits and the negotiations should inform him. Nigeria must re-open the processes of all Oil blocks allocated in the past or renewed by Buhari last year. They all suffered same fate, so they cannot make the World believe that this is the only one that went through payment of commissions or cuts. Sheer hypocrisy. Buhari’s Magu should re-open the blocks held by Indimi, one of the considerations for the latest marriage; since that automatically remove IBB from the picture (After Mohammed and Indimi’s daughter broke up – the initial seal on the block). Abi dem think say Nigerians dey blind? emmanuel Shhhhhhhh, all Oil blocks allocated from Buhari in 1985 to Obj went through very similar process. Those who transact in the Oil sector and finace Industry know this. You can demonise Jonathan, but what is done here is similar hype that sent Jonathan from office. The SS cannot be the weeping child all the time. We all suffered the back lash in Crude shut-in from February 2016 to February 2017. When it relates to foolani and Yoruba, it is a no discuss issue, but once it is South South and Igbo, then the media is deployed to malign. Shell and Eni are fighting back, because they know that all other blocks traded in the past by any other IOC had same thing, including Buhari new in-laws’.

News Reader How Adoke, Etete, Alhaji Abubakar and General Gusau robbed Nigeria “(MILAN, Oct 1). Italian prosecutors investigating state-backed firm Eni SpA over the purchase of a Nigerian oil field three years ago allege that at least half of the $1.1 billion paid was used to bribe local politicians, intermediaries and others, according to official documents and a person close to the investigation. The Malabu oil scam, which has been under investigation for over four years, relates to the billions of dollars paid by oil giants, Shell and ENI, into a Federal Government account for OPL 245, considered the richest oil block in Africa. The money was allegedly diverted by Adoke and paid into private accounts. Alhaji Abubakar Aliyu, who is the Chairman of the A. A.

They all registered their companies to acquire the Oil blocks. Please tell us another story.

We dey hear “Without competitive tendering and with full, unconditional exemption from all national taxes, the OPL 245 block was bought illegally in contravention of domestic laws. In total, $801.5 million was allegedly transferred to Etete’s Malabu accounts; and $466 million out of the amount was used for remunerating government officials, including Jonathan and Alison-Madueke. A suspected “agent” of Jonathan, named Abubakar Aliyu, is alleged to have withdrawn a further $54 million and beneficiaries of the money went on a shopping spree buying property, aeroplanes, armoured cars.” ……..Italy Prosecutors’ filed charges in Italian Court (December, 2016) The Revolutionaries @shahokaya:disqus There’s no peaceful way to resolve Nigeria’s theft crisis. Blood must flow. No country can move forward surrounded by heinous thefts – of stolen money, stolen lands, stolen cars, and stolen status. All treasury thieves in Nigeria now need to be physically attacked and killed. The families of treasury thieves – wives and children – must also be swiftly laid to rest in perfect peace since they are not entitled to inherit stolen assets under any written will. The thefts since October 1st 1960 must all be brought to revolutionary justice on the streets under the death penalty in the Constitution. The deciders of who shall get the death penalty will be the youths – armed as ordinary citizens and formed into cells as well-organized militias. In 30 days of swift and bloody justice on the streets, the story of corruption will end in Nigeria for the grave-diggers to then bury the remains of those consumed by the people’s revolution. Nigerians may delay or dither over this final solution but that is what’s going to happen. The longer it is delayed, the worse for the country now stolen into darkness. Sanssouci We all get ur point but pls consider the following: 1) mohammed bello adoke, aliyu abubakar and aliyu gusau are all northern muslims, and all neck deep in this shit. 2)if indimi, alakija and danjuma all got their oil blocks by performing international fraud why have international authorities not gone after them in the past? 3) since u have facts about indimi, alakija, danjuma that most of us dont, why didnt u urge GEJ to go after them when he was at helm of affairs? 4) doesnt it bother u one bit that a bloc containing 9.23 billion barrels probable reserves was sold for 1.1billion$ at a time a barrel was higher than 100$? Do u sincerely think dan ete and GEJ worked in SS people’s interest in doing so? speechtherapy With due respect bros, there are many sides to this transaction that you and the public in general are unaware of but sadly are quick to jump to judgment about. For one thing, it was not the GEJ govt that agreed a settlement with Malabu, it was OBJs government but were unable to implement it because Shell took them to court to stop it. In fact Shell was close to securing a claim of $2B against the Nigerian govt for same. I work in the oil industry and have followed this case from the onset, the real crime here does in no way include withholding money from the Nigeria purse, in fact the Nigerian govt got $201M in signature bonus themselves instead of the original $20M it had charged for same. Like I said, too many sides to this, I suggest we wait till the court cases commence. Forensics @shahokaya:disqus How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering Goodluck Jonathan may just have been led by the nose into a deadly minefield of international moneylaundering by his usually moronic attorney-general, Adoke Muhammed, but alas, Jonathan may not exit this criminal tangle for the next 20 years, just as Dan Etete himself has not exited it since the year 1998. Goodluck Jonathan is his own undoing. He is a slow thinker and a bad decider of sensible options. Even in his choice of attorney-general he picked the most atrocious of the 100,000 lawyers on offer. Now he has to stew in his own juices. He doesn’t deserve any sympathy. It is even a crime of abetment of felony to support Jonathan over this OPL 245. Were both Jonathan and Adoke possessed of average intelligence the duo could have easily resolved the Malabu Oil tussle with Shell Oil company over OPL 245 without their getting implicated, as has happened, in moneylaundering offences at home and abroad, following from the very daft options both men selected. But see. Adoke does not know the law and Jonathan too does not know the logic. Forensics …….(2) How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering It was Goodluck Jonathan who authorised that Eni Oil company pay $1.1billion. into JP Morgan’s New York bank account of Nigeria’s NNPC state oil company to disguise it as official payment. Within weeks Jonathan then authorised that the entire funds be transferred to JP Morgan’s branch in London en route Dan Etete; where the loot was then shared out to seven criminal co-conspirators, including a Russian citizen. Already the Italians have signaled intention to subpoena Dan Etete for trial. The currently filed case in Nigeria will not preclude simultaneous criminal trial in Italy because no double jeopardy doctrine is legally invocable for distinct criminal offences committed in two different jurisdictions. Dan Etete himself is now frustrated and flustered and has begun to squeal on his accomplices. Dan Etete has said late last year that $800 million out of the $1.1 billion bribe money was pocketed by other people in the deal, as he only took $250million. That means he will now be ready to squeal on all those other people who spirited away the $800million., most likely including Goodluck Jonathan and General Aliyu Gusau whom Italian investigators have specifically fingerpointed in the charges filed in court in Milan, Italy, to begin the criminal prosecution of all the bribe-takers. Reckoned in historical years, Dan Etete who practically stole OPL 245 (by corrupt self-award as Petroleum Minister) has been struggling in vain since the year 1998 to get away with the 250 million dollars loot he got from his criminal brace, but he’s only got more entangled as defendant in severe criminal prosecutions; both in Italy and Nigeria. Even in his self-chosen profession of looting Dan Etete is a failure after 20 years of failing to run away from his own crime scene. But now, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Adoke Muhammed may become Dan Etete’s heirs or successors, and locked into this criminal case with him; having been his privies in the daft conspiracy to coax Eni oil company in Italy to fork out the $1.1billion. Pastor J.J.Jones “The love of money is the root of all evil; which, while some coveted after, they erred from faith and pierced themselves with sorrows. For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro, of those who seek death. There are thorns and snares on the path of the crooked. One who guards himself prudently will stay far from the crooked”.

Kaykay @shahokaya:disqus : Goodluck Ebele Jonathan did not have any spatial awareness in office or ever understood the duties and functions of the office of president he occupied by chance and happenstance. He was lost in space and lost in thoughts unable to think anything through.

US stocks pull back; Snap surges in debut Money Friday 3 March 2017 - 6:58am File: Analysts said a pullback in the broader market was to be expected after US stocks gained more than one percent in a heady session Wednesday that left all three indices at records. Photo: EPA NEW YORK - Wall Street stocks retreated from records Thursday amid weakness in energy and financial shares, while Snapchat owner Snap Inc. surged in its first day of trading. Analysts said a pullback in the broader market was to be expected after US stocks gained more than one percent in a heady session Wednesday that left all three indices at records. "A lot of it has to do with that move yesterday," said Bill Lynch, director of investment at Hinsdale Associates. "I think it's just a simple case of profit taking today given the large move in major stock averages yesterday."

Leading banking shares, which had piled on more than three percent Wednesday, were among the biggest losers, with JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America falling more than one percent. Energy shares also fell on lower oil prices. Snap, parent of the instant messaging service Snapchat, jumped 44 percent after raising $3.4 billion, in the richest US tech company listing since Facebook in 2012. The company saw its share price end its debut trading session at $24.48 well above its initial price of $17.

The EFCC had in December filed related charges against two former Nigerian ministers, Mohammed Adoke and Dan Etete, and others after concluding investigations on the 2011 controversial‎ sale of OPL 245. The alleged fraud committed by the ex-Nigerian officials and officials of the oil firms, has also led to investigations and charges in Italy. The EFCC had also secured a court order ensuring the return of the OPL 245 to the Nigerian government, pending the determination of the court case against the defendants. Although Shell and ENI have appealed that court order obtained on January 26, both companies were not charged for their roles by the Nigerian government until Thursday. The defendants according to the fresh charge include the Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited; Nigerian Agip Exploration Limited; ENI SPA: the then directors of the oil firms, Ralph Wetzels, Casula Roberto, Pujati Stefeno, and Burrafato Sebastiano; Dauzia Lauya also known as Dan Etete;Mohammed Adoke; Aliyu Abubakar, and Malabu Oil and Gas Limited. ‎Messrs Casula and Etete were also among those ‎indicted‎ by Italian prosecutors who have indicated their intentions to file charges against them. According to the charges filed on Thursday, the defendants were accused of committing the crime of conspiracy to commit felony against the provisions of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences, ICPC, Act. The oil firms and their then directors were also alleged to have fraudulently paid $801 million to Messrs. Adoke, Etete, Aliyu, and Malabu for the oil block. OPL 245 is considered one of Nigeria’s richest oil blocks and estimated to contain over nine billion barrels of crude. Investigations had revealed that former President Goodluck Jonathan ordered the handing over of OPL 245 to Malabu, shortly after assuming office in 2010. According to investigations, Mr. Jonathan asked the then Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke, to solidify the transfer of OPL 245 to Malabu, a company then controlled by a fellow Nigerian from the Niger-Delta region, Dan Etete. Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block. Based on advice from desperate businessmen, including an Israeli, Ednan Agaev, Mr. Etete decided to cash in on the block. Through various middlemen, the former minister approached oil giants, Shell and ENI, to buy the block. Knowing Mr. Etete’s history, including the fact that he had been convicted in France for money laundering, the oil firms would not do a direct deal. For the transaction to continue, a legally recognised mediator would have to be found. That mediator turned out to be the Nigerian government, represented by Mr. Adoke. The agreements that were sealed led to Shell and ENI paying the $1.1 billion into a Nigerian government account in JP Morgan Chase in London. The money was to then be transferred to Malabu accounts controlled by Mr. Etete. Although Shell and ENI have repeatedly claimed they did not know the money was going to end up with Malabu, investigations in Nigeria and Italy as well as leaked documents revealed that claim to be false. Mr. Adoke himself would later admit that he, on behalf of the federal government, only acted as a mediator for two willing parties – Malabu and the oil majors. Mr. Adoke was, however, aware of the various fraudulent manipulations of Malabu by Mr. Etete when he authorised the transaction, multiple sources have told PREMIUM TIMES. TRANSFERS TO FRAUDULENT FIRMS To ensure no one stopped the shady transfer of the $1.1 billion to Mr. Etete, the money had to be quickly transferred. More so, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was set to assume office as Nigeria’s Finance Minister and the officials involved were not sure she would play ball. On August 16, 2011, a day before Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala was to assume office, Mr. Adoke and the then Minister of State for Finance, Yerima Ngama, authorised the transfer of the money to Malabu accounts in Nigeria controlled by Mr. Adoke. However, all the $1.1 billion could not be transferred. Emeka Obi, a man who claimed he helped broker the deal between Malabu and the oil majors filed a suit in the UK, that ensured $215 million was frozen of the money. The remaining $801 million was subsequently transferred to Mr. Etete: $400 million was transferred to a Bank PHB account while $401 million was transferred to a First Bank account. Immediately Mr. Etete received the money, curious transfers began. PREMIUM TIMES investigations, now confirmed by the EFCC, reveal that shady companies linked to Abubakar Aliyu received about $479 million dollars from Mr. Etete. Our investigations later showed that most of the companies were non-existent and used fake addresses in their registration documents. The companies – Rocky Top Resource Ltd, Imperial Union Ltd, Novel Properties & Dev. Co. Ltd, A-Group Construction Ltd, and Megatech Engineering Ltd – were all charged in the suit filed by the EFCC last December. While Mr. Etete later admitted that only $250 million of the money paid into his account was his, Mr. Aliyu is believed to have acted as a front for officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration, including Mr. Adoke.

City Lawyers @arabakpura:disqus Mohammed Adoke could be ex-President Jonathan’s Achilles’ heel for assuring Jonathan and the general public that no criminal or civil liability would follow Jonathan’s private business as A BROKER of a private deal between SHELL OIL and MALABU OIL on the illegal sale of OPL 245 under the table in criminal side-step of Nigeria’s Off-Shore and Petroleum laws. Mohammed Adoke, an ignorant fellow, was of course dead wrong on point of law. He said the federal government – i.e. President Jonathan – merely acted as an ‘obligor’ – to sound confident that no liability would ensue. But an obligor does not mean an innocent bystander in law but rather means a full participant as counter-party to a transaction. In June 2015, the United States Justice Department in Washington D.C said it has begun criminal investigation of two counter-parties to Dan Etete’s OPL 245 fraud transaction. On the wording of ‘obligor’ that the daft Muhammed Adoke as attorney general inserted, ex-President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan may just be one of the two ‘counter-parties’ now under investigation for money-laundering in the United States of America for wangling out a whopping $1.2 billion Arabakpura Thanks a lot! … and Jonathan is a good and Peaceful man! sammyctu ode When the people of A country vote for a president it’s cos they have faith and confidence in him to ensure that the interest of that country is well protected by that president. However it’s not the case with Jonathan he chose his personal greedy corrupt immature interest over that of Nigeria thereby giving away one of the most priced assets of Nigeria to foreign companies and a few evil Nigerians. As far as i am concerned Jonathan is a rouge thief an immature boy who should have never be president of Nigeria. He must be indicted for this OPL 245 corruption cos without his instructions and approval this corruption saga would never have occurred. emmanuel Osinbade should note that this Oil Block cannot go to any foolani man – period. It must remain in the South South. Those who have handled his visits and the negotiations should inform him. Nigeria must re-open the processes of all Oil blocks allocated in the past or renewed by Buhari last year. They all suffered same fate, so they cannot make the World believe that this is the only one that went through payment of commissions or cuts. Sheer hypocrisy. Buhari’s Magu should re-open the blocks held by Indimi, one of the considerations for the latest marriage; since that automatically remove IBB from the picture (After Mohammed and Indimi’s daughter broke up – the initial seal on the block). Abi dem think say Nigerians dey blind? emmanuel Shhhhhhhh, all Oil blocks allocated from Buhari in 1985 to Obj went through very similar process. Those who transact in the Oil sector and finace Industry know this. You can demonise Jonathan, but what is done here is similar hype that sent Jonathan from office. The SS cannot be the weeping child all the time. We all suffered the back lash in Crude shut-in from February 2016 to February 2017. When it relates to foolani and Yoruba, it is a no discuss issue, but once it is South South and Igbo, then the media is deployed to malign. Shell and Eni are fighting back, because they know that all other blocks traded in the past by any other IOC had same thing, including Buhari new in-laws’.

News Reader How Adoke, Etete, Alhaji Abubakar and General Gusau robbed Nigeria “(MILAN, Oct 1). Italian prosecutors investigating state-backed firm Eni SpA over the purchase of a Nigerian oil field three years ago allege that at least half of the $1.1 billion paid was used to bribe local politicians, intermediaries and others, according to official documents and a person close to the investigation. The Malabu oil scam, which has been under investigation for over four years, relates to the billions of dollars paid by oil giants, Shell and ENI, into a Federal Government account for OPL 245, considered the richest oil block in Africa. The money was allegedly diverted by Adoke and paid into private accounts. Alhaji Abubakar Aliyu, who is the Chairman of the A. A. Group and Rocky Top Services, allegedly received $336,456,906.78.” emmanuel Was Indimi, Mai Deribe, Theophlus Danjuma and the severl foolanis ans Southerners used as their fronts for all other Oil block IOC’s? They all registered their companies to acquire the Oil blocks. Please tell us another story. Etete was Oil Minister, Alakija was a hair dresser, Indimi was a commodity trader, Danjuma was a soldier. nonsense! We dey hear “Without competitive tendering and with full, unconditional exemption from all national taxes, the OPL 245 block was bought illegally in contravention of domestic laws. In total, $801.5 million was allegedly transferred to Etete’s Malabu accounts; and $466 million out of the amount was used for remunerating government officials, including Jonathan and Alison-Madueke. A suspected “agent” of Jonathan, named Abubakar Aliyu, is alleged to have withdrawn a further $54 million and beneficiaries of the money went on a shopping spree buying property, aeroplanes, armoured cars.” ……..Italy Prosecutors’ filed charges in Italian Court (December, 2016) The Revolutionaries @shahokaya:disqus There’s no peaceful way to resolve Nigeria’s theft crisis. Blood must flow. No country can move forward surrounded by heinous thefts – of stolen money, stolen lands, stolen cars, and stolen status. All treasury thieves in Nigeria now need to be physically attacked and killed. The families of treasury thieves – wives and children – must also be swiftly laid to rest in perfect peace since they are not entitled to inherit stolen assets under any written will. The thefts since October 1st 1960 must all be brought to revolutionary justice on the streets under the death penalty in the Constitution. The deciders of who shall get the death penalty will be the youths – armed as ordinary citizens and formed into cells as well-organized militias. In 30 days of swift and bloody justice on the streets, the story of corruption will end in Nigeria for the grave-diggers to then bury the remains of those consumed by the people’s revolution. Nigerians may delay or dither over this final solution but that is what’s going to happen. The longer it is delayed, the worse for the country now stolen into darkness. Sanssouci We all get ur point but pls consider the following: 1) mohammed bello adoke, aliyu abubakar and aliyu gusau are all northern muslims, and all neck deep in this shit. 2)if indimi, alakija and danjuma all got their oil blocks by performing international fraud why have international authorities not gone after them in the past? 3) since u have facts about indimi, alakija, danjuma that most of us dont, why didnt u urge GEJ to go after them when he was at helm of affairs? 4) doesnt it bother u one bit that a bloc containing 9.23 billion barrels probable reserves was sold for 1.1billion$ at a time a barrel was higher than 100$? Do u sincerely think dan ete and GEJ worked in SS people’s interest in doing so? speechtherapy With due respect bros, there are many sides to this transaction that you and the public in general are unaware of but sadly are quick to jump to judgment about. For one thing, it was not the GEJ govt that agreed a settlement with Malabu, it was OBJs government but were unable to implement it because Shell took them to court to stop it. In fact Shell was close to securing a claim of $2B against the Nigerian govt for same. I work in the oil industry and have followed this case from the onset, the real crime here does in no way include withholding money from the Nigeria purse, in fact the Nigerian govt got $201M in signature bonus themselves instead of the original $20M it had charged for same. Like I said, too many sides to this, I suggest we wait till the court cases commence. Forensics @shahokaya:disqus How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering Goodluck Jonathan may just have been led by the nose into a deadly minefield of international moneylaundering by his usually moronic attorney-general, Adoke Muhammed, but alas, Jonathan may not exit this criminal tangle for the next 20 years, just as Dan Etete himself has not exited it since the year 1998. Goodluck Jonathan is his own undoing. He is a slow thinker and a bad decider of sensible options. Even in his choice of attorney-general he picked the most atrocious of the 100,000 lawyers on offer. Now he has to stew in his own juices. He doesn’t deserve any sympathy. It is even a crime of abetment of felony to support Jonathan over this OPL 245. Were both Jonathan and Adoke possessed of average intelligence the duo could have easily resolved the Malabu Oil tussle with Shell Oil company over OPL 245 without their getting implicated, as has happened, in moneylaundering offences at home and abroad, following from the very daft options both men selected. But see. Adoke does not know the law and Jonathan too does not know the logic. Forensics …….(2) How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering It was Goodluck Jonathan who authorised that Eni Oil company pay $1.1billion. into JP Morgan’s New York bank account of Nigeria’s NNPC state oil company to disguise it as official payment. Within weeks Jonathan then authorised that the entire funds be transferred to JP Morgan’s branch in London en route Dan Etete; where the loot was then shared out to seven criminal co-conspirators, including a Russian citizen. Already the Italians have signaled intention to subpoena Dan Etete for trial. The currently filed case in Nigeria will not preclude simultaneous criminal trial in Italy because no double jeopardy doctrine is legally invocable for distinct criminal offences committed in two different jurisdictions. Dan Etete himself is now frustrated and flustered and has begun to squeal on his accomplices. Dan Etete has said late last year that $800 million out of the $1.1 billion bribe money was pocketed by other people in the deal, as he only took $250million. That means he will now be ready to squeal on all those other people who spirited away the $800million., most likely including Goodluck Jonathan and General Aliyu Gusau whom Italian investigators have specifically fingerpointed in the charges filed in court in Milan, Italy, to begin the criminal prosecution of all the bribe-takers. Reckoned in historical years, Dan Etete who practically stole OPL 245 (by corrupt self-award as Petroleum Minister) has been struggling in vain since the year 1998 to get away with the 250 million dollars loot he got from his criminal brace, but he’s only got more entangled as defendant in severe criminal prosecutions; both in Italy and Nigeria. Even in his self-chosen profession of looting Dan Etete is a failure after 20 years of failing to run away from his own crime scene. But now, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Adoke Muhammed may become Dan Etete’s heirs or successors, and locked into this criminal case with him; having been his privies in the daft conspiracy to coax Eni oil company in Italy to fork out the $1.1billion. Pastor J.J.Jones “The love of money is the root of all evil; which, while some coveted after, they erred from faith and pierced themselves with sorrows. For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro, of those who seek death. There are thorns and snares on the path of the crooked. One who guards himself prudently will stay far from the crooked”. Forensics Reckoned in historical years, Dan Etete who practically stole OPL 245 (by corrupt self-award as Petroleum Minister) has been struggling in vain since the year 1998 to get away with the 250 million dollars loot he got from his criminal brace, but he’s only got more entangled as defendant in severe criminal prosecutions; both in Italy and Nigeria. Even in his self-chosen profession of looting Dan Etete is a failure after 20 years of failing to run away from his own crime scene. But now, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Adoke Muhammed may become Dan Etete’s heirs or successors, and locked into this criminal case with him; having been his privies in the daft conspiracy to coax Eni oil company in Italy to fork out the $1.1billion. Kaykay @shahokaya:disqus : Goodluck Ebele Jonathan did not have any spatial awareness in office or ever understood the duties and functions of the office of president he occupied by chance and happenstance. He was lost in space and lost in thoughts unable to think anything through. Goodluck Jonathan left no moral legacy behind but instead left a wrecked country tossed all around in criminal docks for high crimes and untold thefts. ::???????? WHY DID GOODLUCK JONATHAN BRING OUT HIS NOSE FOR ADOKE TO PULL ANYHOW? Agoro ….no sense….no morals…no thinking…no gumption….no knowledge…..nothing good….. ………..Jonathan did not even occupy any space……and of course he had no weight……… ………It will continue to be a tragedy in history…..that Nigeria was ruled by a bloody buffoon……… thusspokez Day #1: EFCC files corruption charges against Shell, Eni, Adoke, others Day #2: Why EFCC filed corruption charges against Shell, Eni, Adoke, others Day #3: Shell, Eni, Adoke, others deny corruption charges Day #4: Why Shell, Eni, Adoke, others deny corruption charges Day #5: … Word on Marble @thusspokez:disqus Words on Marble: “Dan Etete himself is now frustrated and flustered and has begun to squeal on his accomplices. Dan Etete has said late last year that $800 million out of the $1.1 billion bribe money was pocketed by other people in the deal, as he only took $250million. That means he will now be ready to squeal on all those other people who spirited away the $800million., most likely including Goodluck Jonathan and General Aliyu Gusau whom Italian investigators have specifically fingerpointed in the charges filed in court in Milan, Italy, to begin the criminal prosecution of all the bribe-takers.” ……………..@Forensics Search Our Stories Number of days President Buhari has been away on sick leave Number of days President Buhari has been away on sick leaveCountup Subscribe to News via Email Enter your email address and receive notifications of news by email.

Mayo, who wrote “Exile on Wall Street: One Analyst’s Fight to Save the Big Banks From Themselves,” introduced himself as a “ free agent” Tuesday at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s annual Investor Day. He gave no indication Thursday where he might be headed next, though he noted that he’s been fired about three times in his career and resigned five times. “There’s always room for those who are good at their job,” Mayo said.

Sign Up President Donald Trump has called for a moratorium on new rules so existing measures can be reviewed, and he’s signed directives aimed at starting the process of rolling back restrictions put in place to prevent another financial crisis. Among his targets are rules that guard against predatory lenders and force brokers to lower fees for retirees, as well as the Dodd-Frank Act, the sweeping overhaul of U.S. financial regulation put in place after the financial crisis. “My message to Washington, D.C., is: Don’t sacrifice one iota of the strength of the banking industry,” Mayo said. “But once you’ve done that, eliminate all the red tape, the complications. I mean, you have seven different regulators overseeing mortgage finance. That’s just too many.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Analysts said a pullback in the broader market was to be expected after US stocks gained more than one percent in a heady session Wednesday that left all three indices at records. "A lot of it has to do with that move yesterday," said Bill Lynch, director of investment at Hinsdale Associates. "I think it's just a simple case of profit taking today given the large move in major stock averages yesterday." The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.5 percent to close at 21,002.97 after breaking through 21,000 for the first time Wednesday. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 0.6 percent to end the day at 2,381.90, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.7 percent to finish at 5,861.22. Leading banking shares, which had piled on more than three percent Wednesday, were among the biggest losers, with JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America falling more than one percent. Energy shares also fell on lower oil prices. Snap, parent of the instant messaging service Snapchat, jumped 44 percent after raising $3.4 billion, in the richest US tech company listing since Facebook in 2012. The company saw its share price end its debut trading session at $24.48 well above its initial price of $17. Dow member Caterpillar slumped 4.3 percent after federal investigators descended on the industrial giant's facilities in and around its Peoria, Illinois headquarters. Company officials did not comment on the nature of the probe, but local media said there were officials from the Internal Revenue Service and other US agencies. Monster Beverage jumped 12.7 percent after reporting fourth quarter net income rose 24.7 percent to $172.9 million.

AmEx is announcing a new set of features for its Platinum Card, the popular charge card aimed at well-off and frequently traveling customers. Platinum Card customers will get a $200 credit on Uber and the ability to earn five points per dollar on hotels. The card is also getting a redesign and will be issued in stainless steel instead of plastic. (Photo: AP) 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE American Express Co. is escalating the rewards war for premium credit cards, offering Platinum customers $200 of free Uber rides while raising the annual fee. Redesigned in stainless steel, the card will cost new holders $550 starting on March 30, a $100 increase that will take effect for existing users when they renew after Sept. 1. It’s the first fee hike in more than a decade, according to Janey Whiteside, AmEx’s senior vice president for global charge products, benefits and services. But AmEx, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ken Chenault, is providing more sweeteners. In addition to the credit for Uber Technologies Inc.’s car-hailing service, users will be able to earn five-times rewards points at eligible hotels booked through the lender’s website. And AmEx is expanding its collection of airport lounges. The largest U.S. credit-card issuer by purchases is under pressure to defend its dominance. Rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. made a splash in August with a Sapphire Reserve card featuring an initial sign-up bonus of 100,000 points, drawing so many applicants it temporarily ran out of materials to mint it. Earlier this week, AmEx consumer services chief Doug Buckminster called the offer “a full-frontal assault” on the Platinum portfolio, noting that attrition temporarily increased among those holders after the Sapphire Reserve’s debut. “We view today’s announcement as an attempt to stop the bleeding,” Bill Carcache, a Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst who recommends investors sell AmEx shares, said Thursday in a note to investors. “A significant portion” of platinum card billings shifted to Sapphire Reserve last quarter, when AmEx “increased its investments to record levels without moving the needle on billings growth,” he wrote. AmEx shares fell 1.4 percent to $80.77 at 11:28 a.m. in New York, the worst performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Still, Whiteside said American Express’s changes are a response to customer feedback, not to competitors. The company declined to specify the new Platinum card’s sign-up bonus. “We’ve worked to refine and evolve the card,” Whiteside said in an interview. “We’re really redefining the playing field here.” Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2mymBY7 TOP VIDEOS Sen.

Equities have soared in the months since President Donald Trump's election victory, and that has some concerned about valuations. For Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, developed international and emerging markets have been the laggards in the global picture — and he thinks that's where the next opportunity is. "You're seeing a thrust in economics as well as a thrust in data, not just in the U.S. but across the pond," he said in an interview with "Power Lunch." Stocks closed lower Thursday. Just a day earlier, the major indexes posted their best day of 2017, with the Dow crossing 21,000 for the first time. Steve Rees, head of equity strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank, is "comfortable" holding onto his U.S. exposure, but thinks there are great opportunities to put new money to work in Europe. "Earnings are recovering. The valuations look attractive versus the U.S. And the economies, for the first time in a long time, are starting to look a little bit better," he told "Power Lunch." However, he acknowledged that there is political risk. For one, there is concern that if Marine Le Pen wins the presidency in France, the country could leave the European Union. "We don't want to downplay the polls or just the politics in general but what we can't do is wait for everything to be clear," said Rees. He's advising his clients to "leg in,'" or start to incrementally buy, and stay currency hedged. "Europe could surprise to the upside at some point this year," Rees said.

In what looks to be an early spring migration, Fed officials have turned very hawkish overnight, warning a rate hike is likely in mid-March, while Wall Street had been expecting a June hike. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is likely to send that message when she speaks Friday at 1 p.m. ET at the Executives' Club of Chicago, and similar comments are expected from Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer at noon. "Speaker after speaker, whether they lie on the dovish or hawkish end of the spectrum, have all shifted to the right," said Rob Martin, senior U.S. economist at Barclays. Martin said the three most important Fed officials to comment this week were New York Fed President William Dudley, Fed Gov. Lael Brainard, usually very dovish, and Fed Gov. Jerome Powell. "When the regional presidents go out and talk, they're not as coordinated. When we see two people come out from the board and give a similar message, that feels like a coordinated communication, and I expect the chair to echo those sentiments when she speaks," said Martin. Brainard and Dudley are viewed as part of the dovish core of the Fed, along with Yellen and Fischer. So, strategists and economists have come up with reasons they believe the Fed could feel compelled to get off the sidelines and begin delivering the three rate hikes it has forecast for this year. The first reason, suggested by David Ader, chief macro strategist at Informa Getty Images Federal Reserve Board Chairwoman Janet Yellen testifies before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee February 14, 2017 in Washington, DC. Financial Intelligence, is part of what he says could be the Fed's hidden agenda. Right about when the Fed would vote on a rate hike March 15, the legislated extension of the debt ceiling expires, putting Congress on notice it needs to come to a budget solution to avoid default. The government would run out of money sometime in the fall, and that's when the budget battling could really heat up in Washington. While it's widely expected the administration and Congress will work out a deal, Ader said there is also going to be a lot of discussion about other budget-related topics, such as tax reform, fiscal stimulus and how to pay for it all. "I think there's a secret agenda. If we're talking about it, they're talking about it," he said. "We could have a debt ceiling fight. … The debate and contentiousness within the Republican party, it could be severe. The Fed obviously wants to hike. It's been trying to hike." Ader changed his mind this week, and now thinks a March hike is mostly certain. "I do not think this is the main thrust of it. I think the Fed wants to hike on its own merits, but nonetheless the timing has worked out that if it's going to become an ugly fight, it's going to happen later. If you're the Fed you're going to say: 'Let's do it now because maybe will not have the chance to do it later,'" he said. With its goal of getting three hikes in this year, Ader suggests the Fed doesn't want to run its hiking to collide with that. A second reason is something Fed critics and fans alike have been concerned about for a very long time. Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan said, in a note, the Fed may be worried it is going to overshoot on full employment and fan inflation. That would mean the Fed is behind the curve, which is something that constantly nags at markets. "Recently, Fed speakers have been rhetorically asking whether the FOMC is behind the curve. While they consistently answer in the negative, the very fact they are asking the question may belie the doubts in their own heads. Even the most jerry-rigged policy rules have a hard time justifying rates where they are," writes Feroli. He notes that others have pointed to possible froth in asset markets as a warning sign that the Fed is moving too slowly. A third reason, put forth by Barclays' Martin is that the Fed has a perfect runway to land a rate hike. "What has changed is equity markets. Financial conditions have eased considerably over the last little while. The increase in the equity market hasn't been associated with an appreciation in the dollar," he said, adding the Fed funds futures also signal a rate hike. "They are going to take al ot of comfort that market pricing for the March meeting moved from something in the 30s [percent odds] to high in the 80s…We didn't get a rip in the dollar. We didn't get a step back in equities," he said. Stocks did pull back Thursday, after rallying to record highs Wednesday on the best volume of the year. The Dow was down 112 at 21,002, but yet to be seen is whether it is responding to a more than 300 point run up or concern the days of easy money are ending a little bit sooner. The Dow is up about 14.5 percent since the election. Bond yields have snapped higher in the last week, with the Fed-sensitive two-year Treasury yield dramatically higher at 1.32, the highest level since 2009. If the Fed does move as expected, and the economic data cooperates, the market will have a new dilemma when it raises rates in March. "Of course, the Fed hiking in March will increase expectations that the Fed will deliver quarterly rate hikes," noted Feroli. He expects to see the Fed raise its forecast for rate hikes in its March forecast. "It is a harder to get the median to increase to four hikes, but given the recent rhetoric that can't be ruled out," Feroli noted. He did not change his call yet, from a next hike in May, and he is waiting to hear Fischer and Yellen Friday. Besides speculating about the Fed, markets Friday will be watching ISM nonmanufacturing data at 10 a.m. ET, and Markit services PMI at 9:45 a.m. Three other Fed speakers are on the calendar besides Yellen and Fischer. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker are on a panel together at 10:15 a.m. ET, and Fed Gov. Powell is part of a roundtable at 12:15 p.m. Watch: The full Powell interview show chapters Fed governor Powell: Economy is right where it needs to be    Thursday, 2 Mar 2017 | 12:50 PM ET | 08:09 Patti DommCNBC Markets Editor Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change DJIA --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Analysts said a pullback in the broader market was to be expected after US stocks gained more than 1 per cent in a heady session on Wednesday that left all three indices at records. "A lot of it has to do with that move yesterday," said Bill Lynch, director of investment at Hinsdale Associates. "I think it's just a simple case of profit taking today given the large move in major stock averages yesterday." The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.5 per cent to close at 21,002.97 after breaking through 21,000 for the first time on Wednesday. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 0.6 per cent to end the day at 2,381.90, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.7 per cent to finish at 5,861.22. Leading banking shares, which had piled on more than three percent Wednesday, were among the biggest losers, with JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America falling more than 1 per cent. Energy shares also fell on lower oil prices. Snap, parent of the instant messaging service Snapchat, jumped 44 per cent after raising US$3.4 billion (S$4.8 billion), in the richest US tech company listing since Facebook in 2012. The company saw its share price end its debut trading session at US$24.48 well above its initial price of US$17. Dow member Caterpillar slumped 4.3 per cent after federal investigators descended on the industrial giant's facilities in and around its Peoria, Illinois headquarters. Company officials did not comment on the nature of the probe, but local media said there were officials from the Internal Revenue Service and other US agencies. Monster Beverage jumped 12.7 per cent after reporting fourth quarter net income rose 24.7 per cent to US$172.9 million.

The Dow has set 32 record highs since the election. This week, it crossed 21,000, tying a record for the shortest period between 1,000-point milestones. Now investors want to know: Will this historic rally continue, or is it destined to disappoint? A lot has to go right, in both Washington and the U.S. economy, to justify the meteoric market rise. That's because the gains on Wall Street have been built mostly on expectations and optimism, not fundamentals. Stocks are more expensive by one measure than at any time in the past dozen years, and CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index is flashing "extreme greed." Clearly, hopes for the Trump agenda of tax reform, deregulation and infrastructure spending are very high. But Trump's ambitious proposals are not even close to being implemented. The complexity of tax reform, and problems with figuring out Obamacare first, threaten to slow the process further. "The market is putting an increasingly large down payment on expectations of policy, which has a risk of not developing as hoped," said Mark Luschini, chief market strategist at Janney Capital. "The market is vulnerable to disappointment," he said. Understandably, investors are cheering a post-election spike in confidence among consumers and CEOs alike. While that's encouraging, the key for corporate earnings is whether the confidence translates into real spending -- by Americans, online and at the mall, and by CEOs on equipment, factories and workers. But there's no guarantee that spending will follow, especially considering the deep uncertainty about taxes. "All the optimism in the world doesn't change the numbers here and now," Michael Block, chief market strategist at Rhino Trading, wrote in a note to clients. "I worry that we are heading for a big letdown here." Related: Dow zooms beyond 21,000 after Trump speech The market euphoria has made stocks pricier, at least in historical terms. Based on Wednesday's close, the S&P 500 is trading at 17.9 times projected earnings, the most expensive since April 2004, according to FactSet. Even notoriously optimistic Wall Street stock pickers are struggling to keep up. Just look at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which had been calling for the S&P 500 to rise to 2,300 by year's end. But the index is already sitting at nearly 2,400. BofA upgraded its target to 2,450 this week, but it warned in a report that "elevated valuations" have created "more risks than were evident a few years ago." Luschini, who had predicted the S&P 500 would rise to 2,410, also sounds uneasy about how fast the market has risen. "We were one of the most bullish on the Street. It looked pretty ambitious back in December," Luschini said. Asked at what point he would be concerned the rally is overdone, he said, "A month ago." Related: NY Fed: 'Animal spirits' have been unleashed Much of the focus now will be on Trump's efforts to rewrite the corporate tax code. Investors are already banking on dramatic tax cuts that will translate to fatter corporate profits. Look for the Trump rally to falter if it starts to look like tax reform won't get done this year as promised. Some believe that timetable may be too ambitious, especially considering the divide over whether to adopt House Republicans' proposal for a so-called border adjustment tax, meant to encourage more companies to make things in the United States. Trump has also indicated Obamacare needs to be repealed and replaced before taxes can be tackled, but that is providing to be easier said than done. Speaking at an investor conference this week, JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said that tackling Obamacare first will "clearly delay tax [reform] and maybe make it harder to get something done." In a best-case scenario, if Obamacare comes first, tax reform will take a year, Dimon said. Wall Street is also increasingly betting on an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve later this month. If the Fed fails to deliver, it could leave investors disappointed and wondering once again: If not now, then when? And of course, the Trump rally depends on the American economy withstanding the policy uncertainty to keep corporate profits from falling. Wall Street economists are calling for U.S. growth to pick up above a 2% rate in the first quarter. However, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model was recently downgraded from 2.5% to a mere 1.8%. "I don't think the market can withstand weak economic news," Luschini said.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Mar 2, 2017 at 2:45PM Now that hedge funds have submitted their mandatory regulatory filings for the fourth quarter of last year, we can get a sense of the stocks they're buying. When it comes to bank stocks, there are four at the top of the list: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK). Based on an analysis by FactSet, a market-research firm, the 50 biggest hedge funds in the United States piled heavily into the financial sector last quarter. They did so presumably after the unexpected results of the presidential election led analysts, investors, and commentators to believe that banks could soon make a lot more money. Which bank stocks are hedge funds adding to their vaults? Image source: Getty Images. Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would "dismantle" the Dodd-Frank Act, which has dramatically increased compliance costs in the bank industry. If he were to follow through on this, not only would banks gain more operational flexibility, which could bolster revenue from existing business lines, but they'd also see their noninterest expenses decline. On top of this, many people believe that Trump's pro-business tilt will translate into faster economic growth, spurred on by tax cuts and a $1 trillion infrastructure program. If true, this would increase the demand for loans and, thus, bank revenues. Taken together, then, it seems to make sense why the market has become so optimistic about bank stocks. The sector's biggest winner in the fourth quarter was Bank of America, which accounted for nearly half of the $3.5 billion that flowed into the sector from the 50 largest hedge funds. In addition to Bank of America, three other bank stocks continue to resonate with the hedge fund industry. Bank Combined Stake of Top-50 Hedge Funds ($Millions) Change in 4Q16 ($Millions) Bank of America $4,264 +$1,463 JPMorgan Chase $3,729 +$284 Wells Fargo $2,818 +$351 Bank of New York Mellon $2,408 +$359 Data source: FactSet. This table shows the four bank stocks that rank among the 50 most popular stocks held by the hedge funds tracked by FactSet. Bank of America ranks 13th on the list, JPMorgan Chase comes in 18th, Wells Fargo 32nd, and Bank of New York Mellon ranks 43rd. Moreover, all of these banks saw an inflow of capital from the hedge fund industry in the final three months of 2016. Excluding Bank of America's enormous haul, Bank of New York Mellon was on the high end, with a $359 million inflow. Wells Fargo was next, at $351 million. And JPMorgan Chase brought up the rear, at $284 million. While these inflows help explain why bank stocks soared after the presidential election, investors should be cautious about using this data to inform investments today. Now that bank stocks are trading at multiyear highs, and in some cases all-time highs, it's probably safe to assume that the world's most sophisticated investors are no longer rabidly piling into these stocks at the same rate that they did at the end of last year.

The Dow has set 32 record highs since the election. This week, it crossed 21,000, tying a record for the shortest period between 1,000-point milestones. Now investors want to know: Will this historic rally continue, or is it destined to disappoint? A lot has to go right, in both Washington and the U.S. economy, to justify the meteoric market rise. That's because the gains on Wall Street have been built mostly on expectations and optimism, not fundamentals. Stocks are more expensive by one measure than at any time in the past dozen years, and CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index is flashing "extreme greed." Clearly, hopes for the Trump agenda of tax reform, deregulation and infrastructure spending are very high. But Trump's ambitious proposals are not even close to being implemented. The complexity of tax reform, and problems with figuring out Obamacare first, threaten to slow the process further. "The market is putting an increasingly large down payment on expectations of policy, which has a risk of not developing as hoped," said Mark Luschini, chief market strategist at Janney Capital. "The market is vulnerable to disappointment," he said. Understandably, investors are cheering a post-election spike in confidence among consumers and CEOs alike. While that's encouraging, the key for corporate earnings is whether the confidence translates into real spending -- by Americans, online and at the mall, and by CEOs on equipment, factories and workers. But there's no guarantee that spending will follow, especially considering the deep uncertainty about taxes. "All the optimism in the world doesn't change the numbers here and now," Michael Block, chief market strategist at Rhino Trading, wrote in a note to clients. "I worry that we are heading for a big letdown here." The market euphoria has made stocks pricier, at least in historical terms. Based on Wednesday's close, the S&P 500 is trading at 17.9 times projected earnings, the most expensive since April 2004, according to FactSet. Even notoriously optimistic Wall Street stock pickers are struggling to keep up. Just look at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which had been calling for the S&P 500 to rise to 2,300 by year's end. But the index is already sitting at nearly 2,400. BofA upgraded its target to 2,450 this week, but it warned in a report that "elevated valuations" have created "more risks than were evident a few years ago." Luschini, who had predicted the S&P 500 would rise to 2,410, also sounds uneasy about how fast the market has risen. "We were one of the most bullish on the Street. It looked pretty ambitious back in December," Luschini said. Asked at what point he would be concerned the rally is overdone, he said, "A month ago." Much of the focus now will be on Trump's efforts to rewrite the corporate tax code. Investors are already banking on dramatic tax cuts that will translate to fatter corporate profits. Look for the Trump rally to falter if it starts to look like tax reform won't get done this year as promised. Some believe that timetable may be too ambitious, especially considering the divide over whether to adopt House Republicans' proposal for a so-called border adjustment tax, meant to encourage more companies to make things in the United States. Trump has also indicated Obamacare needs to be repealed and replaced before taxes can be tackled, but that is providing to be easier said than done. Speaking at an investor conference this week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said that tackling Obamacare first will "clearly delay tax [reform] and maybe make it harder to get something done." In a best-case scenario, if Obamacare comes first, tax reform will take a year, Dimon said. Wall Street is also increasingly betting on an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve later this month. If the Fed fails to deliver, it could leave investors disappointed and wondering once again: If not now, then when? And of course, the Trump rally depends on the American economy withstanding the policy uncertainty to keep corporate profits from falling. Wall Street economists are calling for U.S. growth to pick up above a 2% rate in the first quarter. However, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model was recently downgraded from 2.5% to a mere 1.8%. "I don't think the market can withstand weak economic news," Luschini said. Copyright 2017 by CNN NewSource. All rights reserved.
