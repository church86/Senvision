(Reuters Photo/Kim Kyung-Hoon) By : Sujata Rao and Saikat Chatterjee | on 11:00 PM May 26, 2017 Category : International, Asia-Pacific London/Hong Kong. Record-breaking dollar bond sales from Chinese companies are steadily increasing China's weight in global indexes, raising concerns about overexposure among investors who track them. Corporates' rapid move onto offshore bond markets, partly a response to the crackdown on runaway credit growth at home, highlights China's multi-faceted indebtedness, a growing worry for investors. Overall debt is approaching 300 percent of annual economic output, or gross domestic product, and Moody's said it was the reason for cutting China's credit rating for the first time in 30 years. Stripping out maturing debt and coupon payments, year-to-date bond sales from companies in emerging markets total $65 billion including $54 billion from China, JPMorgan estimates. In gross issuance terms, almost half this year's emerging market corporate bond sales are from Chinese firms, the bank said. Company debt issuance in other emerging markets has been subdued by commodity and growth slumps. Some indexes cap the weight they give to each country but most are committed to broadly representing the market. This means that the indexes have to increase the weighting they give to China and investors whose portfolios track or benchmark an index must adjust accordingly. "It poses a challenge for global portfolios. You don't want to have too much of a good thing," said Greg Saichin, head of emerging debt at AllianzGlobal Investments. China today comprises over 20 percent of the Markit iBOXX emerging market corporate index versus 0.5 percent in 2007. In JPMorgan's Cembi Broad index too, China is 21 percent, up from less than 4 percent in 2010, while in the iBoxx corporate dollar bond index which also includes developed countries, China has crept to 8 percent, from less than one percent five years ago. Chinese firms should this year easily surpass the $108 billion debt raised in 2016 and $116 billion in 2014. In 2010, just $14 billion was issued. "It's just a juggernaut of issuance," said Guy Stear, co-head of fixed income research at Societe Generale in Paris. "It's so large that it's a game changer in terms of EM corporates [...] it's not just commodity companies, its cement, materials, internet companies, there's a broad range." The Chinese deals are mostly welcomed by money managers who need to invest the money pouring into their funds. Also, Chinese state-run firms still carry investment grade ratings, unlike issuers from many big emerging economies such as Russia, Turkey, and Brazil. "Relative to rating Chinese debt pays relatively decent yield [...] against that people are conscious that if you are running an EM credit fund you have very very high exposure to one part of the world," Stear said. Allocation Conundrum One popular solution for the allocation dilemma is "unconstrained" debt funds that are less committed to representing the market. Morningstar data showed 10 such funds focused on Asian fixed income were launched already this year by asset managers. More than 40 launched in 2016. "We are already seeing clients and investors wanting a diversified approach rather than just seeking exposure to a broad emerging market bond index," said Bryan Collins, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International in Hong Kong. Such funds can opt for less China exposure. Or they can delve down the credit curve and away from state-run firms whose close correlation with sovereign yields offers less prospect of outperformance, Collins said. Other commonly used indexes cap China's weight – JPMorgan's Cembi Broad Diversified limits the weight each country can have, while Citigroup and Bloomberg have recently launched index variations capping China exposure. "We stay with the Broad Diversified and we are comfortable with China at 8 percent to 10 percent," said Steve Cook, co-head of emerging debt at PineBridge Investments in London. Cook also noted that the $400 billion-plus market was still a fraction of the $5.7 trillion outstanding in US investment grade credit. Corporate dollar bonds also comprise a small proportion of the country's overall debt, estimated by some to be as high as $28 trillion. Cooling Down Chinese authorities were trying to cool the dollar bond boom even before the Moody's rating downgrade. Property firms for instance no longer receive new issuance quotas, Reuters has reported. Their efforts could accelerate after the Moody's downgrade and subsequent rating cuts for state-run firms should also raise borrowing costs. But bond sales are unlikely to grind to a complete halt. For one, raising cash overseas can allow companies to sidestep curbs that are in place to combat capital flight. Second, companies' total debt repayments in 2017 are estimated at 5.5 trillion yuan ($797 billion) by ratings agency China Chengxin estimates. For investment-grade Chinese firms, dollar borrowing works out some 90 basis points cheaper than on domestic markets where interest rates have risen. The spread between JP Morgan's China index and onshore AA-rated corporate debt is at its widest in two years. "If you are laden with debt, interest rates are rising and you need to roll over debt, you find the money wherever you can," said Stephen Jen, chief executive of Eurizon SLJ Capital.

Even for a banker as wealthy as him, that was a big cheque to write for the purchase - made at prices of between US$53.13 and US$53.30 for each JPMorgan share. With hindsight, the timing of his purchase proved fortuitous. At JPMorgan's Friday close of US$85.36, Mr Dimon is sitting on a tidy paper profit of more than US$16 million just 15 months after his purchase. But that had not been the only time Mr Dimon stepped in to buy JPMorgan shares in a big way to reflect the confidence he felt about the bank that he has run for more than a decade. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up In July 2012, he had bought about US$17 million worth of JPMorgan shares at prices between US$34.01 and US$34.46 apiece shortly after the bank reported a US$4.4 billion hit to quarterly earnings caused by a trading desk in London. At current market prices, that purchase would have given Mr Dimon a paper gain of US$25.6 million. For some investors, the timing of Mr Dimon's purchases offers further proof of the usefulness of closely tracking the trades of corporate insiders in order to make money on their stock portfolio. PHOTO: REUTERS JPMORGAN'S JAMIE DIMON US$26m What he spent on shares in his own firm last year. 500k Number of shares bought. US$16m What he has made in paper profit in just 15 months. There are other examples, besides Mr Dimon, of shrewd insiders who have bought into shares when their prices had been temporarily depressed by a run of bad news. In our own backyard, we have DBS Bank boss Piyush Gupta, who bought 200,000 DBS shares at $13.88 apiece in February last year as his bank's share price sank to a six-year low. That purchase had cost him almost $2.8 million - not a sum to sneeze at as well. As it turns out, that purchase has panned out well too. As the DBS share price recovered strongly, Mr Gupta sold 500,000 shares at an average price of $20.53 apiece on May 3. After the sale, he continues to hold directly and indirectly about 1.12 million DBS shares, according to a filing with the Singapore Exchange. Based on the May 3 average selling price of $20.53, this would mean that he made a profit of $1.33 million on the 200,000 DBS shares he bought on the market last year, before deducting transaction costs. Even tracking the share buybacks made by a company can serve as a "buy" signal for investors as well. Take Genting Singapore, for example. In 2015, the casino operator spent $78.12 million buying back its own shares at between 79 cents and $1.01 apiece as its share price tumbled. Queried about the scale of the share buyback during the company's annual general meeting that year, Genting's chairman Lim Kok Thay argued that the buybacks "send a signal that the company and management know best the value of the business" and urged investors to "take it from there and make their own decisions". Genting's purchases might have been a tad early as its share price continued to languish for another year or so, after it stopped its buybacks. But Genting has rebounded well above the highest price it had paid for its share buyback, as it rose by 55 per cent in the past eight months to $1.165 last Friday. Given these examples, there would appear to be a good case to be made for tracking trades made by insiders, and companies' buyback of shares. ST PHOTO: FELINE LIM DBS' PIYUSH GUPTA $2.8m What he spent buying the bank's shares last February. 200k Number of shares bought. $1.33m What he made after selling the shares on May 3, before costs. Indeed, research seems to support this observation. In a 2015 study on insider trades, researchers Josef Laksonishok and Inmoo Lee in the US noted that one reason why observing insider trades is so fruitful is that senior officers and directors are more knowledgeable about the company's direction than the investing public. What is also interesting is their observation that while purchases by insiders may flag "buy" signals, their sales may not offer a significant "sell" signal. They said: "Insiders have many reasons to sell shares but the main reason to buy shares is to make money. Only insider purchases appear to be useful, while sales are not associated with low returns." As to why insider sales are not as good an indicator, they explained that in recent years, a higher percentage of managers' wealth is tied to their companies' stocks in the form of stock options and performance shares. And that could skew the "sell" signal, as a lot of the selling could be due to the managers diversifying their stock holdings - rather than any corporate-related activities. But the two researchers' most crucial observation is that, while following the lead of insiders can serve as a check on any analysis a person can make on a stock, it should never replace fundamental research. In this respect, one conspicuous example comes to mind - embattled commodities trader Noble Group. When the company came under attack by an anonymous blogger, Iceberg Research, over its accounting practices in early 2015, its founder and then chairman, Mr Richard Elman, had been quick to try to shore up investors' confidence with hefty purchases of Noble shares. Then, between June 2015 and August 2015, the company also spent $137.67 million buying back its own shares. Genting Singapore shares rebounded well above the highest the firm paid for its share buyback, rising 55 per cent in eight months. ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG GENTING SINGAPORE $78.12m Estimated cost of shares bought back in 2015. 92.17m Number of shares bought back. $107.4m Current estimated value. But even these massive share purchases failed to halt the stampede of investors out of its shares and its share price continued to plummet. So what are we to make of these examples? In hindsight, both JPMorgan and DBS are healthy businesses and what happened early last year was that their shares had been sold off heavily against the backdrop of a wider stock market turmoil. In Noble's case, however, the company was being hobbled by a ferocious downturn in the commodities market just as Iceberg put the spotlight on its accounting practices that, in turn, focused investors' attention on whether the company could service its large debt burden. Therefore, it is important for investors to note that they should not blindly follow insiders in their trades, and not to get carried away by blockbuster insider transactions which may be aimed at catching the market's attention. Having said that, it is still important to track what insiders are doing with their shares. After all, they have access to information not known to the public - and this will, no doubt, have a bearing on when they buy or sell their company's shares.

Morgan Chase & Co. is trying to spread the word about the bank's $150 million investment in Detroit's revitalization in national advertising. Since announcing a $50 million investment increase, the New York-based bank has promoted its philanthropy and investment in newsletters from political websites Axios.com and Politico.com. One ad in Axios AM even featured a picture of Mayor Mike Duggan. A recurring Chase ad in Politico Playbook boasts: "Detroit is a case study for how the private sector can collaborate with government and community leaders to drive change." On Thursday, an ad in the Axios newsletter featured Detroit lettering artist Joseph Alessio, linking to a video of Alessio creating a wall illustration of the bank's investment lending and grants in the city. "The more we can spread that message in and outside of Detroit, the better it is for others who are looking to take some of those lessons from Detroit and apply them to their challenges — or others who are thinking about investing in Detroit," bank spokesman Steve O'Halloran said.

But ultimately, the episode was set in motion elsewhere – on Wall Street. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The pressure on United, American and other giants is only going to increase with the rise of ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit, Frontier and Allegiant.  Photo: Tim Fadek Relentless pressure on corporate America is creating an increasingly Dickensian experience for many consumers as companies focus on maximising profit. And nowhere is the trend as stark as in the airline industry, whose service is delivered in an aluminum tube packed with up to four different classes, cheek by jowl, 35,000 feet in the air. "There's always been pressure from Wall Street," says Robert Dilenschneider, a veteran public relations executive who advises companies and chief executives on strategic communications. "But I've been watching this for 30 years, and it's never been as intense as it is today." Rich bonus packages for top executives are now largely tied to short-term income targets and fatter profit margins instead of customer service. Of course, bolstering profits and in turn, stock prices has always been a big part of management's responsibility to shareholders, but making it virtually the only criterion for executive pay is new. Five years ago, American Airlines factored in on-time arrivals, lost baggage and consumer complaints to help calculate annual incentive payments for top management. Today, these bonuses are based exclusively on the company's pretax income and cost savings. Advertisement United has also scaled back bonuses linked to reliability and customer satisfaction for senior executives in recent years. But in the wake of what happened in April, bonuses "will be made more comprehensively subject to progress in 2017 on significant improvement in the customer experience," the company says in a financial filing. "Fifteen years ago, airlines competed with each other over who could buy the most planes or have the most routes," says Jamie Baker, a top airline industry analyst at JPMorgan Chase. "Executives are just as competitive today, but it's about who can achieve an investment-grade rating first, who can be a component in the S&P 500, and who has better returns for investors." These new incentives also partly explain why airlines are packing seats more densely and squeezing more passengers into the back of the plane. "Densification is driven by the desire to sweat the assets and generate revenues without having to commit capital to building new planes," Baker says. Such a shift isn't unique to the airline industry. "As in other industries, like manufacturing or consumer goods, the focus is on more traditional financial metrics like pretax income, margins, return on capital and total shareholder return," says Andrew Goldstein, head of the executive compensation practice in North America for Willis Towers Watson. "Airlines haven't abandoned operational and customer-service metrics, but they are putting less emphasis on those factors." Mature industry With the US economy growing at a rate of only 2 per cent while the stockmarket rallies on promises of soaring earnings, something must give so profit margins can grow. In the case of United or Spirit Airlines, whose repeated cancellations led to a melee among travellers this month at a terminal in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, it was customer service. At other companies, like Ford and Alcoa, it was the head of the chief executive that was served up when profits failed to meet expectations. Mature industries, where double-digit annual profit growth is a reach in the best of times, are especially vulnerable to activist investors' demands for board seats, bigger stock repurchases and other short-term financial rewards. The pressure is especially brutal in the airline industry because the key expense, fuel, is for the most part beyond management control. Yet airline executives have largely convinced Wall Street that the bad old days of bankruptcies and fare wars are over, replaced by the kind of predictable annual profits more common among industrial companies. That's among the reasons fees have popped up in recent years for everything from checking bags to securing an assigned seat before boarding. Known on Wall Street as ancillary revenue, this stream of income is especially favoured by investors because it doesn't swing sharply the way fares do. And so far, despite occasional bouts of air rage and frequent consumer complaints, Wall Street has been getting what it wants. United's stock has surged to more than $US80 per share from $US25 per share five years ago, with profit margins rising to 13.6 per cent from 3.7 per cent over the same period. Overall industry margins hit 16.3 per cent, up from 5.2 per cent in 2012. Spirit's operating margins are among the highest in the industry, topping 20 per cent in 2015 and 2016. But Paul Berry, a company spokesman, says Spirit had pivoted to focus more on customer service in the last year, even as some larger rivals keep cutting costs to compete. Despite rewarding top executives strictly according to financial targets, American says it, too, is committed to improving the passenger experience. "Every single person at American knows we succeed or fail based on how well we serve customers," says Joshua Freed, a company spokesman. "We will only meet those financial goals if we keep our customers happy." Still, the promise of steady profit growth has prompted even Warren Buffett to take a fresh look at airline stocks. He once famously called the industry a money-losing "death trap", but reversed course late last year, with his company, Berkshire Hathaway, acquiring stakes in several airlines. "In the past, airline stocks were seen as hazardous to one's wealth," says Baker, the JPMorgan analyst. "They were trading vehicles, and potential destroyers of capital." Increasing pressure The pressure on United, American and other giants is only going to increase with the rise of ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit, Frontier and Allegiant. In fact, American and United are rolling out a stripped-down new class called Basic Economy. Here, in exchange for the cheapest tickets, fliers can't choose their seats before checking in and are more likely to be stuck in the middle of the row. They board last and are less likely to be able to sit with companions. No carry-on luggage is permitted, forcing anyone without elite frequent-flier status to check anything larger than a backpack for a fee. "That's the experience on an ultra-low-cost carrier," says Rajeev Lalwani, an airline industry analyst with Morgan Stanley. As the legacy airlines introduce similar no-frills offerings to hold off upstarts like Spirit, he says, "part of the idea is to get folks to upgrade to premium economy and collect fees". It's also the wave of the future, at least for budget-conscious travellers. "For the lowest price comes the most basic product," says Alan Wise, a senior partner with the Boston Consulting Group, who leads the firm's travel and tourism practice for North America. "Spirit has been a growth story in the space, and it's forced the legacy carriers to adapt and innovate." To be sure, some industry veterans insist it is a mistake to simply blame investors or hedge-fund managers for fostering a race to the bottom in customer service. "The response isn't to Wall Street. It's to customer behaviour," says Alex Dichter, a senior partner at McKinsey who works with major airlines. "About 35 per cent of customers are choosing on price, and price alone, and another 35 per cent choose mostly on price." Dichter notes that when American added 5-10 centimetres  of leg room in economy in the early 2000s, "as far as I know, the airline didn't see one bit of improvement in market share or pricing. "The great irony is that most CEOs would love to compete on product and experience," he adds. "It's much more fun. The problem is that customers aren't paying attention to that." - New York Times How bonuses work for Australian airline executives  At Qantas, chief executive Alan Joyce gets 33 per cent of his potential pay as a fixed base salary ($2.1 million), 40 per cent from short-term incentives and 27 per cent from long-term incentives. He received full short-term and long-term bonuses in 2015-16 for a total package worth $12.9 million.  Qantas' short-term incentives are weighted across five categories: 50 per cent for underlying pre-tax profit, 20 per cent on achieving the Qantas transformation program, and 10 per cent each for safety, customer satisfaction, and growth and strategy.  At Virgin just 20 per cent of the chief executive's remuneration is fixed, 30 per cent is short-term incentives and 50 per cent is long-term incentives. Other senior executives have 25 per cent of pay fixed, and the remainder split between short-term and long-term incentives.  The short-term incentive scorecard for the CEO is 50 per cent profit, 25 per cent return on investment, 7.5 per cent each on employee and customer satisfaction and 10 per cent on safety.  Other senior executives are weighted less towards profit and more towards operational matters.  Long-term bonuses are based entirely on the return on invested capital over three years, at the board's discretion.  - Lucy Battersby Originally published on The Sydney Morning Herald as Route to air travel discomfort starts on Wall Street.

Analysts say cash brought back could be a piggy bank for company stock repurchases or acquisitions. Problem is, President Trump's economic agenda has been stalled amid White House drama. The proposed changes on "repatriated" cash are part of a bigger Trump tax reform package. Randall Stephenson, AT&T's (T) CEO, says tax reform can make it through Congress. "A lot of people are getting pessimistic because of a lot of the noise in Washington right now that tax reform may not be achieved," Stephenson said at a JPMorgan tech conference on May 23. "I am still optimistic something can still get done … bundling tax reform with an infrastructure bill would be big. I think it's achievable." Even so, one worry is that the overseas "tax holiday" for tech firms may not turn out as the bonanza it's made out to be. That depends on whether legislation puts conditions on how money could be spent and creates enforcement mechanisms. Rather than see the money go toward company stock buybacks or acquisitions, Trump and Congress could steer money toward job creation and capital spending, says a UBS analyst. "If the (Trump administration) wants to really drive inward investments within the U.S. there might have to be some sort of mandated use of cash, maybe to spend it on (capital expenditures). As yet, we do not know," UBS analyst Geoff Robinson said in a report. There's reason to think Robinson might be on the right track. "There's trillions of dollars offshore. We want to get that back into America," Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic advisor, said in a recent interview. "We want the companies to bring the money back and put it back into the economy. We want them to create jobs." Cash-rich tech companies like Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Cisco currently would pay a 35% tax on so-called "repatriated earnings." Rather than take the tax hit, they've kept the money overseas. President Trump has proposed a one-time tax of 10% on offshore earnings while the Republican-controlled House has proposed a lower 8.5% rate. The overseas tax-break that Congress passed in 2004 was called the American Jobs Creation Act, but didn't do much to stimulate the economy, analysts say. The AJCA taxed repatriated earnings at a 5.25% rate. The top five firms in bringing back cash in 2004 were drug companies Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK), as well as Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and IBM (IBM). According to the IRS, $312 billion was brought back in all. However, only 10% of companies eligible to bring back cash in 2004 did so, says Richard Lane, an analyst at Moody's Investor Service. Many companies kept cash overseas because of AJCA requirements, he said. The AJCA required companies to reinvest tax savings in worker hiring and training, infrastructure, research and development and capital projects. According to UBS, however, "Funds in 2004's repatriation may have been earmarked for capital investment but ultimately were spent in large part on share repurchases." UBS says that happened because the AJCA did not include a "tracking mechanism" so the government could audit companies and gauge compliance. The Trump administration could put better enforcement mechanisms in place. S&P 500 companies have more than $2.6 trillion in overseas cash. Some of that may be needed to continue funding foreign operations. The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, Google and Oracle (ORCL), Moody's says. While Cisco has stated any cash brought back to the U.S. could be used for reducing debt on its books, analysts have other ideas. If a tax holiday is approved, BMO Capital Markets said in a report that it "expects Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus more on acquisitions, while Apple and smaller companies would likely lean more toward capital return." In the case of Apple and Cisco, some analysts envision enough cash being brought back to fund "transformative" deals. Apple has about $250 billion in cash, growing at about $50 billion a year. About 90% of Apple's cash is overseas. A one-time, 10% repatriation tax would give Apple some $220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a report. Suva speculated that Apple could buy large companies such as Netflix (NFLX), Walt Disney (DIS) or Electronic Arts (EA). Cisco, meanwhile, could bring back up to $56 billion in cash from overseas, analysts say. In a report, Credit Suisse speculates that enterprise software providers ServiceNow (NOW), Splunk (SPLK), or computer security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) could be on Cisco's shopping list. Pacific Crest Securities adds Red Hat (RHT) and Nutanix (NTNX) to the list of possible Cisco targets. Intel (INTC) is among semiconductor companies with a cash hoard overseas. Intel could bring back about $12 billion, says BMO Capital Markets. Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also have significant overseas cash. But, BMO Capital does not expect a Trump tax holiday to spur an acquisition spree among chipmakers.

Argentina is also a frontier market fairy tale! Matein Khalid/Dubai Filed on May 28, 2017 | Last updated on May 28, 2017 at 07.59 pm Share More > Vote Brazil's Bovespa endured a roller-coaster ride in the last year. (AFP) Any hit in Brazil is a chance for UAE investors to accumulate Argentina shares Brazil's Bovespa index, the real and its sovereign debt have plunged and soared in the last year in response to its political news flow rollercoaster. The resignation of Dilma Rousseff triggered Latin America's most-frenzied bull market in the real and the Bovespa in 2016. Now President Michel Temer's systemic bribery allegations gutted Brazil's financial markets. I was horrified to see the iShares Brazil country index fund tank 17 per cent in a single trading session while the Sao Paulo Borsa shut down. It is impossible to pontificate on Brazil as its latest sordid political drama plays out other than to reiterate my old Victorian surgeon's motto: when in doubt, cut it out! Ever since the Mexican peso devaluation of 1994, I learnt the hard way that cross-border contagion is an existential reality in Latin America. When financial Black Death hits the region, fund managers in Gringolandia do not sell what they want, they sell what they can as cross-asset margin calls cascade. So it did not surprise me to see my favourite Latin American stock market since late 2015, Argentina, get slammed in the Brazilian meltdown. However, any hit in Brazil is a chance for UAE investors to accumulate Argentina, my frontier market fairy tale along with Pakistan. Why? One, political stability is as valuable as it is ephemeral in the Third World (now politely known as 'emerging markets'!). President Mauricio Macri is a pro-market reformer committed to economic globalisation who ended 12 years of Peronist socialist misrule under President Néstor Kirchner and his wife Cristina Fernández. The Argentine right, haunted by the memories of the sala guerra, the tragic dirty war under military dictator generals Viola, Videla and Galtieri, has embraced a moderate reformer and a team of ex-JPMorgan Chase technocrats in the Casa Rosada. Hola amigos! Two, Macri has not just talked the talk but walked the walk. He devalued the Argentina peso and abolished currency controls. He settled with Paris Club holdout creditors and guided Argentina's return to the global capital markets with a wildly-successful Eurobond in April 2016, up 12 points after I recommended it in this column as a must own US dollar new issue. Thanks to Macri's reforms, Argentina has now issued $30 billion in foreign debt, a stellar track record for a nation that once precipitated history's biggest sovereign default in 2001. Even Eva Perón in the Recoleta would be proud of the Argentina of 2017! Three, since BP Securities in Buenos Aires is chaired by my old Chase training class hermano Alejandro Allende, I have impeccable insights into the Argentina money game. Alex told me on the eve of Macri's election that Argentine banks could be triple baggers under the new regime. Hence I was able to gift my readers Banco Macro ADR's in New York, up 200 per cent-plus since Macri's election. As I still tell my dad, if you think Wharton's expensive, try ignorance! For Gulf investors still skeptical about Argentina, note that the Merval is up 48 per cent in the last twelve months. 2016 was the year to do the Tango Argentino on the Rio Plata! Four, Pakistan has been upgraded to emerging market by Morgan Stanley Capital International. Argentina is next. Stay tuned while I scan the smoke signals at MSCI. Five, Argentina still faces monumental economic issues, a legacy of the failed Peronist decade and the hyperinflationary debt crises of the 1990s. Inflation is an awful 24 per cent. The Peronistas and the hard left, the voice of the gauchos and the descamisados (poor), are still powerful in Congress. Macro's 3.5 per cent of GDP fiscal deficit target seems unrealistic in 2017. Argentina is Brazil's largest trading partner and vulnerable to Chinese appetite for soft commodities and meat from the pampas. Yet as George Soros advised, the big money is often made when things go from Godawful to just plain awful. Greek equities were leprosy for me since 2010, when Athens near defaulted on its sovereign debt. However, after a Great Depression scale economic slump and epic labour/pension/fiscal reforms, bailouts, the IMF, EU and Berlin have led to another emerging market Cinderella. In my youth, the Akti Meoli in Piraeus and the Grande Bretagne in Syntagma Square were my banker hangouts - plus Mykonos. It is time to return to the Hellenic morning of creation in the Greek isles!

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials BLink Portfolio Editorial Columns Letters Books Blogs BOOK REVIEW The world of finance: a cosy club Jinoy Jose P   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Title: Superhubs: How the Financial Elite and Their Networks Rule Our World Author: Sandra Navidi; Publisher: Hachette India. Price: ₹599 A ringside view of the closed society of financial elites and how they control the world May 28, 2017:   Sandra Navidi’s curriculum vitae looks richly speckled. She studied law and practised in Germany and the US. She was an investment banker and, later, a macroeconomic analyst who worked with economist Nouriel Roubini. If you remember, Roubini had predicted the collapse of the housing market and the worldwide recession of 2008. Navidi is now a management consultant advising a myriad mix of companies and people who run it. Obviously, having attended exclusive invite-only big-ticket events in the world of finance and the economy, she has had access to troves of exclusive information lesser mortals are not necessarily privy to. So, obviously, one expects Navidi’s Superhubs: How the Financial Elite and Their Networks Rule Our World to be an eye-opening treatise on the murky, complex and chaotic universe of global finance and its dubious hubs and networks. But at the very outset Navidi makes it clear that she is no radical rabble-rouser. Instead, she is a neutral chronicler and the judgment is left to the readers, who have a lot to read between the lines in this refreshingly detailed work on 21st century finance. The hyper-networkers Physicist Stephen Hawking called 21st century a period of complexity. For Navidi, three forces propel this complex period: technologisation, financialisation and globalisation. The world of finance is a deadly cocktail of all the three forces that mark this century. As a result, traditional methods and linear thinking become quite unsuccessful in understanding what happens in this system which is a web of alliances and networks in which the ‘power of networking’ plays a pivotal role, influencing global policies and business deals. In 12 chapters rich in research and sprinkled with personality profiles of the movers and shakers of finance, Navidi shows how people such as Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase; Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of Blackrock, the largest asset management company in the world; and billionaire hedge fund honcho George Soros “shape history, transform the world we live in, and determine the future of our financial system, economy, and society”. She helps unravel a curious world of power-brokering, while strictly maintaining her role as a neutral observer. But being neutral is a Herculean task while analysing the world of finance. At times, Navidi gets tempted to go judgemental, especially when she analyses the influential networks in finance. Over time, she writes, certain network dynamics — such as the “rich-get-richer phenomenon” and self-perpetuating feedback loops — will cause any system automatically to become more interconnected, homogeneous, and complex. She understands that this is not a great way to go because most systems are adaptive and self-correcting, so when they become “too lopsided, circuit-breaking feedback loops kick in, restabilising the system”. Systems that fail to correct themselves ultimately self-destruct, she warns. But this is a dog-eat-dog world anyway, where factors such as ethics and loyalty often get a back seat, as we have seen in the works of Michael Lewis, Sebastian Mallaby, or even Bryan Burrough and John Helyar. “You want loyalty, hire a cocker spaniel,” informs Lewis in his seminal work, Liar’s Poker, in which he shared his startling experience as a bond salesman on Wall Street. But Navidi doesn’t want you to enter that space, for obvious reasons. She is still active in the industry and if the litany of praise from the biggies of finance that dot the first few pages of Superhub is any indication, she has influential friends to humour. Circumspect narrative So, Navidi sticks to the essentials, which are enough for us to enjoy. She starts by profiling the Financial Universe, starting from the stratosphere of power — Davos, where meetings tangibly demonstrate that “similar people attract each other — and that those who already have the most connections attract even more”. Then she goes to look at the global financial system through the prism of network science. This, claims Navidi, provides a more structured explanation of how a select few get to the very centre of networks, where they become the so-called ‘superhubs’. There are plenty of successful people in the world, Navidi writes, but only a few become so “disproportionately successful” that they operate the very levers of the financial system; they form the superhub, which connects the influential to the more-influential. In the world of finance, netswork equals net worth. And what are the links that connect these networks? Money, information and opportunities. In finance, says Navidi, the most valuable currency is actionable information that can be converted into monetary gain. So, in essence, you’re worth what you know. Which also means, you’re what/who you’re connected to. Is this a virtue or a vice? Navidi sits on the fence here. Especially considering the plethora of examples that suggest how these powerful networks influence public policies across the globe, leading to considerable damage to public good. During the subprime crisis of 2007-08, most rating agencies were vying with each other to stamp high ratings to toxic bonds and other financial instruments, which eventually, nearly, pulled down the whole financial system in the US, triggering a chain reaction across the globe. In Navidi’s world, superhubs and their influence, though they can get toxic at times, are a necessary inevitability, whether you like it or not. This is where the book stumbles. Or differs from the likes of a Big Short (Lewis) or More Money Than God (Mallaby), which vehemently criticises the power of financial elites and their ill-gotten wealth. But as we can see Navidi seems to have great friends she cannot offend by revealing unpleasant truths. Navidi’s language at times gets too simple to bring out the nuances in the discourse. The book is text-bookish in places. But those are minor glitches; if you are interested in the world of finance and its curiosities, this is a good read. MEET THE AUTHOR An expert commentator on financial markets, Sandra Navidi is the Founder and CEO of Beyond Global, a consulting firm. Navidi has worked as an investment banker at Scarsdale Equities, general counsel at Muzinich and Co. And consultant at Deloitte.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Bank Stocks Are Over the Trump Bump Shares of big banks have underperformed the broader market since the beginning of March. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) May 27, 2017 at 11:11AM Bank stocks shot up in the immediate wake of the presidential election on hopes that the unexpected victory of a pro-business candidate Donald Trump would spur profitability in the industry. But with the controversies swirling in Washington, D.C., combined with legislative paralysis, investors have begun to reconsider how much banks will actually benefit under the new administration. The optimism around bank stocks was spurred by two things, in particular. First, Trump vowed on the campaign trail to reduce the top corporate tax rate from 35% down to 15%. That would help banks more than any other industry, as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup all rank among the 10 biggest corporate taxpayers in America. Bank of America's office in New York City (center). Image source: Getty Images. For Bank of America, for instance, this would have reduced the North Carolina-based bank's tax liability in 2016 by nearly half, or 48%, leaving $3.5 billion in additional net income to hit the bank's bottom line. That would make a huge difference, boosting Bank of America's net income by 19%, or approximately $0.35 per share, holding all else equal. To be clear, there's a short-term downside to a tax cut from the perspective of certain big banks -- namely, Bank of America and Citigroup -- which have large deferred tax assets, which would have to be written down if taxes are cut. According to estimates, that would cost Bank of America somewhere in the neighborhood of $4.4 billion. But unlike the benefit, which would be recurring, this downside would hit the bank's balance sheet only once. In addition to tax cuts, moreover, Trump promised to ease the regulatory burden on banks, which had been ratcheted up ever since the financial crisis. This would lower compliance costs and give banks much more operational flexibility to grow revenue and return capital to shareholders, all of which would boost profitability. The net result is that bank stocks soared in the wake of Trump's unexpected victory. You can see this in the chart below, which compares the performance of the KBW Bank Index to that of the S&P 500, a proxy for the broader market, from the beginning of November 2016 through February of this year. KBWB data by YCharts. But now the tide has changed. With the Russia controversy consuming the White House, and all hopes for legislative victories on tax and healthcare reform reduced to a hope and a prayer, investors have become notably less optimistic about bank stocks. One could even go so far as to say that they're downright pessimistic. You can see this in the chart below, which picks up where the first one left off -- spanning from the beginning of March through today: KBWB data by YCharts. It remains to be seen, of course, how everything shakes out in the nation's capital. But if things don't get back on track soon, it isn't unreasonable to think that the more recent trend in bank stocks will continue to carry the day.

Federal Reserve Bank. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint NEAL ST. ANTHONY @StAnthonyStrib Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank has not tread softly in his first 16 months on the job Kashkari, who was hired by the Minneapolis Fed board in January 2016, tweets, at times irreverently, about economic policy and irks big bankers with occasional criticism of management or his solution for preventing more federal bailouts. He challenges Wall Street, where he once labored, to put more skin in the game. And he’s not shy opining about the implications of certain monetary or fiscal policies, the bailiwick of Congress and the president. Kashkari has met with impoverished kids and struggling small business people as the Minneapolis Fed contemplates doing more to assist minorities achieve family-supporting jobs. He thinks the Fed can do more to revive gritty neighborhoods. “I care about public policy and I want to take on the most important economic challenges we face as a region and country,” Kashkari said last week. “That’s what I said to the board when I interviewed for the job. The Minneapolis Fed is an underutilized resource that could have a bigger impact. And this won’t be without controversy. As long as what we do is nonpartisan and grounded in good economic research, let the critics say what they may.” Kashkari is an engineer who once worked on rocket systems and an MBA who worked for Goldman Sachs. He played a pivotal role at the U.S. Treasury during the depths of the Great Recession. He also was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor of California in 2014. “I enjoyed running,” Kashkari said. “I met billionaires and homeless people and everyone in between. I learned that the vast majority of people are good people. And they care about their neighborhoods, communities and country. I was encouraged.” And he is not shy about ruffling feathers at financial institutions he oversees. The Federal Reserve influences interest rates and employment, does research designed to inform policymakers in Washington, D.C., and state capitals, and regulates bank holding companies, from huge JPMorgan Chase on Wall Street to U.S. Bancorp on the Nicollet Mall. In a rare move for a Fed president, Kashkari blasted the senior management of Wells Fargo & Co. over the consumer fake-account scandal before the board pushed out CEO John Stumpf last fall, five years after the problem surfaced internally. Kashkari also raised big-banker eyebrows when he announced last year the Minneapolis Fed’s preliminary recommendation that the best way to avoid another version of the 2008-10 bank bailout is to raise by 100 percent the capital big banks must hold to cushion against huge losses, to more than 20 percent. Kashkari has concluded it’s the right thing to do. After all, a bank made him put down 20 percent on his house for security. And he has unique insight. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulsen, a former CEO of Goldman Sachs, recruited Kashkari to Treasury and tasked him with a big piece of the bank bailout. The Treasury invested in hundreds of banks to keep them afloat and stimulate lending. The money was paid back with interest. However, as some small banks failed, the precedent was set: The government will bail out the biggest banks, those considered to be integral to the national and global economy through the huge electronic-payment systems that weave through the financial world. “We had to do it, and it was the right thing to do,” said Kashkari. “Let’s not have to do it again.” Big-bank lobbyists will fight capital-raising regulatory changes. Adding more capital means less lending and investing and restrains profits. Conversely, Kashkari would ease some rules for small banks. Kashkari was moved recently by a visit to the Northside Achievement Zone (NAZ), a nonprofit that assists low-income families on things ranging from getting kids ready for kindergarten to nutrition and health education and training referrals for out-of-work adults. The North Side boasts the highest concentration of poverty in the Twin Cities. Sondra Samuels, a former businesswoman who leads NAZ, will addressed a Fed conference last week on why blacks are unemployed at twice the rate of whites. Kashkari wants to study what works and spread the word. “These are enormously important and complex issues,” he said. “I think the Fed has a role.” Said Minneapolis Fed board member MayKao Hang, CEO of the Wilder Foundation: “Neel is a transformational leader who is willing to tackle important issues we face in our region and across the nation. “He knows, for example, that if we want to spur growth across the Ninth District, we have to address why we have some of the deepest economic and racial disparities in the country.” Neal St. Anthony has been a business columnist and reporter for the Star Tribune for 30 years.

Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 1,006.73 +10.78 +1.08% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 82.64 -0.42 -0.51% AdChoices At the corner where East North Street meets North Cherry Street in the small Ohio town of Kenton, the Immaculate Conception Church keeps a handwritten record of major ceremonies. Over the last decade, according to these sacramental registries, the church has held twice as many funerals as baptisms. In tiny communities like Kenton, an unprecedented shift is under way. Federal and other data show that in 2013, in the majority of sparsely populated U.S. counties, more people died than were born—the first time that’s happened since the dawn of universal birth registration in the 1930s. For more than a century, rural towns sustained themselves, and often thrived, through a mix of agriculture and light manufacturing. Until recently, programs funded by counties and townships, combined with the charitable efforts of churches and community groups, provided a viable social safety net in lean times. Starting in the 1980s, the nation’s basket cases were its urban areas—where a toxic stew of crime, drugs and suburban flight conspired to make large cities the slowest-growing and most troubled places. Today, however, a Wall Street Journal analysis shows that by many key measures of socioeconomic well-being, those charts have flipped. In terms of poverty, college attainment, teenage births, divorce, death rates from heart disease and cancer, reliance on federal disability insurance and male labor-force participation, rural counties now rank the worst among the four major U.S. population groupings (the others are big cities, suburbs and medium or small metro areas). In fact, the total rural population—accounting for births, deaths and migration—has declined for five straight years. “The gap is opening up and will continue to open up,” said Enrico Moretti, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied the new urban-rural divide.

The Wall Street Journal.3:51 UP NEXT Just two decades ago, the onset of new technologies, in particular the internet, promised to boost the fortunes of rural areas by allowing more people to work from anywhere and freeing companies to expand and invest outside metropolitan areas. Those gains never materialized. As jobs in manufacturing and agriculture continue to vanish, America’s heartland faces a larger, more existential crisis. Some economists now believe that a modern nation is richer when economic activity is concentrated in cities. In Hardin County, where Kenton is the seat, factories that once made cabooses for trains and axles for commercial trucks have shut down. Since 1980, the share of county residents who live in poverty has risen by 45% and median household income adjusted for inflation has fallen by 7%. At the same time, census figures show, the percentage of adults who are divorced has nearly tripled, outpacing the U.S. average. Opioid abuse is also driving up crime. Father Dave Young, the 38-year-old Catholic priest at Immaculate Conception, was shocked when a thief stole ornamental candlesticks and a ciborium, spilling communion wafers along the way. Before coming to this county a decade ago, Father Young had grown up in nearby Columbus—where for many years he didn’t feel safe walking the streets. “I always had my guard up,” he said. Since 1980, however, the state capital’s population has risen 52%, buoyed by thousands of jobs from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., plus the growth of Ohio State University. Median household income in Columbus is up 6% over the same span, adjusted for inflation. “The economy has grown a lot there,” said Father Young. “The downtown, they’ve really worked on it.” Meanwhile, as Kenton—population 8,200—continues to unravel, he said he has begun always locking the church door. Again, he finds himself looking over his shoulder. “I just did not expect it here,” he said.© Ty Wright for the Wall Street Journal In the first half of the 20th century, America’s cities grew into booming hubs for heavy manufacturing, expanding at a prodigious clip. By the 1960s, however, cheap land in the suburbs and generous highway and mortgage subsidies provided city dwellers with a ready escape—just as racial tensions prompted many white residents to leave. Gutted neighborhoods and the loss of jobs and taxpayers contributed to a socioeconomic collapse. From the 1980s into the mid-1990s, the data show, America’s big cities had the highest concentration of divorced people and the highest rates of teenage births and deaths from cardiovascular disease and cancer. “The whole narrative was ‘the urban crisis,’” said Henry Cisneros, who was Bill Clinton’s secretary of housing and urban development. To address these problems, the Clinton administration pursued aggressive new policies to target urban ills. Public-housing projects were demolished to break up pockets of concentrated poverty that had incubated crime and the crack cocaine epidemic. At that time, rural America seemed stable by comparison—if not prosperous. Well into the mid-1990s, the nation’s smallest counties were home to almost one-third of all net new business establishments, more than twice the share spawned in the largest counties, according to the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan public-policy organization. Employers offering private health insurance propped up medical centers that gave rural residents access to reliable care. By the late 1990s, the shift to a knowledge-based economy began transforming cities into magnets for desirable high-wage jobs. For a new generation of workers raised in suburbs, or arriving from other countries, cities offered diversity and density that bolstered opportunities for work and play. Urban residents who owned their homes saw rapid price appreciation, while many low-wage earners were driven to city fringes. As crime rates fell, urban developers sought to cater to a new upper-middle class. Hospital systems invested in sophisticated heart-attack and stroke-treatment protocols to make common medical problems less deadly. Campaigns to combat teenage pregnancy favored cities where they could reach more people. As large cities and suburbs and midsize metros saw an upswing in key measures of quality of life, rural areas struggled to find ways to harness the changing economy. Starting in the late 1990s, Amazon.com Inc. began opening fulfillment centers in sparsely populated states to help customers avoid sales taxes. One of those centers, established in 1999, brought hundreds of jobs to Coffeyville, Kan.—population 9,500. Yet as two-day shipping became a priority, Amazon shifted its warehousing strategy to be closer to cities where its customers were concentrated, and shut the Coffeyville center in 2015. An Amazon spokeswoman said that it didn’t make the decision lightly, and that last year it opened one of two planned fulfillment centers near Kansas City that will create more than 2,000 full-time jobs. Just as Amazon closed down, so did the century-old hospital in nearby Independence, population 8,700. The nearly one-million-square-foot Coffeyville warehouse Amazon rented has been empty since it went on the market for $35 million, and was recently repossessed at a value of $11.4 million after the building owner filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Coffeyville officials said the area’s problem isn’t a lack of jobs—it’s a shortage of qualified workers. After Amazon said it would close, economic-development leaders held an employment fair expecting to get up to 600 job seekers. Fewer than 100 showed up, said Trisha Purdon, executive director of the Montgomery County Action Council. In the late 1990s, convinced that technology would allow companies to shift back-office jobs to small towns, former Utah Republican Gov. Mike Leavitt pitched outposts in his state to potential employers. But companies were turned off by the idea of having to visit and maintain offices in such locations, he said. Eventually, many of the call centers he landed moved overseas where labor was even cheaper. Although federal and state antipoverty programs were not limited to urban areas, they often failed to address the realities of the rural poor. The 1996 welfare overhaul put more city dwellers back to work, for example, but didn’t take into account the lack of public transportation and child care that made it difficult for people in small towns to hold down jobs, said Lisa Pruitt, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law. Rhonda Vannoster of Independence, Kan., who is 25, has four children with a fifth on the way. She is divorced and jobless and doesn’t own a car, which limits her work options. She said she wants to get trained as a nursing aide but struggles to make time for it. “There just aren’t a lot of good jobs,” she said. There has long been a wage gap between workers in urban and rural areas, but the recession of 2007-09 caused it to widen. In densely populated labor markets (with more than one million workers), Prof. Moretti found that the average wage is now one-third higher than in less-populated places that have 250,000 or fewer workers—a difference 50% larger than it was in the 1970s. As employers left small towns, many of the most ambitious young residents packed up and left, too. In 1980, the median age of people in small towns and big cities almost matched. Today, the median age in small towns is about 41 years—five years above the median in big cities. A third of adults in urban areas hold a college degree, almost twice the share in rural counties, census figures show. Consolidation has shut down many rural hospitals, which have struggled from a shortage of patients with employer-sponsored insurance. At least 79 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, according to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Rural residents say irregular care and long drives for treatment left them sicker, a shift made worse by high rates of rural obesity and smoking. “Once you have a cancer diagnosis…your probability of survival is much lower in rural areas,” said Gopal K. Singh, a senior federal health agency research analyst who has studied mortality differences. The opioid epidemic—and a lack of access to treatment—have compounded the damage. In Hardin County, prosecutor Brad Bailey said drug cases, which accounted for less than 20% of his criminal cases a decade ago, have surged to 80%. The epidemic is spawning more thefts, including a rash of snatched air-conditioners sold for scrap metal, said Dennis Musser, police chief in Kenton. Linda Martell, a 69-year-old who moved to Kenton from outside Cleveland a decade ago to be near her daughter, was surprised a chain saw and heavy tools were stolen from her garage. When she was a young adult, she recalled, “All the problems were in the big cities.” In November’s presidential election, rural districts voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, who pledged to revive forgotten towns by scaling back regulations, trade agreements and illegal immigration and encouraging manufacturing companies to hire more American workers. A promised $1 trillion infrastructure bill could give a boost to many rural communities. Lawmakers from both parties concede they overlooked escalating dmall-town problems for years. “When you have a state like Florida, you campaign in the urban areas,” said former Florida Republican Sen. Mel Martinez. He recalls being surprised when he learned in the mid-2000s that rural areas, not cities, were the center of an emerging methamphetamine epidemic. During the Bush administration, lawmakers were preoccupied with two wars, securing the homeland after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and rebuilding New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Barack Obama’s administration tried to lift rural areas by pushing expanded broadband access, but found that service providers were reluctant to enter sparsely populated towns, said former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. Since the collapse of the housing market, real-estate appreciation in nonmetropolitan areas has lagged behind cities, eroding the primary source of wealth and savings for many families. “We didn’t really have much of a transformation strategy for places where the world was changing,” Mr. Vilsack said. Meanwhile, major cities once considered socioeconomic laggards have turned themselves around. In St. Louis, which has more than 30 nearby four-year schools, the percentage of residents with college degrees tripled between 1980 and 2015—creating a talent pool that has lured health care, finance and bioscience employers, officials say. Instead of people moving where the jobs are, “jobs follow people,” said Greg Laposa, a local chamber of commerce vice president. In many cities, falling crime has attracted more middle- and upper-class families while an influx of millennials delaying marriage has helped keep divorce rates low. Maria Nelson, a 45-year-old media company manager who came to Washington, D.C., to work after college, had always assumed she would someday move to the suburbs, where she had grown up. A generation of heavy federal spending helped make the nation’s capital one of the country’s highest-earning urban centers. Its median household income rose to $71,000 a year in 2015, a 51% increase since 1980, adjusted for inflation. While Ms. Nelson was able to buy a brick row house in 2002, she said she worries about younger colleagues—let alone anyone moving in from a small town—who face soaring real-estate prices. “The whole area just seems to be out of range for most people now,” she said In Kenton, Father Young said that despite their mounting troubles, he is optimistic about his parishioners. Some of them tell him they worry about what will happen when they die because they still provide for their adult children. He likes to say there is always hope. “They can find a job,” he said. “Columbus is close enough.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

But for those who work for Wall Street brokerage firms or the mega Wall Street banks like JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup or German banking giant Deutsche Bank, just the mere mention of FinCEN can quickly produce beads of sweat dripping onto those expensive Canali suits. That’s because FinCEN is the Federal agency where suspicious financial activity that might turn out to be money laundering gets reported. All three banks, and numerous others, have had their share of scandalous run ins with money laundering. In recent weeks, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, Senate Intelligence Committee and the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee have all shown an interest in what FinCEN might have in its database that would shed sunshine on involvement of the Trump business empire or Trump campaign and Russian money inflows. Senator Sherrod Brown, the Ranking Member of the Senate Banking Committee, sent a letter on March 2 to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, asking for documents and explaining his rationale as follows: “…Russia has been subjected to a number of international and US sanctions, as have many prominent Russian leaders and business people. Investors from Russia have, in the past, played a significant role in the Trump organization. example, President Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. stated at a conference in 2008 that President Trump’s businesses involved substantial Russian investments. He reportedly said: ‘And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.’ “Such statements raise important questions about whether any Trump firms, including those now controlled by his children, retain ownership interests in Russian entities, or have business ties or projects elsewhere that include Russian investors. If so, what is the nature of those ownership or investment arrangements?  Might they provide opportunities for economic leverage over the President or any of his family members or associates?  Do they put the President or his family in danger of violating U.S. statutes, regulations, or simply prudent standards of conduct for the leader of our nation?” Treasury Secretary Mnuchin appeared before the Senate Banking Committee on an unrelated matter on May 18. During the hearing, Senator Brown told Mnuchin that he had not received an appropriate response to his March 2 letter. He asked Mnuchin to provide “a complete list of Trump business associates and financial ties to ensure that any foreign entanglements are benign…” Mnuchin denied that he hadn’t been responsive to Brown’s letter.

The Center for Popular Democracy Action Fund, the 501(c)(4) sister organization of the Center for Popular Democracy (CPD), a New York-based nonprofit that receives the bulk of its funding from George Soros, announced at their spring gala Tuesday that they will be heading up the new $80 million anti-Trump network that will span 32 states and have 48 local partners, CNN reported.   The network will seek to mobilize new voters and fight voter identification laws. It will also focus on gerrymandering and automatic voter registration programs with an eye on the 2018 and 2020 election cycles. Rep. Keith Ellison (D., Minn.), the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, backed the new effort. “This national network, led by working class people of color and immigrants, will supply the power and the fight we need to resist the Trump administration’s all-out assault on American values,” Ellison told CNN. “I look forward to standing with CPD Action’s leaders in the streets and in Congress to win real progressive change.” The Center for Popular Democracy, which was founded in 2012, consists of old chapters of ACORN, the community-organizing group that was forced to close after being stripped of its federal funds following controversy in 2010. Andrew Friedman, a co-executive director at the Center for Popular Democracy, co-founded Make the Road New York, a Latino immigrant group that has worked alongside CPD on a number of anti-Trump campaigns. Friedman serves on the board of Make the Road New York (MRNY) and Make the Road Action Fund, which are closely linked to CPD and contain many overlapping staffers. Others in leadership roles at CPD have come directly from ACORN. Brian Kettenring, the other co-executive director of the CPD, was an organizer for ACORN from 1995 to 2010. Steve Kest, a senior advisor at CPD, worked for ACORN for 35 years and served as its national executive director. Christina Livingston, a board member of CPD, is the executive director of the Alliance for Californians for Community Empowerment. Livingston previously organized for ACORN out of Los Angeles. Steve Dooley, the director of partnerships at CPD, began his career at ACORN in D.C. Dooley later directed ACORN’s offices in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Greg Basta, the director of sustainability initiatives at CPD, worked as the statewide canvass director for the New York ACORN for five years. Basta was a founding staff member of New York Communities for Change (NYCC), an ACORN offshoot that was founded in 2010. The groups, which have combined to receive millions in funding from George Soros, funnel money to each other. From 2012 to 2014, New York Communities for Change provided $81,700 to the Center for Popular Democracy, according to the group’s Form 990s up to 2014, the last available year. NYCC also passed $358,533 to the Make the Road New York Action Fund during this time. The Center for Popular Democracy gave New York Communities for Change $406,667 between 2012 and 2014. CPD additionally gave Make the Road New York $173,955. CPD’s Action Fund added another $100,000 to New York Communities for Change. The Center for Popular Democracy did not respond to inquiries on the new $80 million anti-Trump network. New York Communities for Change and Make the Road New York also did not return requests for comment. CPD and MRNY have been extremely active in the anti-Trump arena, using protests and pressure campaigns. The two groups recently “partnered” on a “Corporate Backers of Hate” campaign that targeted JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Boeing, Disney, IMB, Uber, Blackrock, and Blackstone, corporations they say could profit from President Trump’s policies. The “mass lobbying” campaign consists of directly pressuring higher ups at each company through emails and has been called “unprecedented” by corporate responsibility experts. Make the Road was also reported to have organized the “spontaneous” protests at New York’s JFK Airport following Trump’s Muslim travel ban. However, it was later discovered that the protests had been planned since the day after the presidential election. Uber, which had continued to pick up passengers from the airport during the event, found themselves in the center of the #DeleteUber pressure campaign following the protests. The CEO of Uber, Travis Kalanick, later stepped down from Trump’s advisory council. The group is also behind the #GrabYourWallet campaign, which targets retailers for carrying Trump family products. Nordstrom ultimately pulled Ivanka Trump’s products, although the store had claimed they had dropped her brand due to declining sales. The Center for Popular Democracy’s new multi-million dollar network falls in line with a number of major liberal groups who have reorganized to fight back against voter laws following Donald Trump’s victory. Demos, a New York City-based progressive public policy group chaired by Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D., Mass.) daughter, has been assisting unions in pushing back against election lawsuits in number of states after counties had failed to properly maintain their voter rolls. Demos received hundreds of thousands in funding from Soros’ groups. Marc Elias, Hillary Clinton’s former top campaign lawyer, recently joined the board of Priorities USA Action, a major Democratic super PAC that received $9.5 million from Soros during the 2016 election cycle. Elias was tapped as the group shifts its focus on pushing back against state-level Republican efforts on voting laws. Every Citizen Counts, a nonprofit founded by Clinton allies focused on mobilizing African American and Latino voters, was absorbed into Priorities USA. Elias will spearhead challenges against state voting laws from the organization’s nonprofit arm, which is building a national database to be a “one-stop inventory of restrictive voting measures” that they will share with other progressive groups. Elias previously engaged in a multi-state effort to overturn voter ID laws leading up to the 2016 presidential election. The challenges were backed by millions of dollars from Soros. Soros has a goal of enlarging the electorate by 10 million voters by 2018, the Washington Free Beacon discovered after a trove of hacked Soros documents were released last year by DC Leaks. The plan to grow the electorate by millions of voters and combating “suppression” was listed as a top priority in a 220-page guide from his Open Society Foundations. “The Open Society Foundations supports efforts to encourage wider participation in U.S. elections, and opposes measures used to try to suppress voter participation,” a spokesman from the Open Society Foundations told the Free Beacon at the time. http://freebeacon.com/issues/soros-funded-anti-trump-network-has-acorn-ties/ Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

Purchase BookThe financial crisis revealed fundamental shortcomings in both public and private American institutions. While the firms that were successful each found their own way to weather the crisis, unsuccessful firms were remarkably alike in their inability to cope and in the mistakes they made. Combing through the wreckage, Thomas Stanton examines which financial firms survived the crisis and which ones failed. He analyzes how differences in governance, organization, and management between these firms led to their success or failure, and how government supervision and regulation failed to prevent the crisis. Based on interviews that the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission conducted with CEOs, risk officers, traders, and others at major financial firms, Stanton systematically outlines how successful firms such as JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and others used a multitude of approaches to distinguish themselves in operational competence and intelligent discipline, while unsuccessful firms such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Countrywide uniformly failed to prepare for low-probability, high-impact events.

Keith Ellison / Getty Images BY: Joe Schoffstall Follow @JoeSchoffstall May 27, 2017 5:00 am A new $80 million anti-Trump network is being led by an organization whose top funder is liberal billionaire George Soros and which employs former members of the controversial and now-defunct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). The Center for Popular Democracy Action Fund, the 501(c)(4) sister organization of the Center for Popular Democracy (CPD), a New York-based nonprofit that receives the bulk of its funding from George Soros, announced at their spring gala Tuesday that they will be heading up the new $80 million anti-Trump network that will span 32 states and have 48 local partners, CNN reported. The network will seek to mobilize new voters and fight voter identification laws. It will also focus on gerrymandering and automatic voter registration programs with an eye on the 2018 and 2020 election cycles. Rep. Keith Ellison (D., Minn.), the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, backed the new effort. "This national network, led by working class people of color and immigrants, will supply the power and the fight we need to resist the Trump administration's all-out assault on American values," Ellison told CNN. "I look forward to standing with CPD Action's leaders in the streets and in Congress to win real progressive change." The Center for Popular Democracy, which was founded in 2012, consists of old chapters of ACORN, the community-organizing group that was forced to close after being stripped of its federal funds following controversy in 2010. Andrew Friedman, a co-executive director at the Center for Popular Democracy, co-founded Make the Road New York, a Latino immigrant group that has worked alongside CPD on a number of anti-Trump campaigns. Friedman serves on the board of Make the Road New York (MRNY) and Make the Road Action Fund, which are closely linked to CPD and contain many overlapping staffers. Others in leadership roles at CPD have come directly from ACORN. Brian Kettenring, the other co-executive director of the CPD, was an organizer for ACORN from 1995 to 2010. Steve Kest, a senior advisor at CPD, worked for ACORN for 35 years and served as its national executive director. Christina Livingston, a board member of CPD, is the executive director of the Alliance for Californians for Community Empowerment. Livingston previously organized for ACORN out of Los Angeles. Steve Dooley, the director of partnerships at CPD, began his career at ACORN in D.C. Dooley later directed ACORN's offices in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Greg Basta, the director of sustainability initiatives at CPD, worked as the statewide canvass director for the New York ACORN for five years. Basta was a founding staff member of New York Communities for Change (NYCC), an ACORN offshoot that was founded in 2010. The groups, which have combined to receive millions in funding from George Soros, funnel money to each other. From 2012 to 2014, New York Communities for Change provided $81,700 to the Center for Popular Democracy, according to the group's Form 990s up to 2014, the last available year. NYCC also passed $358,533 to the Make the Road New York Action Fund during this time. The Center for Popular Democracy gave New York Communities for Change $406,667 between 2012 and 2014. CPD additionally gave Make the Road New York $173,955. CPD's Action Fund added another $100,000 to New York Communities for Change. The Center for Popular Democracy did not respond to inquiries on the new $80 million anti-Trump network. New York Communities for Change and Make the Road New York also did not return requests for comment. CPD and MRNY have been extremely active in the anti-Trump arena, using protests and pressure campaigns. The two groups recently "partnered" on a "Corporate Backers of Hate" campaign that targeted JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Boeing, Disney, IMB, Uber, Blackrock, and Blackstone, corporations they say could profit from President Trump's policies. The "mass lobbying" campaign consists of directly pressuring higher ups at each company through emails and has been called "unprecedented" by corporate responsibility experts. Make the Road was also reported to have organized the "spontaneous" protests at New York's JFK Airport following Trump's Muslim travel ban. However, it was later discovered that the protests had been planned since the day after the presidential election. Uber, which had continued to pick up passengers from the airport during the event, found themselves in the center of the #DeleteUber pressure campaign following the protests. The CEO of Uber, Travis Kalanick, later stepped down from Trump's advisory council. The group is also behind the #GrabYourWallet campaign, which targets retailers for carrying Trump family products. Nordstrom ultimately pulled Ivanka Trump's products, although the store had claimed they had dropped her brand due to declining sales. The Center for Popular Democracy's new multi-million dollar network falls in line with a number of major liberal groups who have reorganized to fight back against voter laws following Donald Trump's victory. Demos, a New York City-based progressive public policy group chaired by Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D., Mass.) daughter, has been assisting unions in pushing back against election lawsuits in number of states after counties had failed to properly maintain their voter rolls. Demos received hundreds of thousands in funding from Soros' groups. Marc Elias, Hillary Clinton's former top campaign lawyer, recently joined the board of Priorities USA Action, a major Democratic super PAC that received $9.5 million from Soros during the 2016 election cycle. Elias was tapped as the group shifts its focus on pushing back against state-level Republican efforts on voting laws. Every Citizen Counts, a nonprofit founded by Clinton allies focused on mobilizing African American and Latino voters, was absorbed into Priorities USA. Elias will spearhead challenges against state voting laws from the organization's nonprofit arm, which is building a national database to be a "one-stop inventory of restrictive voting measures" that they will share with other progressive groups. Elias previously engaged in a multi-state effort to overturn voter ID laws leading up to the 2016 presidential election. The challenges were backed by millions of dollars from Soros. Soros has a goal of enlarging the electorate by 10 million voters by 2018, the Washington Free Beacon discovered after a trove of hacked Soros documents were released last year by DC Leaks. The plan to grow the electorate by millions of voters and combating "suppression" was listed as a top priority in a 220-page guide from his Open Society Foundations. "The Open Society Foundations supports efforts to encourage wider participation in U.S. elections, and opposes measures used to try to suppress voter participation," a spokesman from the Open Society Foundations told the Free Beacon at the time.   This entry was posted in Issues and tagged George Soros.

The state Supreme Court this week denied a request to hear an appeal filed by the owners after prior courts ruled the pay method was illegal. “The kids won. McDonald’s lost,” said West Pittston-based attorney Mike Cefalo, who filed the class action lawsuit on behalf of the McDonald’s workers in June 2013. Declined comment Franchise owners Albert and Carol Mueller of Clarks Summit declined comment on the Supreme Court’s refusal to hear their argument, a spokeswoman said. The case will now return to Luzerne County Court, where Judge Thomas F. Burke Jr. will determine what damages will be awarded to the plaintiffs, according to Cefalo. In June 2015, Burke ruled that paying employees exclusively with a debit card did not fall in line with the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law, which mandates “wages shall be paid in lawful money of the United States or check.” The state Superior Court last year upheld Burke’s decision. “The language is clear. A debit card is not ‘lawful money’ and it is not a ‘check’ ...” Superior Court Judge Anne Lazarus wrote in the court’s opinion. Attorneys for the Muellers had argued a debit card was the “functional equivalent” of a check or lawful money. The Superior Court panel called that argument “unavailing,” because the cards were mandatory and “forced users to incur fees” for all types of transactions. The J.P. Morgan Chase payroll cards issued to local McDonald’s employees carried fees for nearly every type of transaction, according to Cefalo’s lawsuit, including a $1.50 charge for ATM withdrawals, $5 for over-the-counter cash withdrawals, $1 to check the card’s balance, 75 cents per online bill payment and $10 per month if the card is left inactive for more than three months. After Cefalo filed the lawsuit, it quickly gained national attention, including a front-page story in The New York Times and an investigation by federal officials. Soon after, the Muellers announced they were abandoning the pay practice and would give employees the choice of being paid by check, direct deposit or by payroll card.

Blasting News > Politics > 2017 > 05 > Lloyds Bank will REMAIN in the UK, despite Brexit, says chairman Lloyds Bank will REMAIN in the UK, despite Brexit, says chairman The chairman of Lloyds Bank mocks Remainers' claims Britain will struggle post-Brexit Matt Snape Expert in Politics M. Snape Follow Following Published on: 27 May 2017 27 May 2017 Published on 27/05/2017 The chairman of Lloyds Bank mocks Brexit doom predictions Advertisements Lloyds Bank becomes the first financial institution to commit to the UK as its chairman expressed confidence in Britain's ability to thrive, post-#Brexit. London's domination as the globe's financial hub will not be threatened by Brexit, Lord Norman Blackwell has said. Lord Blackwell has mocked numerous doomsday predictions by different experts about Britain's prospects outside the #European Union. Lord Blackwell, who supported leaving the EU during last year's referendum, said London's financial foundations will ensure the Capital is resilient if the markets jitter once negotiations to leave the superbloc start. 'The Capital will survive' He said the Capital will survive, regardless of the threats made by numerous companies to vacate the UK since June 23rd 2016. Advertisements Advertisements Many organisations have panicked since Prime Minister Theresa May said she will quit her negotiations with the EU, should they fail to agree on a free trade agreement. This would mean Britain and the superbloc would have to trade on World Trade Organisation rules, which the markets fear would be worse than the deal the UK gets from the EU's Single Market. 'London is like a Jenga tower' The chairman of HSBC, Douglas Flint, warned London is like a Jenga tower. He added that if one brick falls down, who knows how many more will follow. However, Lord Blackwell mocked his HSBC counterpart's remarks, saying the Capital is considerably stronger than a Jenga tower due to its history of financial success. He compared the Capital to the Tower of London due to its solid foundations. The Chief Executive of Lloyds Bank, Antonio Horta Osorio, repeated his boss's claims. Advertisements But HSBC is not the only financial institution that fails to share Lloyds' confidence in Britain's post-Brexit prosperity. Insurers Legal & General and Aviva have threatened to move some operations to the Republic of Ireland because of Britain's EU exit. Dublin has offered British companies incentives to shift their activities to EIRE, particularly unfettered access to the EU's Single Market. Many British firms feel access to the Single Market will be jeopardised by leaving the EU, regardless of the Prime Minister's ability to agree a free trade deal with the superbloc. L&G assured staff they will not be made redundant as a consequence of this decision. L&G said this was part of their strategy to ensure that they continue to provide a service to their clients, regardless of Brexit. Reuters reported Aviva said on Friday it would transform its Irish life and general insurance branches into subsidiaries. Asset manager M&G, which is owned by Prudential, revealed plans to establish a fund management company in Luxembourg, while Legg Mason said it also intends to relocate to Dublin. Advertisements Another asset manager, Standard Life, said it may well choose to scarper to the Irish capital as well in order to preserve its EU activities. JPMorgan has already done so as it bought a building in Dublin to employ 1,000 staff. 'Ireland's financial strength' Ireland's Jobs Minister, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, welcomed the news numerous British companies wish to cross the border to EIRE, saying it demonstrated Ireland's financial strength. Martin Shanahan, the head of the IDA Ireland, which is responsible for attracting foreign investment on behalf of the Irish Government, said this was a signal of Ireland's ability to attract businesses without causing significant disruption to the market. Many EU countries have attempted to disrupt Brexit by providing British businesses with the opportunity to re-establish themselves in their financial cities. Spain's Basque region is a typical example of an area of Europe that has thrived from post-Brexit uncertainty. Many Basques work in Britain in the science, technology and engineering sections. Despite this, many of them have returned to Spain since Britain voted to leave the EU on June 23rd 2016. Ivan Jimanez, the head of Bizkaia Talent, an organisation that attempts to prevent highly-skilled Basques from relocating abroad, said many of them are returning home from the UK. #Politics Read more Chosen for you Terror strikes London Bridge and Borough Market.

Currency Watch: May 17 - Wall Street Journal (Saumya Vaishampayan): "China's central bank is guiding the currency higher, but the country's investors seem unconvinced. The People's Bank of China on Wednesday fixed the yuan at 6.8635 per dollar, the strongest since Feb. 17, only to have it weaken to 6.88 within minutes... The gap between the central bank's fix and where the currency then trades in the onshore market has widened in recent days. Wednesday's discount was the largest since January. Such a gap 'suggests that the onshore market is still not fully convinced that the Chinese yuan will remain strong,' said Irene Cheung, a senior strategist for Asia at ANZ in Singapore..."

Corn added 0.4% (up 5.8%). Trump Administration Watch: May 19 - Bloomberg (Justine Sink): "Donald Trump won the presidency on the promise he'd drain the swamp. This week, the swamp struck back. The naming Wednesday of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate the Russian government's meddling in the U.S. election, including ties to Trump's campaign, abruptly shifted the balance of power in Washington. The city's permanent political class forcefully reasserted itself against an antagonistic president determined to bring them to heel. The Russia investigation will cast a pall over Trump's first term, with Mueller free to pursue the facts where they lead and little urgency to get there." May 18 - Reuters (Julia Edwards Ainsley and Steve Holland): "The U.S. Justice Department, in the face of rising pressure from Capitol Hill, named former FBI chief Robert Mueller... as special counsel to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion between President Donald Trump's campaign and Moscow. The move followed a week in which the White House was thrown into uproar after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey... Trump, whose anger over the allegations has grown in recent weeks, took the news calmly and used it to rally his team to unite, move on and refocus on his stalled agenda, a senior White House official said. 'We are all in this together,' Trump told his team..." May 13 - Reuters (David Lawder): "U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said... that United States reserves the right to be protectionist on trade, but noted that his international counterparts are growing more comfortable with the Trump administration's economic agenda. 'We do not want to be protectionist but we reserve our right to be protectionist to the extent that we believe trade is not free and fair,' Mnuchin told a news conference at the end of a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial democracies. 'Our approach is for more balanced trade, and people have heard that... And as I say, people are more comfortable today, now that they've had the opportunity to spend time with me and listen to the president and hear our economic message.'" May 15 - Bloomberg (David Goodman and Alessandra Migliaccio): "Group-of-Seven ministers slowly coming to terms with the reality of Donald Trump's administration are about to leave the heavy lifting to their bosses. Finance chiefs in Italy at the weekend spoke of an improving relationship with their U.S. counterpart Steven Mnuchin, in a contrast to previous encounters. But with their gathering in Bari cementing rather than mending disagreements on free trade, the risk is that the diplomatic truce they achieved unwinds when Trump himself meets with G-7 leaders on the island of Sicily later this month." May 16 - Bloomberg (Joe Light): "A top Treasury Department official said the Trump administration wants to boost the role of private capital in the mortgage market, a longstanding Washington goal that has largely befuddled policy makers since the 2008 financial crisis. Transferring risk away from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is 'core' to U.S. housing policy, Craig Phillips, a counselor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, said... Without outlining any specific plans, Phillips said a central goal is increasing the amount of private loans in the market that lack government backing." China Bubble Watch: May 15 - Bloomberg: "The ferocity of China's bond rout is surprising some of the market's top observers. The yield on sovereign debt due in a decade surged to a two-year-high of 3.7% last week, wrong-footing analysts from Citic Securities Co. and Haitong Securities Co. -- the country's two biggest brokerages -- who had in April predicted a maximum level of 3.6% in the near term. The tumble comes amid intensifying efforts to crack down on excessive borrowing... 'No one knows what kind of indicator would suggest the campaign is over, and no one knows how long this process will last,' said Shan Kun, head of China markets strategy at BNP Paribas (China)... 'When the market is so pessimistic, investors are trading based on expectations, and declines can be illogical.'" May 18 - Bloomberg: "China's anti-leverage campaign is causing a distortion that hasn't happened in the nation's $9 trillion bond market in at least a decade. The five-year sovereign yield is now higher than that on debt due in a decade, the first time the curve has inverted for the tenor in data going back to 2006. This is due mainly to a surge in the shorter-term yield because of a deleveraging campaign, and a limited advance in the 10-year cost as economic growth concerns raise demand for safety... 'It's hard to say where the funding costs will be able to stabilize, so that's curbing demand for the short-end of the curve," said Wu Sijie, a Shanghai-based senior trader at China Merchants Bank Co. 'A liquid market has become the paramount consideration, as people want to escape as fast as they can in a selloff.'" May 16 - Reuters (Samuel Shen and Engen Tham): "China's banking regulator is tightening disclosure rules on lenders' wealth management products (WMP) as it tries to track risky lending practices in the shadow banking sector, the latest in a series of steps by Beijing aimed at defusing financial risks. The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) said... it plans to launch 46 new or revised rules this year, part of which targets risks related to shadowbanking activities Authorities are trying to better regulate 30 trillion yuan ($4.35 trillion) of WMPs, much of it sitting off-balance sheet in the shadowbanking sector. The WMPS have been used to channel deposits into risky investments, often via many layers of asset management schemes to skirt lending and capital rules. The CBRC will now require that banks report the underlying assets and liabilities of their WMPs, as well as all layers of investment schemes, on a weekly basis." May 16 - Wall Street Journal (Shen Hong): "China's central bank made its biggest one-day cash injection into the country's fragile financial markets in nearly four months Tuesday, a fresh sign that Beijing is trying to mitigate the damage to investor confidence inflicted by its recent campaign to tamp down speculative investing fueled by debt. The People's Bank of China pumped a net 170 billion yuan ($24.7bn) into the financial system... The huge provision of cash follows comments from Chinese officials in recent days that suggest they are concerned that recent moves to tighten market regulation have caused too much disruption." May 17 - Financial Times (Gabriel Wildau and Nan Ma): "One of China's largest insurers has warned of mass defaults and social unrest unless the regulator lifts a ban on its issuance of new products, the latest sign of stress in the industry caused by a crackdown on financial risk. In a letter to China's insurance regulator seen by the Financial Times, Foresea Life Insurance warns that the company expects Rmb60bn ($8.7bn) in redemptions this year and might be unable to meet payouts unless it is able to sell new products. In December, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission banned Foresea for three months from applying to sell new products... In the letter dated April 28, Foresea asks the CIRC to resume new product approvals 'in order to avoid inciting mass incidents by clients and localised and systemic risks, producing greater damage to the industry'... Foresea is a unit of Baoneng Group, a property and financial conglomerate... Baoneng has used the sale of so-called 'universal insurance' products to finance its stake in Vanke and other listed companies. Such policies are, essentially, investment vehicles offering high yields and guaranteed payouts on maturities. Distributed through banks, they bear little resemblance to traditional insurance..." May 14 - Wall Street Journal (Chuin-Wei Yap): "The past two months have been tumultuous for Chinese lenders as a new banking czar has unleashed a blizzard of new directives, uncovered a fraud scandal and issued heavy fines. Since his appointment to head the China Banking Regulatory Commission in February, Guo Shuqing has become a central figure in Beijing's crackdown on risk... The 60-year-old Mr. Guo is navigating narrow straits: He has to tame a freewheeling industry without killing a tentative recovery in bank profits or causing too much disruption. President Xi Jinping has stressed the need for a stable financial sector ahead of a major Communist Party leadership shuffle this fall. On Friday, the CBRC tried to reassure investors that it was aware of the threat of overregulation and emphasized the campaign's value in reducing risk long term. 'We're hoping now to avoid risks that have resulted from the regulations to resolve risk,' said Xiao Yuanqi, a CBRC department head." May 16 - Reuters (Elias Glenn): "China's growth is set for its weakest patch since the global financial crisis as authorities pull back on the stimulus that helped the economy get off to an unexpectedly strong start this year, and keep funds tight to deter risky lending... Massive debt - standing at nearly 300% of GDP - and serious budgetary imbalances mean Beijing can't carry on pump priming. The brakes went on in April, when annual growth in fiscal spending dropped to 3.8% from 21% the first quarter. And worries about speculative bubbles have forced the central bank to tighten short term liquidity, while trying to keep medium term funding available for investment." May 17 - Bloomberg: "China home-price growth eased last month after authorities imposed stricter restrictions on property purchases. New-home prices... gained last month in 58 of the 70 cities tracked by the government, compared with 62 in March, the National Bureau of Statistics said... Prices fell in eight cities and were unchanged in four... Chinese authorities stepped up curbs in a string of large cities last month to rein in prices, following a resurgence in demand the previous two months as buyers tried to get in ahead of further restrictions." Europe Watch: May 12 - Wall Street Journal (Giovanni Legorano and Manuela Mesco): "Europe's establishment breathed a sigh of relief after the pro-European Union centrist Emmanuel Macron was elected French president this week. But another populist storm is brewing in Italy, where the euroskeptic 5 Star Movement has remained strong. Fueled by discontent with slow growth, high unemployment and disillusionment with mainstream politicians, 5-Star has won local elections in Rome, Turin and elsewhere, partly on the strength of its leaders' call for a referendum on Italy's use of the European single currency. Pollsters say about 30% of Italian voters support the movement founded by comedian Beppe Grillo, a level of popularity that has stood firm despite a series of high-profile stumbles..." May 17 - Bloomberg (Piotr Skolimowski): "The European Central Bank is trying to work out a key question about the road to policy normalization: what's the speed limit? Three weeks before their next policy decision, the terms of debate between the ECB's 25 Governing Council members over announcing and implementing an exit from unconventional stimulus have coalesced around the pace. In one camp are those who want to move slowly. In the opposite camp: those who want to move extremely slowly. The June 8 meeting in Tallinn is in the sights of investors and economists seeking a signal that the euro area has recovered enough for the ECB to at least hold its first formal talks on what a policy reversal might look like." May 18 - Bloomberg (Carolynn Look and Alessandro Speciale): "European Central Bank policy makers pointed to June to revisit their policy stance after differing on how much the region's economic outlook had improved. At the next policy meeting on June 8, new staff projections and data will put officials 'in a better position to take stock and reassess the sustainability of the recovery and the outlook for inflation,' an account of the Governing Council's April 26-27 meeting showed... 'Some members considered that the risks to real gross domestic product could now be characterized as broadly balanced,' while 'other members maintained that downside risks to growth still prevailed,' the account showed." May 17 - Bloomberg (Maria Tadeo and Ainhoa Goyeneche): "Spain's government debt pile rose for the fourth consecutive month in March, once again climbing above 100% of gross domestic product... Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government has been struggling with a debt-to-GDP ratio hovering around 100% since mid-2014 even as Spain leads the recovery in the euro area." Global Bubble Watch: May 13 - New York Times (Jane Perlez and Yufan Huang): "Along the jungle-covered mountains of Laos, squads of Chinese engineers are drilling hundreds of tunnels and bridges to support a 260-mile railway, a $6 billion project that will eventually connect eight Asian countries. Chinese money is building power plants in Pakistan to address chronic electricity shortages, part of an expected $46 billion worth of investment. Chinese planners are mapping out train lines from Budapest to Belgrade, Serbia, providing another artery for Chinese goods flowing into Europe through a Chinese-owned port in Greece. The massive infrastructure projects, along with hundreds of others across Asia, Africa and Europe, form the backbone of China's ambitious economic and geopolitical agenda... The initiative, called 'One Belt, One Road,' looms on a scope and scale with little precedent in modern history, promising more than $1 trillion in infrastructure and spanning more than 60 countries." May 15 - Reuters (Shu Zhang and Matthew Miller): "Behind China's trillion-dollar effort to build a modern Silk Road is a lending program of unprecedented breadth, one that will help build ports, roads and rail links, but could also leave some banks and many countries with quite a hangover. At the heart of that splurge are China's two policy lenders, China Development Bank (CDB) and Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM), which have between them already provided $200 billion in loans throughout Asia, the Middle East and even Africa. They are due to extend at least $55 billion more... Thanks to cheaper funding, CDB and EXIM have helped to unblock what Chinese president Xi Jinping on Sunday called a 'prominent challenge' to the Silk Road: the funding bottleneck. But as the Belt and Road project grows, so do the risks to policy banks, commercial lenders and borrowers, all of whom are tangled in projects with questionable business logic, bankers and analysts say." Fixed Income Bubble Watch: May 14 - Wall Street Journal (Heather Gillers and Tom McGinty): "The losses from soured investments in Puerto Rico bonds are coming into focus for some of the world's biggest mutual funds, and it is a brutal reckoning. The total red ink for mutual funds that invested in debt issued by the troubled island commonwealth is as much as $5.4 billion over the past five years, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of mutual-fund holdings... Those losses... were tucked inside a wide range of funds..." May 14 - Financial Times (Fraser Lundie): "'The past is always triple-A. We can all remember what the past was. But if we try to make the future triple-A, we have no future. The future is always single-B.' Michael Milken, the 'Junk bond king', was not describing the asset class he created, but he could well have been. In hindsight, high-yield bonds have been one of the best performing asset classes on a risk-adjusted basis of any in the world, an asset class delivering equity-like rewards with half the volatility. Like all things too good to last, capital markets have come to chew the fat off this remarkable record... It is ironic that an asset class that has taken decades to rid itself of the unflattering 'junk' tag now finds itself in a state more likely to exhibit junk status than ever before." May 16 - Wall Street Journal (Min Zeng): "The U.S. bond market is sending a note of caution to the Federal Reserve, which is on track to raise interest rates in June. Hedge funds and money managers have built up the biggest net wagers since 2008 betting long-term Treasury yields will fall. At the same time, wagers betting on an increase in short-term interest rates are near the highest level since 1993. This divergence is happening at a time when the yield premium on the 10-year note relative to the two year has been shrinking." Federal Reserve Watch: May 17 - Bloomberg (Brian Chappatta): "The bond market is interpreting what could be the deepest crisis of Donald Trump's presidency as throwing the Federal Reserve off its path for interest-rate increases this year. The odds that the central bank raises its benchmark rate next month are about 60%, based on the current effective fed funds rate and the forward overnight index swap rate. That's down from 80% a week ago." May 15 - CNBC (Steve Liesman): "While Federal Reserve officials have said they plan to begin a process to normalize their balance sheet, the end result is likely to be a balance sheet that is anything but normal. Interviews with Fed officials, and public statements they've made suggest the Fed's new normalized balance sheet could end up being three times as large as it was before the financial crisis. And it could be bigger than that. The Fed has yet to announce a plan to run off its massive $4.4 trillion balance sheet, but market participants... expect the process to begin in January 2018, months sooner than previously forecast. Some Fed officials have made no secret of their intentions to announce a plan later this year to reduce the balance sheet." May 15 - Bloomberg (Liz McCormick and Alex Harris): "To appreciate just how important the Federal Reserve has been to the U.S. Treasury, consider this simple fact: It alone financed roughly 40% of America's budget deficit last year. So as Fed officials talk up the possibility of unwinding the central bank's crisis-era bond holdings later this year, figuring out what will happen when the U.S. loses its biggest source of funding has become a pressing concern. Of course, finding ready buyers in the Treasury market... has rarely been a problem. But with deficits poised to balloon, bond dealers are divided over which parts of the market will feel the most pain as the Fed pulls back and the Treasury ramps up debt issuance to fill those gaps." U.S. Bubble Watch: May 15 - Wall Street Journal (Laura Kusisto): "Home sales in the first quarter hit their fastest pace in a decade, a sign that rising prices and slightly higher mortgage rates haven't deterred home buyers from rushing into the market. Total existing-home sales climbed 1.4% in the quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.62 million, the highest since the first quarter of 2007... The national median home price, meanwhile, jumped 6.9% from the same quarter a year earlier to $232,100, the sharpest price gain in nearly two years. Demand remains strong as millennials begin to enter the housing market in force." May 17 - CNBC (Diana Olick): "The number of homes for sale in America has been falling steadily for the past year, but the situation is apparently getting much worse as spring demand heats up. 'The inventory is reaching historic lows. It's never declined faster than it did last month. It's freaking us out — it's affecting our business; it's limiting our sales,' said Glenn Kelman, CEO of Seattle-based Redfin..." May 15 - Bloomberg (Patricia Laya): "More confidence among U.S. home builders this month shows the industry remains optimistic demand will keep growing in the face of rising property values, according to data... from the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo. Builder sentiment rose to 70, the second-highest since 2005, from 68 in April..." May 16 - Reuters (Richard Leong): "The U.S. economy is forecast to expand at a 4.1% annualized pace in the second quarter following the release of April figures on housing starts and industrial output, the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDP Now forecast model showed... Domestic factory production increased 1.0% last month for its biggest monthly gain in over three years, but housing starts unexpectedly fell 2.6%..." May 17 - Reuters (Jonathan Spicer): "Americans' debt level reached a record high this year, surpassing the peak touched just as the worst of the recession was taking hold in 2008, and marking a milestone for households that now lean less on mortgages and more on auto and student loans. Total U.S. household debt was $12.73 trillion at the end of the first quarter of 2017, up $473 billion from a year ago, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey... Total indebtedness is now 14% above the 2013 trough of household deleveraging brought on by the 2007-2009 financial crisis and Great Recession. The previous peak, in the third quarter of 2008, was $12.68 trillion, and the New York Fed stressed that the pull-back since then marked an 'aberration' from what had been a 63-year upward trend in household debt." May 18 - Bloomberg (Shahien Nasiripour): "Student debt has more than tripled as a share of total debt owed by U.S. households in less than 15 years.. Student loans made up just 3.3% of total household debt in 2003, for a sum of $240.7 billion, according to estimates... by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That sum is now about $1.3 trillion, or about 10.6% of all U.S. household debt. The jump reflects higher tuition and campus-related costs, more people seeking higher education..., and declines in state appropriations to public colleges and federal grants to students relative to rising college costs. One in six American adults, or 44 million people, has a student loan." May 17 - Bloomberg (Gabrielle Coppola): "Lenders are tightening the spigot on new auto loans, making it harder for U.S. consumers with weak credit to buy a car, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York show. New car loans for subprime borrowers fell in the first quarter to $25.9 billion, the lowest in two years... Drivers with credit scores below 620 now comprise less than 20% of new loans, down from almost 30% a decade ago. Borrowers with the highest credit scores -- 760 or more -- made up nearly a third of new auto loan originations in the first quarter as lenders target the safer deals." May 16 - Reuters (Lucia Mutikani): "U.S. manufacturing production recorded its biggest increase in more than three years in April, bolstering the view that economic growth picked up early in the second quarter despite a surprise decline in homebuilding. The broad strength in factory output... added to labor market data in suggesting the growth slowdown in the first quarter was temporary... 'The sharp increase in industrial activity is a clear sign that the first-quarter sluggishness is behind us. It comes at the right time as home construction seems to have hit a lull,' said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors..." May 14 - Wall Street Journal (Tripp Mickle and Eliot Brown): "Apple Inc. employees last month began testing the company's latest innovation: Apple Park, one of history's most expensive corporate campuses and the leading example of the tech industry's newfound love for splashy architecture. The first of 12,000 Apple headquarters employees moved from several drab, stone buildings in Cupertino, Calif., to space across town in the 2.8-million-square-foot circular building that resembles a spaceship. It features a seamless, curved-glass exterior and a theater that architects said was designed to look like a MacBook Air. The estimated $5 billion project commanded years of attention from top Apple executives... Apple Park is the most lavish in a spate of glitzy new architectural projects by tech titans at a time when their businesses are booming and market valuations are soaring to new heights. Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. have tapped top architects Frank Gehry and Bjarke Ingels for expansions, Amazon is building giant glass globes containing an indoor forest in Seattle, and business-software company Salesforce.com Inc. paid to put its name on a new, 61-story tower that will be the tallest building in San Francisco." May 15 - Bloomberg (Martin Z Braun and Jonathan Levin): "San Juan's gleaming commuter train seemed like a coup -- the kind of big-ticket item many U.S. cities can only dream of. More than a decade on, the Tren Urbano is a monument to the folly, bloat and abuse that finally bankrupted Puerto Rico. Despite years of planning, it sells only a third of the rides it needs to, and loses roughly $50 million a year. The cost so far: $2.25 billion, $1 billion more than planned. That, in a nutshell, is Puerto Rico's story. With Wall Street's help, the U.S. commonwealth borrowed tens of billions in the bond markets, only to squander much of it on grand projects, government bureaucracy, everyday expenses and worse. Debts were piled on debts, even as the economy gave way." Japan Watch: May 16 - Reuters (Leika Kihara): "Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he was 'quite sure' the central bank could smoothly exit from its massive monetary stimulus when the appropriate time to do so came. But he also said the BOJ 'always' had room to expand monetary stimulus to achieve its 2% inflation target, indicating that wages and prices had been slow to respond to improvements in the economy. The remarks suggest the BOJ is in no rush to swing monetary policy in either direction, particularly toward cutting back on stimulus with the economic recovery still fragile. 'There may be some challenging issues, but I'm quite sure the BOJ has enough tools' to manage an exit from its stimulus program, Kuroda told a seminar..." May 18 - Bloomberg (Keiko Ujikane): "Japan's economy advanced for a fifth straight quarter, the longest expansion in a decade, supported by continued strength in exports. Domestic demand rebounded, but economists question whether this strength will continue. Gross domestic product increased by an annualized 2.2% in the three months ended March 31 (estimate +1.7%), accelerating from a revised 1.4% in the previous quarter... The last time Japan strung together this many quarters of growth was in 2006..." May 15 - Bloomberg (Gareth Allan and Shingo Kawamoto): "Earnings reports by Japan's three megabanks on Monday pointed to a fourth straight fall in combined annual profit, even as the impact of negative interest rates begins to ease. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. forecast a 4.8% drop in combined net income to 2.13 trillion yen ($18.8bn) in the fiscal year ending March 2018 from the previous 12 months." EM Watch: May 19 - Reuters (Brad Brooks and Lisandra Paraguassu): "Brazil's top court released plea-bargain testimony on Friday accusing President Michel Temer and his two predecessors of receiving millions of dollars in bribes, the most damaging development yet in a historic political corruption probe. The testimony made public by the Supreme Court is from executives of the world's largest meatpacking company, and raises serious doubts about whether Temer can maintain his grip on the presidency. The scandals that have engulfed Brazil's political class and many business elites reduce the chances that Temer, a conservative who took office after leftist former President Dilma Rousseff was impeached last year, can push through economic reforms crucial for Latin America's biggest country to recover from its worst recession on record." May 16 - Bloomberg (Blaise Robinson): "The scorching gains that have put emerging-market equities on track for their best year since 2009 are showing signs of flagging. After the MSCI Emerging Market Index's surge of about 17% this year, momentum indicators suggest the rally is losing steam. The benchmark is approaching a resistance level formed by the trend line connecting the peaks in 2011, 2014 and 2015. While breaking above it would be a bullish omen, other technical signals also point to some overheating." May 19 - Bloomberg (Eric Martin): "Mexico's central bank unexpectedly raised its key interest rate for a sixth straight meeting to keep an increase in consumer prices from deepening after inflation accelerated to almost double policy makers' target... Banco de Mexico, led by Governor Agustin Carstens, lifted its benchmark by a quarter point to 6.75% Thursday..." May 16 - Bloomberg (Isabella Cota, Eric Martin, and Michelle Davis): "Mexican authorities have zeroed in on seven banks, including three from the U.S., as part of a widening investigation into price manipulation in the nation's bond market, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Local units of Banco Santander SA, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, JPMorgan Chase & Co., HSBC Holdings Plc, Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. have become the focus of the probe..." Leveraged Speculator Watch: May 15 - Bloomberg (Susanne Barton): "Expectations for another boost in U.S. interest rates are wearing down gold bulls. Hedge funds and other large speculators cut long positions in bullion futures and options by the most in more than eight years last week." Geopolitical Watch: May 17 - Reuters (Christine Kim): "South Korean President Moon Jae-in said... there was a 'high possibility' of conflict with North Korea, which is pressing ahead with nuclear and missile programs it says are needed to counter U.S. aggression. Moon made his comments hours after South Korea, which hosts 28,500 U.S. troops, said it wanted to reopen a channel of dialogue with North Korea as Moon seeks a two-track policy... North Korea has made no secret of its work to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the United States and has ignored calls to halt its nuclear and missile programs, even from China, its lone major ally." May 14 - CNN (Brad Lendon): "North Korea says the missile it tested Sunday is capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead, state media said... The country's leader, Kim Jong Un, supervised the launch of the Hwasong-12 missile that reached an altitude of 2,111.5 kilometers (1,312 miles) and flew 787 kilometers (489 miles)... The test was 'aimed at verifying the tactical and technological specifications of the newly developed ballistic rocket capable of carrying a large-size heavy nuclear warhead,' KCNA said." May 16 - Reuters (Christine Kim and Tom Miles): "North Korea's missile program is progressing faster than expected, South Korea's defense minister said... Han Min-koo told South Korea's parliament that Sunday's test had been detected by the controversial U.S. THAAD anti-missile system, which was deployed in South Korea last month, infuriating China. North Korea has defied all calls to rein in its nuclear and missile programs, even from China, its lone major ally, calling them legitimate self-defense. It has been working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland, and experts say Sunday's test was another step toward that aim." May 14 - Bloomberg (Jordan Robertson and Rebecca Penty): "An unrivaled global cyber-attack is poised to continue claiming victims Monday as people return to work and turn on their desktop computers, even as hospitals and other facilities gained the upper hand against the first wave. More than 200,000 computers in at least 150 countries have so far been infected, according to Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency. The U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre said new cases of so-called ransomware are possible 'at a significant scale.' 'We've seen the rise of ransomware becoming the principal threat, I think, but this is something we haven't seen before -- the global reach is unprecedented,' Europol Executive Director Rob Wainwright said..." May 16 - New York Times (Nicole Perlroth and David E. Sanger): "Intelligence officials and private security experts say that new digital clues point to North Korean-linked hackers as likely suspects in the sweeping ransomware attacks that have crippled computer systems around the world. The indicators are far from conclusive, the researchers warned, and it could be weeks, if not months, before investigators are confident enough in their findings to officially point the finger at Pyongyang's increasingly bold corps of digital hackers. The attackers based their weapon on vulnerabilities that were stolen from the National Security Agency and published last month." May 16 - New York Times (Choe Sang-Hun, Paul Mozur, Nicole Perlroth and David E. Sanger): "They take legitimate jobs as software programmers in the neighbors of their home country, North Korea. When the instructions from Pyongyang come for a hacking assault, they are believed to split into groups of three or six, moving around to avoid detection. Ever since the 1980s, reclusive North Korea has been known to train cadres of digital soldiers to engage in electronic warfare and profiteering exploits against its perceived enemies... In more recent years, cybersecurity experts say, the North Koreans have spread these agents across the border into China and other Asian countries to help cloak their identities. The strategy also amounts to war-contingency planning in case the homeland is attacked. Now this force of North Korean cyberhacking sleeper cells is under new scrutiny in connection with the ransomware assaults that have roiled much of the world over the past four days."     Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. Author: Doug Noland Doug Noland Credit Bubble Bulletin I just wrapped up 25 years (persevering) as a "professional bear." My lucky break came in late-1989, when I was hired by Gordon Ringoen to be the trader for his short-biased hedge fund in San Francisco. Working as a short-side trader, analyst and portfolio manager during the great nineties bull market - for one of the most brilliant individuals I've met - was an exciting, demanding and, in the end, a grueling and absolutely invaluable learning experience. Later in the nineties, I had stints at Fleckenstein Capital and East Shore Partners. In January 1999, I began my 16 year run with PrudentBear, working as strategist and portfolio manager with David Tice in Dallas until the bear funds were sold in December 2008. In the early-nineties, I became an impassioned reader of The Richebacher Letter. The great Dr. Richebacher opened my eyes to Austrian economics and solidified my lifetime passion for economics and macro analysis. I had the good fortune to assist Dr. Richebacher with his publication from 1996 through 2001. Prior to my work in investments, I worked as a treasury analyst at Toyota's U.S. headquarters. It was working at Toyota during the Japanese Bubble period and the 1987 stock market crash where I first recognized my love for macro analysis. Fresh out of college I worked as a Price Waterhouse CPA. I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Oregon (Accounting and Finance majors, 1984) and later received an MBA from Indiana University (1989). By late in the nineties, I was convinced that momentous developments were unfolding in finance, the markets and policymaking that were going unrecognized by conventional analysis and the media. I was inspired to start my blog, which became the Credit Bubble Bulletin, by the desire to shed light on these developments. I believe there is great value in contemporaneous analysis, and I'll point to Benjamin Anderson's brilliant writings in the "Chase Economic Bulletin" during the Roaring Twenties and Great Depression era. Ben Bernanke has referred to understanding the forces leading up to the Great Depression as the "Holy Grail of Economics." I believe "The Grail" will instead be discovered through knowledge and understanding of the current extraordinary global Bubble period.
