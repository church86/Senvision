(AAPL), Snap Inc (SNAP) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL) AAPL and SNAP get on analysts' good side, while UAL is fed to the Twitter mob over leggings Mar 27, 2017, 7:59 am EDT  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Monday could see the stock markets mired in red ink again as global and domestic traders alike continue to digest not just the failure of House Republicans to push their first major bill — healthcare reform — forward, but also an unrelenting current of new developments in the ongoing investigation between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. This morning, the spotlight moves to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP), which have some new analyst optimism to boast, as well as United Continental Holdings Inc (NYSE:UAL) … which right now likely wishes it could duck back into the shadows. Here’s what you need to know heading into Monday’s trading: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Apple is on the receiving end of a pair of wins — one on the analyst front, and one in the courts. JPMorgan Chase, which already has an “Overweight” rating on AAPL stock, raised its price target from $142 to $165, implying roughly 18% upside from current prices. The catalyst? JPMorgan sees high pent-up replacement demand at the same time Apple is gearing up to launch a 10th-anniversary iPhone. From analyst Rod Hall: “Our F2018 unit forecast moves up to 260m units from our prior 245m estimate. We also take a detailed look at OLED supply to Apple and conclude that this should not be a limiting factor but probably will keep Apple from making two OLED models. Multiple iPhone “Pro” features including 3D facial scanning, a glass heavy design, and a structured-light-enabled camera look likely to us and should drive users to upgrade phones that are older, on average, than they have been for four years.” JPMorgan also upped its earnings estimates on AAPL from to $11.74 per share in calendar year 2018. Also, over the weekend, a court overturned a 2016 ruling that said Apple violated patent designs of China’s Shenzhen Baili — a now-defunct company that “barely existed” when it sued Apple over the design of its iPhone 6. While Apple faced an early injunction, it has been able to sell phones during the case, and thus the court victory, while encouraging, likely has no serious financial implications. AAPL shares still are threatening to open Monday’s trading lower, along with the rest of the market. United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL) United Continental is in hot PR water after refusing to let two passengers on a plane. Two girls traveling from Denver to Minneapolis were wearing leggings when they were refused entry onto a plane. The incident itself was fairly calm, and a group behind the girls even offered clothes to help cover one of the girls to meet compliance. However, social media went ballistic when someone who witnessed the event tweeted it out. United’s initial response was that the company “shall have the right to refuse passengers who are not properly clothed,” though later on, the airline updated its response to note that the policy had to do with a specific perks program.

They are exceptionally skilled at identifying catalysts for change, even among widely covered stocks, and their track record is excellent: Over the past five years, Transamerica Large Cap Value (ticker: TWQAX), a mutual fund they subadvise, has returned 15.7% a year, beating both the Standard & Poor’s 500 index and other large value funds.

Don’t confuse the last one with Canada’s monetary authority, the Bank of Canada. More From Barron’s J.C. Penney Stock Could Be in a Beauty of a Mess Here’s How Apple Shares Could Hit $200 The World’s Best CEOs: An Exclusive Barron’s List The industry is notable for its relative lack of drama. Canada didn’t have a banking crisis during the global financial bust of 2008. In fact, since 1840, Canada has had zero banking crises--not even during the Great Depression. The U.S. has had a dozen. That includes two for the U.S. since 1970; only Argentina and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have had more. Why the contrast between the U.S. and Canada? Charles Calomiris at Columbia University and Stephen Haber at Stanford tackled that complex subject in a 2013 paper, citing politics as the chief culprit. “In populist democracies, such as the United States, the regulation of banking is used as a political tool to favor some parties over others,” wrote Calomiris and Haber. “It is not that the dominant political coalition in charge of banking policy desires instability, per se, but rather, that it is willing to tolerate instability as the price for obtaining the benefits that it extracts from controlling banking regulation.” Prospects for reform, they wrote, are “bleak.” The two expanded their findings in an award-winning 2014 book, Fragile by Design. That’s the historical setup. Here’s the market backdrop: Canada’s big six have posted average stock market gains of 26% over the past year. U.S. bigs have done even better.

In Canada, banks have been propelled by a lending boom amid a run-up in house prices that has some investors worried. In the U.S., bank investors are betting on falling regulation and rising interest rates. The Canadian banks trade at an average of 12 times forward earnings estimates. That’s lower than JPMorgan and BofA, at about 13 times, but it’s fairly normal compared with Canadian bank valuations since 2000. That’s where RBC Capital Markets stock strategist Matthew Barasch comes in. (RBC is a unit of Royal Bank of Canada.) On Monday, he published a report titled “What’s a Canadian Bank Worth--Why Not a Market Multiple?” That’s a bold suggestion, because the Standard & Poor’s 500 index trades at nearly 18 times forward earnings estimates, and a FactSet index of Canadian shares trades at about 17 times. Multiples like those are unheard of for big banks operating at normal levels of earnings. But there’s evidence to support them. Start with earnings stability. During the past three recessions, U.S. bank earnings have fallen by an average of 46%, and broad U.S. market earnings, by 39%, but Canadian bank earnings have dropped by an average of just 14%.

The 66 members of the S&P 500 that inhabit that neighborhood trade at an average of about 20 times earnings, according to Barasch. Canadian banks have had ROEs above 14% for 35 years. Then look at dividend yields. Canada’s banks pay between 3% and 5%. U.S. stocks in that range go for an average of 26 times forward earnings. As Barasch points out, it’s possible that history won’t repeat for Canadian banks. Loan growth indeed looks likely to slow from here. But periods of negative five-year stock returns for the group have been exceptionally rare. Fun fact: Over the past 20 and 25 years, Canadian banks are the only subsector in North America to outperform Berkshire Hathaway BRKA 0.46221261780418993% Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

It’s also possible that minds will prove difficult to change, and that Canadian banks will continue to trade cheaply, regardless of their merits. But maybe not. Before the global financial crisis, Canadian bank price/earnings ratios had been on a 25-year uptrend. Perhaps their rise over the past year means the pause is over. The takeaway from Barasch is that an investor who owns JPMorgan shares might consider swapping for a basket of the Canadian banks, which combined have a similar market value. JPMorgan has pulled well ahead since the election. But the Canadian banks offer 1.6 percentage points more of yield, higher ROEs, lower volatility and in Barasch’s opinion, a sturdy regulatory framework and better barriers to entry. Comments?

It’s also possible that minds will prove difficult to change, and that Canadian banks will continue to trade cheaply, regardless of their merits. But maybe not. Before the global financial crisis, Canadian bank price/earnings ratios had been on a 25-year uptrend. Perhaps their rise over the past year means the pause is over. The takeaway from Barasch is that an investor who owns JPMorgan shares might consider swapping for a basket of the Canadian banks, which combined have a similar market value. JPMorgan has pulled well ahead since the election. But the Canadian banks offer 1.6 percentage points more of yield, higher ROEs, lower volatility and in Barasch’s opinion, a sturdy regulatory framework and better barriers to entry. Comments?

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Companies Saudi Aramco formally appoints banks to advise on share sale JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley and HSBC have been appointed as international financial advisers for the initial public offering, say sources. Reuters March 30, 2017 15:13 IST Oil tanks seen at the Saudi Aramco headquarters during a media tour at Damam city November 11, 2007.Reuters file Saudi Aramco has formally appointed JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley and HSBC as international financial advisers for its initial public offering, sources familiar with the matter said.  The trio join Moelis & Co and Evercore, which have been appointed independent financial advisers, one source said of what is expected to be the world's biggest share sale. The Saudi authorities aim to sell up to 5 percent of Aramco, listing the shares in Riyadh and at least one foreign exchange to raise cash for investment in new industries in a bid to diversify away from oil exports in an era of cheap crude. Aramco has appointed Saudi Arabia's NCB Capital and Samba Capital as local advisers, the sources said. Reuters previously reported that JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Moelis and Evercore had been asked to work on the global listing, while HSBC was a leading contender to join them. Samba Capital was earlier named as one of two local advisers. One source said all the banks had now been "onboarded", a term indicating they had been fully briefed on the IPO process, and had been tasked with work that includes helping ensure systems on the Saudi stock exchange, the Tadawul, can be integrated with a foreign exchange. Saudi Aramco has yet to pick a foreign site to list. When asked for comment, Saudi Aramco said it did not respond to rumor or speculation. Officials at NCB Capital were not immediately available and other banks have previously declined to comment on their role.

News sign-up JPMorgan cuts its ads to just 5,000 sites News, 31 March 2017 Topics Banks, credit cards, loans Digital media effectiveness Programmatic buying NEW YORK: As the value of programmatic advertising continues to come under scrutiny, it has emerged that JPMorgan Chase has slashed its digital advertising to just 5,000 pre-approved sites without seeing much change in the number of impressions the ads received. Until a few weeks ago, the global financial services giant advertised on about 400,000 websites a month, but its massive cutback has not hit performance, according to the company's Chief Marketing Officer. "It's only been a few days, but we haven't seen any deterioration on our performance metrics," Kristin Lemkau told The New York Times, as she confirmed JPMorgan has seen little change in the cost of impressions or the visability of its ads. Lemkau explained that JPMorgan checked those 400,000 website addresses over a 30-day period and discovered that only 12,000 (or 3%) led to activity beyond an impression. A member of staff then manually clicked on each of these web addresses to double-check whether they were ones that the company wanted to advertise on. And after eliminating 7,000 that did not meet JPMorgan's requirements, that whittled the total down to just 5,000 sites. "Before the YouTube thing happened, we were just looking at programmatic," she said. "Now the question is, what else is out there that we should be looking at whitelisting? At some point, a human is going to take a look." According to Eric Franchi, Co-founder of adtech firm Undertone, the development could hit operators of smaller websites as well as adtech companies if other advertisers follow the same route as JPMorgan. "If you charge a percentage of all of the ads that run through your platform, then the prospects can be pretty dim if all of a sudden your volume has been cut by 95%," he said. "So many of these companies, and some of them are public, tout the number of ads they deliver per second, per day. If you start seeing more marketers move in this direction, it will be pretty interesting. What are the metrics then that those companies start to report?"

LONDON: Saudi Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE has formally appointed JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley and HSBC as international financial advisers for its initial public offering, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The trio join Moelis & Co and Evercore, which have been appointed independent financial advisers, one source said of what is expected to be the world's biggest share sale. The Saudi authorities aim to sell up to 5 percent of Aramco, listing the shares in Riyadh and at least one foreign exchange to raise cash for investment in new industries in a bid to diversify away from oil exports in an era of cheap crude. Aramco has appointed Saudi Arabia's NCB Capital 1180.SE and Samba Capital 1090.SE as local advisers, the sources said. It was reported earlier JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Moelis and Evercore had been asked to work on the global listing, while HSBC was a leading contender. Samba Capital was earlier named as one of two local advisers. One source said all the banks had now been "onboarded", a term indicating they had been fully briefed on the IPO process, and had been tasked with work that includes helping ensure systems on the Saudi stock exchange, the Tadawul, can be integrated with a foreign exchange.

Before the June 23 referendum, CEO Jamie Dimon told UK staff that as many as 4000 people could be relocated. Photo: Chris Ratcliffe "Other options are still very much on the table," JPMorgan said in a statement, reiterating comments made two weeks ago. "We want to see how negotiations progress. No final decisions have been made." NAMA and Kennedy Wilson declined to comment. UK Prime Minister Theresa May's plan to pull Britain out of the European single market has prompted international banks and insurers to begin looking to relocate jobs to other EU countries. Estimates for the number of people who could move range from 4000 to more than 200,000. Citigroup may move some of its thousands of workers in London out of the city and create a new trading unit within the European Union, Jim Cowles, the bank's head for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, wrote in an internal memorandum obtained by Bloomberg. The firm will keep London as its EMEA headquarters, he wrote. Advertisement "Banks can't wait two years or more for a deal to be struck on passporting or equivalence," Bruce Dear, head of London real estate at law firm Eversheds Sutherland International LLP, said by phone. "They have got to be putting contingency plans in place now." Most banks are relocating as many as 1000 workers initially to cities including Dublin, Madrid and Amsterdam with Paris and Frankfurt lower down the list, Jefferies Group LLC analyst Mike Prew said by email. More banks will relocate workers in the coming two years, he said. Dublin is among the locations being considered by JPMorgan for an enlarged EU hub following the Brexit vote. Before the June 23 referendum, chief executive officer Jamie Dimon told UK staff that as many as 4000 people could be relocated in the event of Brexit. In January, he said that number could be even higher - or lower - depending on how the government's negotiations play out. "There will inevitably be some staff who will be asked to consider relocation," Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan's investment bank head, and Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of asset management, said in a memo to staff seen by Bloomberg. "Our size, scale and existing footprint across the continent mean that we have choices in terms of locations and legal entity structure." The Irish Independent reported earlier on Thursday that the US bank may move some workers to the Capital Dock building. Advertisement HuffPost Australia Government FINALLY Gets Company Tax ...

Ad Age "Media Guy" columnist Simon Dumenco's media roundup for the morning of Thursday, March 30: Today we've got a lot of questions: How much is Donald Trump really worth? Lawmakers in 24 states have a plan that might help us finally figure that out. (See No. 6, below.) How much is Jeff Bezos worth? (See No. 1.) What has Elon Musk been feeding his unicorn? (See No. 4.) Should Congress pass a law "allowing traffic jams to call you during dinner to give you gonorrhea"? (See No. 7.) And so on! Anyway, let's get started ... 1. It's official: "Jeff Bezos is second-richest person in world — behind Bill Gates," per The Seattle Times. 2. The big story on the front page of USA Today -- the newspaper you glance at when you're at a Radisson hotel on a business trip you wish you weren't on -- this morning: "Travel ban could cost $18B in tourism." Per the paper's Bart Jansen: President Trump's temporary travel ban and an inhospitable political climate could punch an $18 billion hole in U.S. tourism by international visitors over the next two years, projections by travel analysts show. Foreign tourism is a $250 billion-a-year business in the United States, and Trump's original and revised executive orders temporarily banning travel from majority Muslim countries -- put on hold by federal courts -- have dampened interest worldwide in visiting the U.S., travel and tourism executives told USA Today. 3. An intriguing story by Sapna Maheshwari headlined "A Bank Had Ads on 400,000 Sites. Then Just 5,000. Same Results" (web version: "Chase Had Ads on 400,000 Sites. Then on Just 5,000. Same Results") fronts the business section of this morning's New York Times. Maheshwari's report begins, As of a few weeks ago, advertisements for JPMorgan Chase were appearing on about 400,000 websites a month. It is the sort of eye-popping number that has become the norm these days for big companies that use automated tools to reach consumers online. Now, as more and more brands find their ads popping up next to toxic content like fake news sites or offensive YouTube videos, JPMorgan has limited its display ads to about 5,000 websites it has preapproved, said Kristin Lemkau, the bank's chief marketing officer. Surprisingly, the company is seeing little change in the cost of impressions or the visibility of its ads on the internet, she said. 4. An important bit of news from the Twittersphere: Last night Elon Musk shared his drawings of a flatulent unicorn and a miserable Mona Lisa (to show off the hidden sketch pad feature on the touch screens in Tesla cars): Made today on Tesla sketch pad pic.twitter.com/Z8dFP2NN41 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 30, 2017 5. Elsewhere on Twitter, ICYMI, Bernie Sanders has released a snappy little video: Trump's position on climate change is pathetic and an embarrassment to the world. pic.twitter.com/K2bspoh28D — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) March 29, 2017 6. Gosh, this could get interesting. In a Politico Magazine story headlined "How States Could Force Trump to Release His Tax Returns" that went live on Politico.com this morning, Richard L. Hasen writes, [A] band of state lawmakers is attempting to succeed where so many others have failed. In at least 24 states, legislators have introduced bills that would force Trump (and all other presidential candidates) to disclose their tax returns in order to qualify for their states' ballots in 2020. 7. And finally, on the "Late Show" last night, Stephen Colbert took on Congress for rolling back planned internet privacy protections: "I can't believe they're publicly taking the side of big internet cable companies. Taking the side of a cable company? The only thing less popular would be if they passed a bill allowing traffic jams to call you during dinner to give you gonorrhea." <br /> Simon Dumenco, aka Media Guy, is an Ad Age editor-at-large.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 March 2017 by Military News JPMorgan Chase Institute’s Local Consumer Commerce Index Shows a 1.5 Percent Increase in Consumer Spending Growth in December 2016 WASHINGTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Today, the JPMorgan Chase Institute released its Local Consumer Commerce Index (LCCI) for December 2016, which showed that 14 of the 15 US cities analyzed had higher year-over-year consumer spending growth rates in December than they did in November. Overall year-over-year consumer spending growth increased by 1.5 percent in December – ending a period of sustained declines that began in July 2016. Non-durable spending rebounded significantly relative to November, contributing 1.2 percentage points to overall growth. Data visualization of the changes in local consumer spending growth over the last 24 months can be found online. For the first time since February 2016, the drag on growth from consumers in the top income quintile (-1.1 percentage points) was offset by growth contributions of consumers in the bottom income quintile (1.1 percentage points). Meanwhile, consumers between the ages of 35 and 54 jointly made their first positive growth contribution since April 2016. This report provides a timely view of how the following cities and surrounding metro areas are faring economically, both individually and in aggregate: Atlanta, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, Portland (OR), San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle. By looking at actual, de-identified financial transactions, LCCI offers an ongoing, dynamic view of the health and vibrancy of the U.S. consumer and the places where businesses operate. “December 2016 brought some encouraging trends including the shift from a period of sustained declines to this increase in consumer spending growth,” said Diana Farrell, President and CEO of the JPMorgan Chase Institute. “This increase in growth was widespread with 14 of the 15 cities we analyze showing higher year-over-year growth rates than they did in November.” The key highlights from the latest Index include: Consumers under 35 made a contribution of 1.9 percentage points in December 2016. Consumers in the bottom income quintile closed out 2016 by continuing their trend of strong contributions to growth, contributing 1.1 percentage points to growth in December 2016. Contributions from small businesses cooled slightly, falling from a 0.9 percentage point contribution in November 2016 to 0.1 percentage point contribution in December 2016. By contrast, large businesses contributed 1.5 percentage points to growth in December 2016, up from flat growth in November and the largest contribution of any business size in that month. Houston was the only large LCCI city in December 2016 to not register a positive growth rate. Regardless, the 2 percent contraction is the smallest contraction for Houston since March 2016. The LCCI offers unique advantages over existing measures of consumer spending. The LCCI captures actual transactions, instead of self-reported measures of how consumers think they spend. The LCCI provides timely data on spending in 15 major metropolitan areas; such geographic granularity is unavailable in most other spending measures. These 15 cities mirror the geographic and economic diversity of larger metropolitan areas in the United States and account for 32 percent of retail sales nationwide. The index also presents a more granular view of local consumer commerce through five important lenses: consumer age, consumer income, business size, product type, and consumer residence relative to the location of the business. For each lens, we show how different segments contributed to year-over-year spending growth. The LCCI captures economic activity in sectors that previously have not been well understood by other data sources. These include sectors such as food trucks, new merchants, and personal services. Each release of the LCCI describes the economic picture of local communities and provides a powerful tool for city development officials, businesses, investors, and statistical agencies to better understand the everyday economic health of consumers, businesses, and the places they care about. About the JPMorgan Chase Institute The JPMorgan Chase Institute is a global think tank dedicated to delivering data-rich analyses and expert insights for the public good. Its aim is to help decision makers – policymakers, businesses, and nonprofit leaders – appreciate the scale, granularity, diversity, and interconnectedness of the global economic system and use better facts, timely data, and thoughtful analysis to make smarter decisions to advance global prosperity. Drawing on JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s unique proprietary data, expertise, and market access, the Institute develops analyses and insights on the inner workings of the global economy, frames critical problems, and convenes stakeholders and leading thinkers.

By looking at actual, de-identified financial transactions, LCCI offers an ongoing, dynamic view of the health and vibrancy of the U.S. consumer and the places where businesses operate. “December 2016 brought some encouraging trends including the shift from a period of sustained declines to this increase in consumer spending growth,” said Diana Farrell, President and CEO of the JPMorgan Chase Institute. “This increase in growth was widespread with 14 of the 15 cities we analyze showing higher year-over-year growth rates than they did in November.” The key highlights from the latest Index include: Consumers under 35 made a contribution of 1.9 percentage points in December 2016. Consumers in the bottom income quintile closed out 2016 by continuing their trend of strong contributions to growth, contributing 1.1 percentage points to growth in December 2016. Contributions from small businesses cooled slightly, falling from a 0.9 percentage point contribution in November 2016 to 0.1 percentage point contribution in December 2016. By contrast, large businesses contributed 1.5 percentage points to growth in December 2016, up from flat growth in November and the largest contribution of any business size in that month. Houston was the only large LCCI city in December 2016 to not register a positive growth rate. Regardless, the 2 percent contraction is the smallest contraction for Houston since March 2016. The LCCI offers unique advantages over existing measures of consumer spending. The LCCI captures actual transactions, instead of self-reported measures of how consumers think they spend. The LCCI provides timely data on spending in 15 major metropolitan areas; such geographic granularity is unavailable in most other spending measures. These 15 cities mirror the geographic and economic diversity of larger metropolitan areas in the United States and account for 32 percent of retail sales nationwide. The index also presents a more granular view of local consumer commerce through five important lenses: consumer age, consumer income, business size, product type, and consumer residence relative to the location of the business. For each lens, we show how different segments contributed to year-over-year spending growth. The LCCI captures economic activity in sectors that previously have not been well understood by other data sources. These include sectors such as food trucks, new merchants, and personal services. Each release of the LCCI describes the economic picture of local communities and provides a powerful tool for city development officials, businesses, investors, and statistical agencies to better understand the everyday economic health of consumers, businesses, and the places they care about.

Overall year-over-year consumer spending growth increased by 1.5 percent in December – ending a period of sustained declines that began in July 2016.

For the first time since February 2016, the drag on growth from consumers in the top income quintile (-1.1 percentage points) was offset by growth contributions of consumers in the bottom income quintile (1.1 percentage points).

The trio join Moelis & Co and Evercore, which have been appointed independent financial advisers, one source said of what is expected to be the world’s biggest share sale. The Saudi Arabian authorities aim to sell up to 5 per cent of Aramco, listing the shares in Riyadh and at least one foreign exchange to raise cash for investment in new industries in a bid to diversify away from oil exports in an era of cheap crude. Aramco has appointed Saudi Arabia’s NCB Capital and Samba Capital as local advisers, the sources said. Reuters previously reported that JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Moelis and Evercore had been asked to work on the global listing, while HSBC was a leading contender to join them. Samba Capital was earlier named as one of two local advisers. One source said all the banks had now been “onboarded”, a term indicating they had been fully briefed on the IPO process, and had been tasked with work that includes helping ensure systems on the Saudi stock exchange, the Tadawul, can be integrated with a foreign exchange. Saudi Aramco has yet to pick a foreign site to list. When asked for comment, Saudi Aramco said it did not respond to rumour or speculation. Officials at NCB Capital were not immediately available and other banks have previously declined to comment on their role. PetroChina latest China oil major to consider Aramco listing BEIJING PetroChina will consider taking part in national oil giant Saudi Aramco’s initial public offering based on market conditions, it said on Thursday, the second Chinese oil major to discuss becoming an investor this week. “Saudi Aramco has raised this plan to PetroChina,” president and vice-chairman Wang Dongjin said on Thursday at a briefing following the announcement of China’s largest oil and gas producer’s 2016 results. “I think we will make our evaluation and study based on the market situation,” Wang said. On Monday, Sinopec Corp said the Aramco president had visited the firm and both sides would have talks on the IPO, which is expected to be the world’s largest equity sale. Wang said PetroChina was also in talks with Aramco on its Yunnan Petrochemical plant and about the possibility of supplying its enhanced oil recovery technology to Saudi oilfields. — Reuters More from Companies McDonald's to use fresh beef for Quarter Pounder 04:18 am Mubadala nearly triples net profit in 2016 Why McDonald's wants to start using fresh beef Dubai holding CEO and vice-chairman depart Lloyd’s chooses Brussels for post-Brexit EU hub Mubadala plans overseas investments Aramco formally appoints banks on share sale Barclays Qatar SFO charging deadline to be moved tags from this storySaudi Arabia follow this tag on MGNChina follow this tag on MGNDUBAI follow this tag on MGNHSBC follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessCompanies tagsSaudi Arabia follow this tag on MGN+ MGNChina follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDUBAI follow this tag on MGN+ MGNHSBC follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In CompaniesMcDonald's to use fresh beef for Quarter Pounder Business Gallery Manufacturing is order of the day Pink diamond worth millions shown in London Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Mubadala nearly triples net profit in 2016 02Aster seeks loan change to offset payment delays 03Abu Dhabi fund loses case against Citigroup Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 11Images Pink diamond worth millions shown in London Mar 21, 2017 6Images Manufacturing is order of the day Mar 28, 2017 8Images Massive development at Abu Dhabi airport Mar 11, 2017 8Images Dubai’s next big mall gets into project mode Mar 16, 2017 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee World, UAE Markets Data OverviewGccEuropeAsiau.s.

Gross domestic product increased 2.1 percent, compared with the previously reported 1.9 percent, the Commerce Department said. Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan were all up between 0.8-1.6 percent, while Goldman Sachs' 1.4 percent rise helped lift the Dow. The market has been range bound in the past few days as investors look for new catalysts and assess the impact of Republicans' failure to pass a healthcare bill on tax reform and the rest of President Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda, hopes for which have helped drive stocks to record highs. But the rally may be near its peak, according to a Reuters poll of strategists, who forecast U.S. shares will gain less than 3 percent between now and year-end. The S&P had risen 10.3 percent since the U.S. election through Wednesday's close. The rapid climb in equities has raised concerns regarding valuations, with the S&P 500 trading at nearly 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months against its long-term average of 15 times. The market will be looking at quarterly earnings to see if the lofty valuations can be supported. First-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 10.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "It's the end of the quarter and investors are buying whatever little dip that we've seen," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. "The market has been quiet in the past few days and are looking forward to the first-quarter earnings in the absence of any major economic data." At 10:50 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 82.9 points, or 0.4 percent, at 20,742.22. The S&P 500 was up 7.54 points, or 0.31 percent, at 2,368.67. The Nasdaq Composite was up 15.52 points, or 0.26 percent, at 5,913.06. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the financial index's 0.93 percent rise leading the advancers. Investors are also watching comments from a host of Federal Reserve officials on clues for the path forward for interest rate hikes. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she sees more rate hikes this year as the U.S. economy is expected to rebound from what looks like a weak first quarter. Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan, San Francisco Fed head John Williams and New York Fed President William Dudley are also scheduled to make appearances. Shares of Lululemon Athletica plunged as much as 22.6 percent to a more than one-year low of $51.30 after the Canadian yoga and leisure apparel retailer said first-quarter comparable sales were expected to fall. ConocoPhillips rose 7.8 percent to $49.50 after the company said it agreed to sell oil sands and western Canadian natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy. Cenovus was down 10.9 percent at $11.65. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,642 to 1,103. On the Nasdaq, 1,524 issues rose and 1,096 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 14 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 67 new highs and 11 new lows.

 American Express Platinum cardholders will now be 'Uber VIPs' — but there's a catch Tanza Loudenback Mar. 30, 2017, 10:53 AM 5,338 facebook linkedin twitter email print Keep an eye on the fees. AP/Diane Bondareff American Express is bulking up the benefits on its premier travel rewards credit card to compete with lucrative offerings from JPMorgan Chase and Citi, its two biggest competitors. Beginning March 30, American Express Platinum members will receive up to $200 in Uber credits annually and automatic VIP status on Uber rides in select cities — but they'll pay for the privilege. The card's annual fee, for new and existing cardholders, has increased from $450 to $550, surpassing the cost of the Chase Sapphire Reserve and Citi Prestige cards, which both have an annual fee of $450. New Platinum card members will also now get a 60,000-point sign-up bonus after spending $5,000 in the first three months, up from 40,000 bonus points after spending $3,000 in the same time period. American Express hasn't raised its annual fee on the card in 10 years, the company told Business Insider. The latest iteration of the Platinum card — which will upgrade all members to a heavy-metal card — is part of an effort by American Express to appeal to "today's global travelers" who crave luxury and convenience. By linking their Uber app and Platinum card, members will get $15 in Uber credits doled out monthly and an extra $20 in December. And with VIP status, cardholders will be paired with top-rated drivers in cities where the service is available. But credits don't roll over month to month and only apply to rides in the US. Platinum members will also now get 5x membership rewards for hotel bookings, made through American Express Travel, though it excludes reservations made through the company's own program, Fine Hotels & Resorts. That's five points for every $1 spent, the same benefit that's been available since October for airfare purchases made on the card. The new Platinum card will still include the previous suite of benefits: $200 airline fee credit, which covers in-flight meals, baggage fees, and other incidentals 1 point for every $1 spent Access to over 1,000 airport lounges across 120 countries $100 application credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck No foreign transaction fees The fee for additional card added to an account will remain the same — $175 for the first three Platinum cards, and $175 for each card thereafter. A complimentary gold card can now be added to a Platinum account at no extra annual fee. American Express' partnership with Uber comes at a trying time for the ride-sharing service, which has weathered several months of high-profile scandals, including losing more than 200,000 customers in a single weekend in January in retaliation to its ties to President Trump, and a recent accident involving one of the company's self-driving cars.

The lender is negotiating the potential purchase of a building being developed by a venture between Kennedy Wilson Holdings Inc. and Ireland's National Asset Management Agency, the people said, asking not to be identified because the plans are private. The building at 200 Capital Dock has about 130,000 square feet (12,000 square meters) of space, the people said. That's enough for more than 1,000 workers. "Other options are still very much on the table," JPMorgan said in a statement, reiterating comments made two weeks ago. "We want to see how negotiations progress. No final decisions have been made." Bloomberg News NAMA and Kennedy Wilson declined to comment. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May's plan to pull Britain out of the European single market has prompted international banks and insurers to begin looking to relocate jobs to other EU countries. Estimates for the number of people who could move range from 4,000 to more than 200,000. Citigroup may move some of its thousands of workers in London out of the city and create a new trading unit within the European Union, Jim Cowles, the bank's head for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, wrote in an internal memorandum obtained by Bloomberg. The firm will keep London as its EMEA headquarters, he wrote. "Banks can't wait two years or more for a deal to be struck on passporting or equivalence," Bruce Dear, head of London real estate at law firm Eversheds Sutherland International LLP, said by phone. "They have got to be putting contingency plans in place now." Most banks are relocating as many as 1,000 workers initially to cities including Dublin, Madrid and Amsterdam with Paris and Frankfurt lower down the list, Jefferies Group LLC analyst Mike Prew said by email. More banks will relocate workers in the coming two years, he said. Lloyd's of London said Thursday that it would open an EU hub in Brussels by the beginning of 2019. Dublin is among the locations being considered by JPMorgan for an enlarged EU hub following the Brexit vote. Before the June 23 referendum, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told U.K. staff that as many as 4,000 people could be relocated in the event of Brexit. In January, he said that number could be even higher — or lower — depending on how the government's negotiations play out. "There will inevitably be some staff who will be asked to consider relocation," Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan's investment bank head, and Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of asset management, said in a memo to staff seen by Bloomberg. "Our size, scale and existing footprint across the continent mean that we have choices in terms of locations and legal entity structure." The Irish Independent reported earlier on Thursday that the U.S. bank may move some workers to the Capital Dock building.

Neither US bank disclosed a preferred site for a new EU hub, but they said they have spent months drawing up plans. “Citi has been preparing for Brexit since before the exit vote in June,” the bank’s EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) boss Jim Cowles said in an internal memo sent on Thursday morning and seen by the Press Association. Canary Wharf, including One Canada Square, and the Citigroup Centre. Mr Cowles said Citi has been working on the assumption of a “hard Brexit”, in which the UK loses access to the single market for financial service. “A hard Brexit would require certain changes, including relocating certain client-facing roles to the EU from the UK, and the possible creation of a new broker-dealer entity within the EU,” he said, echoing comments made in January. It is unclear how many of Citigroup’s near-9,000 UK staff may have to move once a location is chosen. The bank has been exploring its options with “with representatives from a number of different countries”, as well as clients, he said. (Yui Mok/PA) An similar internal note was sent out to staff on Wednesday from JPMorgan’s head of asset and wealth management Mary Erdoes, and Daniel Pinto, head of the corporate and investment bank. JPMorgan, which has said about 4,000 of its 16,000 UK staff could be moved out of Britain, told staff it had “choices in in terms of locations and legal entity structure” of a new EU hub and was “well-placed” to serve clients given its existing footprint across the continent. The note, seen by the Press Association, said: “We have spent the last several months reviewing the many variables in this process, client needs, employee considerations, regulatory requirements, operational risks, our inventory of licenses, political issues in the region and dozens of other factors.” “This is a complex process and we will not rush into any decisions.” Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

The lender is negotiating the potential purchase of a building being developed by a venture between Kennedy Wilson Holdings Inc and Ireland’s National Asset Management Agency, the people said, asking not to be identified because the plans are private. The building at 200 Capital Dock has about 130,000 square feet (12,000 square metres) of space, the people said. That’s enough for more than 1,000 workers. “Other options are still very much on the table,” JPMorgan said in a statement, reiterating comments made two weeks ago. “We want to see how negotiations progress. No final decisions have been made.” NAMA and Kennedy Wilson declined to comment. UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to pull Britain out of the European single market has prompted international banks and insurers to begin looking to relocate jobs to other EU countries. Estimates for the number of people who could move range from 4,000 to more than 200,000. Citigroup Inc may move some of its thousands of workers in London out of the city and create a new trading unit within the European Union, Jim Cowles, the bank’s head for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, wrote in an internal memorandum obtained by Bloomberg. The firm will keep London as its EMEA headquarters, he wrote. “Banks can’t wait two years or more for a deal to be struck on passporting or equivalence,” Bruce Dear, head of London real estate at law firm Eversheds Sutherland International LLP, said by phone. “They have got to be putting contingency plans in place now.” Most banks are relocating as many as 1,000 workers initially to cities including Dublin, Madrid and Amsterdam with Paris and Frankfurt lower down the list, Jefferies Group LLC analyst Mike Prew said by email. More banks will relocate workers in the coming two years, he said. Dublin is among the locations being considered by JPMorgan for an enlarged EU hub following the Brexit vote. Before the June 23 referendum, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told UK staff that as many as 4,000 people could be relocated in the event of Brexit. In January, he said that number could be even higher — or lower — depending on how the government’s negotiations play out. “There will inevitably be some staff who will be asked to consider relocation,” Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan’s investment bank head, and Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of asset management, said in a memo to staff seen by Bloomberg. “Our size, scale and existing footprint across the continent mean that we have choices in terms of locations and legal entity structure.” The Irish Independent reported earlier today that the US bank may move some workers to the Capital Dock building. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Activist targets GM share structure, board Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Australia to bar banks from bargaining collectively with Apple over payments Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Nothing in this region comes close to Pengerang Activist targets GM share structure, board Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Britain considering citizenship rights post-Brexit, says May (VIDEO) Brexit trigger spells trouble for UK’s sweet economic run Lloyd’s of London chooses Brussels for post-Brexit EU hub Malaysia’s palm oil to reap benefits from Brexit Trudeau: Canada seeks more trade with post-Brexit Britain Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The line of debt has commitments from the banks and is expected to close on Monday, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deal isn't finalized. The financial security provides Dropbox with flexibility as it deliberates an IPO. The San Francisco-based startup has been meeting with bankers to discuss plans to list, people familiar with the talks said. While the company hasn't set specific timing, potential advisers believe it will be ready to go public by the end of this year. Dropbox and its lenders declined to comment. Dropbox has said it's not in a hurry to go public and that the business is nearing profitability. The company is cash-flow positive, with annualized revenue of more than $1 billion, Chief Executive Officer Drew Houston said last summer. Dropbox could tap debt if it wants to expand more aggressively or make acquisitions, said one of the people. It never touched a smaller credit facility, which was expiring, the person said. Dropbox CEO Drew Houston. Photographer: Tony Avelar/Bloomberg After opening up in 2007, Dropbox gained a loyal following from people looking to store photos and other files in the cloud, making them available from any computer or mobile device. It rode this wave to a $10 billion valuation in early 2014, vaulting it to become one of Silicon Valley's most valuable unicorn startups. A few months later, it secured a $500 million credit facility led by JPMorgan. Box Inc., a rival file-storage company, went public in 2015. After popping on the first day of trading, Box lost 40 percent of its market value over the course of that year. Dropbox's private investors soon began scrutinizing the startup more closely, and mutual fund backers wrote down the values of their stakes. Dropbox has shifted to focus on selling its cloud service to larger businesses, which has helped boost revenue. It has also cut costs, partly by building data centers instead of relying on Amazon.com Inc.'s cloud storage. Dropbox's growth is encouraging, and its cash generation is impressive compared with most other unicorn businesses, said a banker close to the deal. In addition to JPMorgan, participants in the new debt facility include Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Macquarie Group Ltd. and Royal Bank of Canada, said the people. For the banks involved, taking on the risk of lending to an unprofitable private company can help them win a role underwriting an eventual IPO. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up When Snap Inc. sought advisers to go public, the company placed a big consideration on which banks had been willing to extend credit in the past, according to people familiar with the matter. Aside from boutique advisory firm Allen & Co., Snap's roster of lenders claimed the main IPO underwriter spots, gaining the biggest fees and most prominent roles. Meanwhile, Bank of America declined to lend to the money-losing company and didn't have a role in Snap's listing, the people said. Dropbox's cash flow and more predictable subscription revenue make it a less risky borrower than Snap. Dropbox's incentive for raising the new credit facility was to replace the one that's expiring and wasn't determined by IPO timing, said one person familiar with the plans. The company got better terms by setting up a new line of credit from these banks, rather than renewing the previous one, the person said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

No final decisions have been made.” NAMA and Kennedy Wilson declined to comment. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to pull Britain out of the European single market has prompted international banks and insurers to begin looking to relocate jobs to other EU countries. Estimates for the number of people who could move range from 4,000 to more than 200,000. Citigroup Inc. may move some of its thousands of workers in London out of the city and create a new trading unit within the European Union, Jim Cowles, the bank’s head for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, wrote in an internal memorandum obtained by Bloomberg. The firm will keep London as its EMEA headquarters, he wrote. “Banks can’t wait two years or more for a deal to be struck on passporting or equivalence,” Bruce Dear, head of London real estate at law firm Eversheds Sutherland International LLP, said by phone. “They have got to be putting contingency plans in place now.” To read a QuickTake on Passporting, click here Most banks are relocating as many as 1,000 workers initially to cities including Dublin, Madrid and Amsterdam with Paris and Frankfurt lower down the list, Jefferies Group LLC analyst Mike Prew said by email.

London has flourished as a financial hub over the past two decades. Brexit may question that role. Source: Bloomberg) Dublin is among the locations being considered by JPMorgan for an enlarged EU hub following the Brexit vote. Before the June 23 referendum, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told U.K. staff that as many as 4,000 people could be relocated in the event of Brexit. In January, he said that number could be even higher -- or lower -- depending on how the government’s negotiations play out. “There will inevitably be some staff who will be asked to consider relocation,” Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan’s investment bank head, and Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of asset management, said in a memo to staff seen by Bloomberg. “Our size, scale and existing footprint across the continent mean that we have choices in terms of locations and legal entity structure.” Watch Next: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Says Brexit Won't Be a Disaster The Irish Independent reported earlier on Thursday that the U.S. bank may move some workers to the Capital Dock building.

Posted 30 Mar 2017 15:50 Updated 30 Mar 2017 18:45 FILE PHOTO: Logo of Saudi Aramco is seen at the 20th Middle East Oil & Gas Show and Conference (MOES 2017) in Manama, Bahrain, March 7, 2017. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed Enlarge Caption  Email More A A LONDON: Saudi Aramco has formally appointed JPMorgan Chase & Co , Morgan Stanley and HSBC as international financial advisers for its initial public offering, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The trio join Moelis & Co and Evercore , which have been appointed independent financial advisers, one source said of what is expected to be the world's biggest share sale. The Saudi authorities aim to sell up to 5 percent of Aramco, listing the shares in Riyadh and at least one foreign exchange to raise cash for investment in new industries in a bid to diversify away from oil exports in an era of cheap crude. Aramco has appointed Saudi Arabia's NCB Capital and Samba Capital as local advisers, the sources said. Reuters previously reported that JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Moelis and Evercore had been asked to work on the global listing, while HSBC was a leading contender to join them. Samba Capital was earlier named as one of two local advisers. One source said all the banks had now been "onboarded", a term indicating they had been fully briefed on the IPO process, and had been tasked with work that includes helping ensure systems on the Saudi stock exchange, the Tadawul, can be integrated with a foreign exchange. Saudi Aramco has yet to pick a foreign site to list. When asked for comment, Saudi Aramco said it did not respond to rumor or speculation. Officials at NCB Capital were not immediately available and other banks have previously declined to comment on their role.

The deceleration in loans made to companies and consumers has befuddled some analysts who worry that the worst growth rate in about six years bodes ill for the U.S. recovery at a time when expectations remain high. With credit acting as the lubricant for economic expansion, solving the mystery of the downturn has gained fresh urgency as investors wait to find out if the enthusiasm tied to Trump's pro-growth agenda will translate into a tangible boost. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "One of the stories for optimism at the start of the year was that the gain in confidence and financial market deregulation would spur a rebound in credit creation," said Michelle Meyer, economist at Bank of America Corp. "Surprisingly, the data show the opposite." Commercial bank credit rose by an annualized 4.2 percent in the week ending March 15, down from an almost 8 percent rate last year, according to analysis by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Commercial and industrial loans have seen the biggest slowdown, rising by only $67 billion over the past 12 months, compared with $191 billion over the course of 2016 in a sharp reversal of a multi-year trend that has seen such lending surge to a record $2.1 trillion of outstanding loans. Ask bank managers what the problem is and you'll get a lot of theories: Regulators have been eyeing underwriting standards in the wake of the lending boom, a shortage of qualified workers is preventing businesses from expanding, the rout in oil prices stymied demand, bank loans have been competing with a booming bond market, and of course, interest rates have been rising. But high up on the expansive list is the simple idea that it takes time for a more cheerful mood to materialize in actual activity. "I would tell you that there is a huge amount of optimism out in the marketplace and I believe that it's going to be translating into a substantially higher loan growth as we head through the year," said Kelly King, chief executive of BB&T, in response to analyst queries. The lending cool down contrasts with surveys taking the pulse of the U.S. economy -- figures released on Tuesday showed consumer confidence jumping to its highest level in more than 16 years, fueling questions over the growing gap between "hard" and "soft" economic data that has opened up since November. "There have been a few troubling signs recently, particularly around loan growth that is consistent with this idea that business may be waiting for policy change and in the near term we could actually hit an air pocket in the U.S. economy where businesses are on the sidelines, and we get a period of slower growth," said Paul Eitelman, strategist at Russell Investments, adding that executives need to see the Trump administration deliver on its policy promises before they can ramp up investment. Corporate credit analysts at UBS Group share that concern, blaming a potent mix of political uncertainty, rising rates and historically-high corporate borrowings for reduced demand for company loans. Companies have taken advantage of years of low interest rates and yield-hungry investors to load up on debt in a wide variety of forms. "Anecdotes abound today that high leverage is altering real economic decisions. Companies today want to be sure that growth and tax policy will be tailwinds, before committing capital to work," wrote analysts led by Stephen Caprio. "Simply put, the buffer for a miscalculation is not there for levered firms." Josh Rosner, bank analyst at Graham Fisher & Co., worries that the dip in lending may herald the long-awaited turn of the credit cycle after years of growth. He notes that more loans on bank balance sheets have been souring this year, which may spur them to try to offload non-performers to specialist funds and investors. "It appears that, with rates low, banks have been able to refinance loans of weaker credits to support performance," he wrote in a note published on Wednesday. "Having scraped the bottom of the borrower-quality barrel it is likely that as rates rise, or liquidity is reduced, delinquencies and defaults will begin to rise as fewer credits will be able to be rolled." Others are far more sanguine. While slowdowns in bank lending do tend to coincide with recessions, there have been some instances of it softening in the midst of an economic expansion, according to economists led by Jan Hatzius at Goldman Sachs and Daniel Silver at JPMorgan. The downturn in commercial and industrial bank loans is a "classic 'rear-view mirror' indicator of slowing economic conditions from late 2015 and early 2016, and as such doesn't provide any insights into future economic conditions," said Chris Watling, chief strategist at Longview Economics, an independent research firm. What's more, expectations of future credit conditions are bullish, presaging a likely uptick in corporate demand for loans in the coming months, according to Longview. Only a net 3 percent of U.S. businesses expect credit conditions to deteriorate, for example, according to a February survey from the National Federation for Independent Business. That's the strongest expression of confidence on credit conditions since 2004 -- businesses are routinely negative on the credit outlook -- and compares with a long-term average of 7.2 percent. Whatever the cause of the slowdown, investors won't have to wait long to find out if it's a temporary blip or something more profound. A model by Bloomberg Macro Strategist Cameron Crise that smooths changes in sentiment surveys suggests the drop in lending is reaching its nadir. At Bank of America, Meyer sees a three-quarter lag between improving consumer confidence and credit growth based on historic correlations, which would mark early 2018 as the market's moment of truth. "This means the potential improvement in the economy, as indicated by the strong surveys, is more a story for the next year than this year," she said.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Draper pulls shelter sites after hundreds protest, boo homeless man Mormon blogger trumpets alt-right racial views, but is out of tune with her religion Gehrke: What would the guy who couldn't find room at the inn think of our response to homeless shelt Accused former USU student Torrey Green texted 'they said i raped them yes i did' to friend Monson: Tanner Mangum owns BYU football now ELEVATE 2017’s top six tax questions answered   Professional-in-Residence Jim Mortensen Prepares Students to Become Top Advisors   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Traffic Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

The site could potentially house around 1,000 employees. http://www.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/jp-morgan-eyes-capital-dock-for-brexit-relocation-35576640.html http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article35576753.ece/53501/AUTOCROP/h342/ip%20KW%20Image%202.jpg Email US investment banking giant JP Morgan is understood to be considering the relocation of hundreds of its employees from London to Capital Dock, the 31,600 sq m (340,000 sq ft) office scheme currently being developed by Kennedy Wilson in Dublin's docklands. The site could potentially house around 1,000 employees. News of JP Morgan's potential post-Brexit move will be welcomed, coming as it does in the wake of the decision by two major insurance companies, Lloyd's of London and AIG, to choose Brussels and Luxembourg instead of Dublin for their respective European Union bases. Prior to last June's referendum, J.P Morgan boss Jamie Dimon said as many as 4,000 employees could be relocated if Britain chose to leave. While a source familiar with the matter insisted that a decision on Capital Dock was "still up in the air", JP Morgan's intentions in relation to the scheme's offices are currently the subject of intense speculation within Dublin's commercial real estate sector. The Irish Independent understands that JP Morgan has been engaged in a search for space capable of accomodating employees from both its existing offices at George's Dock in the IFSC and up to 500 personnel currently working within its London operations. In terms of timing, it remains unclear when the bank's current Dublin employees would relocate to new offices, given the fact that JP Morgan remains committed to a 25-year lease from December 1996 on its George's Dock premises. Capital Dock's office space is set to be delivered by Kennedy Wilson in the final quarter of this year, with 190 apartments on its adjoining 4.8 acre site ready for occupation from 2018, making both offerings timely propositions for JP Morgan and other financial services firms seeking to relocate from London in the wake of Brexit. Kennedy Wilson's intention to offer office tenants at Capital Dock priority access to the scheme's 190 apartments is widely acknowledged within property circles as providing it with an advantage over its competitors aiming to attract London-based banks to Dublin. The US-headquartered real estate giant has been aggressive in its pursuit of post-Brexit business, with members of its senior management confirming to analysts from Deutsche Bank as far back as last October that they had already held "preliminary talks" with a number of banks in London in relation to the relocation of some of their operations to Dublin. Asked by the Irish Independent for comment at the time, Kennedy Wilson Europe's chief operating officer Peter Collins said: "As a company with a long-term commitment to Ireland, we are of course interested in exploring the unfolding scenarios offered by Brexit and the potential for further investment in Ireland, and Dublin in particular." A request to Kennedy Wilson's spokesman for comment yesterday on JP Morgan's potential move to Capital Dock had not been met with a response by the time of going to press. JLL, the agents responsible for lettings at Capital Dock declined to comment on the matter, as did a spokeswoman for JP Morgan.

JP Morgan Chase said yesterday that it had cut the number of websites that it uses for display advertising from 400,000 to 5,000. An investigation by The Times revealed last week that ads featuring some of America’s biggest companies were being promoted alongside YouTube videos posted by hate preachers and other extremists. The ads appeared next to videos of Wagdi Ghoneim, an Egyptian cleric suspected of illegal fundraising, and Hanif Qureshi, whose teachings inspired the assassination of a Pakistani politician. The findings prompted Johnson & Johnson, AT&T, Verizon and other companies to pull advertising from YouTube and Google immediately. Several others,… Want to read more?

Hackers have been able to steal credit card and personal information from major companies like JPMorgan and Home Depot. As a result, cybersecurity has become more necessary, and instead of developing a dedicated department within a company, most opt to hire a third-party cybersecurity firm. What is interesting here is that many investors think cybersecurity is the next area in technology that needs real consolidation. The March 15 short interest data have been compared with the previous figures, and short interest in most of the selected cybersecurity stocks increased. FireEye Inc. (NASDAQ: FEYE) saw its short interest increase to 28.11 million shares from the previous reading of 26.79 million. Shares were last seen at $12.24, in a 52-week trading range of $10.35 to $18.73. The short interest at CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ: CYBR) increased slightly to 1.28 million shares from the previous level of 1.23. Shares were trading at $47.90, within a 52-week range of $37.00 to $59.28. Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.’s (NASDAQ: CHKP) short interest remained relatively flat to 6.32 million shares compared with the previous reading of 6.31 million. Shares were trading at $102.58, in a 52-week range of $74.34 to $104.35. The number of Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE: PANW) shares short also stayed essentially flat at 7.21 million, compared with the previous level of 7.22 million. Shares were trading at $110.60, within a 52-week range of $110.07 to $165.69. Fortinet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: FTNT) short interest increased to 5.51 million shares from its previous reading of 4.40 million. Shares were trading at $36.01, in a 52-week trading range of $28.01 to $38.33.

This time round the U.K. is the center of attention. British Prime Minister Theresa May this week officially triggered talks to break away from the European Union. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Companies were involved in deals totaling more than $93 billion this quarter, which included several U.K. businesses buying assets outside the country. That’s up from $37.1 billion in the same period last year. While uncertainty was fertile ground for corporate combinations, it had the opposite effect on appetite for new stock in the equity markets. Issuers raised a mere $1.7 billion from 11 IPOs, down from $2.38 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “Over the next two years there will be a period of heightened uncertainty and that will make companies think harder about M&A to generate growth,” said Ed Byers, co-head of U.K. investment banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “We expect to continue to see plenty of deal activity in the U.K. as companies adjust to the new reality and determine how to take their businesses forward.” The biggest deal by a U.K. company this year was Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc’s purchase of Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for nearly $18 billion including debt. The numbers would have been a lot higher if Kraft Heinz Co. had been successful in its $143 billion bid for London-listed Unilever. Appetite for U.K. companies with a global presence remains strong, with some acquirers hoping to take advantage of an approximately 16 percent decline in the pound against the dollar since Britain voted to leave the EU in June. European IPOs Low levels of activity in the U.K. IPO market were reflected across Europe as well, with this first quarter being the slowest for the share sales across the continent since a similar period in 2012. “There has been a heightened awareness of risks among investors as we get closer to certain political and macro events,” said Edward Sankey, head of equity syndicate at Deutsche Bank AG. Buyers have been more price sensitive on stock sales as a result, he said. The largest IPO in the U.K. this year was that of investment company BioPharma Credit Plc, which raised $762 million, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Deal volumes are also low because private equity exits, which powered the IPO markets in the last few years, have dried up, Sankey said. As the U.K. prepares for years of negotiations to strike a new deal with Europe and elections loom in the key economies of Germany and France, companies across the continent are using dealmaking as a way to take their businesses forward. Across the whole of Europe, M&A this quarter rose to more than $230 billion, the highest first-quarter volume since 2007. “While the outcome of the Brexit negotiations is unclear, most companies are not putting their plans on hold due to political uncertainty,” said Martin Todd, a European equities portfolio manager for Hermes Investment Management. “Negotiations are likely to be protracted, and ultimately Brexit is less of a talking point than one might expect.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is a Comeback Buy Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock: The Sleeping Giant Will Wake Soon Recent Posts: Embrace Facebook Inc (FB) Stock, Just Don’t Chase It! Buy Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) Stock on Any Dips Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is a Comeback Buy View All Posts Shares of Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) rallied 7.4% last Friday after the company reported better-than-expected results for its most recent quarter. Although MU stock has risen sharply over the past 12 months, the primary trend remains higher. Active traders and investors would be wise to respect this trend. When Micron announced strong results and promising guidance last week, analysts were quick to follow suit and raise their price targets for the stock. For example, JPMorgan raised its target from $33 per share to $38. Deutsche Bank propped its target on MU shares from $30 to $35. In my proprietary research, I have found mixed results over time regarding stocks reaching analyst price targets. However, when combined with a solid growth story and supporting charts — which is what we have right now in MU stock — stocks don’t often just meet these price targets, but easily surpass them. This then leads analysts to continuously raise their PTs until greed takes over and expectations get too high. Lastly, analysts end up greatly missing the major turning points — both in company fundamentals, and in stock prices. Let’s move on to Micron’s charts. MU Stock Charts We see on the multiyear weekly chart that Micron was a great breakout story from mid-2013 into late 2014. The wind then quickly changed, leading to a whopping 75% drop over the ensuing 13 months that fully retraced the entire 2013-14 breakout. Click to Enlarge However, note that despite the big drop, MU stock found support around the $10 area, which in years past had acted as a lid on the stock. So, with former resistance turning into technical support, Micron began clawing its way back up from the early 2016 lows in a trend that remains intact to this day. Trend followers and active investors alike should continue to respect this trend until it ends and the lower end of the uptrending parallels is violated for good.

Fiji Time: 7:07 PM on Friday 31 March Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business Banks reassure staff over disruptions Reuters Friday, March 31, 2017 BANKS in Britain have tried to reassure their London staff over possible Brexit disruption, including a shift in jobs to continental Europe, as Prime Minister Theresa May triggered formal EU divorce proceedings on Wednesday. Investment banks Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Nomura were among those who sent messages to employees in London, Europe's biggest financial center, as they work out how to keep serving clients across the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc. Morgan Stanley also informed employees in Europe that no decisions had yet been made on changes for when Britain departs, leaving the EU with 27 member states. But Rob Rooney, CEO of Morgan Stanley International, was blunter in updating them on the work of a committee comprising senior leaders at the bank which has been making Brexit contingency plans for over a year. "As prudence would dictate, we have been preparing for a worst case scenario, in which we would need to establish a more significant entity within the EU 27," Mr Rooney said in a memo to staff on Wednesday seen by Reuters. "We continue to monitor the situation closely and, when appropriate, will take the necessary decisions and begin to execute on our plans."

It’s proof that the takeover frenzy of the last two years is still going strong, despite factors that would seem to damp activity, Simon said at Tulane University’s Corporate Law Institute Conference in New Orleans. Companies are pushing ahead with consolidation despite political gridlock in Washington and policy changes in China that make it harder for corporations there to buy overseas. One thing in particular bodes well for dealmaking, Simon said. U.S. regulators -- whose pushback helped kill a “dramatic” $800 billion worth of deals last year -- are likely to be more welcoming of big transactions under the Trump administration. “We do think we will see a more benign regulatory environment,” he said. More Stability Deals worth a total of about $3.8 trillion were agreed on in 2016, according to data compiled by JPMorgan. While that was the third-best year on record, volumes still fell about 17 percent from 2015’s record $4.6 trillion in deals. A sharp drop-off in megadeals, worth $10 billion or more, as well as a slow down in health-care transactions, depressed activity last year. Big deals were down about 40 percent from the year earlier, while health-care M&A fell about 50 percent from the levels seen during the takeover frenzy in that industry in 2015, Simon said. Investment bankers, who bring in fees advising companies on dealmaking, tend to be optimistic by nature. Simon gave the room full of 600 lawyers, law students, publicists and reporters a slew of reasons to be bullish on deals in 2017. Economists are forecasting modest growth in gross domestic product, a lower unemployment rate and rising interest rates. At the same time, volatility is low and debt is relatively cheap and available. While stock prices are at all-time highs, the market is not “overbought,” he said. “One thing our industry craves is stability,” Simon said. “We couldn’t ask for a more stable environment.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

No recession unfolded. Nine months after Britain voted to leave the European Union (EU), disregarding warnings of grim economic consequences, a nation famous for calmly carrying on has seemingly gone about its business.   As Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday officially initiated Britain’s exit from Europe — Brexit, in everyday talk — the lack of disaster was touted by those steering the departure as a sign of little trouble ahead.   “There were predictions about what would happen to the economy if the United Kingdom voted to leave,” May told Parliament on Wednesday. “Those predictions have not proved to be correct. We see a strong economy.”   But the reassuring talk did not reckon with one significant detail: Nothing has actually happened yet.   May has only set in motion the complex, politically fraught divorce proceedings through which Britain must settle its affairs with the 27 jilted members of the EU. The outcome will almost certainly be costly: Britain has placed in jeopardy its trading relationship with Europe, its largest customer for exports, while imperiling London’s status as banker to the planet.   The markets essentially shrugged. The move was as expected as the next Super Bowl. The pound dipped a tad. So did shares on London’s stock market.   The immediate impact of May’s action was to start negotiations on future dealings across the English Channel. Those talks have a two-year deadline. If no deal is struck before then, Britain and Europe would plunge into a state of chaotic uncertainty.   Trade would revert to the rules of the World Trade Organization, making Britain’s exports to Europe vulnerable to tariffs and other barriers to commerce, including health and safety rules.   London’s bankers would be effectively severed from Europe, with many transactions for clients based on the Continent rendered illegal.   Until now, such issues were wrapped in layers of hypotheticals, with the details left for some indeterminate day when Britain’s government would make it real. That day has come.   Though the financial industry has been preparing to move jobs to other financial capitals in anticipation of a messy Brexit, other industries have waited for clarity. Now, they will feel pressure to act — shifting some lines of business to European capitals, perhaps shelving British expansions.   Global banking giants like Citigroup, HSBC and JPMorgan Chase may soon carry out plans to shift thousands of jobs to financial centers in the European Union. Goldman Sachs recently confirmed that it is moving hundreds of jobs out of London while expanding offices in Frankfurt and Paris.   Vodafone, the telecommunications giant, said after the referendum that it might shift its headquarters from London.   “The fact of setting this clock ticking is significant, because two years for many businesses is enough time for them to adapt, but short enough that they have to start making decisions really quickly,” said Nicolas Véron, an economist and senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institution in Brussels. “You will start to see very observable, concrete consequences of Brexit very soon.”   Britain has exploited its inclusion in Europe’s vast single market to make itself a dominant hub for multinational companies as various as aviation, pharmaceuticals and finance. They have set up factories, marketing teams and trading floors in Britain while selling to clients from Ireland to Greece, as if this swath of geography — home to some 500 million people — were one country.   So much for all that.   European leaders have consistently reaffirmed that remaining in the single market requires that Britain accept the free movement of people. That collides with a primary aim of many Brexit supporters — restricting immigration.   After months of pretending that a finesse could be found, May in January declared her government’s choice: enter immigration limits, goodbye single market.   Long before this political reckoning with reality, executives at global banks were already mulling which jobs to move from London to other cities in the European Union — Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Luxembourg.   “People will have to move,” said William Wright, founder and managing director of New Financial, a research institution in London. “There’s no other option.”   Predicting how many jobs will move has become a thriving cottage industry. Oliver Wyman, the global consultancy, concluded that if, as now seems likely, transactions in London for European clients are sharply curtailed, as many as 35,000 British jobs could disappear with as much as 20 billion pounds ($24.8 billion) in revenue.   After the Brexit vote, May met with Nissan’s chief executive to offer assurances that her government would do what was necessary to keep auto manufacturing competitive. Nissan said it would continue to make sport utility vehicles in Sunderland, a city in northern England.   Brexit supporters called the outcome a template for how a pragmatic British government would prevent businesses from abandoning its shores — with tax cuts, friendly regulation and deal making. But if Britain promised anything meaningful to Nissan, it probably violated World Trade Organization rules. Nissan has since said it continues to assess the uncertain economics of Britain. Ford and BMW are reassessing their British factories, too.   For now, Britain has managed to avoid the most frightening economic forecasts.   Before the referendum last June, the British Treasury predicted that a vote to exit could shrink the economy by as much 6 per cent annually for the first two years.   The economy expanded by 1.8 per cent last year. British consumers continued to spend. British factories continued to churn out cars, medical devices and aircraft parts, many of them destined for Europe.   This month, Toyota announced plans to sink an additional £240 million (about $297 million) into a factory in Derbyshire, though it qualified that it required reliable access to Europe. Snap, the parent company of social media darling Snapchat that raised $3.4 billion in an initial public offering, recently picked London as its international headquarters.   But consumer spending has been increasingly paid for by debt. The British pound has surrendered 17 per cent of its value against the dollar since the referendum, raising the cost of imported goods. Investment is flagging.   A weaker pound helps exports, making British goods cheaper on world markets. But exports have also been aided by the very thing Britain is trying to ditch — inclusion in Europe.   Proponents of Brexit tend to dismiss Europe as a land leading only in the numbers of unemployed men who are moving in with their parents. Britain’s next era is supposed to be centered on trade with faster growing, innovative nations like the United States.   Britain and Europe must negotiate a trade deal that will prevent a rupture to commerce. During the campaign, Brexit supporters argued that Europe would ultimately make it happen because its most powerful member, Germany, now sends a parade of BMWs, Audis and Volkswagens to Britain.   But trade negotiations are vulnerable to the manipulations of politically protected industries. This one seems particularly prone to acrimony. European leaders confront existential threats to their union, with political parties across the Continent hostile to its powers. Many are intent on using Britain to illustrate what they contend happens when a member leaves — nothing good.   “It’s common sense,” said Véron, an economist. “You don’t allow someone who leaves the club to have better terms than someone who’s in the club, or otherwise the club doesn’t mean anything.”   Even if European leaders seek middle ground, any one of the member nations could hijack the proceedings with their demands while the clock ticks away. Last year, a single province of Belgium nearly scuppered a trade deal negotiated between all of Europe and Canada in seeking favour for its dairy farmers.   In a bid to stake out a stronger negotiating position, May has threatened to walk away if Europe does not extend good terms. “No deal for Britain is better than a bad deal,” she said in January.   Whatever the comparative rankings of unfortunate events, Britain’s leaving Europe sans deal would be bad, as economists and people running businesses have said.   It is often said that businesses fear uncertainty more than anything. May just eliminated some of that. But she replaced it with an apparent certainty that presents its own troubles: Britain really is departing the largest consumer market on earth.   ©2017 The New York Times News Service   Read More On Brexit | European Union | Eu | Theresa May | Europe | Citigroup | Hsbc | International | Others PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements Club ITC - 25% earnings on dining at ITC Hotels The 'One' Sedan the World's Elite Prefer to Drive Banking conveinience on the go, anytime...anywhere Cover from Natural Calamities.

There has been growing speculation as to whether the U.S. central bank would soon consider reducing its bond holdings following three rounds of large-scale bond purchases or quantitative easing, one of the unconventional measures it used to combat the last recession. "In our baseline projection, the Fed slowly phases out MBS reinvestments beginning in the spring of next year, never halts reinvestments of Treasuries, never sells MBS, and reaches its new optimal size of the balance sheet in early 2024, with excess reserves in the banking system of $500 billion," JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli wrote in a research note. On March 22, the Fed had $2.46 trillion in Treasuries and $1.78 trillion in MBS. Several policymakers have raised concerns about the risks of the Fed maintaining the current level of its Treasuries and MBS holdings as it has remained on track to further increase short-term interest rates in the coming months. "While we see reinvestments phasing out early next year, we believe the Committee will want to formally agree on and communicate the plan sometime this year, perhaps by the summer or fall," wrote Feroli, referring to the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee, its policy-setting group. Fed's balance sheet is equivalent to 23 percent of the size of the U.S. economy compared with 6 percent prior to the global financial crisis more than eight years ago. Earlier Thursday, Goldman Sachs analysts said the Fed would shrink its balance sheet to 11 percent of U.S. gross domestic product or equivalent to $2 trillion, which could be achieved in late 2022. The FOMC will next meet on May 2-3.

The Mexican veteran has filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase & Co., alleging that bank officials conspired with his former tax preparers to steal $ 2.3 million. Marquez's lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court last Friday, is looking to get triple the amount in damages. The text of the complaint states that "the plaintiff believes that Chase agents, officers and/or employees were active participants and co-conspirators in criminal transactions." He also says the bank failed to adequately train their employees. Marquez's complaint alleges that his tax preparers were a father-son duo who opened accounts at the Chase branch on Philadelphia Street in the Los Angeles area of Whittier. According to the lawsuit, tax preparers, with the help of a notary, falsified Marquez's name on documents to open accounts at Chase in March 2013, using money that didn't belong to Marquez and without his knowledge. Then, they allegedly deposited Marquez's tax refund checks with sums ranging from $400,000 to 1.4 million. Marquez says the IRS sent him a letter, through his new accountant, in April 2015 - and the letter included copies of the allegedly stolen refund checks. Marquez, 43 years old, has not fought since 2014, but has not officially retired from boxing. He last saw action in May of 2014, when he won a twelve round decision over former world champion Mike Alvarado. The Mexican fighter is scheduled to meet with Zanfer Promotions in the coming days to finalize the details of his next fight. Marquez wants to return on a date in June. He won't mention any of the opponents until a deal is reached with Zanfer for the date, location and venue.

But there is still one way we can protect the environment ourselves, and that is by voting with our dollar. If you oppose our continued reliance on fossil fuels and the pipelines that transport them, begin taking steps today to break up with your megabank. The connection between your bank account and oil pipelines is more direct than you might think. Projects the scale of oil pipelines generally can’t be built without massive loans from massive banks. Where do banks get much of the money with which they make such loans? From deposits made by account holders. Take the Dakota Access Pipeline, for example. The 1,172-mile pipeline is thought to have cost Energy Transfer Partners and other stakeholders approximately $3.8 billion to build. The banks lending money to Energy Transfer Partners for the construction of this and other pipelines include Citibank, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, US Bank and Comerica. If you are banking at one of the institutions listed above, you may be inadvertently lending your money to companies constructing oil pipelines. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the 2.7 million miles of gas and oil pipelines in the United States alone experience an average of 310 pipeline-related “serious incidents” per year at an annual cost of $310 million. Pipeline spills can devastate habitats and ecosystems, damage human health, pollute drinking water and destroy livelihoods. In addition, pipeline construction prolongs our reliance on greenhouse gas-producing fossil fuels and delays our transition to cleaner energy sources. The Dakota Access Pipeline, in particular, has become a symbol of environmental racism and human rights abuses. The pipeline is expected to transport approximately 500,000 barrels of crude per day directly beneath the Missouri River. This crossing originally was planned near the city of Bismarck, but was moved near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation when Bismarck residents expressed concerns about their safety. The safety concerns as well as the sovereign rights of the Standing Rock tribe, however, were ignored, and peaceful protesters faced dog attacks, pepper spray, compression grenades, rubber bullets, tear gas, bean bag rounds, high-pressure hoses in sub-zero temperatures, and imprisonment. Luckily, the reliance by banks on customer deposits to fund pipelines and other large projects puts consumers in a position of power. If you bank at one of the institutions above and don’t want your money invested in pipelines, there’s an easy step you can take: Switch banks. Not only will this keep your personal money out of the hands of companies like Energy Transfer Partners, it will pressure banks like Wells Fargo to stop lending money to such companies in order to prevent the loss of additional customers. In other words, your consumer choices can directly impact the funding of existing and future pipelines. At the same time, there are other good reasons to divest from the big Wall Street banks behind the Dakota Access Pipeline, because many also were implicated in the subprime mortgage scandal, actively fund the boom in private prisons, and have been fined for various rate-fixing and money-laundering scandals that seem to do little to change their corporate behavior. So how do you start? First, you’ll need to choose a new bank. Local banks, credit unions and green banks are generally good options. Local banks tend to invest locally while credit unions are not-for-profit cooperatives. They generally have lower fees than banks and are also more likely to keep your money in the community. Although a local credit union may have limited locations, most credit unions participate in a nationwide network of surcharge-free ATMs. Green banks use public funds to finance the development of clean energy technologies. Next, you’ll need to transfer your money from the old account to the new. Once you’ve successfully moved your money, contact your bank to close your account, and — importantly — to tell them why you did so. To encourage people to make the shift, Davis’ Standing Rock Divestment Action Group is inviting Davis residents to take action en masse on April 14, which the group has declared Break Up With Your Megabank Day. You can sign the pledge to divest from banks funding pipelines and receive information on the April 14 action at bit.ly/breakupbank-pledge. If you do divest, you’ll be in good company. Since February, the city of Davis as well the cities of Seattle, Santa Monica and San Francisco have voted to divest from banks funding pipelines, and additional divestment movements are underway in cities both across the country and around the world. The divestment movement is beginning to catch the attention of corporate policymakers. At its annual shareholder meeting in April, for example, Wells Fargo shareholders will discuss the adoption of a policy “regarding the rights of indigenous peoples … affected by WFC financing.” While it is uncertain whether this policy will be adopted (or enforced), it’s a definite indication that the banks are beginning to listen. Make sure your voice is also heard. — Beth Graham is a graduate student at UC Davis who volunteers at a rehabilitation center for animals affected by oil spills. She coordinated the “Tipis for Standing Rock” campaign in Davis and delivered supplies to Standing Rock with her mother in December. Francisco Dominguez is a photographer/artist who has been active locally in the Standing Rock movement. He has worked with the Davis City Council to pass a resolution in support of the people of Standing Rock as well as the council’s decision to divest from Wells Fargo Bank.

According to Finextra, data from Burton-Taylor found the financial data services market rose 3.45 percent in 2016 and reached $27.48 billion. Despite the rise in spending, the total number of users who work from a Bloomberg terminal shrank for just the second time in its 36-year history. The other year of decline was 2009. The decline in Bloomberg's base shouldn't necessarily come as a surprise as various notable clients have been in talks with competing firms. For example, Bloomberg's second-biggest client, JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM was in talk with rival Thomson Reuters to supply up to 2,000 terminals which would have saved the bank up to $36 million in fees. "The industry showed steady overall growth in 2016 and, in spite of rather pessimistic forecasts from market participants surveyed last year, performed surprisingly well in the Americas and Asia," Finextra quoted Douglas Taylor, founder & managing director of Burton-Taylor as saying. "Although Emea held the market back last year, MiFID II requirements and the tight regulatory environment should drive spend in all regions in 2017."     Winners And Losers In Financial Data The decline has come as financial institutions and retail traders alike have sought to cut costs, leading to the rise of new research alternatives like Benzinga Pro. Finextra noted Bloomberg still dominates the financial data market with a 33.4 percent market share, while Thomson Reuters ranked second with a 23.14 percent market share. S&P Global Market Intelligence was one of the biggest winners in 2016 as its revenue grew year-over-year in 2016 by 21.85 percent. Among vendors with at least $500 million in global revenue, Platts delivered the highest five-year compound annual growth rate at 11.14 percent, followed by Global Market Intelligence (10.91 percent), Moody's Analytics (10.19 percent) and FactSet (8.72 percent).   © 2017 Benzinga.com.

Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters Financial sector Nils Pratley on finance London will remain Europe’s financial capital despite Brexit Nils Pratley Never mind Lloyd’s, City will remain streets ahead of its European competitors even if hundreds of jobs go to Paris or Brussels Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Thursday 30 March 2017 14.38 EDT Last modified on Thursday 30 March 2017 17.00 EDT If Lloyd’s of London is serious about banning its brokers from enjoying a pint at lunchtime, which was last month’s edict from the top of the Richard Rogers building, Brussels is probably not the best place to open a new base. The beer is excellent. Still, Lloyd’s Belgium-bound contingent will be few in number. The insurance market is moving “a few tens” of jobs from a London office that houses 700. Gags about Lloyd’s of Brussels don’t work, especially as the Belgian subsidiary, on day one, will employ fewer people than the Chinese one. So should we stop worrying about a mass exodus of jobs from the City? No. Lloyd’s is a poor guide to the wider employment picture because its Brexit adjustment was relatively straightforward. To allow business to continue as normal, it just had to set up a separately capitalised subsidiary in the EU with its own management team. Note, too, that the non-UK EU is currently a small part of its business – about 11% of premiums. For many big banks, the calculations on jobs could be very different. For them, the details of the trade agreement between the EU and the UK – assuming there is one – really matter. If vast chunks of EU-only financial activity have to be cleared within the EU, it is conceivable that sizeable trading teams could shift. Consider moves such as JP Morgan’s bid to buy an office in Dublin as sensible contingency planning: the bank won’t necessarily move hundreds of jobs, but it needs to be able to act quickly if necessary. None of which alters the fact that London will remain Europe’s financial capital for the foreseeable future under almost all circumstances. Even if 1,000 HSBC jobs go to Paris, or wherever, London will remain streets ahead of its European competitors. Three decades of post-Big Bang concentration in the UK cannot be reversed overnight. It’s on the global stage, however, that London could suffer more, at least until the new EU-UK financial arrangements are clear. Some of this financial activity can take place almost anywhere in the world. If you’re a US investment bank in New York, it’s currently an easy call to hire your globally-focused staff on the home front. In the banking jobs game, Wall Street looks the most obvious winner from Brexit. The real concern for Lloyd’s Lloyd’s financial figures for 2016 were the secondary story, but should not be ignored. Not for the first time, they told a tale of specialist insurance risk being seriously mis-priced in a world of low interest rates. At a headline level, all looked calm: pre-tax profits were steady at £2.1bn and Lloyd’s return on capital slipped only modestly from 9.1% to 8.1%. Scratch the surface, however, and the picture is different. Higher investment returns, coupled with a handy boost from sterling’s fall, did all the hard work. Profits from underwriting, the day-to-day business, plunged. The combined ratio – how much premium income is paid out in claims and expenses – was 98%, not the comfortable 90% of a year ago. If you’re in the insurance business, you can’t complain when risks materialise – in this case, hurricanes and wildfires. It was the first time since 2012 that claims have been above the long-term average. But you have to wonder what a truly horrendous year like 2011, which brought floods in Thailand and Australia, the New Zealand earthquake and the Japanese tsunami, would do. Lloyd’s and its members could cope because the market remains well capitalised. But the impact would surely be far heftier than the £500m loss seen back then. They were gentler times – competition was less intense and premiums were higher. Note chief executive Inga Beale’s stark warning: “The current situation where (re)insurance demand continues to be dwarfed by overall capacity, and continues to fuel a highly competitive environment, is not sustainable.” She can cut more costs, modernise and appeal for sensible pricing. But, as matters stand, specialist insurance continues to look like a dangerous bubble in the financial system. There is too much hot money chasing returns that look fundamentally fragile. AO World fund raising “This is our first capital raising since our IPO,” says Steve Caunce, chief executive of AO World, the online retailer of electrical goods. Make sure it is also your last. The over-hyped IPO, or flotation, in 2014 was pitched at 285p. Thursday’s £50m fund-raising, to fund expansion in Germany and the Netherlands, was at 132.5p. Long-term fans snapped up the stock happily, but let’s hope they really are the long-term sort. The first sight of profits from the European division is pencilled in for 2021 – and that’s on an “adjusted ebitda run-rate” basis.

Matthew Cochrane (CMFCochrane) Mar 30, 2017 at 1:20PM For the first time in its six year history, credit ranked as the overall preferred method of payment in Total Systems Services' 2016 U.S. Consumer Payment Study. The survey results reinforce what we seemingly observe every day. Consumers choose credit cards for a variety of reasons: reward points, credit score improvement, and superior protection against fraud. As credit card usage increases, it might be worthwhile, as both consumers and investors, to see which credit card companies command the most loyalty from their account holders. Fortunately, we have the Brand Keys' annual Customer Loyalty Engagement Index to help us with this task. Image source: Pixabay. While it is a little unclear how the index, which looks at customer relationships with 740 brands across 83 industries, calculates its loyalty rankings, the marketing consulting group did have this to say about its study: The Brand Keys data paints a detailed picture of the category drivers that engage customers, engender loyalty and drive real profits. These drivers not only define how the consumer will view the category, compare offerings, and, ultimately, buy, but also identify the expectations the consumer holds for each driver. The brand whose drivers come closest to meeting (or even exceeding) those of the category Ideal is always the one whose customers will demonstrate the highest levels of engagement and loyalty over the next 12 to 18 months. Credit card rankings In the credit cards category, the payment networks Mastercard and Visa finished sixth and fifth (tied) respectively. This might not be too surprising since the networks only facilitate transactions for the card-issuing banks and consumers and do not issue cards themselves. The big card-issuing banks finished higher on the list: Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) placed fifth (tie), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) fourth, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) third, and Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF) second. So, if the duopoly payment networks and the giant card-issuing banks didn't finish atop the rankings, who did? It was actually a tie between the American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) and Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS). Why American Express? I must admit, I was probably most surprised by the inclusion of American Express at the top spot. I thought too many angry customers being forced to exit American Express's fold when the company lost out on the Costco co-brand deal would have soured their ranking performance for a good while longer. But give the company credit. Its increase in marketing and focus on offering rewards that customers cannot get anywhere else seem to be paying off. In 2016's fourth quarter, American Express spent more than $1.2 billion on marketing and promotion expenses; a whopping 30% sequential increase over the third quarter! IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL Q4'16 SLIDE PRESENTATION In the most recently reported quarter's conference call, CFO Jeffrey Campbell commented on the rewards that he believes set American Express apart from other credit card rivals: We are seeing higher levels of engagement in many of our premium services, such as airport lounge access, and cobrand benefits such as First Bag Free on Delta. As we look ahead to 2017, we will continue to invest through this line as we expand the differentiated features and benefits we offer to our Card Members. We view this as another important component of our initiatives to drive revenue growth. Why Discover? For those keeping score, this is Discover's at least second consecutive year finishing on top of the rankings. It should also be noted that this isn't the only survey finding Discover on top of customer satisfaction ratings. Last year, Discover finished first in the J.P. Power credit card customer satisfaction ratings for the third year in a row. Discover's business growth seems to reflect these high marks in customer satisfaction. Last quarter, every one of Discover's loan portfolios saw growth including its credit card, personal, and student loan portfolios. In last quarter's press release, CEO David Nelms stated, "We are proud of all we accomplished in 2016, including record originations in personal and student loans as well as strong new card account growth, all of which helped us to achieve nearly 7% loan growth." Image source: Discover Financial Services 2016 Q4 Earnings Presentation So what is consistently setting Discover apart from its peers? In last quarter's conference call, Nelms explained that the 5% cash back the company offers is a great headline number that grabs new customers' attention. Nelms also believes the revolving broad categories increased customer engagement with their Discover cards. But the secret sauce might be more than just the percentage the company offers back as rewards. In the company's 2016 fourth quarter conference call, CFO R. Mark Graf explained: ...we're very focused on an overall value proposition as opposed to competing on the basis of headline earn rate, right? So it's also about ease of redemption, dollar thresholds to redeem. We removed all those things. So it's not just about what's the headline earn. It's can you actually use it, right? Discover deserves extra credit for creativity in this category. In its recent deal with PayPal, Discover was the first credit card company to work into the deal that its card holders could redeem points through using PayPal's payment platform. Offering differentiating rewards and giving customers option regarding how to redeem their rewards appear to be a winning combination for increasing customer loyalty. Investors should take note: There are worse investing metrics to follow than a company's customer-base satisfaction when considering potential investments.  Matthew Cochrane owns shares of Mastercard.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wall Street gained on Thursday, led by financial shares, after data showed U.S. economic growth was stronger than previously reported last quarter, helped by robust consumer spending, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq set a record closing high. The energy sector rose for a third straight day, supported by stronger oil prices and a 8.8-percent gain for ConocoPhillips , the biggest percentage riser on the S&P 500 after it agreed to sell oil and gas assets. The S&P 500 gained for a third straight day, rebounding after its worst week of the year last week. U.S. economic growth slowed less than previously reported in the fourth quarter as robust consumer spending provided a boost, the Commerce Department said. Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1 percent annualized rate instead of the previously-reported 1.9 percent pace. A record-setting rally for stocks in the wake of President Donald Trump's November election stalled somewhat this month, with some investors pointing to risks to Trump's agenda, including tax reform, after his fellow Republicans failed to pass a healthcare bill. The GDP report is "basically an affirmation that, hey, at the end of the day, Washington will do and say whatever they are going to do, but the economy is marching forward," said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. "It’s not just the U.S. economy, but we do see definitely improvement throughout the world," Cavanaugh said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 69.17 points, or 0.33 percent, to 20,728.49, the S&P 500 gained 6.93 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,368.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 16.80 points, or 0.28 percent, to 5,914.34. The Nasdaq closed at a record high after rising for a fifth straight session. Financial shares surged 1.2 percent, with Bank of America and Citigroup propping up the S&P 500. The defensive utilities sector was the worst-performing group, falling 0.7 percent. Investors are also turning their attention to the impending first-quarter earnings season to justify lofty valuations for stocks. The S&P 500 is trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months against its long-term average of 15. First-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 10.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We continue to see decent-to-improving economic data primarily in employment," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York. "We are likely to see a good quarter in terms of earnings, so I think there is some anticipation perhaps in the market here." In corporate news, Lululemon Athletica shares plunged 23.4 percent after the Canadian yoga and leisure apparel retailer said first-quarter comparable sales were expected to fall. About 6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.56-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.49-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 99 new highs and 19 new lows.

AirPods A Bloomberg report shares that the new credit line will be coming from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and five other banks. People close to the matter said the increased financial resources will give Dropbox flexibility as it considers an IPO, which the established startup may be ready for by the end of this year. However, Dropbox may take its time after considering its performance, finances, and noting IPO’s such as its competitor Box Inc.: Box Inc., a rival file-storage company, went public in 2015. After popping on the first day of trading, Box lost 40 percent of its market value over the course of that year. Dropbox’s private investors soon began scrutinizing the startup more closely, and mutual fund backers wrote down the values of their stakes. Dropbox is nearing profitability and most recently had an annual revenue of $1B. Dropbox has said it’s not in a hurry to go public and that the business is nearing profitability. The company is cash-flow positive, with annualized revenue of more than $1 billion, Chief Executive Officer Drew Houston said last summer. Dropbox recently released updates to its plans and services with a focus on business customers. Bloomberg notes that change along with shifting from relying Amazon’s services to building its own data centers as two positive moves for growth. Dropbox has shifted to focus on selling its cloud service to larger businesses, which has helped boost revenue. It has also cut costs, partly by building data centers instead of relying on Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud storage. Dropbox’s growth is encouraging, and its cash generation is impressive compared with most other unicorn businesses, said a banker close to the deal. Unnamed sources shared that banks will see a Dropbox IPO as a safer investment when compared with Snap Inc. with regular subscription revenue and more predictable cash flow. Additionally, the new $600M credit line is not in addition to a previous $500M line but rather replacing it.

Plenty of investors are still willing to pay extra to have humans look after their wealth. Just ask Garth Taljard, who helps oversee 50 multi-asset funds for Schroders Plc, the U.K.’s biggest asset manager. As mutual funds lost more than $300 billion in the U.S. since 2014 amid the rush into cheaper passive funds that mimic indexes, he was hiring to keep up with demand that doubled over five years. “Investors realize it’s quite challenging for themselves to do asset allocation, it’s very much a full-time job,” said Taljard, who added two new money managers this year to a global team of 85, responsible for divvying up 64 billion pounds ($80 billion) of clients’ cash. Funds like his haven’t suffered the same fate as other active portfolios because they offer something that isn’t easy to automate: a one-stop-shop where risk-averse insurers or pension funds can spread money across assets as diverse as U.S. blue-chip stocks and emerging-market currencies. This strategy gained popularity after the global financial crisis -- Morgan Stanley says $2 trillion flooded into multi-asset funds since then -- because investors wanted to shield their wealth from future market shocks. Political turbulence from the election of Donald Trump and the rise of European anti-euro parties will only fuel demand. While the funds generate lower returns, their managers can hedge against unforeseen turmoil by quickly moving into safer assets and reverting to riskier ones once things settle down. That versatility comes with a fee more than double that on exchange-traded funds, according to industry data provider Morningstar Inc. “Investors are looking for active multi-asset managers to help navigate potentially troubled waters ahead,” said Taljard, who moved to London last year from Hong Kong, where he oversaw Schroders’ Asian multi-asset business. ETF Dominance As managers like him thrive, traditional mutual funds have, by and large, lost out to ETFs, especially in the U.S. Known as passive funds because their managers don’t actively pick individual securities to buy and sell, ETFs charge on average about 10 basis points and routinely beat their active counterparts. They’ve fetched $2.8 trillion of inflows since 2008, almost half in just the past three years, Morningstar data show. But there’s a catch: passive funds are easy to enter and exit and thus attract a lot of the speculative money that flees quickly in a market rout. Pension funds and insurers are limited by how much they can expose their customers’ retirement savings to risks. After the 2008 crash, Europe slapped rules dubbed Solvency II on insurers, for instance, to guarantee their business models are safe enough to ride out a severe financial shock. This is where multi-asset managers carved out a niche. Years of near-zero and negative interest rates in the industrialized world made it impossible for institutions to keep relying on bond funds for wealth preservation. Instead of trying to build their own complex investment portfolios to generate steady returns, many handed the reins to the likes of Schroders and JPMorgan Chase & Co., whose assets under management quadrupled in the five years through December to $199 billion. Multi-asset managers broadened their mandates beyond equities and fixed-income, and analyze factors like valuation, carry and momentum when allocating funds. They also invest across countries and industries, including in ETFs, helping them secure a new captive audience. “Some types of investors felt after the financial crisis that asset allocation is very challenging and it’s good to get help,” said Olivia Mayell, a fund manager at JPMorgan Asset Management in London. Future appetite for these strategies depends, to some extent, on whether the normalization of U.S. and European monetary policy starts to draw people back to traditional low-risk investments, like bonds. Missed Opportunity For the downside protection, investors in multi-asset funds have also missed out on a whole lot of upside. A stock-market rally handed investors in the S&P 500 about 70 percent in five years, while a Bank of America Merrill Lynch global bond index returned 17 percent. The performance may not be enough to turn the tide. While more expensive than ETFs, the 1.02 percent median fee on European multi-asset funds is about half the cost of typical hedge funds, and pressure to reduce fees is only building. “To some extent the multi-asset fund is giving you a little bit of what the fund of hedge funds gave you in the past, in terms of equity-like returns but with lower risk,” said Randal Goldsmith, a senior analyst at Morningstar in London. Geopolitical turmoil is also a boon for multi-asset strategies, according to Michael Cyprys, an asset-management analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. Investors want “downside protection” against shocks and are more inclined to seek outcomes -- like capital preservation or inflation protection -- than high returns, he said. Le Pen Risk One such blow would be if anti-euro nationalist Marine Le Pen wins French presidential elections next month, sending the euro tumbling 10 percent if JPMorgan predictions are right, and triggering a 23 percent drop in the Euro Stoxx 50, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch projections. The loss for a multi-asset fund that counterbalances European holdings with haven assets like the Japanese yen? About 4 percent, says Legal & General Investment Management’s London-based head, John Roe, who’s AUM swelled from 1 billion pounds to 15 billion in four years. Back at Schroders, Taljard said although demand remains high, asset managers are vying for contracts with clients who increasingly want to keep running their own funds, but with a hand from the industry. “Instead of just giving us a mandate to manage they also want to learn and share ideas with us,” he said. “Schroders has grown its assets, but we’ve also seen a lot more competition.” This article was provided by Bloomberg News.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wall Street gained on Thursday, led by financial shares, after data showed U.S. economic growth was stronger than previously reported last quarter, helped by robust consumer spending, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq set a record closing high. The energy sector rose for a third straight day, supported by stronger oil prices and a 8.8-percent gain for ConocoPhillips , the biggest percentage riser on the S&P 500 after it agreed to sell oil and gas assets. The S&P 500 gained for a third straight day, rebounding after its worst week of the year last week. U.S. economic growth slowed less than previously reported in the fourth quarter as robust consumer spending provided a boost, the Commerce Department said. Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1 percent annualized rate instead of the previously-reported 1.9 percent pace. A record-setting rally for stocks in the wake of President Donald Trump's November election stalled somewhat this month, with some investors pointing to risks to Trump's agenda, including tax reform, after his fellow Republicans failed to pass a healthcare bill. The GDP report is "basically an affirmation that, hey, at the end of the day, Washington will do and say whatever they are going to do, but the economy is marching forward," said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. "It’s not just the U.S. economy, but we do see definitely improvement throughout the world," Cavanaugh said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 69.17 points, or 0.33 percent, to 20,728.49, the S&P 500 gained 6.93 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,368.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 16.80 points, or 0.28 percent, to 5,914.34. The Nasdaq closed at a record high after rising for a fifth straight session. Financial shares surged 1.2 percent, with Bank of America and Citigroup propping up the S&P 500. The defensive utilities sector was the worst-performing group, falling 0.7 percent. Investors are also turning their attention to the impending first-quarter earnings season to justify lofty valuations for stocks. The S&P 500 is trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months against its long-term average of 15. First-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 10.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We continue to see decent-to-improving economic data primarily in employment," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York. "We are likely to see a good quarter in terms of earnings, so I think there is some anticipation perhaps in the market here." In corporate news, Lululemon Athletica shares plunged 23.4 percent after the Canadian yoga and leisure apparel retailer said first-quarter comparable sales were expected to fall. About 6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.56-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.49-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 99 new highs and 19 new lows.

Photos Videos Topics Live UAE 99/3 (28.5) - PNG (Yet to bat) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Ravindra Gaikwad Yogi Adityanath Virat Kohli Donald Trump Narendra Modi Home Money US STOCKS-Wall St higher as bank stocks gain after GDP data Shares1 Thu, 30 Mar 2017-08:42pm , Reuters U.S. stocks were higher in morning trading on Thursday as bank stocks gained after data showed that the domestic economy grew at a faster pace in the fourth-quarter than previously estimated. Gross domestic product increased 2.1 percent, compared with the previously reported 1.9 percent, the Commerce Department said. Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan were all up between 0.8-1.6 percent, while Goldman Sachs' 1.4 percent rise helped lift the Dow. The market has been range bound in the past few days as investors look for new catalysts and assess the impact of Republicans' failure to pass a healthcare bill on tax reform and the rest of President Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda, hopes for which have helped drive stocks to record highs. But the rally may be near its peak, according to a Reuters poll of strategists, who forecast U.S. shares will gain less than 3 percent between now and year-end. The S&P had risen 10.3 percent since the U.S. election through Wednesday's close. The rapid climb in equities has raised concerns regarding valuations, with the S&P 500 trading at nearly 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months against its long-term average of 15 times. The market will be looking at quarterly earnings to see if the lofty valuations can be supported. First-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 10.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "It's the end of the quarter and investors are buying whatever little dip that we've seen," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. "The market has been quiet in the past few days and are looking forward to the first-quarter earnings in the absence of any major economic data." At 10:50 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 82.9 points, or 0.4 percent, at 20,742.22. The S&P 500 was up 7.54 points, or 0.31 percent, at 2,368.67. The Nasdaq Composite was up 15.52 points, or 0.26 percent, at 5,913.06. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the financial index's 0.93 percent rise leading the advancers. Investors are also watching comments from a host of Federal Reserve officials on clues for the path forward for interest rate hikes. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she sees more rate hikes this year as the U.S. economy is expected to rebound from what looks like a weak first quarter. Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan, San Francisco Fed head John Williams and New York Fed President William Dudley are also scheduled to make appearances. Shares of Lululemon Athletica plunged as much as 22.6 percent to a more than one-year low of $51.30 after the Canadian yoga and leisure apparel retailer said first-quarter comparable sales were expected to fall. ConocoPhillips rose 7.8 percent to $49.50 after the company said it agreed to sell oil sands and western Canadian natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy. Cenovus was down 10.9 percent at $11.65. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,642 to 1,103. On the Nasdaq, 1,524 issues rose and 1,096 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 14 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 67 new highs and 11 new lows.

To learn more and subscribe, please click here. American Express has upped the signup bonus for its premium Platinum card from 40,000 to 60,000 points, in what is widely seen as an attempt to one-up its competitor JPMorgan Chase’s Sapphire Reserve card, reports the Wall Street Journal. To earn the new introductory bonus, customers will have to spend $5,000 in the first three months, up from $3,000 previously. The high upfront rewards will be a growing cost for American Express in the short term, but is intended to attract customers that will quickly generate enough fees to offset their acquisition costs. Issuers are recalibrating rewards after the extravagant peak in late 2016. Fueled by credit card debt’s rise to prerecession levels, credit card companies brought rewards to new heights to attract customers. As 2016 drew to a close, American Express and Chase both offered up to 100,000 points as incentives to pick up their cards, which amounts to a monetary value of roughly $1,500. Total spending by issuers on rewards rose to $22.6 billion in 2016, up from $10.4 billion in 2010. Recently, American Express and Chase have both walked back their upfront rewards, and shifted attention to modifying rewards programs and fee structures to stay competitive. For example, American Express partnered with Uber to give Platinum cardholders free ride credits every month and has upped annual fee from $450 to $550. Looking ahead, card issuers are expected to place greater attention on using analytics to identify customers who open cards for upfront rewards and the close them, in a process known as “churning.” That cost-savings measure could help the companies get the most out of their high spending on rewards.  Retailers like Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts are winning over consumers with their mobile wallets — apps developed by stores to make it easier for their customers to pay, and to deliver valuable perks.  And these retailer wallets are leading the overall mobile wallets industry, thanks to their ability to rapidly push out innovative features like rewards programs, coupons, mobile order-ahead, and custom marketing. This may be surprising considering that retailer mobile wallets can be used only at a specific retailer’s locations; in contrast, popular universal mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay can be used at multiple retailers, as long as users are using the necessary smartphones. Ayoub Aouad, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on retailer mobile wallets that assesses what makes them so successful and which retailers can most effectively leverage the technology to push sales, traffic, and average ticket size. The report also outlines what makes these mobile wallets attractive, and discusses some of the advancements being made in the payments industry that will affect mobile wallets' growth rate. Here are some key takeaways from the report:  Retailers with large addressable user bases who are loyal, repeat visitors, will see their mobile wallets continue to be popular with consumers, especially as there continues to be slow merchant adoption of near-field communication (NFC) technology as well as weak offerings by universal mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. Loyalty programs will be a significant driver in retailer mobile wallet adoption. Companies like Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts have been able to leverage their loyalty programs to acquire mobile wallet users, which, in turn, has driven store traffic and conversion rates. By leveraging these programs, sales are expected to grow at a five-year compound annual growth rate of 68%. However, adoption will begin to decelerate as a result of increased competition by 2020. As universal mobile wallet players begin to add effective loyalty programs and coupons to their offerings, adoption for retailer-based mobile wallets is likely to slow down because these offerings are their main marketing points.  In full, the report:  Explains what hurdles universal mobile wallets have faced. Details what features retailers have adopted into their mobile wallets that have been successful   Analyzes the use cases of retailers that have successfully leveraged their mobile wallet offerings to push growth. Identifies how universal mobile wallets will eventually slow growth for retailer-based mobile wallets.  Interested in getting the full report?

Morgan Stanley said earlier this month that the inclusion of Chinese government bonds in major bond indexes could trigger $250 billion to $300 billion of inflows into China onshore notes. The moves are also spurring other global asset managers to hire. Citigroup Index LLC said this month that Chinese onshore sovereign bonds are set to join some of its gauges but omitted them from its key World Government Bond Index, while Bloomberg Barclays Indexes, owned by Bloomberg, overhauled its China fixed-income gauges and started a Global Aggregate + China index on March 1. Briscoe said that the inclusions are the “warning shot across the bow for everybody to get ready”. He declined to comment on the number of hires the firm plans to make but said that it is “applying for our WFOE status within China,” referring to the wholly foreign-owned enterprise designation. Foreign funds with investment management enterprises that have that status can raise money from onshore institutional and high-net-worth investors once registered with the Asset Management Association of China. More bankers The moves focused on China’s bond market come even as Sam Kendall, who runs UBS Group AG’s regional investment bank, is trying to widen the firm’s scope by assigning more bankers to a pan-Asian focus and pushing them to pursue deals that aren’t directly linked to the health of the broader Chinese markets. UBS Group is the asset management unit’s parent. UBS Asset has also been readying China funds and in March launched its China High Yield Bond fund, which invests in US dollar and yuan debt. The firm plans to sell the fund to onshore investors once it meets the requirements of the Mutual Recognition of Funds programme, which enables investment vehicles to be offered both on the mainland and in Hong Kong. With China now the world’s second-largest economy, UBS Asset is positioning itself to take global investors onshore. “You need to get China right if you want to get Asia right,” Briscoe said.

David Rockefeller David Rockefeller, heir to one of history’s most fabled fortunes, died on March 20. At 101, he was the world’s oldest billionaire. He was the last-surviving grandson of the Standard Oil founder John D Rockefeller, America’s first billionaire. He was the only one of his family’s five sons to spend his entire professional career in the corporate world, rising to chief executive of Chase Manhattan Bank during 35 years at the company. He was a confidant of world leaders from Deng Xiaoping to Fidel Castro. Under Rockefeller, Chase – now known as JP Morgan Chase – was the first US bank to open offices in the Soviet Union and China and, in 1974, the first to open an office in Egypt after the Suez crisis of 1956. Rockefeller would visit the bank’s Arabian Gulf units each year in his Gulfstream II jet. Nemir Kirdar, who would go on to found Investcorp but from 1976 to 1981 was Chase’s head for the region, in his memoir described Rockefeller’s meeting with Sheikh Zayed on one such tour. The scene comes after the men have been introduced: "‘Your Highness,’ Rockefeller continued, ‘I see all this extraordinary development taking place in Abu Dhabi under your rule. I run a bank and that’s challenging enough, but to build a whole nation is amazing. How have you achieved it?’ "Sheikh Zayed was by nature a deep and thoughtful man. When I translated Rockefeller’s remarks, he looked at me with his penetrating gaze for what seemed an age. He absorbed the question and seemed to turn it around in his mind. Then he said slowly: ‘It’s like a tree’. There he paused. I sat attentively, expecting him to continue. Rockefeller raised an eyebrow at me, wanting to know what he’d said. "‘Sir, he says it’s like a tree’, I explained. "Now we were both waiting for the next remark. But that was it. In that one phrase, Sheikh Zayed had summed up his whole philosophy as a founder of his nation." Royal Robbins In 1957, Royal Robbins became the first climber to ascend the Half Dome formation in America’s Yosemite park. A decade later he made the climb alongside his wife, Liz, which made her the first woman to scale the route. Afterwards the couple were aghast at a picture of themselves in their moment of triumph, clad in torn shorts and scruffy shirts. "When we looked at that picture," Robbins said, "we said, maybe we’d better get in the clothing business". They started selling climbing gear and clothes out of a garage in Modesto, California, the next year. They were climbing in England’s Lake District in 1971 when Robbins’ wife became friendly with local women who made wool sweaters and asked them to tailor the jumpers to suit the needs of climbers. These quickly became a popular item. According to a history on the company website: "The Herdwick and Swaledale sheep’s wool made for rugged, durable sweaters that, with slight improvements, were ideal for cool weather climbing." The company adopted the name Royal Robbins and did much of its sales through mail order and, later, online. In 2003 the couple sold the business. But while Robbins ran it, he tried to make it a pleasant place to work, and he tried to make the gear as ecologically friendly as possible. "I wanted to be remembered for the leadership of my company in a joyful way. People had fun," he said. As a climber he had tried to leave behind few traces of his presence; this became known as "clean climbing". As a retailer he specialised in gear that could be removed from the mountain, unlike the old-style metal pitons that many climbers used. In his later years, when arthritis meant he could not keep on climbing, he turned to kayaking and rafting as a way of staying close to nature. Robbins died on March 14 at age 82. Chuck Barris Chuck Barris was a legendary television producer who at his commercial peak was supplying the US networks with 27 half-hour shows a week. His greatest fame, however, came when he took to the stage himself. Barris, who died on March 21 at age 87, pioneered programme formats that put ordinary people in embarrassing situations on The Dating Game and The Gong Show during the 1960s and ‘70s. Barris was considered a television revolutionary for creating programme formats that lasted for decades and sowing the seeds of reality television by showing everyday Americans on primetime TV. The Dating Game is often compared to The Bachelor, which premiered on ABC in 2002. Barris’s family was left destitute when his dentist father died of a stroke. Later, when Barris attended Drexel University in his native Philadelphia, he spent summers working in his grandfather’s clothing store. After graduation, he moved to Pittsburgh to work for US Steel. "My ambition came from my great fear of ever ending up in that clothing business," he once said. Barris moved to New York and worked as a page at NBC, where he was accepted for its management-training programme after using top industry executives as bogus references on his résumé, he said. He then landed a job with Dick Clark on American Bandstand in Philadelphia. Barris also became a pop music producer, writing the 1962 hit Palisades Park for the singer Freddy Cannon. The song peaked at No 3 on the US pop charts. Switching to daytime programming at ABC, Barris developed game shows in Los Angeles. He founded Chuck Barris Productions in 1965. His shows included The Parent Game, The $1.98 Beauty Show and Three’s a Crowd. After selling his company in 1987, he moved to St Tropez, France, where he lived for a decade. He became recognisable to a generation of North Americans as the zany host of The Gong Show, which showcased amateur acts notable for an absence of talent and the participants’ willingness to make themselves look foolish. Billed as "everybody’s chance at the big time", it featured performances that could be terminated as soon as one of three celebrity judges struck the gong, a large metallic disc that emitted a crashing sound. Joe Rogers The Waffle House co-founder Joe Rogers, who went from short-order cook to co-founder of one of America’s largest restaurant chains, died on March 3. He was 97. Rogers, born in Jackson, Tennessee, was the son of a railway worker who was laid off during the Great Depression. With his father unemployed, Rogers delivered newspapers and laundry to contribute to the family income. During the Second World War, he joined the US Army Air Corps, learnt to fly and also trained B-24 pilots, eventually earning the rank of captain. After the war, he found work grilling burgers during the day at a Toddle House restaurant in New Haven, Connecticut. At night, he studied accounting and other aspects of the business from the manager and his wife. He was quickly promoted to local and regional management positions. After moving to the state of Georgia, in 1955 Rogers and Tom Forkner opened the first Waffle House restaurant just east of Atlanta in Avondale Estates. Under their leadership, the Waffle House chain grew to 400 restaurants by the end of the 1970s. Rogers still spent time at the corporate headquarters in nearby Norcross until a few years ago, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. "I’m not an executive, I’m a waffle cook," Rogers told the newspaper. "My father genuinely loved every customer who walked into a Waffle House, and customers immediately understood that," said Rogers’ son, the Waffle House chairman Joe Rogers Junior. Christy Mihos Christy Mihos, who built and sold a chain of convenience stores bearing his name, twice ran unsuccessfully for governor of Massachusetts and endured bankruptcy, died on March 2. He was 67. Mihos, who was born in the Massachusetts city of Brockton, turned his ­father’s grocery store into a chain of nearly 150 stores across New England called Christy’s Markets. He and his brother eventually sold the chain for millions of dollars. In 1999, he was appointed to the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority board and campaigned against mismanagement and cost overruns in the multibillion-dollar Big Dig motorway project. Mihos and another board member, Jordan Levy, were fired by the state’s acting Republican governor, Jane Swift, but took their case all the way to the state’s highest court and were reinstated. Mihos mounted failed runs for governor as an independent in 2006 and as a Republican in 2010. His later life was marred by the bankruptcy, which overlapped with a nasty divorce squabble that resulted in him spending a week in jail for failing to pay his wife nearly US$80,000. George Olah George Olah, who came to North America as a refugee and went on to win a Nobel Prize in chemistry for finding a way to stabilise an elusive form of carbon and use it as a catalyst, died on March 8. He was 89. His work had important industrial applications, from the more effective oil refining to the production of less polluting forms of petrol and even the development of new medicines. Olah, a native of Budapest, fled in 1956 with his family when the Soviets crushed the Hungarian Uprising. After the family’s landing in Montreal, Canada, Olah found work as a research scientist at Dow Chemical in Sarnia, Ontario. In the Dow lab he began to study carbocations, which are carbon atoms whose existence is so fleeting that many scientists believed they did not exist. Olah discovered through many hours of lab work that not only did they exist, but they would remain stable if you dissolved them in certain "superacids", which are hundreds of times stronger than sulphuric acid. This allowed him to study the carbon atoms and find their potential applications. "This transformed the field of carbocation chemistry and paved the way for synthesis methods involving the use of superacid catalysts that produce important organic compounds," Chemical News wrote in its obituary of Olah. He was awarded the Nobel in chemistry in 1994, by which time he had left Dow for academia, first at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, and then, from the late 1970s, at the University of Southern California.In recent years he had worked on the potential of methanol as a form of renewable energy. According to his obituary, Olah believed that you could take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and, through a reaction with hydrogen, produce methane, a gas for which he had developed methods for conversion to methanol. This, he asserted, would end humanity’s dependence on fossil fuels while also cleansing the atmosphere of built-up carbon dioxide. This would require huge amounts of energy, which he proposed to gather from natural sources such as sunlight and wind. * Agencies and The National business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Economy Future of Industry: Mubadala looks to TS&S for aircraft engine plans Mubadala reports Dh4.1bn income in 2016 as diversification pays off March’s business obituaries: David Rockefeller, Royal Robbins and the Waffle House boss Future of Industry: 3M aims to increase sales in Abu Dhabi with move towards heavy industry MOST VIEWED Business | All Hyperpanda to shutter its doors in Dubai Festival City Life on the Dubai Marina, starting at Dh1.3 million – in pictures Thousands of cosmetics salespeople set to give Dubai economy a lucrative makeover Auditor warns on Drake & Scull’s future as contractor breaches terms of bank loans Mubadala reports Dh4.1bn income in 2016 as diversification pays off Amazon purchase of Souq.com gets warm reception from consumers in UAE Marina Gate apartments in Dubai dazzle once the dust clears Vice to start hiring as it targets Middle East millennials Retailers not alone in gaining lift from post-Brexit pound Taqa reports Dh19 billion in losses for 2016 from drained oil and gas asset values More Most Viewed Deputy Ruler of Fujairah laid to rest Sharjah girl dies from injuries after quad bike crash Emirates plane damaged in minor collision in Singapore Watch Dubai Crown Prince help pull stuck lorry out of the desert Officials backtrack on move to reduce speed limits on Emirates and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed roads Fujairah’s problem solver: Sheikh Hamad bin Saif — in pictures Children in UAE at low risk from measles outbreak sweeping southern Europe UAE gamers voice anger as Discord chat app blocked by Etisalat Emirati teens in Ajman injured in explosion after ‘inhaling gas’ Hyperpanda to shutter its doors in Dubai Festival City More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Vice to start hiring as it targets Middle East millennials Emirates mulls loaning laptops to passengers amid US ban Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Officials backtrack on move to reduce speed limits on Emirates and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed roads Watch Dubai Crown Prince help pull stuck lorry out of the desert Switch to Mobile Site About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

Ralf Witzler is from Frankfurt Main Finance, he says its not so easy for financial institutions to just up sticks: “Relocations could be quite ambitious, particularly for the American banks, and for the big Swiss banks whose business is brokerage. It is very complicated. For commercial banks the move would be less complicated, they have a bit more room for manoeuvre. Asset management can relocate relatively quickly. The most pressure is on the big investment banks.” Others maybe leaving on a jet plane as Ryanair and EasyJet have been warned by the EU to relocate out of London or sell off shares to European nationals if they wish to continue to operate intra-Europe routes such as Paris to Berlin.

REUTERS/ Ali Jarekji (Copyright Reuters 2017) Saudi Aramco has formally appointed JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and HSBC as international financial advisers for its initial public offering, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Continue Reading Below The trio join Moelis & Co and Evercore, which have been appointed independent financial advisers, one source said of what is expected to be the world's biggest share sale. The Saudi authorities aim to sell up to 5 percent of Aramco, listing the shares in Riyadh and at least one foreign exchange to raise cash for investment in new industries in a bid to diversify away from oil exports in an era of cheap crude. Aramco has appointed Saudi Arabia's NCB Capital and Samba Capital as local advisers, the sources said. Reuters previously reported that JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Moelis and Evercore had been asked to work on the global listing, while HSBC was a leading contender to join them. Samba Capital was earlier named as one of two local advisers. One source said all the banks had now been "onboarded", a term indicating they had been fully briefed on the IPO process, and had been tasked with work that includes helping ensure systems on the Saudi stock exchange, the Tadawul, can be integrated with a foreign exchange. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Saudi Aramco has yet to pick a foreign site to list. When asked for comment, Saudi Aramco said it did not respond to rumor or speculation. Officials at NCB Capital were not immediately available and other banks have previously declined to comment on their role.   (Reporting by Ron Bousso in London,; David French in New York, Davide Barbuscia in Dubai, with additional reporting by Reem Shamseddine in Khobar, Saudi Arabia; Writing by Tom Arnold; Editing by Edmund Blair) Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

Exar to be Acquired by MaxLinear for $13/Share Cash The Deal: MaxLinear, Inc.

The acquisition will be conducted by means of a tender offer and is expected to close in Q2 of 2017. Exar closed at $12.99, up $2.37. Under Armour Chatter of PE Interest The Rumor: Private equity is in talks to take Under Armour (NYSE: UAA) private at $26.00 per share, according to unconfirmed market chatter.

Under Armour closed at $20.66, up $0.71. Synovus Financial in Talks to Acquire Cabela's Banking Unit The Rumor: Cabela's (NYSE: CAB) is said to be in talks to sell its financial business to Synovus Financial Corp.

Under the proposed plan, Synovus would resell the credit-card portfolio to Capital One (NYSE: COF) and retain approximately $1 billion in deposits held in Cabela's bank, in order to avoid a regulatory review for Capital One, the sources said. Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's announced on October 3 that Bass would acquire Cabela's for $65.50 per share in cash.

The talks are said to be ongoing. Cabela's closed at $52.04, up $5.79. Posted-In: News Rumors M&A © 2017 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

The trio join Moelis & Co <MC.N> and Evercore <EVR.N>, which have been appointed independent financial advisers, one source said of what is expected to be the world's biggest share sale. The Saudi authorities aim to sell up to 5 percent of Aramco, listing the shares in Riyadh and at least one foreign exchange to raise cash for investment in new industries in a bid to diversify away from oil exports in an era of cheap crude. Aramco has appointed Saudi Arabia's NCB Capital <1180.SE> and Samba Capital <1090.SE> as local advisers, the sources said. Reuters previously reported that JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Moelis and Evercore had been asked to work on the global listing, while HSBC was a leading contender to join them. Samba Capital was earlier named as one of two local advisers. One source said all the banks had now been "onboarded", a term indicating they had been fully briefed on the IPO process, and had been tasked with work that includes helping ensure systems on the Saudi stock exchange, the Tadawul, can be integrated with a foreign exchange. Saudi Aramco has yet to pick a foreign site to list. When asked for comment, Saudi Aramco said it did not respond to rumor or speculation. Officials at NCB Capital were not immediately available and other banks have previously declined to comment on their role.

REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed By Ron Bousso, David French and Davide Barbuscia | LONDON LONDON Saudi Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE has formally appointed JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and HSBC (HSBA.L) as international financial advisers for its initial public offering, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The trio join Moelis & Co (MC.N) and Evercore (EVR.N), which have been appointed independent financial advisers, one source said of what is expected to be the world's biggest share sale. The Saudi authorities aim to sell up to 5 percent of Aramco, listing the shares in Riyadh and at least one foreign exchange to raise cash for investment in new industries in a bid to diversify away from oil exports in an era of cheap crude. Aramco has appointed Saudi Arabia's NCB Capital 1180.SE and Samba Capital 1090.SE as local advisers, the sources said. Reuters previously reported that JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Moelis and Evercore had been asked to work on the global listing, while HSBC was a leading contender to join them. Samba Capital was earlier named as one of two local advisers. One source said all the banks had now been "onboarded", a term indicating they had been fully briefed on the IPO process, and had been tasked with work that includes helping ensure systems on the Saudi stock exchange, the Tadawul, can be integrated with a foreign exchange. Saudi Aramco has yet to pick a foreign site to list. When asked for comment, Saudi Aramco said it did not respond to rumor or speculation. Officials at NCB Capital were not immediately available and other banks have previously declined to comment on their role.

The U.K.’s attempt to link security to a trade deal prompts accusations of blackmail. by Simon Kennedy @simonjkennedy More stories by Simon Kennedy March 30, 2017, 2:45 AM EDT Brexit Difficulty Becomes a Reality for U.K.'s May Sign up to receive the Brexit Bulletin in your inbox, and follow @Brexit on Twitter. Proof, if it was ever needed, that two years of Brexit talks will be hard going came within hours of Theresa May triggering them. For all the niceties about the European Union included in her six-page letter, it was the British prime minister’s attempt to link a sweeping free trade deal to cooperation on security that drew the focus and prompted accusations of blackmail. Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament. Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg “Security is far too important to start to bargain it against an economic agreement,” declared Guy Verhofstadt — the European Parliament’s point person on Brexit matters and someone who will have a say on the final outcome. Brexit Secretary David Davis said on Thursday the government wasn’t engaging in blackmail and wouldn’t withdraw cooperation, but security will be part of the negotiation. Tomorrow's front page: PM's #Brexit threat to EU pic.twitter.com/DZRwbmgGra— The Sun (@TheSun) March 29, 2017   The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Other obstacles were quickly thrown in May’s way: EU President Donald Tusk and German Chancellor Angela Merkel denied May’s bid to discuss divorce and a new trade relationship in parallel. Others reminded her they want Britain to pay an exit fee and the European Parliament warned that any post-Brexit transition will be hard won and time-limited. To help make her case, May penned columns for newspapers from Sweden to Germany.  Tim Ross, Robert Hutton and Jonathan Stearns break down just what we learned on Day One. Among their observations: May mentioned “security” 11 times. She made her clearest demand yet for a trade deal to cover financial services, said she wanted a transitional arrangement, and signaled the U.K. wants to settle its bills but has claims too. The divorce bill may range between €25.4 billion and €65.1 billion, think tank Bruegel says in new research out on Thursday. Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said in an interview that the amount is up for negotiation and that the “devil is in the detail.” Bloomberg’s Gavin Finch reports that banks were encouraged by what they heard, but noted any trade pact including finance would be unprecedented and will take time to piece together. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley all signaled they are still preparing to shift staff from London. Lloyd’s of London said on Thursday it will set up a new European unit in Brussels.  What Next? The EU now has control. By Friday night, Tusk will have circulated a draft of guidelines for the negotiations, but leaders won’t ratify them until April 29. Merkel, Tusk and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker are all in Malta on Thursday. Here are profiles of the negotiators you don’t know, but should. Taking Back Control Day Two of Brexit will see the U.K. government begin to reclaim power over 19,000 European laws. It will publish proposals to incorporate them into U.K. law on the day Britain leaves the EU so as to ensure regulatory certainty. The ultimate “cut and paste” job will enable lawmakers to decide which bits of European legislation to keep and which to scrap.  “At the heart of the referendum decision was sovereignty,” Brexit Secretary David Davis said. “A strong, independent country needs control of its own laws. That process starts now.” For all you need to know about the “Great Repeal Bill,” read our QuickTake Q&A by Thomas Penny and Alex Morales. Will the Sweet Spot Turn Sour? Perhaps the biggest surprise since the referendum has been the economy’s resilience. Now that the process of withdrawal is actually under way that may be eroded as investors and businesses face the reality of changes in regulation and immigration, while also bracing for contentious talks. Jill Ward and Lucy Meakin discuss how long the sweet spot can last. Remember, the Bloomberg Brexit Barometer is a daily guide to the state of the economy. It fell on Wednesday and will be updated around 10:30 a.m. in London. One reason for confidence is that some home buyers have regained confidence in the U.K. real estate market, according to Sharon Smyth and Jack Sidders.

The adjudication proceedings pertained to JP Morgan Mutual Fund launching a scheme, back in 2014, after expiry of the right to launch deadline. Besides, JP Morgan Mutual Fund, the proceedings were initiated by the regulator against trustee -- JP Morgan Mutual Fund India Pvt Ltd -- and JP Morgan Asset Management India Pvt Ltd. According to three separate but similarly-worded settlement orders, each of the three entities have paid Rs 91.8 lakh to the regulator. Besides, they had proposed "voluntary debarment" from issuing of new schemes for a period of one year. The total settlement amount is little over Rs 2.75 crore. These entities paid the settlement amounts in February and three settlement orders were passed by Sebi's Adjudicating Officer Suresh B Menon. The settlement terms were approved by the High Powered Advisory Committee on Consent. It was alleged in the show cause notice that JP Morgan Mutual Fund launched the scheme --JP Morgan India Fixed Maturity Plan - Series 39 -- when the right to launch the said scheme had already expired. Among others, it was alleged that the offer document contained misleading and incorrect scheme name and information and even the units that were allotted to the investors were under the incorrect scheme name.

Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Foreigners own a mere 3 percent of China’s local currency bonds, but adding notes from the nation to global indexes including those from Bloomberg Barclays, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. would bring cash into the country from yield-hungry investors from New York to Tokyo. Morgan Stanley said earlier this month that the inclusion of Chinese government bonds in major bond indexes could trigger $250 billion to $300 billion of inflows into China onshore notes. The moves are also spurring other global asset managers to hire. Click here for a story on UBS Asset forecasting China’s bond market to come of age Citigroup Index LLC said this month that Chinese onshore sovereign bonds are set to join some of its gauges but omitted them from its key World Government Bond Index, while Bloomberg Barclays Indexes, owned by Bloomberg, overhauled its China fixed-income gauges and started a Global Aggregate + China index on March 1.  Briscoe said that the inclusions are the “warning shot across the bow for everybody to get ready.” He declined to comment on the number of hires the firm plans to make but said that it is “applying for our WFOE status within China,” referring to the wholly foreign-owned enterprise designation.  Foreign funds with investment management enterprises that have that status can raise money from onshore institutional and high-net-worth investors once registered with the Asset Management Association of China. The moves focused on China’s bond market come even as Sam Kendall, who runs UBS Group AG’s regional investment bank, is trying to widen the firm’s scope by assigning more bankers to a pan-Asian focus and pushing them to pursue deals that aren’t directly linked to the health of the broader Chinese markets. UBS Group is the asset management unit’s parent. UBS Asset has also been readying China funds and in March launched its China High Yield Bond fund, which invests in U.S. dollar and yuan debt. The firm plans to sell the fund to onshore investors once it meets the requirements of the Mutual Recognition of Funds program, which enables investment vehicles to be offered both on the mainland and in Hong Kong. With China now the world’s second-largest economy, UBS Asset is positioning itself to take global investors onshore. “You need to get China right if you want to get Asia right,” Briscoe said.

A recent debt auction saw West Bengal -- a state struggling to meet its debt obligations -- paying a coupon of 7.64 percent to borrow for 10 years, the same as Haryana -- a northern state that generates most revenue on its own, with limited reliance on federal grants. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up The lack of price differentiation and liquidity is reason why global funds such as PineBridge Investments Europe Ltd. have largely stayed away from state bonds despite being granted access to them in 2015. Even so, raising funds isn’t a tall order for states, as the implicit sovereign guarantee of their debt -- besides yields that are typically higher than those on notes issued by the federal government -- means they are a draw for local investors. “The relatively little yield difference among states isn’t reflective of their fundamentals,” said Anders Faergemann, a senior fund manager in London at PineBridge Investments, which oversees about $83 billion globally. “Bonds of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ states should be priced differently.” Working together, India’s 29 states combined would form a bloc that has a bigger economy than the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, more members than the European Union, and twice the population of North America. Net borrowing by regional administrations is set to rise 12 percent to 3.8 trillion rupees ($59 billion) in the financial year starting April 1, after surging an estimated 30 percent to 3.4 trillion rupees this year, according to ICRA Ltd. The central government plans to borrow a net 4.2 trillion rupees in the coming year. Read: States on Borrowing Binge Bad News for Modi and Indian Bonds Cutoff yields for states’ 10-year borrowings were bunched up in a tight five-basis point range at an auction on March 27, showing little differentiation between the silk-to sandalwood-producing southern Indian state of Karnataka and the mineral-rich northwestern Rajasthan. State Name Estimated Fiscal Deficit for FY17 (%) FY18 Estimate (%) Cut-off Yield for 10-Year Debt at March 27 Sale Andhra Pradesh 3.06 3 7.62% Gujarat 1.80 1.82 Didn’t sell Karnataka 2.16 2.61 7.59% Haryana 2.49 2.84* 7.64% Rajasthan 6.36* 2.99 7.61% Tamil Nadu 4.58* 2.79 7.62% Source: State budget documents. *Includes impact from UDAY bonds Rising supply of state bonds has caused their spread over corresponding sovereign notes to widen to about 90 basis points, from an average 55-60 basis points over the last one year, according to Crisil Ratings Ltd., the local unit of S&P Global Ratings. Part of the increase has been because some states are acquiring debt piled up at power distribution companies under a 2015 federal plan to revive the utilities. A report by ratings firm ICRA Wednesday showed that 13 states have so far issued 2.32 trillion rupees of the so-called UDAY bonds toward refinancing the borrowings of state-owned electricity retailers. “The indebtedness of states is likely to increase” going forward due to the takeover of debt under the UDAY scheme, said Manish Gupta, a director at Crisil Ratings in Mumbai. “Higher salary payout and increased interest burden may widen the fiscal deficits over the medium term.” Thanks to the extra debt burden on account of the UDAY scheme, Rajasthan’s fiscal gap is estimated to have bloated to more than 6 percent of gross domestic product in a financial year ending Friday. That’s double the 3 percent cap set by the finance commission, a panel that decides every five years how tax revenues should be divided between federal and state governments. West Bengal has been hit by repayment woes and needs to shell out about 470 billion rupees in fiscal 2018 for principal and interest repayments, budget documents show. Tamil Nadu expects a ‘significant impact’ on its resources as the closing down of state-owned liquor shops hurts revenue. ‘Little Incentive’ Markets need to pay greater attention to states’ finances as their widening deficits have completely offset the consolidation at the central level, and borrowings by states is poised to overtake the centre’s by 2018-19, Sajjid Chinoy and Toshi Jain, economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote in a February report. Global funds own 15.6 billion rupees worth of state-government bonds, just 7.4 percent of the 210-billion rupee investment limit available to them, according to data from the National Securities Depository Ltd. That’s even as they have exhausted 85.9 percent of their cap for purchases of sovereign debt. “There is little incentive for investors to discriminate among underlying fiscal positions of states and place a premium on quality,” the JPMorgan economists wrote in their report. “The corollary, of course, is that there is little incentive for states to consolidate, because prudent states are not rewarded and profligate states are not disciplined.” Boosting Liquidity That said, Suyash Choudhary, Mumbai-based head of fixed income at IDFC Asset Management Co., says the securities will appear more attractive to investors should authorities improve reissuances to boost liquidity and sell bonds across more maturities. The Reserve Bank of India typically auctions state bonds once in fortnight. A Finance Ministry report earlier this year said the sale process needs to be reviewed if a ‘modicum of discipline’ is to be introduced on how regional governments’ finances are managed. “It is a good opportunity to invest in state and corporate bonds now, as their spreads over sovereign notes have backed up quite a bit,” he said.

Suburbs The Doings Weekly Burr Ridge News Hinsdale District 86 finance officer resigns after contract not renewed Hinsdale Township High School District 86 hires Bill Eagan as first chief financial officer Hinsdale Township High School Di / handout William Eagan William Eagan (Hinsdale Township High School Di / handout) Kimberly FornekContact ReporterPioneer Press Hinsdale High School District 86 finance administrator William Eagan resigned after being told his contract would not be renewed and following an investigation into a potential conflict of interest. The board notified Eagan in February that his contract as chief financial officer would end at the end of the school year. But, according to a resignation agreement Eagan signed March 19, Eagan decided he would rather quit effective March 21. The move comes months after Eagan was placed first on administrative leave, then told to work off-site with assignments and tasks coming directly from the superintendent. Eagan will receive severance payments, totaling $63,172, for the salary and benefits he would have earned until June 30, when his contract expires, plus $15,115, which is the value of 20 vacation days he did not take, according to the agreement. The district also provided Eagan with a letter of reference, which cites his accomplishments and contributions to the district As CFO, Eagan improved and created internal controls for the district's purchasing and other transactions, that total about $100 million annually. Those controls have saved the district money, stated the agreement, signed by superintendent Bruce Law and board President Kay Gallo. Eagan "professionalized" reporting in the district, which helped district officials negotiate contracts with three different bargaining units, better manage spending and improve financial forecasting, the agreement states. But in a letter to Eagan dated Feb. 22, the board said his pattern of behavior and communication is "detrimental to the working relationships and operations of the district." The letter said the reason had been explained to Eagan in meetings with the superintendent and the board and in his performance evaluation. Law would not disclose in what way Eagan's behavior was detrimental to the district. The district is trying to strike a balance between what it must produce according to the Freedom of Information Act and protecting attorney-client privilege and an individual's privacy, Law said. Eagan, who started working for the district in April 2014, could not be reached for comment. In October, he and several other administrators, whom district officials determined were paid less than employees in similar positions in other school districts, were given raises. Eagan's annual salary was raised to $196,500. On Nov. 21, chief human resources officer Domenico Maniscalco told Eagan he was being placed on paid administrative leave, while the district conducted an investigation into whether Eagan's wife worked for a company with which the district had a contract, according to a letter The Doings obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The district did not reveal the outcome of that investigation. According to the Morgan Stanley website, Kelly Eagan works as a senior client service associate with Morgan Stanley's Loftus Group. District 86 has done financial transactions with JP Morgan Chase, including refinancing bonds issued in 2012 through Chase, which was the lowest bidder, according to district reports. On Dec. 12, Eagan was reinstated to active status, but told to only work remotely and not on district property. All his assignments and tasks came through the superintendent. According to his contract, the district had to notify Eagan by March 1 if his contract would not be renewed. On Feb. 22, the school board voted 4-1 not to renew the contract. The search for a new chief financial officer began weeks ago, Maniscalco said, and he will recommend a candidate for the position at the board's meeting Monday kfornek@pioneerlocal.com Twitter @kfdoings Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune High Schools Hinsdale Freedom of Information Act Four people fatally shot in South Shore neighborhood 'Everywhere I go, it's gonna be a challenge:' family discusses life in Englewood What's new at Guaranteed Rate Field, besides a new name?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 March 2017 by Military News Lantheus Announces Refinancing of its Debt Facility NORTH BILLERICA, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNTH), parent company of Lantheus Medical Imaging, Inc. (collectively, “Lantheus” or “the Company”), today announced the closing of a new $275 million term loan facility (the “new term loan”) and a new $75 million five-year cash-flow revolver facility (the “CFR”). Net proceeds from the new term loan, together with approximately $15 million of cash on hand, were used to retire the remaining outstanding principal balance on the Company’s previous $365 million term loan facility and pay accrued interest and related fees and expenses attributable to the transaction. The new term loan has an interest rate of LIBOR + 4.50% and retains the prior term loan’s maturity date of June 2022 as well as its 1% mandatory amortization per year, adjusted to reflect the new principal amount. The new term loan was issued at an original issue discount of 99.75%. The CFR is priced at LIBOR + 3.50% and replaces the $50 million asset backed loan (“ABL”) facility, which was undrawn at the time of closing of the refinancing. The CFR carries the same 0.375% unused line fee as the ABL and has an extended maturity date of March 2022. Funds available under the CFR may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. “We remain committed to enhancing the Company’s capital structure,” commented Jack Crowley, Chief Financial Officer of Lantheus. “This transaction improves our credit profile, provides additional liquidity and gives the flexibility needed to effectively capitalize upon our strategic initiatives. As of closing, our leverage ratio continues to improve, and we believe the reduction in interest rate and amortization payments will provide a positive impact on cash flow of approximately $5 million per year over the life of the facility.” The transaction was led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Citizens Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acting as joint lead arrangers.

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now United Airlines faces a new setback in its bid to win back business customers as production snags hinder deliveries of Boeing Co. jetliners outfitted with new luxury seats. "Short delays" are affecting two 777-300ER aircraft with United's Polaris luxury interiors, said Megan McCarthy, a spokeswoman for the airline. United and the planemaker are working with French seatmaker Zodiac Aerospace to expedite shipments, said McCarthy and Doug Alder, a spokesman for Boeing. The stumbles will slow United's efforts to woo international travelers with a rebranding campaign centered on the Polaris cabins, which offer pod-style suites with Zodiac's lie-flat berths. Zodiac, which agreed to be acquired by Safran SA, has also held back production of Airbus Group SE's marquee A350 with delays of seats and lavatories. "It's not just seatless in Seattle, it's seatless in Toulouse," said aviation consultant Robert Mann, referring to the planemakers' manufacturing hubs and a Tom Hanks movie. "It's a serious problem and it's been building." United Continental Holdings Inc. rose 1.1 percent to $70.63 at 10:35 a.m. in New York. Zodiac slid 0.9 percent to 23.36 euros in Paris. 'Consequential Damages' Even delays of a month or two could hurt Chicago-based United if, after a year of marketing build-up, the airline misses a chance to deploy the brand-new 777s on high-profile routes to Asia during the peak summer travel season, Mann said by phone. "You can only make the most money when you have a product in the market at the right time," Mann said. "You are talking consequential damages." Boeing may have to park additional United planes if Zodiac can't provide the complex seats on schedule. For the Chicago-based manufacturer and Airbus, receiving lie-flat seats at the right time is crucial because the products can require extensive rewiring, ductwork changes and reinforced cabin floors. When deliveries run late, planemakers may be forced to remove fittings such as galleys and lavatories so the berths can be installed. It's the latest in a series of production stumbles for Plaisir, France-based Zodiac, which warned this month that fiscal 2017 operating profit would plunge 10 percent. Delays also slowed deliveries of Boeing 787 Dreamliners to customers such as American Airlines Group Inc. over the past two years. At United, Zodiac seats are being installed first on the 777-300ER fleet, then on the carrier's 787-10 and Airbus A350-1000 jets. Existing 767-300 and 777-200 aircraft also will be retrofitted with the cabins. "We're not happy, period," United Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz told investors at a JPMorgan Chase & Co. event this month. "But rather than just be unhappy, we've got people on site with the folks there to make sure that we can expedite and accelerate as much as we can." Factory Bottlenecks Zodiac on March 14 revealed bottlenecks at the Cwmbran, Wales, plant where the Polaris seats are manufactured, as well as problems at U.S. factories that make lavatories for Airbus. The latest production meltdown prompted TCI Fund Management Ltd. to urge Paris-based Safran to abandon its acquisition of the seatmaker. Zodiac declined to comment on United, a spokeswoman said Thursday. The company said in the March 14 statement that the snags in Wales were "generating significant disruptions and delays that are currently being addressed." The production issues plaguing Zodiac are "probably the worst that the seat-supplier sector has seen in a decade," said Gary Weissel, managing officer with Tronos Aviation Consulting Inc. The French company has lost market share and sales, and been sued by American for fouling up 787 deliveries -- a cost typically borne by the carrier, not the planemaker. Zodiac has struggled to integrate acquisitions and hire an adequate engineering force to design seats as expensive and complex as a luxury sports car. "Most people don't understand the complexity of the products, which must also meet rigorous safety and certification standards for federal aviation regulators," Weissel said. "It's a combination of engineering, design and artistry all coming together." -By Michael Sasso and Julie Johnsson, Bloomberg View Comments Tags Airlines Business Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wall Street gained on Thursday, led by financial shares, after data showed U.S. economic growth was stronger than previously reported last quarter, helped by robust consumer spending, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq set a record closing high. The energy sector rose for a third straight day, supported by stronger oil prices and a 8.8-percent gain for ConocoPhillips , the biggest percentage riser on the S&P 500 after it agreed to sell oil and gas assets. The S&P 500 gained for a third straight day, rebounding after its worst week of the year last week. U.S. economic growth slowed less than previously reported in the fourth quarter as robust consumer spending provided a boost, the Commerce Department said. Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1 percent annualized rate instead of the previously-reported 1.9 percent pace. A record-setting rally for stocks in the wake of President Donald Trump's November election stalled somewhat this month, with some investors pointing to risks to Trump's agenda, including tax reform, after his fellow Republicans failed to pass a healthcare bill. The GDP report is "basically an affirmation that, hey, at the end of the day, Washington will do and say whatever they are going to do, but the economy is marching forward," said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. "It’s not just the U.S. economy, but we do see definitely improvement throughout the world," Cavanaugh said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 69.17 points, or 0.33 percent, to 20,728.49, the S&P 500 gained 6.93 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,368.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 16.80 points, or 0.28 percent, to 5,914.34. The Nasdaq closed at a record high after rising for a fifth straight session. Financial shares surged 1.2 percent, with Bank of America and Citigroup propping up the S&P 500. The defensive utilities sector was the worst-performing group, falling 0.7 percent. Investors are also turning their attention to the impending first-quarter earnings season to justify lofty valuations for stocks. The S&P 500 is trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months against its long-term average of 15. First-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 10.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We continue to see decent-to-improving economic data primarily in employment," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York. "We are likely to see a good quarter in terms of earnings, so I think there is some anticipation perhaps in the market here." In corporate news, Lululemon Athletica shares plunged 23.4 percent after the Canadian yoga and leisure apparel retailer said first-quarter comparable sales were expected to fall. About 6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.56-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.49-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 99 new highs and 19 new lows.

Photographer: Stefan Falke/Laif/Redux As a member of Hillary Clinton’s national finance committee, a distinction reserved for those who raised at least $100,000 for her presidential bid, Craig Phillips qualified as a Hillary superfan, or a “Hillblazer” in the words of the campaign. A former BlackRock Inc. executive, Phillips had told friends and colleagues he hoped to get a political appointment at the Treasury Department, parlaying his big donations into a big job in Washington. His plan half-worked. Phillips is indeed working at the Treasury; it’s just that his boss is Donald Trump, and his job is totally different from what it would’ve been under Clinton. Phillips is leading Treasury’s review of how to roll back financial regulations, a policy move opposed by Democrats. He’s also one of a handful of people hired by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in the first two months of the Trump administration. While Phillips’s views on the rules that were piled on the banking industry after the 2008 financial crisis aren’t clear (he wouldn’t comment for this story), conservatives inside and outside the government are surprised he got the job, given his political leanings. A Treasury spokesman says Mnuchin is confident Phillips supports the administration’s economic policy goals, adding that he “is a key member of our team.” Phillips, who spent his 40-year career in finance, including stints at Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley, announced last September he was leaving BlackRock. At the time, few thought Trump had a chance. Yet after the election, as Democrats grappled with their diminished prospects, Phillips saw he still had an opportunity to work in government, thanks to his almost 25-year friendship with Mnuchin. The two had crossed paths because of their work in housing finance, a subsection of Wall Street where major players tend to know one another. Mnuchin fought to bring on Phillips, 62, because of his deep experience in the markets, people familiar with the hiring say. Although some White House and Treasury aides opposed him, they were ultimately overruled. Phillips was among the first people to start working at Treasury as part of the administration’s “beachhead team” of appointees who took the reins as soon as Trump was sworn in. Phillips has been in on most discussions of the major issues confronting the department, including a tax overhaul, the debt limit, and Trump’s executive order in February directing the department to get serious about cutting financial regulations. Phillips is now one of Treasury’s most senior officials, given how slow the White House has been to nominate people for top positions, including undersecretary and assistant secretary for domestic finance. Part of the delay, people involved in the nomination process have said, was because of a desire by the White House to make sure Mnuchin’s preferred candidates hadn’t publicly opposed or criticized Trump. Despite his Clinton connections, Phillips wasn’t subjected to as intense White House scrutiny, since his job as a counselor to Mnuchin doesn’t require Senate confirmation. Even so, his political donations were hardly a secret. Federal Election Commission records show he donated $136,100 to Clinton in October. That same month he gave $33,400 each to the Democrats’ Senate and House campaign committees. One source notes Phillips later gave a big check to Trump’s inaugural committee. Ian Katz, a policy analyst who watches the Treasury for Capital Alpha Partners LLC in Washington, says Phillips’s support for Democrats might not be as strange as it seems. “In finance there’s often not a huge difference between Republicans and Democrats, they’re all for free markets,” says Katz. “The fact that he worked at BlackRock is probably more relevant than his political affiliation.” The Treasury has until early June to report back to Trump on regulations. Many in the banking industry see this effort as the first and perhaps best chance to scrap some of the more onerous requirements imposed by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. The bulk of Phillips’s review kicked off in March with a series of group meetings. Big banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. have already been in, as have asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity Investments and consumer advocates. Held in Treasury’s ornate Cash Room, the events weren’t open to the public. Phillips plans to hold 16 sessions; among others, he’s also invited community banks and credit unions. People familiar with the meetings said firms were told to bring ideas for changes they want made to financial rules, along with solutions that preferably don’t involve passing legislation. At these get-togethers, the banking industry is looking for any kernel of insight into the White House’s thinking on financial regulations. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly blasted big banks, yet he’s filled his administration with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partners, including Mnuchin. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up First, though, Wall Street must figure out where Phillips stands. Those who see his ties to Clinton as evidence he’ll be a counterweight to the administration’s push to eliminate rules may be disappointed. “Financial regulation is not inherently political,” says Hester Peirce, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. “It’s about trying to get the financial system to work well so the rest of the economy works well.” The bottom line: Despite donating $136,100 to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, Craig Phillips is a top official in Trump’s Treasury Department.

REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci - RTX2AHAB By Tatiana Bautzer | NEW YORK NEW YORK Latin American governments and companies could soon step up bond sales, seizing on increased deal appetite as a regional economic recovery gains steam and concerns about potential aggressive U.S. policy changes ease, bankers and investors said this week. Attractive returns on Latin American debt and demand for less traditional structures have allowed the Brazilian government to sell debt at record low yields. Suzano Papel & Celulose SA (SUZB5.SA) subsequently placed a 30-year junk bond, the first of its kind for a Brazilian firm, this month. Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc (ARCO.N), the world's largest McDonald's (MCD.N) restaurant franchisee, and Chile's Empresas CMPC SA CAR.SN raised a total $765 million through the sale of 10-year bonds in separate deals. Brazilian logistics firm JSL SA (JSLG3.SA) could be next in line soon, two people familiar with the plans said. Concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump's policies would lure capital away from Latin America have subsided, bankers and executives said. Inflows are also being fueled by market stability after the U.S. Federal Reserve's single rate hike so far this year. Emerging market funds had $6.5 billion in net inflows in the week ended March 22, their most in nearly four years, Institute of International Finance data showed, with about $4.5 billion going to bonds. "We'll still see a lot of debt refinancing deals, but there are a few first-time issuers tapping the market," said Felipe Wilberg, global head of fixed income for Itaú BBA SA, which is hosting an annual Latin American debt capital markets conference in New York. According to other bankers, who asked for anonymity to speak freely about market trends, cheaper funding for the region's borrowers largely hinges on the ability of several governments, like Brazil's, to get congressional approval for key fiscal reforms ahead of a busy Latin America election calendar. Investors initially expected Trump-related turmoil to slam the brakes on access to capital markets in Latin America, which has struggled with the end of a decade-long commodities boom. The premium that investors demand for Latin American bonds over U.S. Treasuries stands at about 7.59 percentage points, compared with about 7.14 points at the start of the year, according to JPMorgan's EMBI Diversified Latin America bond index .JPMEGDLAT. 'DIFFERENT REACTION' However, the pushback has been minor compared with prior U.S. tightening cycles that triggered violent swings in Latin American issuers' borrowing costs. Spreads have tightened somewhat across the region, said Baruc Sáez, Itaú BBA's managing director of international fixed income. "Although conventional wisdom states that U.S. rate hikes lead to pressure on asset prices in emerging markets, we are seeing a different reaction from investors," said Marc Nachmann, head of Latin America for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Earlier in the day, pulpmaker CMPC sold $500 million of so-called Green bonds at a lower-than-targeted yield of 4.42 percent. Arcos Dorados sold $265 million in global notes at 5.85 percent interest, below initial guidance of 6 percent. JSL, the logistics firm, is discussing a potential $300 million global bond deal with banks that will have to be fully hedged against currency fluctuations because the company's revenues are all denominated in Brazilian reais, a person with direct knowledge of the transaction said. Western Asset Management Co has raised the Latin American share of its emerging markets debt positions to 47 percent from 40 percent over the past year, as prices turned attractive and the outlook improved, said Mark Hughes, who helps oversee $40 billion in emerging market bonds for the firm. The ramp-up has been gradual though, Hughes said, noting that bonds from Brazilian exporters now offer a better entry point than those of domestic-oriented companies. Latin American sovereign and corporate borrowers have raised $34 billion from bond sales this year, according to Itaú BBA data. Last year, bond borrowing in the region reached $102 billion. Bankers are raising their estimates for new Latin American bond supply this year to $80 billion from as low as $60 billion in November as the initial negative sentiment on Mexico has recovered. In the case of Brazil, President Michel Temer's progress in pushing reforms has fueled demand for bonds like Suzano's. "When the deal hit the road, we sensed that investors were in general more optimistic about fiscal consolidation than they were a year earlier," Marcelo Bacci, Suzano's chief financial officer, said in an interview.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Cenovus Energy Inc. fell more than 10 per cent, the most since its 2009 debut, after saying it will buy Canadian oil assets from ConocoPhillips for $17.7 billion in a deal partly financed with shares. The pros and cons of Cenovus Energy’s massive acquisition Analysts weigh in on deal that gives a Canadian company full control of its oilsands assets, but takes on a lot of debt doing so. Find out more The agreement, announced after the close of trading Wednesday, will double the Calgary-based producer’s reserves and production in the latest sale of energy assets in Canada by international companies stung by falling oil prices. While Cenovus shares fell, Houston-based Conoco was having its best day in four months, rising 6 per cent to US$48.69 in New York. Conoco is set to get 208 million shares in the deal, which it said Wednesday it will liquidate within six months. Additionally, Cenovus said it is selling 187.5 million shares at $16 each, or 8.3 per cent below the Wednesday close, to raise $3 billion. Cenovus acquires Conoco’s half interest in a joint venture with Cenovus in Canada’s oil sands and most of Conoco’s Deep Basin conventional assets in Alberta and British Columbia. “This is an easy fit,” said Michael Kay, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in New York. “ConocoPhillips is focused elsewhere, and Cenovus has made it a priority to expand in the oil sands. It’s mostly a domestic industry now.” Combined, the holdings in the agreement can produce 298,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2017.  The transaction, expected to close in the second quarter, will make Conoco into Cenovus’s largest shareholder, with about a 25 per cent stake. The sale comes two weeks after Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. agreed to spend $12.7 billion to buy assets in Alberta from Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Marathon Oil Corp. It follows by a month Conoco’s announcement that its reserves fell to a 15-year low after removing oilsands barrels that were uneconomic as crude prices sat below US$50 a barrel. The acquisition allows Cenovus “to take full control of our best-in-class oilsands projects and to add a second growth platform across the prolific Deep Basin that provides complementary short-cycle development opportunities,” said Brian Ferguson, Cenovus chief executive officer. With about 440,000 barrels a day of capacity after the acquisitions, Cenovus will be the third largest oil-sands producer by the end of the decade, behind Suncor Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural, according to company statements. Deal Details Along with the share sales, Cenovus has a $10.5 billion bridge loan in place with Royal Bank of Canada and JPMorgan Chase & Co., the company said in a statement announcing the acquisition after the close of trading on Wednesday. Cenovus will also make contingency payments to Houston-based Conoco over five years, if oil prices rise above $52 a barrel. Related Blockbuster $17.7 billion Cenovus deal tightens Canada’s grip on the oilsands Canadian crude just got a lot more Canadian as another global giant bails on the oilsands ‘We’ve got the fight in us’: Oilsands companies battle for dollars as investors favour short-term plays In a separate statement, Conoco said it would use the proceeds to reduce debt to $20 billion in 2017, and to double a share repurchase program to $6 billion. The company plans to triple its buybacks this year to $3 billion, with the remaining $3 billion spent in the next two years. Conoco doesn’t plan to remain a shareholder in Cenovus for the long-term, Chief Financial Officer Don Wallette Jr. told analysts on a conference call Wednesday. After a six month pause mandated by the deal, “we will liquidate our position over time and do it in an orderly way.” Maximizing Value “We were just looking for the maximum value that we could get for the assets, and that happened to come from a combination of cash and equity and the contingent payment,” he said. The transaction will be Cenovus’s biggest since it was separated from Encana Corp. in 2009. In that split, Encana retained most of the previous company’s natural gas assets, while Cenovus held the oil assets. The current deal is the largest in the Canadian oil patch since CNOOC Corp. bought Nexen Energy for $17 billion in 2012. The industry has long been hampered by a lack of adequate transport options to move its crude to market. A series of proposed pipelines — and renewed support in the U.S. for the Keystone XL project — may help to ease a bottleneck that has kept Western Canadian oil prices below global benchmarks.

Attractive returns on Latin American debt and demand for less traditional structures have allowed the Brazilian government to sell debt at record low yields. Suzano Papel &amp; Celulose SA subsequently placed a 30-year junk bond, the first of its kind for a Brazilian firm, this month. Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc, the world's largest McDonald's restaurant franchisee, and Chile's Empresas CMPC SA raised a total $765 million through the sale of 10-year bonds in separate deals. Brazilian logistics firm JSL SA could be next in line soon, two people familiar with the plans said. Concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump's policies would lure capital away from Latin America have subsided, bankers and executives said. Inflows are also being fueled by market stability after the U.S. Federal Reserve's single rate hike so far this year. Emerging market funds had $6.5 billion in net inflows in the week ended March 22, their most in nearly four years, Institute of International Finance data showed, with about $4.5 billion going to bonds. "We'll still see a lot of debt refinancing deals, but there are a few first-time issuers tapping the market," said Felipe Wilberg, global head of fixed income for Itaú BBA SA, which is hosting an annual Latin American debt capital markets conference in New York. According to other bankers, who asked for anonymity to speak freely about market trends, cheaper funding for the region's borrowers largely hinges on the ability of several governments, like Brazil's, to get congressional approval for key fiscal reforms ahead of a busy Latin America election calendar. Investors initially expected Trump-related turmoil to slam the brakes on access to capital markets in Latin America, which has struggled with the end of a decade-long commodities boom. The premium that investors demand for Latin American bonds over U.S. Treasuries stands at about 7.59 percentage points, compared with about 7.14 points at the start of the year, according to JPMorgan's EMBI Diversified Latin America bond index. 'DIFFERENT REACTION' However, the pushback has been minor compared with prior U.S. tightening cycles that triggered violent swings in Latin American issuers' borrowing costs. Spreads have tightened somewhat across the region, said Baruc Sáez, Itaú BBA's managing director of international fixed income. "Although conventional wisdom states that U.S. rate hikes lead to pressure on asset prices in emerging markets, we are seeing a different reaction from investors," said Marc Nachmann, head of Latin America for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Earlier in the day, pulpmaker CMPC sold $500 million of so-called Green bonds at a lower-than-targeted yield of 4.42 percent. Arcos Dorados sold $265 million in global notes at 5.85 percent interest, below initial guidance of 6 percent. JSL, the logistics firm, is discussing a potential $300 million global bond deal with banks that will have to be fully hedged against currency fluctuations because the company's revenues are all denominated in Brazilian reais, a person with direct knowledge of the transaction said. Western Asset Management Co has raised the Latin American share of its emerging markets debt positions to 47 percent from 40 percent over the past year, as prices turned attractive and the outlook improved, said Mark Hughes, who helps oversee $40 billion in emerging market bonds for the firm. The ramp-up has been gradual though, Hughes said, noting that bonds from Brazilian exporters now offer a better entry point than those of domestic-oriented companies. Latin American sovereign and corporate borrowers have raised $34 billion from bond sales this year, according to Itaú BBA data. Last year, bond borrowing in the region reached $102 billion. Bankers are raising their estimates for new Latin American bond supply this year to $80 billion from as low as $60 billion in November as the initial negative sentiment on Mexico has recovered. In the case of Brazil, President Michel Temer's progress in pushing reforms has fueled demand for bonds like Suzano's. "When the deal hit the road, we sensed that investors were in general more optimistic about fiscal consolidation than they were a year earlier," Marcelo Bacci, Suzano's chief financial officer, said in an interview.

Returns on Latin American bonds remain attractive and the new openness to deals has already allowed Brazil’s government to raise funds at a record low yield. Argentine’s Santa Fé province also recently returned to the capital market after a long hiatus. Brazil’s Suzano Papel e Celulose SA’s is one example of the warmer reception for Latin American debt. Its recent sale of a 30-year junk global bond – the first of its kind by a Brazilian company – underscored investors’ receptiveness to less traditional structures, bankers said. Brazilian logistics firm JSL SA could be next in line, two people familiar with the plans said. Concerns that US President Donald Trump would lure capital out of Latin America have subsided, according to bankers, who spoke on background on the eve of Brazilian bank Itau BBA’s annual debt capital markets conference in New York. That, coupled with market stability after the US Federal Reserve’s single rate hike so far this year, is fueling inflows, the bankers added. Emerging market funds registered a $6.5 billion net inflow in the week ending March 22, their highest in nearly four years, Institute of International Finance data showed. About $4.5 billion of that total went to bonds. “We’ll still see a lot of debt refinancing deals, but there are a few first-time issuers tapping the market,” said Felipe Wilberg, global head of fixed income for Itaú BBA, Brazil’s largest corporate and investment bank. Cheaper funding for the region’s borrowers largely hinges on governments’ ability to push ahead with key reforms ahead of a busy Latin America election calendar, Wilberg said. Investors had initially expected Trump-related turmoil to slam the brakes on access to capital markets in Latin America, which has struggled with the end of a decade-long commodities boom. The premium that investors demand to own Latin American bonds over US Treasuries now stands at about 7.6 percentage points, compared with about 7.1 points at the start of the year, according to JPMorgan’s EMBI Diversified Latin America bond index. DIFFERENT INVESTOR REACTION However, the pushback has been minor relative to prior US tightening cycles that triggered violent swings in Latin American issuers’ borrowing costs. “Although conventional wisdom states that US rate hikes lead to pressure on asset prices in emerging markets, we are seeing a different reaction from investors,” said Marc Nachmann, head of Latin America for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Western Asset Management Co has raised the Latin America share of its emerging markets debt positions to 47 percent from 40 percent over the past year, as prices turned attractive and the outlook improved, said Mark Hughes, who helps oversee $40 billion in bonds for the firm. The ramp-up has been gradual though, Hughes said, noting that bonds from Brazilian exporters now offer a better entry point than those of domestic-oriented companies. Latin American sovereign and corporate borrowers have raised $34 billion from sales of global debt this year, Itaú BBA data showed. Last year, bond borrowing in the region reached $102 billion. Bankers are raising their estimates for new Latin American bond supply this year to $80 billion from as low as $60 billion in November as initially negative sentiment on Mexico has recovered. In the case of Brazil, President Michel Temer’s progress in pushing reforms is fueling demand for bonds like Suzano’s. “When the deal hit the road, we sensed that investors were in general more optimistic about fiscal consolidation than they were a year earlier,” Marcelo Bacci, Suzano’s chief financial officer, said in an interview.

(Source: Bloomberg) The Irish government’s sale of part of its stake in Allied Irish Banks Plc came a step closer last week. On Thursday in Dublin, the finance ministry appointed another group of banks to help in what could be the biggest listing on the London and Irish stock exchanges this year. How much of AIB will be sold? The government hopes to recoup about 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) or more from selling 25 percent of AIB, which had to be rescued by the state during the financial crisis. Including the so-called greenshoe, about 27 percent of the lender could be sold. The government owns 99.9 percent of the bank, and Finance Minister Michael Noonan has said it may take a decade to return the bank fully to private hands. When is the IPO going to happen? Noonan has indicated the sale could take place in May or June. If that’s delayed, the next window is probably in the fall. Noonan has consistently said the determining factor will be maximizing value from the sale, and the state of the wider market will play a key role. The Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index has risen 28 percent over the last six months. That rally has stalled in recent weeks, and privately, government officials insist they won’t be rushed into a sale. What is AIB worth? The agency that manages the government’s shareholding, the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, valued AIB at 11.3 billion euros in February. That was before the bank released its 2016 results, including a pretax profit of 1.7 billion euros and a reinstated dividend, and government officials view the February valuation as low. For more on how AIB has been preparing for an IPO, click here How will the sale be priced? A tiny sliver of AIB’s shares is still traded on the junior Dublin market. These are so thinly traded, they aren’t considered a particularly useful measure of the bank’s value. As ever, the price will be determined by demand, and early soundings indicate demand will be strong. AIB is viewed as a proxy for the Irish economy, which is growing at twice the pace of the euro-region. The bank is the biggest player in the Irish mortgage market, with about 35 percent of new lending. A valuation of about 12 billion euros would suggest a price of around 4.50 euros per share. Royal Mail -- a salutary tale? In 2013, Royal Mail Group Ltd. closed 38 percent higher on its trading debut, prompting criticism of the Conservative-led U.K. government, which was accused of failing to get full value for the taxpayer. The Irish government will likely heed that lesson. On other hand, investors will be wary of overpaying. In 2015, the government sold shares in Permanent TSB Group Holdings Plc at 4.50 euros each. They are now trading at 2.39 euros. Who is advising on the deal? The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up The government hired Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, and J&E Davy as global coordinators for the sale. Rothschild & Co is advising the government on the sale. Morgan Stanley and Goodbody Stockbrokers are working with AIB. On Thursday, the government named Investec Plc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., UBS Group AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goodbody as bookrunners on the deal. The fees involved for the banks are as much as 14 million euros, according to the finance ministry. What’s left to be done before the IPO? Nearly everything is ready at this point, with bookrunners the last investment banks to come on board. AIB executives have been meeting investors as part of a so-called “non-deal roadshow,” while the prospectus is being compiled. The next steps for the bank are its annual shareholder meeting on April 27 and its first quarter interim management statement, which is set to be published at around the same time. Assuming Noonan gives the go-ahead, the bank will then file an intention to float, publish a so-called pathfinder document and the full prospectus. Noonan probably won’t make any move until after the AGM. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

In the days immediately following Frank's death, The Tribune published multiple stories and tributes to Frank's life and his work as SLOStringer. The marketing email was sent to potential Tribune subscribers less than a week after the March 21 car accident that killed Frank. Featuring the slogan, "Real people. Real news" and offering an 80 percent discount on Tribune subscriptions, the ad also featured a photo of Frank's wrecked SUV, which ran in newspaper's initial story about his death. By March 24, the newspaper's Facebook page was deluged with comments from SLO County residents offended by the use of the photo in the advertisement. Many aired their grievances in comments under unrelated news stories. "This is unacceptable," one commenter wrote. "[Frank] was a good friend to many of us and seeing something like this ... it's in pretty poor taste." The Tribune issued an apology on March 24, calling the use of the photo an "egregious error." According to the statement, the Sacramento-based marketing team for The Tribune's parent company, McClatchy, created the email. "Unfortunately, the email was not reviewed by local Tribune staff before it was sent out," the statement read. McClatchy owns 29 newspapers across the United States, including five in California. In a February presentation to JP Morgan Chase, the company said its reach included 14 million people in local markets, and more than 59 million globally. In an email response to questions from New Times, Tribune General Manager Devon Goetz said that new procedures were developed to avoid a similar mistake in the future. "Going forward, we are instituting a review process for promotions related to news content," Goetz wrote. "Honestly, in my more than 30 years with the company, I can't recall anything remotely like this happening before. But this error is one too many and we hope anyone we offended will accept our apology and our word that we will work hard to avoid a repeat." Frank's memorial service was held at Mountainbrook Church in SLO on March 29 and was followed by a barbecue at the Madonna Inn Expo Center. An online fundraising campaign for Frank raised more than $25,000 as of March 29.

Search Watch Live Home UK Brexit Trump World Business Politics Tech Entertainment Offbeat Weather Lloyd's of London confirms Brussels as EU base while Citi mulls future Brussels will be a new EU subsidiary for Lloyd's of London before Brexit while Citi also eyes relocating jobs from London. 20:09, UK, Thursday 30 March 2017 Video: Lloyd's boss: why we chose Brussels Twitter Facebook Google+ Whats App Mail Lloyd's of London is to shift around 100 jobs to the heart of the EU to limit potential damage to the world's biggest insurance market from Brexit. It made the announcement, as Sky News reported, less than 24 hours after Theresa May began the formal process to commence divorce talks with the EU. The company's lead was followed hours later by US bank Citi, which warned staff it could be be forced to relocate work from London under a "hard" Brexit scenario it was preparing for. However, it confirmed London would remain its European headquarters. Image: Citi's European HQ is at Canary Wharf The moves highlight the pressure felt by financial services firms to secure their continued access to the bloc once the UK leaves. So-called passport rights - which currently allow them to trade seamlessly across borders - are expected to be lost following the negotiations. Lloyd's, which derives 10% of its revenue from the EU, said it intended to have the Brussels office "ready to write business" for the 1 January 2019 renewal season, subject to regulatory approval. It had considered Luxembourg instead. Chief executive, Inga Beale, said: "It is important that we are able to provide the market and customers with an effective solution that means business can carry on without interruption when the UK leaves the EU. "Brussels met the critical elements of providing a robust regulatory framework in a central European location, and will enable Lloyd's to continue to provide specialist underwriting expertise to our customers. "I am excited about the opportunities this venture will offer the market by providing that important European access efficiently." In his note to staff, Citi's European boss Jim Cowles wrote: "A hard Brexit would require certain changes, including relocating certain client-facing roles to the EU from the UK, and the possible creation of a new broker-dealer entity within the EU." He added that the bank was already well positioned as it had operations in 20 of the remaining EU27 nations. Planning for the divorce began in the City in the aftermath of last June's referendum. Sky News recently revealed how Deutsche Bank had signed a 25-year lease on a new City base. But Goldman Sachs signalled earlier this week that it was accelerating plans to create more jobs on the Continent, with its London-based operations calling a halt to expansion. JPMorgan, HSBC and UBS have also given strong indications that thousands of jobs may cross the Channel or go to Dublin. Ms Beale called for the EU and UK to come to a sensible compromise in their looming divorce deal. She said: "It is now crucial that the UK Government and the European Union proceed to negotiate an agreement that allows business to continue to flow under the best possible conditions once the UK formally leaves the EU. "I believe it is important not just for the City but also for Europe that we reach a mutually beneficial agreement. We stand ready to help and support the Government as best we can." Lloyd's made the announcement as it published annual results - with 2016 profits flat on the previous 12 months. It said pricing pressures made for an "extremely challenging" environment despite gross written premiums rising 11%. Pre-tax profits came in a £2.1bn.
