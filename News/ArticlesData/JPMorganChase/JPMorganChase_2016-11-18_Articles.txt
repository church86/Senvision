Bankers are gaining confidence that U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will be able to secure a lengthy transition period that would carry them over from the current rules to whatever fresh terms of trade are agreed with the EU, according to two people with knowledge of their firm's contingency plans. That's led to more measured language from many of the industry's leaders. "Wait and see is also UBS's attitude toward Brexit," UBS Group AG Chairman Axel Weber said Wednesday at a conference in the U.K. capital. "No doubt London will remain an important financial center. UBS will be here." VIDEOS TOP JOBS The shift in tone, also evident from banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc, comes after May sought to quell fears in the finance industry that her government wouldn't fight to protect it from the fallout of Brexit when negotiations begin early next year. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney also called this week for a long transition period to give banks a chance to adapt. "Nobody wants to make a bad decision by moving quickly with the amount of uncertainty around," Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan's head of corporate and investment banking, said in an interview. "We will be ready to make a permanent decision once we have a better idea of the direction of travel." Banks continue to plan for the worst: the loss of their right to sell services freely around the EU from London after the end of the two-year Brexit negotiation period. And they are ready to start the process of moving people abroad within weeks of Britain triggering Article 50, scheduled for March, as May would still have to convince EU counterparts to agree to a transition period. But bankers have paused on issuing warnings of pandemonium and threats to relocate abroad that circulated in the months before and after June's referendum. "I don't think London will lose its gravitational pull in terms of the management of capital in any reasonable time-frame," Barclays Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley said at a conference this week. "I would not underestimate at all the ability of the U.K. to remain as creative as it's been historically." Before the referendum, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he would relocate as many as 4,000 employees to the continent after Brexit. In September, UBS said that it may have to move 1,500 staff out of London after Brexit, or 30 percent of its U.K. workforce. That same month, one of JPMorgan's top executives in Europe said there would be "pandemonium" unless there was an agreement for a transition period. Relations between the finance industry and May's government reached a low point at the Conservative Party conference in early October when officials said banks would get no special favors in the Brexit negotiations and suggested their threats to leave London were empty. Since then, there has been a concerted effort within government to mend relations with the City, officials said earlier this month. That involved Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, who campaigned against Brexit, and pro-leave lawmakers such as David Davis setting aside their ideological differences in pursuit of a common strategy to quit the EU. Davis said recently he was "determined to get the best possible deal" for London-based banks. Recently, bankers have laced their warnings with some optimism. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc Chairman Howard Davies said Sunday in an interview on ITV that triggering Brexit without a transitional deal would be damaging to all parties. Asked whether a deal is likely, Davies said: "It is possible."   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Op-ed: Should Mormons who voted for Trump get temple recommends?

 10 things you need to know in markets today Oscar Williams-Grut Nov. 16, 2016, 1:48 AM 388 facebook linkedin twitter email print A man walks through a garden on an autumn day in Srinagar, India November 15, 2016. REUTERS/Danish Ismail Good morning! Here's what you need to know in markets on Wednesday. EU antitrust regulators are set to fine HSBC, JPMorgan, and Credit Agricole by the end of the year for rigging financial benchmarks linked to the euro, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Reuters reports that charges were levied in May 2014 against the three banks, which denied wrongdoing. The European Commission could penalise HSBC, JPMorgan, and Credit Agricole next month, the people said. The decision has been delayed several times and another hold-up could still occur. Google still plans to open a new UK headquarters building in London, which the BBC reports could create up to 3,000 jobs in the country by 2020. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, told the BBC the company sees "big opportunities" in the UK despite the country's vote to exit the European Union in June. Employment and wage data is coming. UK earnings and job figures for September and October are due at 9.30 a.m. GMT (4.30 a.m. ET). The unemployment rate is forecast to remain steady at 4.9% and wage growth is forecast to be 2.3%, the same as in the prior month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied for a seventh straight day on Tuesday, clinching another record closing high overnight near 19,000. The rout in the bond market finally paused as traders bought Treasurys, sending yields lower for the first time since last week's election. Japan's Nikkei hit a 9 and a half month high. The Japanese stock market closed up 1.1% at its highest level since February, buoyed by the weak yen helping exporters. Elsewhere in Asia, China's Shanghai Composite is down 0.07% at the time of writing (6.25 a.m. GMT/1.25 a.m. ET) and the Hong Kong Hang Seng is up 0.45%. Saudi Arabia will reveal how much oil it is sitting on as it prepares to sell shares in Saudi Aramco. "This is going to be the most transparent national oil company listing of all time," Khalid al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, told the Financial Times in an interview. Intel will invest more than $250 million (£200 million) to make autonomous driving a reality. Intel wrote in a press release that the investment will be geared toward advancing tech related to connectivity, communication, deep learning, and cybersecurity for cars. Deutsche Bank has shaken up some of its senior ranks in its US investment bank. The firm has promoted Michael Santini to vice chairman of Americas corporate finance and John Anos to cohead of global industrials alongside Richard Sheppard. Senior Morgan Stanley executives collectively earned about $10.5 million (£8.4 million) over the past week by exercising options and selling shares, with most of them profiting from an election-fueled rally in bank stocks, according to securities filings. The executives made the sales after shares of Morgan Stanley, which traded as low as $22 in the last 12 months, reversed course to become the best performing of the six largest US banks so far this year, closing Monday at $39.35. An aggressive tax avoidance scheme used by temp recruitment agencies is depriving the taxpayer of “hundreds of millions” of pounds a year, a Guardian investigation has found. A number of agencies have been making large windfalls by using “contrived” financial arrangements to slash their employer’s national insurance bills.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Nov 18, 2016 at 7:09PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. The good news keeps rolling in for banks. On Thursday, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, told Congress that an interest rate hike "could well become appropriate relatively soon." Interest rates are the single most important variable for investors in bank stocks to watch right now. It's why I've talked ad nauseam about the issue for much of the past year, as the most widely held bank stocks -- JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) -- all stand to profit handsomely once rates increase in earnest. Indeed, the most likely reason to explain why all four of these stocks climbed on Thursday was Yellen's testimony. Bank Thursday (11/17) Stock Performance JPMorgan Chase 0.65% Bank of America 1.64% Wells Fargo 1.72% Citigroup 1.71% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Three reasons Yellen is optimistic Yellen focused on three specific things in her remarks to Congress, the first being the rosy jobs picture. The unemployment rate stayed at 4.9% in October, which continues to be below the Fed's definition of maximum employment, defined as an unemployment rate of 5%. The Fed chairwoman noted that the rate of jobs growth continues to be "above trend" and that the labor force participation rate has remained constant despite headwinds from an aging population -- which, holding all else equal, causes labor force participation to fall as retirees exit the workforce. But the best sign on the employment front in the United States right now relates to jobless claims. The latest data, released Thursday, shows that the number of Americans applying for first-time unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest level in more than four decades. You have to go back to 1973 to see a comparable level. Data source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Chart by author. Yellen also found economic growth data to be a positive sign. Although output grew at just 1% for the first six months of 2016, it's estimated to have nearly tripled to just under 3% in the third quarter. It did so in spite of the ongoing concerns about the integrity of the European Union and moderating growth in China. Last but not least, the one area that monetary policymakers continue to watch for improvement is inflation. And while the most recent data shows that inflation remains below the Fed's 2% target rate -- it came in at 1.6% in October -- the trend in consumer prices is heading in the right direction as well. Data source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Chart by author. This is the variable, in turn, that investors in JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup should watch most closely. The higher inflation goes, the more likely the Fed is to raise rates and thereby boost the amount of money that each of these banks earns from their multibillion-dollar portfolios of loans and securities. On the low end, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase will earn between $2 billion and $3 billion in added net interest income each year from a 1-percentage-point increase in rates. On the high end, Bank of America's net interest income would climb by $5.3 billion under the same scenario. (Wells Fargo's disclosures around interest rate sensitivity are less specific.) With this in mind, Yellen's comments about a possible rate hike coming soon should be music to bank investors' ears. According to the Fed chief, at the latest meeting of the committee in charge of monetary policy, its members "judged that the case for an increase in the target range had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon."

Hernan Arbizu, who became involved in a tax-evasion probe involving JPMorgan, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to charges including wire fraud and embezzlement. He was extradited in June from Argentina. "I knew what I was doing was wrong," he said in court. "I'm very sorry and am ashamed by my actions." The 48-year-old citizen of Argentina faces a mandatory-minimum two-year prison sentence and a maximum of 422 years. But under a plea agreement, Arbizu agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, which his lawyer, Guy Lewis, said could help him avoid further prison. What that cooperation entails, Lewis said, "remains to be seen." JPMorgan declined to comment on Friday. Arbizu was first indicted in 2008, the same year he was fired by JPMorgan, where he was a vice president in its private banking division. He worked at UBS from 2002 to 2006. While at JPMorgan, Arbizu oversaw more than $200 million of client assets and was responsible for managing relationships with high-net-worth Argentine customers, according to the bank. Prosecutors said that from March 2007 to April 2008, Arbizu initiated 12 wire transfers from clients at UBS and JPMorgan totaling nearly $5.38 million, about half of which came from a single JPMorgan account. In lawsuits JPMorgan filed against Arbizu in 2008 and 2009, the bank said he wired the $2.8 million to an account at UBS to conceal the millions of dollars that he had previously stolen from one of its customers. JPMorgan said that after it discovered evidence of the wire transfers, Arbizu, then living in Connecticut, fled to Argentina, taking with him confidential data on clients. That data later became the basis of a tax evasion investigation and raid by Argentina authorities of JPMorgan's office in Buenos Aires in 2008 after Arbizu handed over a list of customers. No case against JPMorgan appears to have resulted. The case is U.S. v. Arbizu, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-cr-615.

After having just been awarded a multibillion-dollar settlement stemming from the financial crisis, the investment giant launched the hashtag (hash)AskJPM for people to ask career advice questions. But the move badly underestimated consumer sentiment toward banks and showed a tone of deafness to how social media works. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)(Credit: AP) JP Morgan Chase has agreed to pay a fine $264 million in response to claims that it hired unqualified Chinese employees because they were the children of officials from whom the bank hopes to obtain business. In a scheme that the Department of Justice described as “bribery by any other name” and a threat to national security, JP Morgan Chase is alleged to have hired roughly 100 interns and full-time employees because foreign government officials requested that they do so. In return, JP Morgan Chase received business that earned them more than $100 million. These actions violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits American companies from paying officials in foreign governments to secure business. Although JP Morgan Chase rewarded foreign officials by employing their loved ones instead of directly paying them, the Justice Department effectively argued that this still constituted bribery, particularly because there were many cases in which the unqualified candidate was hired due to a pre-existing understanding that the bank would be awarded business in return. In order to settle, JP Morgan Chase will have to pay $130 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission, $72 million to the Justice Department, and $61.9 million to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. The JP Morgan Chase settlement is particularly important given that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, is on President-elect Donald Trump’s short list for secretary of treasury (a position for which Dimon has repeatedly claimed to have no interest). Other close Trump advisers include Wall Street insiders like former Goldman Sachs executive Steve Mnuchin, who also served as finance chair of Trump’s presidential campaign, and Jeb Hensarling, who has ties to the payday loan industry.       Matthew Rozsa is a Ph.D. student in history at Lehigh University and a political columnist.

Among them was a 4.8-magnitude earthquake in January 2016 that's is probably the strongest fracking-induced earthquake ever. The researchers found two main causes from the quakes: pressure increases from injections of chemically laden water designed to pry oil and gas from rock formations; and pressure changes from fracking chemicals that remain after the process releases the hydrocarbons. These latter events can last for months. • Ivanka sat in on Trump’s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Abe. • JPMorgan’s “systemic bribery” in China so blatant that an internal spreadsheet kept track of it:  JPMorgan Chase will pay more than $130 million in a corruption settlement because it bribed government officials in China by hiring their relatives, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In a three-year investigation, the SEC discovered that JPMorgan engaged knew they were violating the law because they had an internal spread sheet documenting the bribery. • Marilyn Monroe’s dress worn when she sang Happy Birthday to JFK sells for $4.8 million. Elouise Cobell • Blackfeet woman to receive Presidential Medal of Freedom Nov. 22: The late Elouise Cobell, an enrolled member of the Blackfeet tribe of American Indians, will receive the nation’s highest civilian honor Tuesday, along with 21 other recipients. Cobell grew up in the 1950s on the Blackfeet reservation of northern Montana without running water, electricity or other amenities. A rancher, Cobell won a 15-year battle in the courts of government mismanagement of oil and gas leases on the Indian trust land that makes up the reservation. Tribal money went missing and wound up in government hands.

Since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed 500- and 1,000-rupee notes from circulation, currency exchange providers in the U.S. have been unable to take the outlawed bills. Some of the country’s biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., work with vendors to provide rupees to clients and those vendors have made the bills unavailable, spokesmen for the banks said. Wells Fargo & Co. also said it can’t supply rupees at this time, while Bank of America Corp. said it has never accepted the currency for exchange. “If you have a euro, you can go to a bank and exchange it,” Desai, 76, of Cliffside Park, New Jersey, said in a telephone interview. “For an Indian rupee, I don’t think there’s any bank that does that here.” Read more: India Withdraws High-Denomination Bills in Graft Crackdown Five-hundred rupee ($7.34) and 1,000-rupee notes ceased to be legal tender Nov. 9, Modi said last week in a surprise announcement, sweeping away 86 percent of the total currency in circulation. The move has been seen as an attempt to fulfill his election promise of curbing tax evasion and recovering illegal income, locally known as black money, stashed overseas. The notes will have to be deposited in banks by the end of December, Modi said. ‘Cash-based Economy’ “For our clients, it’s very hard,” Nandita Chandra, head of Great Indian Travel Co.’s New York office, said in a telephone interview while visiting New Delhi. “A lot of people are affected and we don’t have a culture that is credit-card friendly, it’s a cash-based economy." Read more: Modi put a target on tax evaders on his first day in office. Mastercard Inc., the second-largest payment network, heralded the move as one that will reduce crime and drive growth in the Indian economy. Modi’s “bold action and leadership is a critical step in positioning India to be a leader in the global cashless and digital economy movement,” Porush Singh, the firm’s president for South Asia, said in a statement. “Mastercard is committed to working with the government to provide the cashless solutions that combat corruption and create growth, and inclusion for all members of society.” Travelex Ltd., which operates more than 200 currency exchange stores in the U.S., said it’s unable to accept the 500- and 1000-rupee bills from customers because it can’t repatriate the cash in bulk under India’s current rules, said Lucie Smith, a spokeswoman for the London-based company. Western Union Co., the world’s largest money-transfer service, said for those locations facing a shortage of rupees, customers are able to receive checks or remittances to their bank accounts. “A lot of people are trying to give money to their friends to spend it, or else it will go to waste,” said Desai, who makes a yearly trip to India to work at a medical camp. If she can’t find a place to exchange or use the bills, she’ll “just have to throw it away.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

By Jack Hough Biography November 18, 2016 Investors have read plenty about potential Donald Trump stock trades. Here, we’ll instead look at a Trump discount, meaning a stock that has been clobbered since Election Day on the belief that U.S. policy changes will be bad for business in South Korea. Kia Motors (ticker: 000270.KR), down 30% so far this year and 12% since Election Day, trades at just 4.9 times this year’s projected earnings. More than half the company’s stock value is attributable to land, buildings and net cash. That means the car-making business...

Tonight Mostly clear. Low 26F. Winds light and variable. Updated: November 20, 2016 @ 12:15 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Photos Obits Classifieds AP Business Highlights By The Associated Press Updated Nov 17, 2016 ___ Yellen says she isn't going anywhere when Trump takes office WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen appears unruffled by incoming President Donald Trump's victory last week. Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, reiterated the Fed's political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress' Joint Economic Committee. ___ America's shift to SUVs is on display at L.A. Auto Show America's shift from cars to SUVs is starting to look permanent, and automakers are scrambling to meet the demand. Toyota, Ford, Subaru, Jeep and Volkswagen are all showing new SUVs at this week's Los Angeles Auto Show. Even traditional luxury car makers like Jaguar and Alfa Romeo are debuting SUVs. Americans bought more SUVs than four-door cars for the first time last year, and the momentum is growing. But unlike the previous SUV boom, which fell victim to rising gas prices, this one is likely to stay as automakers offer more small SUVs with better fuel economy. ___ Ex-Valeant, Philidor execs arrested for fraud, conspiracy Former executives of Valeant Pharmaceuticals and a related mail-order pharmacy were charged Thursday with running a fraud-and-kickback scheme that bilked Valeant out of millions of dollars. Their arrests are part of an ongoing investigation, according to Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who said other arrests are possible. Bharara's office said it has charged Gary Tanner, a former Valeant executive, and Andrew Davenport, who had been the chief executive of Philidor, a mail-order pharmacy that is now defunct, with two counts of wire fraud, along with money laundering and conspiracy. ___ Bank stocks surge again, leading broader market higher NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose Thursday as banks resumed their steep upward climb and retailers moved higher. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen emphasized that the Fed plans to raise interest rates, which will help banks make more money from lending. Stocks started the day with small gains and moved higher following Yellen's testimony to Congress. Banks once again marched higher as investors cheered the latest indication that interest rates will rise from their current ultra-low levels. Retailers also rose after strong earnings from Best Buy, while food and household goods makers struggled after weak results from Wal-Mart and J.M. Smucker. ___ Wal-Mart's profit falls but beats estimates; revenue misses NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw its third-quarter profit fall more than 8 percent, dragged down as it continues to plow money into e-commerce and improving its stores. While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world's largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the retailer down. ___ Gap's third-quarter profit drops nearly 18 percent NEW YORK (AP) — Gap's third-quarter profit fell nearly 18 percent, undercut by costs related to store closures outside North America. Gap Inc. shares fell in after-market trading Thursday as the company said the slump in the number of people visiting its stores continues as it heads into the critical holiday shopping season. Gap is facing the same problems as other fashion retailers, with shoppers buying less clothing in general and also favoring off-price chains like T.J. Maxx. But Gap is also struggling with identity problems, mired in a slump as its fashions just don't stand out in an overcrowded landscape. ___ JPMorgan Chase to pay $264 million in Chinese bribery case NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to pay $264.4 million in fines to federal authorities to settle criminal and civil charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country. JPMorgan's Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person's qualifications, in order to gain favor and win banking deals. ___ Tesla, SolarCity get shareholder approval for merger Tesla Motors got approval from investors to combine with SolarCity Corp. in an effort to expand the market for solar power and give electric car owners new options for solar charging. Shareholders of both companies backed the merger by a wide margin Thursday. The deal, first proposed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk proposed in June, has had more of a mixed reaction on Wall Street. Analysts wondered why Tesla would want to take on SolarCity while busy with its own goals. There were also complaints of a conflict of interest for Musk, who is chairman of both companies. ___ Wells Fargo sees significant slowdown in account openings NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo disclosed signs on Thursday that its customers are significantly pulling back from doing business with the bank, a reverberation of the sales practices scandal that drew a huge fine in September. Because of the timing, its data for October is the first full-picture view of customer reaction and it is not pretty. New customer account openings fell 44 percent in October from a year earlier, while account closures rose 3 percent from the previous year. The bank saw a 50 percent drop in credit card applications. ___ Verizon's AOL cutting 500 jobs, will focus on mobile, video NEW YORK (AP) — AOL is cutting about 500 jobs, or 8 percent of its workforce, as it trims back following some deals and focuses on mobile, video and data. In a memo to employees, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong says the Verizon-owned company has added 1,500 employees over the past year because of acquisitions and partnerships, and it needs to consolidate to improve operations. Armstrong says AOL will add jobs in the areas that are driving growth. ___ Sorry Trump, NY Times says subscriptions rose since election NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Times pushed back against President-elect Donald Trump, saying Thursday that its paid subscriptions have jumped since the election, despite Trump's accusations. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the Times "is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'Trump phenomena.'" The Times said Thursday that it added 41,000 paid subscriptions to its newspaper and digital news products in the week since Election Day. The increase is its largest one-week rise since 2011, when it launched its digital subscription model. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average added 35.68 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 10.18 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 39.39 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,333.97. Benchmark U.S. crude slid 15 cents to $45.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 14 cents to $46.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.45 a gallon. Natural gas fell 6 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.70 per 1,000 cubic feet. ___ The first item has been corrected to read that Yellen's term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, not January 2018.

Over a seven-year period, between 2006 and 2013, the bank hired about 200 interns and full-time employees at the request of clients in the region, including nearly 100 referred by government officials at 20 different state-owned businesses in China, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which was part of the settlement. The Chinese firms then entered into transactions earning the bank more than $100 million in revenue, according to the SEC. Since 1977, the United States has criminalised bribing foreign officials to win business under a statute known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.— AFP About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Tesla shareholders approve merger with SolarCity Japan budget airline Peach to buy 13 Airbus aircraft → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent ‘Copper Land’ exhibition in Nizwa concludes Al Jin Cave is fifth largest in the world Cruise tourism opens up new job vistas 221 CAS Nizwa students receive their degrees Read More ...

He was extradited in June from Argentina."I knew what I was doing was wrong," he said in court. "I'm very sorry and am ashamed by my actions."The 48-year-old citizen of Argentina faces a mandatory-minimum two-year prison sentence and a maximum of 422 years. But under a plea agreement, Arbizu agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, which his lawyer, Guy Lewis, said could help him avoid further prison. What that cooperation entails, Lewis said, "remains to be seen." JPMorgan declined to comment on Friday.Arbizu was first indicted in 2008, the same year he was fired by JPMorgan, where he was a vice president in its private banking division. He worked at UBS from 2002 to 2006.While at JPMorgan, Arbizu oversaw more than $200 million of client assets and was responsible for managing relationships with high-net-worth Argentine customers, according to the bank. Prosecutors said that from March 2007 to April 2008, Arbizu initiated 12 wire transfers from clients at UBS and JPMorgan totalling nearly $5.38 million, about half of which came from a single JPMorgan account.In lawsuits JPMorgan filed against Arbizu in 2008 and 2009, the bank said he wired the $2.8 million to an account at UBS to conceal the millions of dollars that he had previously stolen from one of its customers. JPMorgan said that after it discovered evidence of the wire transfers, Arbizu, then living in Connecticut, fled to Argentina, taking with him confidential data on clients.That data later became the basis of a tax evasion investigation and raid by Argentina authorities of JPMorgan's office in Buenos Aires in 2008 after Arbizu handed over a list of customers. No case against JPMorgan appears to have resulted.The case is U.S. v. Arbizu, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-cr-615.

Eric Volkman (TMFVolkman) Nov 18, 2016 at 7:04PM What happened? Confirming rumors that had been swirling for several months, accommodation booking and search company Trivago, currently majority-owned by online travel agency giant Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), has filed for an initial public offering. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES In the filing, Trivago revealed that it aims to raise up to $400 million in the issue. In conjunction with a number of its shareholders -- but not Expedia -- it will do so by floating American depositary shares, a common form of stock issued by foreign companies that trade on U.S. exchanges. Although Expedia is a U.S.-headquartered company, Trivago is based in Dusseldorf, Germany. In the wake of the stock market flotation, there will be two classes of shares. Class A shares will be the ones issued in the IPO; class B shares will be held by Expedia. No firm date has yet been set for the issue, and Trivago did not specify the number of American depositary shares it plans to sell. The company will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol TRVG. The IPO's underwriters are JPMorgan Chase unit JPMorgan Securities, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. Does it matter? At this early stage, it's hard to determine just how much of an impact the Trivago IPO will have on Expedia's stake. We still don't know how many shares will be offered, plus initial deal sizes have a way of changing as an IPO gets closer to realization. Regardless, Trivago's market debut is sure to be beneficial for Expedia. After all, the online travel incumbent acquired 62% of the fast-growing site in 2012 for around $531 million. This looks like a good deal these days considering that a minority stake is initially being valued at up to $400 million. A boost in the value of the Trivago stake would, theoretically, increase the attractiveness of Expedia. The latter's stock has traded up only slightly this year, in contrast to the nearly 20% rise enjoyed by archrival Priceline Group (NASDAQ:PCLN). The latest developments for Priceline Group have been encouraging; it posted a third quarter that saw revenue rise by 19% on a year-over-year basis and adjusted net profit grow by 20%.  In Expedia's most recently reported quarter, it beat Priceline Group on a revenue growth basis, with top line improving by 33%. Net profit, however, declined slightly due to an increase in expenses. Eric Volkman has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Priceline Group.

Continue Reading Below The good news keeps rolling in for banks. On Thursday, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, told Congress that an interest rate hike “could well become appropriate relatively soon.” Interest rates are the single most important variable for investors in bank stocks to watch right now. It’s why I’ve talked ad nauseam about the issue for much of the past year, as the most widely held bank stocks — JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Citigroup (NYSE: C), and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) — all stand to profit handsomely once rates increase in earnest. Indeed, the most likely reason to explain why all four of these stocks climbed on Thursday was Yellen’s testimony. More From Fool.com Bank Thursday (11/17) Stock Performance JPMorgan Chase 0.65% Bank of America 1.64% Wells Fargo 1.72% Citigroup 1.71% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Three reasons Yellen is optimistic Yellen focused on three specific things in her remarks to Congress, the first being the rosy jobs picture. The unemployment rate stayed at 4.9% in October, which continues to be below the Fed’s definition of maximum employment, defined as an unemployment rate of 5%. The Fed chairwoman noted that the rate of jobs growth continues to be “above trend” and that the labor force participation rate has remained constant despite headwinds from an aging population — which, holding all else equal, causes labor force participation to fall as retirees exit the workforce. But the best sign on the employment front in the United States right now relates to jobless claims. The latest data, released Thursday, shows that the number of Americans applying for first-time unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest level in more than four decades. You have to go back to 1973 to see a comparable level. Data source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Chart by author. Yellen also found economic growth data to be a positive sign. Although output grew at just 1% for the first six months of 2016, it’s estimated to have nearly tripled to just under 3% in the third quarter. It did so in spite of the ongoing concerns about the integrity of the European Union and moderating growth in China. Last but not least, the one area that monetary policymakers continue to watch for improvement is inflation. And while the most recent data shows that inflation remains below the Fed’s 2% target rate — it came in at 1.6% in October — the trend in consumer prices is heading in the right direction as well. Data source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Chart by author. This is the variable, in turn, that investors in JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup should watch most closely. The higher inflation goes, the more likely the Fed is to raise rates and thereby boost the amount of money that each of these banks earns from their multibillion-dollar portfolios of loans and securities. On the low end, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase will earn between $2 billion and $3 billion in added net interest income each year from a 1-percentage-point increase in rates. On the high end, Bank of America’s net interest income would climb by $5.3 billion under the same scenario. (Wells Fargo’s disclosures around interest rate sensitivity are less specific.) With this in mind, Yellen’s comments about a possible rate hike coming soon should be music to bank investors’ ears. According to the Fed chief, at the latest meeting of the committee in charge of monetary policy, its members “judged that the case for an increase in the target range had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon.” 10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

SUJATA RAO and NICHOLA SAMINATHER LONDON and SINGAPORE — Reuters Published Friday, Nov. 18, 2016 5:03PM EST Last updated Friday, Nov. 18, 2016 5:07PM EST Comments AA The year threatens to end as it began for emerging markets – with losses. After spectacular returns between end-January and October, emerging market stocks and bonds are again in retreat, disappointing investors who had hoped the sector had finally turned a corner after lagging its developed market peers for years. Money managers who attended last year’s Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit had correctly called a turn in favour of emerging markets. At this year’s summit (Nov. 14-19) – just after Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election victory – the mood was far less buoyant. In the wake of the election, investors pulled a record $6.4-billion (U.S.) from emerging bond funds tracked by JPMorgan – a full 10 per cent of what had been received year to date. Equity funds shed a third of year-to-date inflows, data showed. Returns for 2016 are still positive. But foreseeing more pain, many summit participants said they had cashed out their emerging market trades. Among them is NN Investment Partners, which turned positive on emerging markets toward the end of 2015 but recently reversed gear. “For us, Trump has been a game-changer for emerging markets,” Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, NNIP’s chief strategist, told the London leg of the summit. He said Mr. Trump might or might not carry through on pledges to slap tariffs on trade partners or build a wall to keep out Mexican immigrants. But he is seen unleashing a trillion dollars of stimulus through tax cuts and infrastructure spending. That is feeding through to U.S. bond markets, where rising yields are pricing in a jump in inflation. “It’s not just the risk of protectionism that we are worried about in emerging markets, it is the combination of that risk along with reflation which is undermining the story,” Mr. van Nieuwenhuijzen added. Those “reflation” bets have already taken some steam out of emerging markets since mid-October. A Merrill Lynch investor survey just after the Nov. 8 election found emerging equity allocations suffering their biggest month-on-month drop in five-and-a-half years. Bhaskar Laxminarayan, Asia CIO for Julius Baer, said 90 per cent of his firm’s global equity portfolio was in developed markets, as headwinds from Western protectionism grow. “We’ve achieved peak globalization … If you have a couple of years of this to play out, that’s not the best time to be in emerging markets,” Mr. Laxminarayan told the summit in Singapore. ‘Ground zero’ The emerging rally earlier this year had coincided with a 5-per-cent fall in the U.S. dollar index. Since the election, the greenback’s value has risen 5 per cent to 14-year highs. “Investors had been assuming the dollar had peaked. If that assumption turns out to be wrong … that does change the landscape quite dramatically,” said Richard Titherington, emerging markets head at JPMorgan Asset Management. But Mr. Trump’s election may not be unequivocally negative for the developing world if his infrastructure plans reignite commodity demand and boost U.S. growth. “It’s not time to get out yet. Commodities are stabilizing, the fact we’re now seeing earnings growth in emerging market companies, these make us think that, on the equities side, emerging markets can continue to move forward,” said Mark Haefele, CIO of the $2-trillion UBS Wealth Management. Emerging market debt is another story. Higher U.S. yields don’t just reduce the appeal of emerging bonds, they also make it costlier for governments and companies to roll over maturing debt or raise fresh finance. Mr. Haefele is steering clear, calling emerging market bonds “Ground zero” in the event of additional unexpected U.S. rate rises. Bonds in currencies such as the rand and the ruble could be at the sharp end of a sell-off. These rebounded this year after three years of losses, with big-name investors such as BlackRock and Pimco buying back in. Speaking in New York, BlackRock’s fixed income CIO Rick Rieder said he wasn’t ready to back off yet, calling emerging markets “a great opportunity” for 2017. Many summit participants said they might return in 2017, arguing there was potential in parts of the developing world and that rampant dollar gains were likely to prove unpalatable to U.S. policy-makers. Mexico has borne the brunt of Trump-related selling, but Didier Saint-Georges of Carmignac Gestion was among many who said the peso’s huge depreciation would boost competitiveness. “I would buy [Mexican assets] now, absolutely, with a 2017 perspective,” Mr. Saint-Georges said. GAM Investment Solutions also has hung on to the peso, while trimming other emerging market holdings. Its group head Larry Hatheway however plans to re-enter once bonds and the dollar settle. “When we look to 2017 and look at parts of markets that should perform, my sense is emerging equities, currencies will be good to be in,” Mr. Hatheway said. “It’s just a not-for-now story.” Report Typo/Error Also on The Globe and Mail Emerging market risk runs high on U.S. election (Reuters)   JPM-NJPMorgan Chase & Co Latest Price$77.71 -0.31 (-0.40%) BLK-NBlackRock Inc Latest Price$372.78 +1.41 (+0.38%) Updated November 18 4:00 PM EST. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

Witnesses told Unicorn Riot that the man was placed under arrest after attempting to hand Sheriff's deputies a flower that he had picked. Cass County Sheriff's deputies continued to brutalize the man, punching, kicking and kneeing him, after moving him near a squad car across the street. The man was heard screaming that his shoulder had been dislocated, and also yelled that he was a military veteran who was having a panic attack. Cass County Sheriff's deputies who were restraining and beating the man were repeatedly heard saying "stop resisting" and "stop reaching for my gun." Sheriff's deputies and police officers worked to obstruct the view of the beating by creating a visual barrier with their bodies, as well as threatening all eyewitnesses present at the scene with arrest. A bleeding wound on his head was visible as well as blood splattered on the ground. At some point during the incident, a transparent hood was placed over the man's head. - Advertisement - Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney was present for this entire incident. When asked if the hood placed on the man's head was a form of "hooding", considered to be a form of torture under international law, Sheriff Laney stated that the bag on the man's head was a "valid spit hood." >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> A press release from Greenpeace Thursday says the largest bank in Norway, DNB, sold its assets in the Dakota Access pipeline.

Submitted on Friday, Nov 18, 2016 at 11:02:01 AM     (1+)   pablo mayhew (Member since Aug 14, 2014), 7 fans, 4 articles, 587 comments    Good stuff, Stephen. Thank you. The Norwegian bank pullout is indeed encouraging news. For some reason, I was unable to access video footage via the article link. I did, however, manage to find a video of the event on YouTube. Appalling. The first question, naturally, is why it takes seven or nine cops to subdue one clearly subdued and wounded unarmed man. Something needs to be said about that scene, but it must be done carefully. Without seeking to place Stephen Fox, OEN, myself, or anyone or anything else that those in power might seek to drag into the realm of complicity in some way, I guess I will say it like this: If this kind of brutal neo-fascist reaction by the the law-enforcement arm of the One Percent to people expressing their views and standing up for their rights persists--which it undoubtedly will--the time will soon arrive when being a spectator to such a warped and grotesque show of force will no longer suffice. I suppose it comes down to one's definition of acceptable risk. Myself, I have been sickened and repulsed by what I have seen of the police brutality that has surrounded the Dakota Pipeline situation from the outset. And I have no illusions whatsoever of how little I have seen of what has occurred. Chances are fair--as we continue to push back against the oligarchic octopus that has its tentacles into virtually all aspects of American life--that any of us may encounter similarly grim and morally unacceptable situations in our own environment. It is an unfortunate reality of our age. We all will have a choice to make at that point. But quite possibly the situation will make the choice for us. It may be wise to prepare for such an occurrence--like it or not.

As articulate as you are, you could make a fine presentation to the Boards of Directors of JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, as to why THEY should also pull out. Today, I was in Wells Fargo, which I am unable to leave for many reasons, and about five people urged the head tellers and personal bankers to get in touch with them through some kind of fill out this form deal, but I will do some more research and track these names down for an OEN articles.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases pr @ satprnews.com Fitch Upgrades 2 Classes of JPMCCM 2005-LDP1 NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Fitch Ratings has upgraded two classes, downgraded one and affirmed six defaulted classes of JP Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. series 2005-LDP1 (JPMCCM 2005-LDP1) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrades to the two senior classes reflect increasing credit enhancement and expectation of continued pay down relative to Fitch’s expected losses. Fitch modeled losses of 10.5% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the original pool balance total 4.1%, including $114.6 million (4% of the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. One loan is defeased (1.7% of the pool) As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool’s aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 98% to $45 million from $2.88 billion at issuance. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes K through NR. Concentrated Pool: Although the transaction has experienced significant pay down, the pool is extremely concentrated with only 11 loans and one REO asset remaining. Retail properties comprise the majority of the remaining pool at 71%. The two largest loans, which have related sponsorship and account for 49% of the total pool balance, are grocery anchored community shopping centers located in Niles, IL and Virginia Beach, VA. The REO (14% of the pool), and the transaction’s only specially serviced asset, is a 162,000 sf office property located in Greenwood, IN. The special servicer is focused on stabilizing the 79% occupied property prior to marketing it for sale. Maturities: No loan matures prior to 2019. The two largest loans in the pool (49%) are scheduled to mature in December 2019. Amortization: All performing loans are amortizing with six loans (25% of the pool) fully amortizing over their terms. The Fitch stressed LTV for the pool is 87.3%. RATING SENSITIVITIES The Stable Outlooks on classes F and G reflect the class’s sufficient credit enhancement and expectation of continued pay down. Class F is expected to be paid in full over the next year from scheduled amortization. Further upgrades to class G may be limited due to the increasing concentration of the pool. Fitch ran an additional sensitivity analysis on the pool which applied a 50% loss to the two largest loans, both of which mature in 2019. Credit enhancement to classes F and G remained sufficient to support the ratings. USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action. Fitch has upgraded the following ratings: –$1.3 million class F to ‘AAAsf’ from ‘BBBsf’; Outlook Stable; –$28.8 million class G to ‘BBsf’ from ‘CCCsf’; Outlook Stable. Fitch has downgraded the following rating: –$14.9 million class H to ‘Dsf’ from ‘Csf’; RE 80%. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: –$0 class J at ‘Dsf’; RE 0%; –$0 class K at ‘Dsf’; RE 0%; –$0 class L at ‘Dsf’; RE 0%; –$0 class M at ‘Dsf’; RE 0%; –$0 class N at ‘Dsf’; RE 0%; –$0 class P at ‘Dsf’; RE 0%. Classes A-1 through E have paid in full. Fitch does not rate the class NR certificates. Fitch previously withdrew the ratings on the interest-only class X-1 and X-2 certificates.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities.

After spectacular returns between end-January and October, emerging market stocks and bonds are again in retreat, disappointing investors who had hoped the sector had finally turned a corner after lagging its developed market peers for years. Money managers who attended last year's Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit had correctly called a turn in favour of emerging markets. At this year's summit, held Nov. 14-19 - just after Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory - the mood was far less buoyant. In the wake of the election, investors pulled a record $6.4 billion from emerging bond funds tracked by JPMorgan - a full 10 percent of what had been received year-to-date. Equity funds shed a third of year-to-date inflows, data showed. Returns for 2016 are still positive. But foreseeing more pain, many summit participants said they had cashed out their emerging market trades. Among them is NN Investment Partners, which turned positive on emerging markets towards the end of 2015 but recently reversed gear. "For us, Trump has been a game-changer for emerging markets," Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, NNIP's chief strategist, told the London leg of the summit. He said Trump might or might not carry through on pledges to slap tariffs on trade partners or build a wall to keep out Mexican immigrants. But he is seen unleashing a trillion dollars of stimulus through tax cuts and infrastructure spending. That is feeding through to U.S. bond markets, where rising yields are pricing in a jump in inflation. "It's not just the risk of protectionism that we are worried about in emerging markets, it is the combination of that risk along with reflation which is undermining the story," van Nieuwenhuijzen added. Those "reflation" bets have already taken some steam out of emerging markets since mid-October. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch investor survey just after the Nov. 8 election found emerging equity allocations suffering their biggest month-on-month drop in 5 1/2 years. Bhaskar Laxminarayan, Asia CIO for Julius Baer, said 90 percent of his firm's global equity portfolio was in developed markets, as headwinds from Western protectionism grow. "We've achieved peak globalization ... If you have a couple of years of this to play out, that's not the best time to be in emerging markets," Laxminarayan told the summit in Singapore. "GROUND ZERO" The emerging rally earlier this year had coincided with a 5 percent fall in the dollar index. Since the election, the greenback's value has risen 5 percent to 14-year highs. "Investors had been assuming the dollar had peaked. If that assumption turns out to be wrong ... that does change the landscape quite dramatically," said Richard Titherington, emerging markets head at JPMorgan Asset Management. But Trump's election may not be unequivocally negative for the developing world if his infrastructure plans re-ignite commodity demand and boost U.S. growth. "It's not time to get out yet. Commodities are stabilising, the fact we're now seeing earnings growth in emerging market companies, these make us think that, on the equities side, emerging markets can continue to move forward," said Mark Haefele, CIO of the $2 trillion UBS Wealth Management. Emerging market debt is another story. Higher U.S. yields don't just reduce the appeal of emerging bonds, they also make it costlier for governments and companies to roll over maturing debt or raise fresh finance. Haefele is steering clear, calling emerging market bonds "Ground Zero" in the event of additional unexpected U.S. rate rises. Bonds in currencies such as the rand and the rouble could be at the sharp end of a selloff. These rebounded this year after three years of losses, with big-name investors such as BlackRock and PIMCO buying back in. Speaking in New York, BlackRock's fixed income CIO Rick Rieder said he wasn't ready to back off yet, calling emerging markets "a great opportunity" for 2017. "NOT-FOR-NOW STORY" Many summit participants said they might return in 2017, arguing there was potential in parts of the developing world and that rampant dollar gains were likely to prove unpalatable to U.S. policymakers. Mexico has borne the brunt of Trump-related selling, but Didier Saint-Georges of Carmignac Gestion was among many who said the peso's huge depreciation would boost competitiveness. "I would buy (Mexican assets) now, absolutely, with a 2017 perspective," Saint-Georges said. GAM Investment Solutions also has hung on to the peso, while trimming other emerging market holdings. Its group head Larry Hatheway however plans to re-enter once bonds and the dollar settle. "When we look to 2017 and look at parts of markets that should perform, my sense is emerging equities, currencies will be good to be in," Hatheway said. "It's just a not-for-now story."

Trump.” With that caveat, this person also said rumors that Steve Mnuchin was out for Treasury were wrong. And they expressed skepticism that Jamie Dimon would get an offer given negative things the JPMorganChase CEO has said about Trump. Also unlikely: House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling. Too many lobbyist connections, evidently. Still, the bottom line is nobody knows, probably not even Trump, and any of these people could get Treasury. Pretty much everyone has been floated as a potential Secretary of State, including frequent Trump critic Mitt Romney. To MM, tapping Romney would be a genius move to show both magnanimity and a desire to calm fears in the establishment of Trump’s approach to Russia (among other things). But is Trump capable of such a gesture? Story Continued Below A DIFFERENT VIEW ON WALL STREET AND TRUMP — Better Markets' Dennis Kelleher with a slightly different view from our Thursday piece: “[I]it seems unlikely that President Trump is going to deliver Wall Street's biggest banks their most desired special interests, which they have been lobbying unsuccessfully to get for years. … “The salivating Wall Street bankers and their lawyers and lobbyists may turn out to be right, but a President Trump should be a leader in aggressively regulating Wall Street's too big to fail banks, nonbanks and activities so that they can't do again to the American people what they did in 2008” MM VS KUDLOW — The venerable Larry Kudlow, one of the smartest and nicest people we know, also has a different view. He believes Steve Bannon will guide Trump away from pro-Wall Street policies and that Hensarling will offer relief to smaller banks but not big ones. He also suggested Trump might follow through on a new Glass-Steagall. If all this comes to pass, MM owes Larry dinner. We debated it on CNBC’s Closing Bell. Watch here. TROUBLED WATERS — POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt: “Rep. Maxine Waters, who has clashed on policy with … Hensarling for years, would be ‘very worried’ about the Texas Republican becoming the next Treasury secretary. In an interview Thursday, Waters said the House Financial Services Committee chairman was on the opposite side of Democrats ‘on all the big issues.’ Waters has served as the top Democrat on the committee since Hensarling took control of its gavel in 2013. “She said they have a ‘friendly relationship,’ but she would rather not see him become the 77th Treasury secretary. ‘No, I would not be happy with that at all,’ the California Democrat said. A longstanding divide between Hensarling and Waters is their approach to policing the financial system. As Treasury secretary, Hensarling would chair FSOC … Hensarling said he would prefer that FSOC play ‘no role’ in imposing its will on capital markets. … “[HFSC] spokesman Jeff Emerson: “After last week's elections, the ranking member probably needs to spend more time worrying about how divided her party is and why the American people just repudiated her party's liberal agenda. People all across the country voted for the Republican majority because we offer a better way.” Read more. TRANSITION CAN OFFICIALLY BEGIN — POLITICO’s Nancy Cook: “The Trump transition team filed the last pieces of necessary paperwork late Thursday afternoon that enables it to start receiving briefings and go into federal agencies. This document, called the Memorandum of Understanding … basically kicks off the transfer of power from one administration to the next and lets the future Trump administration begin to think through its plan for the federal government.” Read more. GOLDMAN ON TRUMP AND CONGRESS — Goldman Sachs analyst Alec Philips in a podcast with Goldman’s Jake Siewert: “Because of the procedural rules of the Senate you need 60 votes to break a filibuster and they’ve got … 52 seats, they’re going to need eight Democrats. “There are some exceptions to that. And so, the exceptions would be on sort of fiscal related legislation, where they can use something called the reconciliation process to pass bills that deal with tax policy, certain areas of spending, as long as they’re involved in sort of the broader budget process with a simple majority.” Listen. MORE ON KASHKARI — From Tyler Gellasch, a former legislative aide who helped write the Volcker rule: “I wouldn't be surprised if Kashkari's dramatic capital raise, which would be in-line with what many bank reformers would hope, snags a lot of support from both sides of the aisle … and a lot of opposition. “A much higher capital requirement for big banks may be the price for shedding the Volcker Rule and other systemic risk constraints. Depending on the details, even I might take that trade.” HOT CLICK — American Action Forum has a list of at least 48 regulations Trump could wipe away in January. DOLLAR KEEPS RISING — Reuters: “The dollar vaulted to 13 1/2-year highs against a basket of major currencies as U.S. bond yields rose, leaving Asian stocks vulnerable to potential rotation out of emerging markets to the United States. … The dollar's rise, however, was a boon for Japan's exporter-driven Nikkei average, which rose 0.9 percent to a 10-month high.” Read more. RATE HIKE ON TRACK — Bloomberg: “[Fed Chair Janet Yellen] suggested the Federal Open Market Committee wouldn’t be knocked off course from raising interest rates next month after Trump won victory last week on a campaign that the economy was in terrible shape. The labor market is continuing to improve and inflation is starting to rise toward the Fed’s 2 percent goal amid signs of increasing wage gains, she said.” Read more.

TRUMP AND THE WORLD — IHS on the impact of Trump on the global economy: “The election of Donald Trump ... has the potential of upsetting the established global order and changing the economic outlook. If protectionist policies are pursued, growth in global trade and real GDP will likely be slower and inflation will probably be higher — a recipe for stagflation. “If more pragmatic and pro-growth policies are pursued, then economic growth, inflation, and interest rates will all be higher — an outcome that will benefit most but not all economies. IHS Global Insight believes the latter scenario is more likely than the former. … Brexit and political uncertainty in Europe had already clouded Europe’s outlook. The US election could embolden right-wing populist parties in Europe and make the Brexit negotiations more complicated” ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: Now delivering: Retirement security for life! We know saving for retirement can be difficult, but policymakers can help by supporting policies to encourage saving, make retirement plans more widely available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies. Let’s send Americans paychecks for life. Learn more at: http://irionline.org/agenda. ** MNUCHIN BANK HIT WITH REDLINING ALLEGATIONS — POLITICO’s Lorraine Woellert: “OneWest Bank, a mortgage lender founded and run by Steven Mnuchin until last year, discriminated against blacks, Hispanics and Asians and avoided putting branches in minority communities, according to a federal complaint filed by two California housing watchdogs. “The redlining accusation, filed with [HUD], was made against CIT Group Inc., which purchased OneWest in a $3.4 billion deal that closed last year. Mnuchin … is on CIT's board. While the complaint doesn't name Mnuchin specifically, it could complicate any decision to nominate him for a Cabinet post” Read more. WHALEN ON KASHKARI — BRA's Chris Whalen on Kashkari’s proposal: “Kashkari suggests excessive levels of capital to address the problem of big banks, an extension of the false narrative that a lack of capital caused the 2008 financial crisis. This view is wrong for several reasons. First and foremost, the top banks are big because the Fed … and other regulators have over the past several decades encouraged a series of mergers between large strong banks and the weak. … “Second, prudential regulations give the largest banks with active securities businesses an unfair advantage vs smaller institutions. These regulations allow the largest banks to swell to enormous size, both in terms of their visible balance sheets and the less-apparent off balance sheet (OBS) obligations” MORE KASHKARI REACT — From Tom Quaadman, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness: “The plan wasn’t really surprising: more capital, more scrutiny, and new taxes .. What was surprising, though, was President Kashkari’s lack of understanding of how important a strong financial system is to economic growth and Main Street business” Read more. LOBBYISTS SCOFF AT TRUMP RULE — POLITICO’s Isaac Arnsdorf: “K Street quickly cast doubt on the effectiveness of Donald Trump's five-year lobbying ban on transition and administration officials, saying the rule would both deter top talent from joining Trump's team and widen the use of loopholes. On its face, Trump's ban would last longer than any policy in force before. But it's already become increasingly common for former officials to find ways to use their influence without registering as lobbyists. “Trump's ban will probably intensify that trend, and its announcement probably had more to do with protecting the president-elect's anti-establishment image than actually disrupting the revolving door, lobbyists and legal experts said” Read more. CFPB FOCUSED ON FINANCIAL DATA — POLITICO’s Colin Wilhelm: “The CFPB on Thursday stepped further into the growing debate over the future of finance: who controls the consumer data that's vital to both startups and traditional financial companies. In a request for information, as well as at a public field hearing, the CFPB doubled down on statements about the importance of consumer access and control of their financial data, an issue on which Director Richard Cordray first planted a flag at an industry conference last month” Read more. TRUMP TAPS FLYNN - POLITICO's Bryan Bender: "President-elect Donald Trump has tapped retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, one of his top confidants, to be White House national security adviser, which would elevate the controversial surrogate to be the chief arbiter of virtually every major defense and foreign policy decision. "Flynn’s appointment was confirmed to POLITICO by a source close to the Trump transition on Thursday night, though it was not clear whether Flynn has responded." Read more. ABE LAUDS TRUMP — Bloomberg’s Akiko Nishimae and Isabel Reynold: “Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Donald Trump was a trustworthy leader in comments after his first meeting with the U.S. President-elect, whose statements on trade and security have sparked concern in Japan. “Abe told reporters in New York on Thursday night that he had frank discussions in a ‘warm atmosphere’ at Trump Tower. He said he explained his views on a range of issues, but declined to comment on the substance of the talks in a meeting that lasted more than an hour.

ROMNEY HEADS TO THE TOWER — CNBC’s Antonio Jose Vielma: “Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney will meet with Donald Trump this weekend to discuss the secretary of state position, a source close to the president-elect with direct knowledge of his thinking told NBC News. “Separately, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich told NBC News on Thursday he will not be in Trump's cabinet, instead choosing to focus on ‘strategic planning for the emerging Republican majority.’” Read more. FED FIGHTS FOR INDEPENDENCE — FT’s Barney Jopson: “Janet Yellen has stressed the importance of central bank independence in her first public remarks after Donald Trump’s election victory as new data showed the president-elect will inherit a strengthening economy. “Ms Yellen said it was ‘critically important’ that central banks had the freedom to make judgments about how best to pursue their goals. Her remarks followed attacks during the election campaign by Mr Trump, who claimed the Fed had kept interest rates low to help the Obama administration.” Read more. DRAIN THE … SCHUMER? — Business Insiders’ Allan Smith: “It just so happens that the Democrat who will likely have to work closest with Trump is also the senator who's received more in campaign donations from the Manhattan billionaire than any other member of the Senate. “From 1996, when Schumer was running for a House seat, to 2010, Trump donated roughly $9,000 directly to the New York Democrat's campaign, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Three of Trump's children — Eric, Donald Jr., and Ivanka — donated a combined $6,800 to Schumer. Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband and a top adviser to the president-elect, donated $4,000 to Schumer.” Read more. MUSK MERGER — WSJ’s Tim Higgins and Cassandra Sweet: “Shareholders of Tesla Motors Inc. and SolarCity Corp. approved Tesla’s $2.1 billion all-stock offer to merge and create one company headed by Elon Musk that would sell emissions-free cars and rooftop solar panels that power them. “Tesla announced that the merger was approved by 85 percent of Tesla shareholders, excluding Mr. Musk and other affiliated shareholders. SolarCity didn’t disclose the percentage of its shareholders voting.” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements. With longer lifespans, this often means saving for a longer retirement. These challenges have made planning and saving for retirement more difficult. But what if all Americans could get paychecks for life? Policymakers can help make this possible by supporting policies that encourage saving, make workplace retirement plans more broadly available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies. Let’s send Americans retirement security.

JPMorgan Chase settles bribery case for $264 million JPMorgan Chase & Co. agreed to pay $264 million to settle accusations that the bank hired the children of Chinese leaders to win business in China, federal prosecutors and regulators said in a statement on Thursday. The New York Times reported the hiring practices of the bank and its Hong Kong subsidiary violated United States law governing foreign bribery. The bank had argued that hiring well-connected employees was routine practice in China. Regulators didn’t agree, and also are investigating the hiring practices of other large banks, the New York Times reported. Fed Chair Yellen says Fed could hike rates soon Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said the recent presidential election has done nothing to alter the central bank’s plans to raise interest rates “relatively soon,” according to Reuters. Yellen said the Fed would change its outlook if the new Trump administration dramatically lowers taxes and government spending. She sounded a cautionary note on President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to “turn back the clock” on the Dodd-Frank financial regulations approved in the wake of the financial meltdown. Yellen told Congress economic data justified a rate hike “relatively soon.” Wal-Mart sales climb, though profit slumps U.S. retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. continues to trail Amazon.com in its quest to revamp its online operations. Wal-Mart lured more shoppers during the quarter, but profits fell as the retailer invested heavily to compete with Amazon, The Wall Street Journal reported. Same-store sales climbed 1.2 percent for the quarter, the ninth straight increase, according to The Wall Street Journal. Company executives also said the strong dollar trimmed the retailer’s overseas revenue. Marijuana industry readies for post-election gains The Economist reported the U.S. cannabis industry is celebrating following the November 8th election results. Four states, including California, voted to approve recreational marijuana use, while another four states approved medical marijuana. Industry leaders met this week in Las Vegas to discuss growth opportunities. Last year, legal sales of pot climbed to $6 billion, according to the Arcview Group, an investment and market-research firm. Despite the growth of legal recreational cannabis use, federal laws banning the drug prohibit large-scale investment from banks and private equity firms.         Related Posts Must-Read Money Stories for Tuesday, Nov. 15 Must-Read Money Stories for Wednesday, Nov. 16 Must-Read Money Stories for Thursday, Nov. 17 must read money stories Search Our Site Search for: Subscribe to Our Podcast     Latest News Must-Read Money Stories for Friday, Nov. 18 Share this!JPMorgan Chase settles bribery case for $264 million JPMorgan November 18, 2016 Staff Editor to Freelance Writer: 4 Tips for a Successful Career Transition Share this!Whether or not to go freelance might be one November 18, 2016 Donald W.

ALSO READ Brexit could add to European banking costs - JPMorgan's Dimon Clutch Auto to hold board meeting Clutch Auto to hold board meeting Nobel winner says CEO pay too complex, echoing investor gripe JPMorgan Chase CEO says bank it will raise minimum pay By David Henry NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is once again facing questions about who will succeed its larger-than-life chief executive after Jamie Dimon was courted by the incoming U.S. president for the role of Treasury secretary. Dimon, 60, has been running the largest U.S. bank for more than a decade and has faced questions about his longevity in the role before: when potential successors left, when he allowed an embarrassing $6.2 billion derivatives trading loss and, most recently, when he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014. Although associates have said Dimon is not interested in the Treasury job, the recent invitation from a member of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team to apply for the job was a reminder to interested parties, including some investors, that his time at the helm is finite. "He is not going to be CEO forever," said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Management, which owns JPMorgan shares. Although a sudden departure would not necessarily lead the investor to sell the stock, it would be "troubling," Todd said. "I would have to gain some comfort with who was taking over that role." Dimon will not be easy to replace. He has won a higher valuation for JPMorgan stock than rival banks by shepherding it through the financial crisis without any quarterly losses, while earning relatively high returns on equity and explaining the workings of the bank to analysts as though he were a demanding business school professor. He has been quick to point out that the JPMorgan board has a succession plan in place, whether he departs abruptly due to unforeseen circumstances - known colloquially as a "hit by a truck" scenario - or whether he takes part in a more gradual transition. The board does not publicize those plans. Doing so could prompt executives who are not the favorite to leave. There are six key members of Dimon's management team who are often mentioned in discussions about succession. They range in age from 46 to 58, with the older executives seen as "hit by a truck" contenders, and younger ones thought to be potential CEOs-in-training. Each has some qualities Dimon has identified as necessary for the next CEO - like moving through senior roles in different parts of the company, having experience with the investment bank, or having the temperament to be the public face of JPMorgan - but none clearly has them all. JPMORGAN'S GOT TALENT Gordon Smith, a 58-year-old Briton with computer science training, is chief executive of the consumer bank. He runs nearly half of JPMorgan, including Chase branches, credit cards, mortgages and auto loans. Dimon hired him from American Express Co in 2007. Although Smith has many of the skills needed to be CEO, he is close enough to Dimon's age that insiders see him as an unlikely long-term candidate. Daniel Pinto, 53, who oversees corporate and investment banking, is also on the succession shortlist. Dimon has entrusted Pinto with running the most volatile part of JPMorgan and dealing with the biggest corporate clients. A native of Argentina, Pinto spends much of his time working from JPMorgan's London office. Doug Petno, who runs commercial banking, is another possible contender. With $212 billion in assets, his segment of the company is bigger than all but a handful of competitors. The 51-year-old came up through the ranks as lender and investment banker to the oil and gas industry. Mary Erdoes, 49, who runs asset management, is also said to be in the running. Erdoes keeps a relatively low public profile as she travels the world to cater to the richest clients. Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, who is 47, is also floated as a possibility. Lake already has a high profile, because she handles public presentations of the bank's financial results each quarter and has shown she can be as dextrous with numbers as Dimon. But while Lake is known internally for grasping the details behind summaries she receives from business heads, she has not run any of JPMorgan's units day to day. Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames is the youngest contender, at 46. In his role, he has the advantage of learning all segments of the bank from the inside out. Dimon turned to Zames in early 2012 to clean up the portfolio of the bad "London Whale" derivatives trader that was costly not only in dollars but in reputation. Zames came from fixed-income trading, and has worked through financial crises going back to 1998. 'I DON'T WANT TO RETIRE' Dimon has said JPMorgan has a "deep bench" of talent, with several people who could take over. But he has been careful not to clearly show favorites. When all goes right with succession plans, companies tend to announce a few months ahead of time that their leaders will be relinquishing the CEO title to a successor but remain on the board as chairman for a smooth transition. During the interim, other executives in the horse race tend to peel off, letting up-and-comers take over their own roles. JPMorgan has resolved nearly all of its major legal investigations. Dimon received a clean bill of health after undergoing cancer treatment. And, apparently, he has no plans to join Trump's cabinet. So unless an unexpected event forces his hand, Dimon may not feel compelled to tell investors who is next. "My retirement date, every time you ask me that, I'm going to say five years," Dimon said in response to a question last year. "I don't want to retire."

The authorities alleged that the bank hired relatives and friends of Chinese government officials to secure banking deals, the US Department of Justice said in a statement. US Assistant Attorney General Caldwell said: “Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple.  “This case demonstrates the Criminal Division’s commitment to uncovering corruption no matter the form of the scheme.” Beginning in 2006, senior Hong Kong-based investment bankers set up and used the “Sons and Daughters Program,” to hire candidates referred by clients and government officials. The US authorities said that the program was used as a means to influence those same officials to award investment deals to JP Morgan APAC.  By late 2009, JPMorgan executive and senior bankers revamped the program to give priority to the candidates linked to upcoming client transactions. The Justice Department’s statement said that a referred candidate in the revised program had to have a “directly attributable linkage to business opportunity” to get hired. Many of those hire performed ancillary work such as proofreading and provided little real value to any deliverable product, it said. Despite that, the candidates hired during the scheme were typically given the same titles and paid the same amount as entry-level investment bankers. According to the statement, the corrupt scheme has resulted in at least $35m in profits for JP Morgan. Of the total penalty, JP Morgan agreed to pay $130.5m in disgorgement to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including prejudgment interest.

Tech to aid fertility Business Beat More Business »   Vying for lucrative deals in China, JPMorgan Chase deployed all the usual wining-and-dining tactics that big banks use to woo clients. JPMorgan, federal authorities now say, also had ways of sweetening the deal that crossed a legal line. Federal prosecutors and regulators announced on Thursday a settlement of roughly $264 million with the bank and its Hong Kong subsidiary, accusing them of a vast foreign bribery scheme that may have spread to a number of Wall Street banks. The case centered on JPMorgan’s­ hiring practices in China, where it is accused of hiring the children of Chinese leaders to win business in the fast-growing nation. Some of the well-connected candidates were unqualified, authorities said, and often “performed ancillary work” — telltale signs of hidden bribery. The case could lay the groundwork for authorities to pursue penalties against other big banks as well. Banks including HSBC, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank have hinted that they face investigations into their hiring practices in China as part of a larger sweep by the agency that began in 2013. “We do not expect this to be the last action resulting from that sweep,” Andrew Ceresney, the head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, told reporters Thursday. The bank argued that the hiring of well-connected employees was routine in China, and that its own hires fell into a gray area of foreign bribery laws. But the prosecutors and regulators say that as JPMorgan­ hired more and more candidates based on referrals from Chinese leaders, senior bankers in several instances explicitly tied those jobs or internships to securing deals with Chinese government-run companies. To be hired, a referred candidate had to have, in the bank’s own words, a “directly attributable linkage to business opportunity,” a scheme that enabled the company to win or retain business resulting in more than $100 million in revenue, prosecutors said. “The common refrain that this is simply how business is done overseas is no defense,” said Robert Capers, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. “This is no longer business as usual; it is corruption.” Still, authorities acknowledged that JPMorgan­ cooperated extensively with the investigation and they lowered the penalty accordingly. The bank, authorities stated, also disciplined nearly two dozen employees and “took significant employment action” that led to the departure of six employees who participated in the misconduct. “We’re pleased that our cooperation was acknowledged,” a JPMorgan spokesman, Brian Marchiony, said. “The conduct was unacceptable.” “We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved,” he added.

JPMorgan agreed to $264 million in fines, an amount discounted in return for the bank’s cooperation with the investigations. The bank acknowledged wrongdoing as part of the settlement — an unusual admission in such cases. Facing a competitive business environment, JPMorgan hired candidates, who usually were unqualified, for internships and full-time jobs at the prestigious bank, the largest in the U.S. by assets. In some cases the applicants were referred by Chinese government officials and the employment would be extended if the relationship generated enough revenue, according to court documents. The case is just the first of what law enforcement officials expect to be several delving into the conduct of U.S. banks operating in China. The JPMorgan case shows that this may “be an industrywide problem,” said Andrew Ceresney, director of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission. “We do not expect this to be the last action related to this sweep.” JPMorgan said it has made improvements to its hiring practices and was pleased that its cooperation was recognized by law enforcement officials. “The conduct was unacceptable. We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved,” JPMorgan said in a statement. The case centers on hiring practices in JPMorgan’s Hong Kong business. Between 2006 and 2013 the bank developed a referral program for applicants connected to business or government officials that could land JPMorgan work. Those applicants were allowed to bypass the usual hiring process and did not have to compete against more qualified candidates based on merit, according to court documents. The arrangement was so explicit that JPMorgan employees created a spreadsheet to track the revenue brought in from clients who made referrals.

If the relationship generated sufficient revenue, those hired through the referral program were offered longer-term jobs, according to court documents. Others were given shorter-term employment unless the business contact offered additional work to JPMorgan. About 200 interns and full-time employees were hired as part of the scheme, including nearly 100 referred by Chinese government officials. Bank employees knew that they were potentially violating the law, but persisted in the conduct for more than six years, said Ceresney of the SEC. The bank was involved in a “systematic bribery scheme,” he said. More Business Cozy retirement?

The Department of Justice called the scheme "bribery by any other name" and said it threatened national security. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Justice Department (DoJ) began an investigation in 2013. The bank will pay the SEC $130m for violations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It is also expected to pay $72m to the US Justice Department and $61.9m to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38013723 A11608543165 View Public Profile Send a private message to A11608543165 Find all posts by A11608543165 « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Search this Thread Show Printable Version Email this Page Search this Thread: Advanced Search Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home Work     Just Talk     AsiaOne Contests     Politics     ShowBiz / Entertainment     Tech         General news         News and comments             Phones and Telcos             Computers and Software             Internet             Bad Tech Deals             How Tos         MarketPlace             Trading             Buying & Selling         Reviews             Phones and Gadgets             Computers and Cameras             Consoles, Games and Software             Services and Others         Innovations     Health         News         Cancer         Health costs         Sexual Health         Letters to the press         Feedback & Comments     Business         News         Daily Frustrations         Jobs         Money         SME Central         Tech Sense     Property         News         Property Market         Housing agents         The Wanted List     Worklife     Regional & World News         Asia             Asia News             South East Asia             China             Japan             Malaysia         World         World News     Singapore     Crime     Show Your Pics     Sports         Singapore sports         Football         Tennis         Golf         International events & other sports         Scandals, rumours and gossip     Motoring         Motor Talk             Public transport             Hot Fumes             Motor Mouths             Formula One racing             Taxi Tales             Motoring Classifieds             Complaint Corner             Diesel Motoring         Motor Announcements         Technical             Motor Tech             Help!             I.C.E.         Chatroom             Saloons             Hatchbacks             MPVs             SUVs             Coupes / Cabriolets Live     SoShiok.com         Dining Experience             Cafes, Bistros / Other Eateries         Hawker food         Wine & Beverages         Desserts & Titbits         Recipes         To Market, To Market         Coffee Shop Talk         Discounts, Offers, Credit Card Promos, Contests! & More!!     Travel         News and issues         Airlines         Hotels         Flight crew         Tips and advisories         Tourism in Singapore         Vacation stories         Deals to steal Play     Diva         News         love sos             Issues and views             Dating & Relationship tips             Marriages gone bad         parenthood             Motherhood             The Mummy Diaries         people watch             Celebrities talk         make me over             Contests and giveaways!             Latest beauty products to hit the shelves             Style Guide             Weddings             Health & wealth         Let's talk             Just Woman     Education         News         Schoops         Students, teachers & parents         Learning institutions         General     Helpdesk Powered by vBulletin® Version 3.8.6 SPH DIGITAL NEWS / ASIAONE GROUP / Copyright ©2014 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd .

The SEC and Justice Department had been investigating over several years whether some of JPMorgan’s hiring efforts involved bribes, in violation of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The SEC will receive US$130 million of the settlement, with US$72 million going to Justice and US$61.9 million to the US Federal Reserve, which penalised the bank “for unsafe and unsound practices.” JPMorgan did not admit or deny the charges. As part of its settlement with the Justice Department, a Hong Kong unit of the bank admitted to making quid pro quo hiring agreements with Chinese officials to win investment business. JPMorgan is the first major bank to settle a case over the hiring of “princelings,” as the offspring and other relatives of top Chinese officials are popularly known. In recent years, several other banks, including HSBC and Goldman Sachs, have said their hiring practices in Asia were under scrutiny by US authorities. The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it a crime to bribe overseas officials to win business, even if the payments are non-monetary. A JPMorgan spokesman said in an email: “The conduct was unacceptable.” The hiring programme was halted in 2013 and the bank took actions against those responsible, the spokesman said. Authorities said JPMorgan’s Asia unit created an elaborate programme, called “Sons and Daughters,” that allowed clients and influential government officials to recommend potential hires. Those candidates received preferential treatment, bypassing JPMorgan’s normal recruitment practices, the SEC said. Between 2006 and 2013, JPMorgan hired around 200 interns and full-term employees at the request of its Asia clients, as well as Chinese officials at state-owned companies. Those state-owned companies brought JPMorgan more than US$100 million in revenue, the SEC said. For example, in urging the hiring of one candidate, a JPMorgan banker said, “It will strengthen our relationship” with a client and solidify “our position as an advisor to him and the IPOs of his companies (expected to be >US$500mm in offering size,” according to SEC’s order. Quid pro quo business arrangements remain an entrenched part of business culture in China that is very hard to avoid, said Alex Bourelly, who leads the SEC enforcement practice at the law firm Baker Botts LLP.

More than resigned — most of Wall Street had consented to this fate. The banking industry channeled the bulk of its campaign donations into Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Among corporate titans more broadly, only one chief executive of an S&P 100 company — Emerson Electric’s David Farr — invested in Donald Turump’s presidential bid. This industry-wide shunning of Trump — combined with the candidate’s manifest unfitness for office and radically incoherent policy agenda — fed a common wisdom that the mogul’s election would be a pox on the market. And then the Republican nominee won. And Wall Street suddenly remembered that Trump had promised tax cuts and deregulation — and bankers love tax cuts and deregulation. Then the populist crusader — who had accused hedge-fund managers of “getting away with murder,” derided his opponent as a puppet of the big banks, and vowed to “drain the [D.C.] swamp” (that special interests had turned so fetid) — revealed that he and Wall Street have the same taste in economic managers. Per Politico: Former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin has been seen at Trump Tower amid rumors that he’s the leading candidate for Treasury secretary. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross appears headed to the Commerce Department. Steve Bannon, another Goldman alum, will work steps from the Oval Office. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon remains a possibility as Treasury secretary and will serve as an outside adviser if he doesn’t get the job. It’s a restoration of Wall Street power — and a potential flip in the way the industry is regulated — perhaps unparalleled in American history. “There is a joke going around here that if I’d have known how good Trump was going to be for Wall Street, I’d have campaigned for him,” one Goldman Sachs executive told the outlet. “What people are reacting to is this incredible cultural shift. People thought it might be 10 or 15 years until regulators stopped demanding heads and now all of a sudden you can envision it happening overnight.” The S&P 500’s financial companies saw their stocks jump 11 percent the week after the election. And it isn’t hard to see why. Trump’s advisers have already signaled that they will eliminate the Obama administration’s “fiduciary rule,” which requires financial advisers to put their clients’ interests ahead of their own (specifically, it bars advisers from dumping lousy products onto their clients, for the sake removing them from their own firms’ balance sheets). Trump’s team has also promised to repeal the vast majority of the post-crisis financial reforms passed through Dodd-Frank. Meanwhile, the president-elect is expected to deliver massive, supply-side tax cuts and deficit spending — a recipe for Keynesianism, country-club style, that’s likely to spur faster growth (in the short term), higher interest rates, and an even greater concentration of wealth in the hands of the few. Thus, Trump has done wonders for the economic anxiety of any banking executive who wasn’t sure that he (or she) could afford that new winter home or second yacht. And that giddy relief seems to have dispelled any worries they may have previously harbored about entrusting an emotionally volatile authoritarian with the most powerful army in human history. “There’s a good chance that the ‘craziness’ factor will be smaller and play a lesser role in driving outcomes than many had feared,” Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, wrote on LinkedIn this week. “Our very preliminary assessment is that on the economic front, the developments are broadly positive—the straws in the wind suggest that many of the people under consideration … probably won’t recklessly and stupidly drive the economy into a ditch.” Even if we bracket the concern that Trump will use state power to entrench a kleptocracy, there’s reason to think his economic plans will cause havoc in the long run. The argument for expansionary fiscal policy at a time of low inflation and low interest rates is strong — but the case for pursuing that policy primarily through tax cuts for the very wealthy is not. Trump’s plan will do little to shore up the bargaining power — and, thus, the purchasing power — of ordinary American workers. His deregulatory measures heighten the risk of further financial crisis. And his profligate deficit spending could eventually lead to higher borrowing costs — and will immediately strengthen calls for decimating social spending on the poor, the sick, and the elderly. And then, of course, Trump’s agenda has a high chance of ensuring the end of organized human life within a matter of centuries. But there’s an old Wall Street saying about the importance of living in the moment: “[By the time shit hits the fan] I’ll be gone and you’ll be gone.” (And so will the Medicaid expansion. And Bangladesh.)

Photo: AP Aruna Desai has a problem with the thousands of Indian rupees she has with her in the US — she cannot find a bank to exchange her funds and could not give the money away if she tried. Since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed 500 and 1,000 rupee notes (US$7.34 and US$14.67) from circulation, currency exchange providers in the US have been unable to take the outlawed bills. Some of the nation’s biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc, work with vendors to provide rupees to clients and those vendors have made the bills unavailable, spokesmen for the banks said. Wells Fargo & Co also said it cannot supply rupees at this time, while Bank of America Corp said it has never accepted the currency for exchange. “If you have a euro, you can go to a bank and exchange it,” Desai, 76, of Cliffside Park, New Jersey, said in a telephone interview. “For an Indian rupee, I don’t think there’s any bank that does that here.” The large rupee notes ceased to be legal tender on Wednesday last week, Modi said last week in a surprise announcement, sweeping away 86 percent of the total currency in circulation. The move has been seen as an attempt to fulfill his election promise of curbing tax evasion and recovering illegal income, locally known as black money, stashed overseas. The notes will have to be deposited in banks by the end of next month, Modi said. “For our clients, it’s very hard,” Nandita Chandra, head of Great Indian Travel Co’s New York office, said in a telephone interview while visiting New Delhi. “A lot of people are affected and we don’t have a culture that is credit-card friendly; it’s a cash-based economy.” Mastercard Inc, the second-largest payment network, heralded the move as one that will reduce crime and drive growth in the Indian economy. Modi’s “bold action and leadership is a critical step in positioning India to be a leader in the global cashless and digital economy movement,” Porush Singh, the firm’s president for South Asia, said in a statement. “Mastercard is committed to working with the government to provide the cashless solutions that combat corruption and create growth, and inclusion for all members of society.” Travelex Ltd, which operates more than 200 currency exchange stores in the US, said it is unable to accept the 500 and 1,000 rupee bills from customers because it cannot repatriate the cash in bulk under India’s current rules, said Lucie Smith, a spokeswoman for the London-based company. Western Union Co, the world’s largest money-transfer service, said for those locations facing a shortage of rupees, customers are able to receive checks or remittances to their bank accounts. “A lot of people are trying to give money to their friends to spend it, or else it will go to waste,” said Desai, who makes a yearly trip to India to work at a medical camp. If she cannot find a place to exchange or use the bills, she’ll “just have to throw it away,” Desai said. This story has been viewed 1276 times. Comments will be moderated.

New figures released show that foot traffic to branches is also down, with "branch banker interactions" down 22 percent from 2015. The figures come in the wake of a sales practice scandal that triggered multiple lawsuits, an enormous $185 million fine and the resignation of the company's longtime CEO John Stumpf.

DALLAS—When the children were released from the privately run immigration detention facility in Karnes City, Texas, they were immediately taken to the emergency room with pneumonia. Quotes in the article The GEO Group Inc GEO ▲ 30.23 +0.24 +0.80% Graham Holdings Co GHC ▲ 479.20 +1.75 +0.37% Homeland Security Corp HSCC ▲ 0.0199 +0.0021 +12.04% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 77.71 -0.31 -0.40% Over the past few months, several children who fled from violence in South and Central America with their mothers have been hospitalized after leaving the facility run by GEO Group, a private prison company that saw its stocks jump following Election Day. The children’s health problems were the result of poor medical care inside what is essentially a prison for mothers and their children, according to Amy Fischer of the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services. With Donald Trump now president-elect, the Karnes City facility and a dozen more like it across the country are preparing to fill even more beds with immigrants and refugees. GEO Group and another private prison company, Corrections Corporation of America, are also preparing for more large, lucrative contracts with the federal government to run the detention centers. Both companies saw their stock prices soar following Trump’s historic and shocking win. “If we see how the stocks skyrocketed, I think they see this as a huge opportunity for profit,” Fischer said of the two companies. Of the 1,000 largest companies in the country, Forbes reported the day after Trump’s victory, “the biggest winner of the election was Corrections Corporation of America.” CCA’s stock shot up 49 percent that day thanks to Trump’s promise to enact mass deportations as president. GEO’s stock rose 21 percent the same day. But it isn’t just the two companies who have an interest in detaining more immigrants. A report released Thursday shows that some of the country’s largest banks profit off fees and interest payments from the two companies—both of which rely on such debt financing for their daily operations. The report (PDF), compiled by In the Public Interest, which describes itself as a “comprehensive research and policy center,” shows the two companies have nearly $2 billion in debt each from lenders including JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America. Without them, GEO Group and CCA would have difficulty operating, according to the report. In the Public Interest calls for the banks to immediately halt debt financing to GEO Group and CCA. If the banks did so, the “companies will be forced to find other sources of funds, which would significantly reduce their operations and growth.” Some of those operations include significant donations to Republican lawmakers in Congress, many of whom have harsh stances on crime and immigration, according to Fischer. “You can trace their campaign contributions to some of the most aggressive anti-immigrant politicians both at the state and federal level,” Fischer said. Those contributions are in addition to the millions both companies spent on lobbying politicians between 2004 and 2014, according to a 2015 report from the liberal Center for American Progress. For its part, CCA says it makes a point not to lobby for specific criminal justice laws. “It is CoreCivic’s longstanding policy not to draft, lobby for, promote or in any way take a position on proposals, policies or legislation that determine the basis or duration of an individual’s incarceration or detention,” CCA spokesman Jonathan Burns told International Business Times this week. On top of helping to fund its daily operations, large loans from banks have helped GEO Group and CCA to purchase smaller corrections companies, the report notes, allowing them to become the two largest private prison companies in the country. Under Trump, they may have the opportunity to grow even larger. In June the president-elect told MSNBC’s Chris Matthews that privatization of prisons “seems to work a lot better.” The comment came two months before the Department of Justice, citing security problems and poor conditions at private prisons nationwide, said it would phase out the use of private companies to run federal penal institutions. Whether Trump still believes private prisons are superior to those run by the government is unknown, but GEO Group and CCA have the president-elect’s comments on immigration to lift their spirits—and, possibly, their bottom line.© Photo Illustration by Kelly Caminero/The Daily Beast private prison boom for Trump immigration plan In a 60 Minutes interview on Sunday, Trump pledged to deport between 2 and 3 million immigrants, making it a priority to remove those with criminal records. Whether there even are that many who fall into that category is a matter of debate, to put it charitably. If there are that many criminal illegal aliens, Trump would have to make good on his campaign promise of creating a “deportation force” to remove them—a promise House Speaker Paul Ryan assured the American public last week was only lip service. Illegal immigrants with criminal records are an easy target for deportation, but the immigration plan on Trump’s website makes no distinction for men, women, and children fleeing violent countries like El Salvador, where some 4,000 people had been murdered by October, according to The Washington Post. “Anyone who crosses the border illegally will be detained until they are removed out of our country,” Trump’s official immigration policy statement reads. Whether Trump intends to kick out the tens of thousands of refugees fleeing South and Central American violence remains to be seen, but what is clear is that GEO Group and CCA see Trump’s win as a boon for business. “As you know, the need for new infrastructure has been frequently discussed during this election season,” CCA Vice President of Finance Brian Hammonds said in a November call with investors just before the election. “And (CCA) is positioned to assist government organizations in making investments to modernize their mission-critical criminal justice infrastructure, while allowing them to maintain their borrowing capacity to address other capital needs.” In layman’s terms, “we’re about to get paid.” The call came after U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement renewed a contract with CCA in October to operate the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, a $1 billion dollar deal that runs through 2020. Prior to the contract renewal, the company’s future was grim—stock prices dove following the August Justice Department decree that called for the end of private companies running federal prisons. Partly in response, CCA changed its name to CoreCivic and, in the November call with investors, Hammond said the rebranding was part of an effort to change the company into a “diversified government solutions provider.” The name change had nothing to do with problems at CCA-run facilities, like the deadly 2015 gang fight at an Oklahoma prison that left four men dead, Hammonds said. “Despite poorly sourced claims from industry critics and activists to the contrary, our continued focus on operational excellence, flexibility, and our compelling value proposition have continued to create opportunities for the company to grow where our partners need and want solutions that we can deliver,” Hammonds said during the call. Except Trump’s pledge that may be difficult to meet, a brief look at federal data shows. It has taken President Obama six years to deport 2.5 million people, according to a 2015 Department of Homeland Security report. Last year, DHS, ICE, and Customs and Border Patrol deported less than 1 million people combined. More than 30,000 of those men, women, and children were from South and Central America, according to the report, and at least 40,000 more such refugees are currently being held in private detention centers like the ones in Karnes City and Dilley, Fischer said. That number is expected to increase, as the renewed contract for the Dilley facility indicates. Along with an expected increase in detentions will come a greater burden on an already overworked system in which “credible fear” interviews are held. There, DHS hears arguments from refugees who say a return to their home country would put them at risk of injury or death. “Unfortunately, there’s no right to counsel in these proceedings, so what we do is prep the mothers as much as we can ahead of these interviews,” Fischer said. In Karnes City, a family facility that holds mostly mothers and their children, Fischer and other advocates have a high success rate—roughly 90 percent of refugees there are granted the right to stay in the United States and eventually seek citizenship. In official terms, their fear is credible. Now, they have a new fear: President Trump. “I think the immigrant community is right to be very scared,” Fischer said. “At the same time, it’s an expansive system and I don’t think Trump has really thought through the intricacies of what it would take to deport the amount of people he has mentioned.” If Trump’s words are to be trusted, no one currently in a detention facility or caught crossing the border illegally after Jan. 20 will have the opportunity to prove they have a credible fear of returning to their home country. “As we look forward to a Trump presidency we expect this to only be more aggressive,” Fischer said.

If she can’t find a place to exchange or use the bills, she’ll “just have to throw it away.” Bloomberg Jenny SuraneSonali Basak Topics: DemonetisationUS BanksRupee ExchangesBlack MoneyRs500 Notes More from this Section Our wealth manager made us disciplined about savings You don’t need to invest in 10 different funds to build a good mutual fund portfolio Know when to say ‘no’ What not to do with your financial investments in the time of need NPS is waiting for pension managers Editor's Picks Demonetisation: Income tax department notices to those depositing huge cash Arun Jaitley pitches for latest technology in farm sector, hints at incentive review Oil may rise to $55 if all producers cooperate: Iran Modi’s demonetisation drive may damage Arvind Kejriwal the most Demonetisation has achieved 50% of objective: Subramanian Swamy First Published: Sat, Nov 19 2016. 09 36 AM IST Read more from Livemint Our wealth manager made us disciplined about savings You don’t need to invest in 10 different funds to build a good mutual fund portfolio Know when to say ‘no’ Editor's Picks Demonetisation: Income tax department notices to those depositing huge cash Arun Jaitley pitches for latest technology in farm sector, hints at incentive review Oil may rise to $55 if all producers cooperate: Iran Latest News Our wealth manager made us disciplined about savings You don’t need to invest in 10 different funds to build a good mutual fund portfolio Know when to say ‘no’ What not to do with your financial investments in the time of need NPS is waiting for pension managers Mint On Sunday The dilemma of Draupadī’s disrobing The prodigals return to Neroca US elections: How slogans can make or break a candidate Now, the crowd can bankroll your research How to maximize judicial time Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2016 HT Media Ltd.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Nov 18, 2016 at 7:09PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. The good news keeps rolling in for banks. On Thursday, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, told Congress that an interest rate hike "could well become appropriate relatively soon." Interest rates are the single most important variable for investors in bank stocks to watch right now. It's why I've talked ad nauseam about the issue for much of the past year, as the most widely held bank stocks -- JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) -- all stand to profit handsomely once rates increase in earnest. Indeed, the most likely reason to explain why all four of these stocks climbed on Thursday was Yellen's testimony. Bank Thursday (11/17) Stock Performance JPMorgan Chase 0.65% Bank of America 1.64% Wells Fargo 1.72% Citigroup 1.71% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Three reasons Yellen is optimistic Yellen focused on three specific things in her remarks to Congress, the first being the rosy jobs picture. The unemployment rate stayed at 4.9% in October, which continues to be below the Fed's definition of maximum employment, defined as an unemployment rate of 5%. The Fed chairwoman noted that the rate of jobs growth continues to be "above trend" and that the labor force participation rate has remained constant despite headwinds from an aging population -- which, holding all else equal, causes labor force participation to fall as retirees exit the workforce. But the best sign on the employment front in the United States right now relates to jobless claims. The latest data, released Thursday, shows that the number of Americans applying for first-time unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest level in more than four decades. You have to go back to 1973 to see a comparable level. Data source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Chart by author. Yellen also found economic growth data to be a positive sign. Although output grew at just 1% for the first six months of 2016, it's estimated to have nearly tripled to just under 3% in the third quarter. It did so in spite of the ongoing concerns about the integrity of the European Union and moderating growth in China. Last but not least, the one area that monetary policymakers continue to watch for improvement is inflation. And while the most recent data shows that inflation remains below the Fed's 2% target rate -- it came in at 1.6% in October -- the trend in consumer prices is heading in the right direction as well. Data source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Chart by author. This is the variable, in turn, that investors in JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup should watch most closely. The higher inflation goes, the more likely the Fed is to raise rates and thereby boost the amount of money that each of these banks earns from their multibillion-dollar portfolios of loans and securities. On the low end, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase will earn between $2 billion and $3 billion in added net interest income each year from a 1-percentage-point increase in rates. On the high end, Bank of America's net interest income would climb by $5.3 billion under the same scenario. (Wells Fargo's disclosures around interest rate sensitivity are less specific.) With this in mind, Yellen's comments about a possible rate hike coming soon should be music to bank investors' ears. According to the Fed chief, at the latest meeting of the committee in charge of monetary policy, its members "judged that the case for an increase in the target range had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon."

The department proposed so-called Qualified Professional Asset Manager waivers to JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Barclays Plc and UBS Group AG, according to a Federal Register document reviewed by Bloomberg News. A one-year waiver will take effect on Monday. The Labor Department also proposed granting the banks five-year waivers, which would become effective after a 45-day comment period, just before the Trump administration is to take over the government on Jan. 20. “We take the ongoing process very seriously and firmly believe that the information we have provided to the Department of Labor supports the granting of a continuing exemption to allow us to serve our U.S. pension plan clients without disruption to them,” Peter Stack, a spokesman for UBS, said by e-mail. Representatives of the other banks declined to comment. A Labor Department spokesman didn’t respond to an inquiry. Retirement Plans The business activity covered by the waivers includes 401(k) plans and corporate pensions, among other retirement plans. Any institution or individual that manages pensions overseen by the Labor Department must seek permission to continue those operations after certain criminal convictions. The five banks were found guilty of violations that included interest-rate or currency manipulation. Regulatory waivers have become politically fraught over the last two years, with lawmakers including Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, pressing the Labor Department, which oversees about $8 trillion in private-sector pensions, for tougher reviews of banks accused of crimes before clearing them to continue their pension-management businesses. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which issues its own waivers for certain securities activities, isn’t inclined to use the process as an additional enforcement tool, SEC Chair Mary Jo White said last year.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 19 November 2016 Choppy market, challenging returns by manokaran mottain MALAYSIANS consumers have been pinched as sentiments on the ground feel that income increases do not correspond with the rising cost of living. Since the middle of 2014, the government has been reducing the subsidy bill, from 18.1% of operating expenditure in 2014 to an estimated 10.4% in Budget 2017, in an effort to shrink its fiscal deficit. Consequently, the latest third quarter Malaysian consumer sentiments index tracked by the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research fell to 73.6 after a brief rebound to 78.5 during the previous quarter; the index level below 100 point suggests bearish consumer outlook. As a result, consumers appear to be more prudent with their expenditure. From the latest third quarter gross domestic product (GDP) release, private consumption growth slowed to 0.2% on quarter-on-quarter basis, down from 0.7% quarter-on-quarter expansion registered during the second quarter. Against current external and domestic macro tantrums, how should households adapt and preserve their hard earned savings and capital? According to Bank Negara, in 2015, aggregate household financial assets grew by RM97.9bil to RM2.1 trillion. Bank Negara remains confident of household balance sheet resilience as household financial asset to household debt ratio remained above two times in the past five years. Deposit instruments form the largest component of household financial assets at 43%. In the past five years, inflation rate averaged 2.4% per annum while inflation-adjusted median household income growth expanded 9.1% per annum between 2012 and 2014. Although a top down view of these statistics could indicate resilience in household consumption, the state of household balance sheet would determine the middle and longer time domestic demand outlook. At the microeconomic level, household savings are essential for children’s education, retirement plans and general well-being of living standards. > Defensive play in domestic market A fundamental investment strategy is to hold a diverse portfolio of assets that generate decent return that corresponds with the investor’s appetite for volatility. During times of choppy markets and uneven global macro conditions, investors still adopting a top down approach in asset selections should give due consideration of their strategy. The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index return has contracted 3.7% since the beginning of the year until mid-November on the back of challenging domestic business conditions and dampened international financial market appetite. Meanwhile, the JPMorgan Asian Dollar Index which tracks Asian currency exchange rates against the US dollar, have been volatile and depreciated 2.2% between the start of the year and mid-November. Headwinds in global macroeconomic conditions following the uncertainty of the Brexit fallout and the surprise win of Republican candidate Donald Trump for the US Presidency against the market favoured Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton have been negative developments for the emerging markets. With clouded visibility of uptick in fundamental macro of domestic demand and private investment appetite – in most of the economies around the world – households with appetite for exposure in equities would have to tread carefully depending on the region and the supporting macro factors. On the other hand, investments into Malaysian sovereign bond registered pocket of positive returns this year. Listed in Bursa Malaysia is a fixed income Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that provides exposure to Malaysian government bonds. Since the beginning of the year, the ETF would have generated an annualised return of around 8.1% at its peak in early October. Therefore, this shows that it is essential to identify macro trends and allocate portfolio holdings accordingly. This dull asset class of fixed income managed to outperform the domestic equity index this year. On the other hand, the government has been pushing for a retail presence in the domestic debt market, including the Islamic bond sukuk market. The Securities Commission has developed a framework for retail bonds and sukuk in its Capital Market Masterplan 2 for selected issuers to sell debts either through the Bursa exchange or over-the-counter via appointed banks. This allows greater participation for investors with direct access in trading bonds and sukuk, instead of relying on unit trust funds for fixed income exposures. > Don’t forget to save and invest However, at the end of the day, households with heightened risk aversion might decide to be cash position dominant. While this would protect and preserve capital, keep in mind of the savings gap shortfall in the years to come. For some, plans for retirement and children’s tuition fees could still be a decade away. However, the power of compounding interests matters in the long run. Therefore, households should periodically review their financial asset holdings to align it with respective financial goals even more so in this climate of global macro and market uncertainties. A defensive play could be a wise idea at the immediate term at least. While investment strategies are important and likely more relevant to the middle and high income households, for the majority of Malaysians especially the bottom 40% households, the fundamental issue remains the level of income. Although bottom 40% household median real income growth is estimated to have expanded 14.9% per annum between 2012 and 2014, growing at a much faster pace than the 5.9% per annum expansion among the top 20% households, ultimately, standard of living depends on the level of income per se. According to the Department of Statistics’ Salaries and Wages Survey Report 2015, the national median monthly salary is RM1,600. From the Household Income survey 2014, the median monthly household income of the bottom 40% household was RM2,629, compared to the income of RM11,610 of the top 20% household. With an average household size of 4.3 person per household, after deducting household expenses of food, fuel, medical fees, education costs, it begs to ponder if there are any substantial left over savings for an average household to save and invest for the lower income group? The situation looks equally worrying from the Employees Provident Fund’s (EPF) perspective. In October, EPF raised the savings threshold to ‘have a good life’ upon retirement to RM228,000, up from RM196,800 previously as Malaysia becomes an ageing population as soon as 2030. Unfortunately, EPF guided that some 78% of employees aged 54 and above have EPF savings well below the threshold. In fact in 2014, active EPF members between the 51 and 55 age group had on average RM159,952 in savings each. In light of low saving thresholds as well as early withdrawals by EPF members, a new scheme introduced as a second retirement savings account, Akaun Emas will be effective in January 2017. The EPF contributions for employees working after the age of 55 will be automatically deposited in the special account and the monies only allowed to be withdrawn when they reach age 60. While this initiative is a constructive measure to enforce a savings fund for employees’ retirement after 60, would it be adequate for comfortable retirement given estimated remaining life expectancy of 18.5 years for men and 20.9 years for women at 60 years of age? >Income growth and investment returns – left wanting for more Therefore, from a policy making point of view, there is a need for a two pronged approach for the wellbeing of our households in the long run – opportunities to boost income growth and avenues for investment returns. Nevertheless, expectations much be managed well as the burden should not directly fall on the shoulders of the fiscal policy. Government should be an enabler and leave the mechanics to the free and fair market. For investment platforms, there are already existing platforms such as Amanah Saham National and also the much encouraged Private Retirement Scheme for Malaysians to partake in the risks and returns opportunities from the market. For now, consumer awareness on regulated financial investment products could be promoted to encourage wider adoption of financial planning for the future. Looking ahead, market and macro volatility could very well remain heightened going into 2017. Cutting through the noise and chatter, the performance of gold price remains elevated since the beginning of the year, which have risen 15.5% until mid-November – after a two year annual decline since the last peak in early October 2012 – is a strong indication of safe haven shelter sentiments. Have gold price peaked, or would it continue to make gains? The market will tell in time. A resilient domestic demand supported by a rebound in international trade activities, pro-growth economic policies from the major economies such as US and UK and economic stability in China would be a very optimistic outlook to anticipate in 2017. Until then, households should continue to stay defensive, be prudent with expenditures and ready to seize opportunities in the market.

Wayne Munroe  told Tribune Business: “If I were a web shop owner, that would make me upset and, as a group, they could probably look at establishing a credit union and then insist that if you want to do business, you do business with the credit union. “If it worked in conjunction, or was side by side with their premises, it would have a very strong presence in the Family Islands and could, in fact, potentially put the banks out of business [there]. The banks bank with everyone other than the web shop owners.”     Mr Munroe has suggested in the past that Bahamian web shop operators could sue Canadian-owned commercial banks for discrimination over their refusal to accept deposits from the sector. The banks, though, argue that their worldwide policies prevent them from accepting gaming-related deposits, especially the online variety. CIBC FirstCaribbean, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Scotiabank are all adopting this stance, with an RBC (Bahamas) position paper warning that conducting business with web shops would run afoul of its parent bank’s global policies and US federal law. Two Bahamian-owned institutions, Commonwealth Bank and Fidelity Bank (Bahamas), are also refusing to deal with the web shop gaming industry, viewing it as too ‘high risk’. Such fears will have been heightened in an environment where Bahamian institutions, and their counterparts in the Caribbean, are struggling to maintain correspondent relations with developed country banks due to risk-related concerns. Accepting web shop deposits could be just the excuse a correspondent needs to terminate business. Bank of the Bahamas is the only institution to state publicly that it is doing business with web shops, having received clearance from its own US correspondent bank, JP Morgan Chase, to accept deposits from the newly-legalised sector.     “A license they could very readily get is a co-operative credit union license because they have a large number of staff across all of them, and participants,” Mr Munroe added of the web shops. “If I were them it would upset me how the banks discriminate against me, and my mission would be to put as many of them out of business through an alternative financial institution; that’s one option.” Setting up their own commercial bank is one option that has been mulled by the web shop industry, especially given the large financial sums it recycles. FML Group of Companies chief, Craig Flowers, has previously gone public with such a suggestion, and has long had a personal interest in banking, at one point eyeying whether to buy a Turks & Caicos bank that was in liquidation. However, one obstacle to web shop banking ambitions may be obtaining the necessary licences from the Central Bank of the Bahamas. And they may face the same difficulties going the credit union route, as the regulator is the same. However, Mr Munroe argued:“If I am given a license to do something and then the banks refuse to accept my money and I have to get money in the system, you basically force me to launder money. “We have a  legalised, regulated gaming industry, yet the banks say that they will accept deposits from web shop employees, which are generated in a web shop, and deposits from third party vendors. But all except the Bank of the Bahamas say that they will not hold established accounts for the web shop operators and that makes no sense whatsoever, especially since they bank with casinos.”     Mr Munroe acknowledged that the banks do not do online gaming banking for the casinos. “There is a good reason for that, which is - unlike the web shops who have to see their customers who do business in Bahamian dollars, which isn’t convertible currency - the casinos set up accounts online and do business in convertible currency,” he explained. “If you say it’s too much of a risk to do business with web shop owners, it makes no sense  because  before they got a license they had to disclose the past 20 years of their financial affairs. It’s very easy to establish with the Gaming Board what they say their existing circumstances are.” Web shops are already competing with the banks, given that they have in the past offered loans. They are also in the money transmission business, with clients able to pick up money from their account on any Bahamian island. One of the Government’s principal aims in legalising, regulating and taxing the web shops was to pull the industry into the formal economy and commercial banking system, thereby eliminating any regulatory risk to the Bahamas’ reputation.

These numbers criminals were only just made legitimate by way of a corrupt government. The whole entire world knows this. ALL of their stashed money is from proceeds of crime.

This money and the 10's of thousands of pieces of property they bought with this money should have been confiscated by government long ago. These guys are criminals and should be treated as such.

Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends in early 2018, reiterated the Fed’s political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress’ Joint Economic Committee. Economic data since Fed policymakers gathered in early November reinforced her view that the economy is making progress toward the Fed’s goals on employment and inflation. She said that at the meeting, she and her colleagues believed that the case for a rate increase “had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon.” Analysts viewed Yellen’s comments as an effort to put financial markets on notice that a rate hike is likely to occur at the Fed’s last meeting of the year on Dec. 13-14. They noted that she dismissed a suggestion that increased market uncertainty after Trump’s election might be cause for a delay. Asked whether it might be better to push back a move until January, Yellen said that uncertainty surrounding Trump’s proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending could well last for a good deal longer than one month. “Yellen’s testimony before Congress ... further cemented in place expectations that the Fed will hike rates next month,” said Michael Feroli, senior economist at JPMorgan. Asked about her own future, Yellen said it was “fully my intention” to remain as Fed chair until her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018. She said she could not imagine any circumstance that would cause her to leave early, addressing speculation that she might step down once Trump takes office, given his critical comments of her during the election campaign. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 and projected that it could raise rates as many as four times in 2016. But it deferred as the U.S. economy went through a prolonged soft-patch. The rate has remained in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent for the entire year. The rate had been at a record low near zero for seven years. Economists are forecasting that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter-point in December and then will boost rates two more times in 2017. Yellen stressed in her testimony that the slow recovery and absence of inflation pressures should allow the Fed to move gradually in raising its key rate, the federal funds rate. “Gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years,” Yellen said, referring to the point where the funds rate is neither promoting economic growth nor slowing growth. As measured by the gross domestic product, the economy grew at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, the government has estimated, more than twice the rate in the April-June quarter. The unemployment rate is 4.9 percent, around the level typical of a healthy economy, down from 10 percent in 2009. In addition to firmly stating that she has no plans of leaving the Fed before her term as chair is complete, Yellen also made clear that her views on bank regulation differ from Trump’s. Yellen gave a strong defense of the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress in 2010 to increase financial market regulations in an effort to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. After the country lived through a “devastating financial crisis,” Yellen said that “I would not want to see the clock turned back on all the improvements we have made.” Trump and other Republicans have attacked Yellen and other federal bank regulators for imposing too-restrictive rules on banks, pledging that they will seek to repeal major parts of the 2010 law. ——— This story has been corrected to show that Yellen’s term ends Feb. 3, 2018, not January 2018.     Tags: yellen, rates, percent, economy, financial, trump, Other stories from today: Facebook buys Pittsburgh-based facial analysis software firm Wells Fargo sees significant slowdown in account openings Google hits Pixel resellers with ’digital death sentence’     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   If you are traveling for Thanksgiving, when is the best time to go?

Updated List Of Everything We Know So Far By Julia Glum @superjulia On 11/18/16 AT 9:56 AM Close One of the first orders of business for any newly chosen American president is to figure out his or her cabinet, the group of high-level officials who direct policy in major areas of the government. Much like the run-up to the election, President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet selection has been widely covered and dominated by rumors.  Nearly every famous Republican's name has come up in connection with a cabinet position in the past week. To help you keep it all straight, here's a list of what we know for sure about the Trump White House.  This story will be continually updated as news of the cabinet nominees breaks.  Chief of Staff: Officially chosen. The appointment of Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus was confirmed by Trump's transition team Sunday. National Security Adviser: Officially chosen. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn has been offered the post, the Trump transition team confirmed Friday. Secretary of State: Not chosen. Candidates include former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former ambassador John Bolton and Tennessee Sen.

Tom Cotton, former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, Politico reported. Attorney General: Officially chosen. Alabama Sen.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Nov 18, 2016 at 9:29AM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. If you're thinking about buying bank stocks, or any kind of stocks for that matter, few things are more important than profitability. To make things easy, here's a list of the 10 most profitable big banks in America. Name Net Income (TTM*) (Millions) Return on Assets (TTM) Return on Equity (TTM) U.S. Bancorp $5,886 1.36% 14.26% Wells Fargo $22,239 1.21% 12.78% Fifth Third Bancorp $1,832 1.29% 12.24% Northern Trust $999 0.84% 11.78% Commerce Bancshares $268 1.09% 11.61% State Street $2,126 0.85% 11.33% JPMorgan Chase $23,440 0.96% 10.47% Cullen/Frost Bankers $279 0.97% 9.70% Bank of New York Mellon $3,370 0.89% 9.40% Huntington Bancshares $651 0.84% 9.40% *TTM: trailing 12 months. Data source: YCharts.com. There are a few points to note here. First, these banks are all members of the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen of the nation's biggest banks, ranging from Commerce Bancshares, which has $25 billion in assets on its balance sheet, up to JPMorgan Chase, which has a $2.5 trillion balance sheet. Second, at least in the context of investing, profitability doesn't just mean how much a bank earns. If that were the case, then the biggest banks on any list would almost invariably also be the most profitable. Given this, it's important to look beyond a bank's earnings to determine how profitable it is on a relative basis. That's why the above list isn't sorted by net income, but instead by return on equity. This places U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) at the top despite the fact that they're aren't the three biggest banks on the KBW Bank Index. Return on equity is calculated by dividing a bank's net income by its shareholders' equity. In this way, it shows how much profit a bank earns from every dollars' worth of equity. In U.S. Bancorp's case, it's earned $0.14 from every dollar in equity over the last 12 months. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo has earned $0.13 from each dollar and Fifth Third Bancorp is at $0.12 per equity dollar. This makes it easy to determine how effective, say, U.S. Bancorp's management is relative to Wells Fargo's, even though Wells Fargo is roughly four times larger than U.S. Bancorp. And the same is true for Fifth Third Bancorp, which is less than a tenth of Wells Fargo's size. The final metric that's worth considering when you're assessing a bank's profitability is return on assets. Because banks are so heavily leveraged, typically by a factor of 10 to 1, it can be hard to tease out whether one bank earns more than another simply because it uses more leverage. The way to tell whether this is the case is to look at return on assets, which is calculated by dividing a bank's earnings by its total assets, as opposed to its shareholders' equity. It may go without saying, as you can see in the table, but there's bound to be overlap between these two profitability figures. In this case, regardless of whether we look at return on equity or return on assets, U.S. Bancorp, Wells Fargo, and Fifth Third Bancorp remain at the top of the list. The only difference is that, excluding leverage, Fifth Third outperforms Wells Fargo. The lesson here for investors is twofold. First, profitability should be a primary consideration when picking bank stocks. And second, that profitability is about more than just profits and is dependent, in no small part, on how you measure it. John Maxfield owns shares of US Bancorp and Wells Fargo.

By adding its voice this week to the long list of institutions pressing Germany to spend more, the European Commission left Berlin looking more isolated and out-of-step than at any time since the outbreak of the global financial crisis nearly a decade ago. Predictably, the Commission's call for a "significantly more positive fiscal stance" in the euro area was shot down by Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and the conservative media establishment in Germany. On Friday, Schaeuble accused the Commission of overstepping its mandate and urged it to focus its energies on enforcing the EU's fiscal rules. But by this time next year, the episode may be looked back upon as the first step towards a broader change in Europe's economic approach, away from the austerity-first stance pushed successfully by Berlin for many years. This could be fuelled by a range of factors: the pressures arising from Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. election and the arrival of new governments in France and Germany in 2017. "We expect that the German position will gradually lose influence," Marco Protopapa of JPMorgan said this week. Trump's win is especially significant. On the one hand, it is likely to increase pressure on Germany to spend more public money on defence and security. On the other, it sends a powerful signal to the German political establishment about the dangers of ignoring an increasingly frustrated underclass, buffeted by the forces of globalisation, that has shown a readiness to vent its anger at the ballot box. GRAND BARGAIN The looming French election will be crucial. Centre-right frontrunner Alain Juppe, and his top conservative rivals Francois Fillon and Nicolas Sarkozy, are all promising radical economic reform if they are elected in May of next year. That could open the door to the sort of "grand bargain", or reforms-for-stimulus compromise between France and Germany, that has been talked about for years but was impossible with a weak, unpopular Francois Hollande in the Elysee and the French economy languishing. "We are very much in the grand bargain game," an adviser to Juppe told Reuters. The real game changer could be the German election in the autumn of next year and the fate of Schaeuble, the personification of Germany's rule-based restrictive approach to fiscal policy. The most likely outcome of that vote looks like another "grand coalition" between Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). Schaeuble, 74, has already said that he plans to run for a seat in the Bundestag again, a signal to many that he would like to continue to play an important role in the next cabinet. But the SPD, which would probably have first choice of ministries in such a constellation, could claim the finance ministry this time around, as they did in 2005 in Merkel's first term. That would push Schaeuble into another ministry, blunting his role as a guardian of fiscal rectitude. One senior official who served in both grand coalitions said the lessons of the past years would push Merkel's next coalition partner to take the finance ministry instead of the foreign ministry, the traditional first choice. "Regardless of who that partner is, everyone has understood that the finance ministry has a great deal more value than the foreign ministry," the official said. FROM WITHIN Christian Odendahl, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform, said the European Commission's call for more spending was unlikely to sway Germany. "The change needs to come from within," he said. But Odendahl does believe that a more vigorous debate is developing within Germany over the wisdom of Schaeuble's "Schwarze Null", or balanced budget, policies. A poll for public broadcaster ARD in September showed that 58 percent of Germans favoured spending additional tax revenues on infrastructure investments, compared with 22 percent who prefer debt reduction and 16 percent who want tax cuts. "If you had a different finance minister or if the political case for a topic-based fiscal expansion grew, then you could see a shift," he said, citing the messages from Trump's election. "Merkel is far too pragmatic and political to make the Schwarze Null a priority when there are other problems to address." A more expansive German fiscal policy after the election may help pave the way for a tightening of monetary policy, a step Schaeuble himself has called for. The European Central Bank (ECB), which meets next month to decide on whether to extend its quantitative easing (QE), or bond-buying programme, has been looking for ways out of its ultra-loose stance. It too has called on Germany to grab the stimulus baton. Marcel Fratzscher, who runs the Berlin-based DIW economic institute and is a former senior official at the ECB, says the pressure is building on Berlin to shift its stance. His worry is that the ruling parties may end up wasting the fiscal wiggle room they have by making lavish promises to pensioners in the coming election campaign. "I think there will be a further shift, even if Schaeuble stays. If the United States ratchets up spending and this is successful then it would be a signal," he said. "My worry is that it could come too late, that the government will have used its fiscal space for pension increases and tax reductions."

Congressman with Ties to Trump to play key role on bank rules His staff is known for saying he’s no friend of mega-banks Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mail With some in the finance industry salivating over the prospect of deregulation under Donald Trump, a key power broker is emerging who might bring headaches for Wall Street. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling has already been rumored as a potential Treasury Secretary under Trump and he’s got a plan at his fingertips for ripping up and replacing the Dodd-Frank Act. The Texas congressman -- who met with the president-elect at Trump Tower Thursday -- has said he’s been in constant discussion with Trump’s transition team about his proposed legislation, which many lobbyists expect to be the starting point for rewriting bank rules in a Republican-controlled government. Hensarling at Trump Tower on Nov. 17. Photographer: Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AFP/Getty Images What Trump Might Mean for Wall Street Reform Law: Quicktake Q&A There are a lot of things Wall Street likes in Hensarling’s bill. It scraps the Volcker Rule ban on lenders making speculative market bets with their own capital. It reins in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has boosted oversight of everything from mortgage lending to credit cards. It eliminates a Dodd-Frank provision that set limits on how much banks can charge retailers when merchants accept debit cards. Asset managers and insurers in particular like his plans to overhaul the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a collection of regulators with authority to impose punitive rules on companies by labeling them systemically important financial institutions. But passing Hensarling’s bill wouldn’t necessarily free large banks from the handcuffs Washington put on them after the financial crisis, unless lenders want to take the unappealing step of raising hundreds of billions of dollars in new capital. The Republican also has a strong populist streak, has been perceived by Wall Street as unyielding on policy positions and almost always colors his criticism of Dodd-Frank as a failed attempt to do away with too-big-to-fail banks. That mirrors the message that Trump himself championed during his campaign when he called for breaking up the biggest banks and reining in Wall Street’s influence in politics. Such views can’t bring comfort to the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. “Wall Street has long believed Hensarling is their obstacle to getting reasonable compromise,” said Mark Calabria, a financial regulation expert at the Cato Institute think tank. “There’s a perception that he’s an ideologue who won’t compromise. When bankers go into meet with him, they feel like they are getting a lecture.” After meeting with Trump Thursday, Hensarling told reporters in New York that he is very excited to help the incoming president “drain the swamp” in Washington and get the economy “working for Americans again.” While Hensarling has a great position leading the financial services panel, he said he would certainly consider a different role if Trump asks. Guiding Policy Lobbyists and their clients rely on the fact that when a bill is introduced, they will get ample opportunity to promote the aspects of it they like and attack the elements they don’t. But bankers can’t assume they will have an open dialogue with Hensarling or that he’s even that interested in hearing from them at all. For instance, before unveiling the full text of his bill to replace Dodd-Frank in June, his office summoned more than two dozen lobbyists to a private gathering on Capitol Hill to lay out some rules of engagement, according to attendees. Hensarling’s staff scheduled the meeting after lobbyists complained they weren’t being consulted on legislation that would have huge implications for financial firms. Hensarling quickly got to the point: He indicated he didn’t care whether the industry supported everything in his bill, because he was going to introduce it regardless. The lawmaker then left to catch a plane. Hensarling’s staff took over the discussion, explaining that they only planned to meet with trade groups to get feedback, rather than engaging with representatives from individual firms. Specific companies were told, though, that they could send letters on the legislation to Hensarling’s office, said the attendees who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. A spokeswoman for Hensarling declined to comment on the meeting. Frosty Relationship The gathering served as a stark reminder of the frosty relationship Hensarling sometimes has with New York mega-banks, some of the attendees said. His staff often boasts he’s not a friend of Wall Street and doesn’t seek their buy-in on policy, people familiar with the comments say. But after Trump’s surprise win and Republicans keeping control of Congress, banks know Hensarling will play a key role in determining whether the industry accomplishes its top goals on Capitol Hill. That’s true whether he joins the new president’s cabinet or continues to lead the main House panel that deals with oversight of banks and their regulators. Hensarling said this week that his staff is working to update his bill. Legislation on financial rules will likely be handled in the Senate by Mike Crapo, who’s expected to be the new chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. Crapo, an Idaho Republican, has previously supported a variety of measures to alter Dodd-Frank. The House Financial Services Committee is “interested in working on a 2.0 version,” Hensarling said of his bill Wednesday at the Exchequer Club in Washington. “Advice and counsel is welcome.” Hensarling has more connections than most lawmakers to the Washington-neophyte Trump. He’s a close confidant of Vice President-elect Mike Pence, even appearing with him on campaign stops over the past few months. A longtime staffer on Hensarling’s committee is helping to shape financial services policy for the Trump transition team. Other aides to Hensarling are working with or connected to Trump’s inner circle, including the lawmaker’s staff director, who is married to Trump’s top lawyer. Dismantling Dodd-Frank While Trump’s transition team put out a statement last week pledging to dismantle Dodd-Frank, it hasn’t laid out a plan on what it would do instead. That leaves a void that Hensarling’s Financial Choice Act could fill. Still, few lobbyists anticipate a total repeal of Dodd-Frank, which banks have spent years and millions of dollars complying with. Because of filibuster rules, Congress probably can’t pass legislation without the votes of at least some Democrats in the Senate. That means changes will be easier to negotiate than a total overhaul. During his Wednesday speech, Hensarling acknowledged the hurdles posed by Senate procedures and said he’s prepared to work with Democrats on a compromise. A key plank of his Choice Act is that it frees banks from a litany of rules if they boost their leverage ratios -- a figure meant to show how safe a lender is by measuring the amount of equity capital it has in relation to total assets. In theory, the higher the ratio, the bigger the buffer for losses before a bank goes bust. Raising Billions Hensarling’s bill demands that banks have a leverage ratio of at least 10 percent to qualify for regulatory relief. For comparison, Citigroup’s leverage ratio was 7.4 percent at the end of the third quarter. When Hensarling first released details on his legislation in June, he predicted the biggest Wall Street firms combined could have to raise “several hundred billion dollars in new equity” if they wanted to be exempt from regulations. For a big bank that declines Hensarling’s offer, they’d probably be stuck with a whole slew of burdensome requirements, including post-crisis regulations on capital and liquidity, and annual stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve meant to determine whether lenders can weather a severe economic downturn. “It’s a slippery slope,” said Cato’s Calabria, who previously worked as a Republican staff member on the Senate Banking Committee. Once lenders make the decision to opt out of rules, they’ve “legitimized the argument that banks should have higher capital requirements,” he said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The reason for the clandestine preparations: the Eurobond was a crucial step for Russia's limping economy and Moscow feared its Western adversaries might try to sabotage it by pressuring foreign financial institutions to steer clear. "I had not experienced such secrecy in my life before," said Andrey Solovyov, head of debt capital markets at the state-run investment bank, VTB Capital, and one of the three people in the know. Western governments led by Washington have imposed sanctions on certain Russian individuals and entities, over Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its role in the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, aiming to hinder access to Western financing. The sanctions do not, however, forbid Western firms from taking part in a Russian Eurobond - an international bond denominated in a foreign currency. Reuters interviews with about a dozen government officials, bankers and investors involved in the deal shows the lengths that Russia was willing to go to secure Western finance. The May 23 launch was shrouded in secrecy, even from managers who were going to handle it. And it came close to collapsing in the fraught hours that followed. Russian Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said the U.S. administration "found a way to pressure its financial institutions" to eschew the placement. And at the eleventh hour, in a highly unorthodox move, officials had to turn to a local intermediary to handle the technicalities of the issue after two European clearing houses declined to handle it – one of them hours into the launch day, according to two banking sources familiar with the placement. In the end, Russia placed the Eurobond in the market and raised $1.75 billion, as targeted.      Views differ about whether this was a triumph. Moscow said it showed it could still access Western credit markets, despite U.S. resistance. Buyers included at least one big U.S. asset manager which declined to be named due to the political sensitivity of the matter. But some Western financial industry insiders said the issue was a hollow victory, because some of the biggest financial institutions - including the likes of BNP Paribas and JPMorgan - kept away from the primary issue, and they have the capital Russia needs in the long term. CLEARING CONUNDRUM The fact Russia was planning a Eurobond was not a secret. This had been announced by Moscow in February and, according to multiple sources in Russian and Western financial institutions, around that time the Obama administration had advised Western players not to participate. A U.S. Treasury spokesman told Reuters it had not barred U.S. entities from taking part, but "highlighted potential risks that could arise if sanctioned entities were indirectly involved in the issuance". He did not elaborate, but lawyers said the main risk was that investors' money might end up going to sanctioned entities, which could theoretically breach the sanctions. Russian officials and bankers say they acted specifically to catch U.S. officials off-guard. From about two months before the launch, they did not tell VTB Capital managers or workers - apart from the select three - about the details of the issue, such as the date and the terms offered. Once the day of the launch came, it was a rollercoaster. The bond was launched in the morning Moscow time, so VTB could talk to would-be clients in Europe and Asia at least for a few hours to assure them there was no sanctions risk before they received countervailing calls from the U.S. Treasury, the sources said. The terms were attractive; the yield was 4.75 percent - a significant premium on the ultra-low yields on offer in European markets, and on existing Russian sovereign bonds. On May 23, a Monday, the order was given to VTB Capital bankers to start pitching to clients. Would-be investors put in their bids. Business was brisk. The expectation among the organisers, and on the market, was that the order book would be closed quickly. Yet by lunchtime, the first glitch occurred: the order book was still open. The problem, according to two banking sources familiar with the discussions around the placement, was with the clearing houses crucial to placing such a bond. The two big houses, Euroclear and Clearstream, act as intermediaries, taking money from investors and holding the securities on their behalf. Rules at most big banks prevent them taking part in a Eurobond if one of the two is not on board. Before the bond launch, Clearstream had declined to get involved in the deal, according to a government source who said this was the result of political reasons, without elaborating on this. Clearstream declined to comment. That left Euroclear. The two banking sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity about private discussions, said that shortly before VTB Capital opened the order book for its issue, it reached a loose agreement with Euroclear that it would act as clearing agent. Yet by midday in Moscow on May 23, Euroclear had still not given a formal, definite answer on whether it would clear the issue or not, according to one of the bankers. Launching without one of the two houses on board was a highly unusual if not unprecedented move for a country issuing a Eurobond, an indication of Russia's determination to place the bond. The two banking sources said Euroclear held back because it was worried about the risks stemming from the U.S. government's attitude to the bond. Euroclear declined to comment. MAKE-OR-BREAK By the end of Monday, with the bond still not placed - and no international clearing house to handle the issue - investors were getting anxious. "Rumours started to spread that 'the goods are sub-standard, rotten, that you should make a run for it'," said the first banking source. "Investors started to gradually take back their orders." The next morning, VTB staff were fighting a rearguard action, trying to persuade customers not to withdraw orders. Senior executives at the bank kept pressing Euroclear to say if it would take part or not, the source said. VTB Chief Executive Andrei Kostin personally called Euroclear executives, said the first banking source. Asked about this, VTB said that as sole arranger, "the bank was in contact with all parties involved in this process". The issue had reached a make-or-break point by late on Tuesday. "At the end of the second day, we took the decision that we're going ahead without Euroclear," said Solovyov, the VTB Capital head of debt capital markets. It is unclear if Euroclear ever came back with an answer - but Moscow anyway had a plan B. A month earlier, the finance ministry had got in touch with the National Settlement Depository (NSD), Russia's domestic clearing house, asking it to handle the Eurobond in case Euroclear did not take part, said NSD head Eddie Astanin. "It was unexpected," Astanin said of that request to the depository, which had never handled a Eurobond. He had assigned his team to draw up a plan, which was ultimately put into action. HITTING THE PHONES It was now evening on day two in Moscow. VTB bankers knew they were still on thin ice regarding potential clients. While the terms offered better returns than outstanding Russian Eurobonds, the bond would not be "euroclearable" - so buyers would need to take a leap of faith, handing over their money to a Russian settlement system that was untried. Bankers hit the phones at VTB Capital, where patriotic anthem "Rise up, vast country" was played in the VIP elevator after sanctions were imposed in 2014. Unusually, the bank's senior management also picked up the phones to clients to offer "all sorts of assurances", said the first banking source. Some investors could not be persuaded. "We were honest and gave them feedback that because of the spirit of the sanctions we would not be taking part," said Bryan Carter, head of emerging markets fixed income at BNP Paribas Investment Partners. One London-based hedge fund manager, who declined to be identified, said his fund wanted to buy but missed the deadline because the fund's compliance department, worried by U.S. warnings, took a long time to give the green light. For those who did buy, there were arguments in favour. Pavel Mamai, portfolio manager at UK hedge fund Promeritum Investment Management, for example believed U.S. investors who did not take part in the initial issue would want to buy the bond later, allowing him to sell at a profit. "I wasn't sure it would become euroclearable but I still thought it would have upside as it came so cheap," he said. Mamai did later resell the bond, twice, and made money each time, he said. The order book was closed soon after 8 p.m. Moscow time, 6 p.m. in London, with the primary issue raising $1.75 billion. The finance ministry said around 75 percent of it was bought by foreign investors, though Reuters cannot independently verify that. The next morning, the bond started selling on the secondary market. Over the following days, Western investment banks included the bond in their indices, making it easier to trade. On July 28, Euroclear started clearing the bond - meaning every investor in the world could buy it.

REUTERS/Maxim Zmeyev/File Photo By Lidia Kelly, Katya Golubkova and Sujata Rao | MOSCOW/LONDON MOSCOW/LONDON When Russia sought to raise money on Western debt markets this year with a Eurobond, only three people at the state-run investment bank organizing the issue were told in advance about the date and details of the launch. The reason for the clandestine preparations: the Eurobond was a crucial step for Russia's limping economy and Moscow feared its Western adversaries might try to sabotage it by pressuring foreign financial institutions to steer clear. "I had not experienced such secrecy in my life before," said Andrey Solovyov, head of debt capital markets at the state-run investment bank, VTB Capital, and one of the three people in the know. Western governments led by Washington have imposed sanctions on certain Russian individuals and entities, over Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its role in the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, aiming to hinder access to Western financing. The sanctions do not, however, forbid Western firms from taking part in a Russian Eurobond - an international bond denominated in a foreign currency. Reuters interviews with about a dozen government officials, bankers and investors involved in the deal shows the lengths that Russia was willing to go to secure Western finance. The May 23 launch was shrouded in secrecy, even from managers who were going to handle it. And it came close to collapsing in the fraught hours that followed. Russian Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said the U.S. administration "found a way to pressure its financial institutions" to eschew the placement. And at the eleventh hour, in a highly unorthodox move, officials had to turn to a local intermediary to handle the technicalities of the issue after two European clearing houses declined to handle it – one of them hours into the launch day, according to two banking sources familiar with the placement. In the end, Russia placed the Eurobond in the market and raised $1.75 billion, as targeted.  Views differ about whether this was a triumph. Moscow said it showed it could still access Western credit markets, despite U.S. resistance. Buyers included at least one big U.S. asset manager which declined to be named due to the political sensitivity of the matter. But some Western financial industry insiders said the issue was a hollow victory, because some of the biggest financial institutions - including the likes of BNP Paribas and JPMorgan - kept away from the primary issue, and they have the capital Russia needs in the long term. CLEARING CONUNDRUM The fact Russia was planning a Eurobond was not a secret. This had been announced by Moscow in February and, according to multiple sources in Russian and Western financial institutions, around that time the Obama administration had advised Western players not to participate. A U.S. Treasury spokesman told Reuters it had not barred U.S. entities from taking part, but "highlighted potential risks that could arise if sanctioned entities were indirectly involved in the issuance". He did not elaborate, but lawyers said the main risk was that investors' money might end up going to sanctioned entities, which could theoretically breach the sanctions. Russian officials and bankers say they acted specifically to catch U.S. officials off-guard. From about two months before the launch, they did not tell VTB Capital managers or workers - apart from the select three - about the details of the issue, such as the date and the terms offered.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) In this Nov. 16 file photo, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani walks from an elevator as he leaves Trump Tower in New York. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) By ERIC LIPTON and RUSS BUETTNER / The New York Times Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF WASHINGTON – It was a golden year for Rudolph W. Giuliani, a mad dash that would take him to 11 countries on four continents, and by the time 2006 was done, earn him $16 million — a princely sum compared with the $7,000 he claimed to have in 2001, when he went through a divorce. With salaries from a law firm and a consulting firm, and most of all $10 million from 108 speeches he delivered to audiences around the world, the lucrative year of 2006 will now, along with the rest of Giuliani’s career after his tenure as New York’s mayor, be getting a new round of scrutiny if he is nominated as secretary of state by President-elect Donald Trump. The blitz of activity by Giuliani in 2006 – speaking to Wall Street banks; oil, gold mining and pharmaceutical companies; and investor groups in Japan and Singapore — is public because the next year he began a campaign for president and had to file a financial disclosure form. But that public ledger offers the most detailed look at just how Giuliani managed to become so wealthy after he left office, with assets worth tens of millions of dollars, including homes he now owns in Palm Beach, Fla., the Hamptons and New York City. Giuliani’s speeches and travel that year and in the decade since were often related to business deals he was pursuing, or even standing agreements he had reached, like the one with backers of the dissident Iranian political party known as the Mujahedeen Khalq, which until 2012 was considered a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department. They offer a road map of sorts to the kinds of potential conflict of interest questions that are already emerging as Giuliani’s name is floated as a possible Trump Cabinet member, particularly given that Trump repeatedly mocked Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, for the many paid speeches she and her husband gave after they left public office. In particular, Trump criticized Clinton’s speeches to Wall Street banks. But Giuliani, in a one-year year period that ended in January 2007, earned $750,000 in speaking fees — before the 20 percent cut taken by the speakers’ agency — for eight speeches he gave to Wall Street banks and other major financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Bros., before its collapse. As with Clinton, there is little public record of what Giuliani said during these events. Some members of the Senate, which will hold hearings and vote on his nomination if Trump selects him, are already saying they want to learn more about Giuliani’s work in the years since he left City Hall. “I’m concerned generally about conflicts of interest on the part of prospective members of the administration, in every role,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said when asked about Giuliani’s business ventures since he left office. “And that concern is well justified in terms of the backgrounds of some of the potential nominees that have been discussed.” Giuliani, in an interview this week, defended his activities since he left office, saying he had been open about his dealings with private companies and foreign states or political parties, including the Iranian group. “My ties to them are completely open,” Giuliani said. Giuliani certainly kept up a feverish pace. In one month alone during 2006, he gave 20 speeches. From 2001 to 2008, the year he ran for president, he was on the road as much as 200 days a year, according to Anthony V. Carbonetti, a former New York City Hall aide. “Every time I turned, he was calling me from a different country or a different city,” Carbonetti said. For most of those trips, he had a standard speech that mixed a retelling of leadership lessons outlined in his book and memories from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which ultimately earned him the nickname “America’s mayor.” “I heard it so many times, I could have given the speech,” Carbonetti joked. The speeches that have drawn the greatest scrutiny are those he gave from 2012 through last year at events organized by the Mujahedeen Khalq, a dissident group of Iranians that holds a rally in France every year to draw attention to the persecution of its members by the government of Iran. Giuliani was paid for “three or four” speeches he delivered to the group, said Robert G. Torricelli, a former senator from New Jersey who served as a lawyer for the MEK, as the group is known, as it sought to be removed from a State Department list of terrorist organizations. Paul S. Ryan, a vice president for policy and litigation at Common Cause, a nonprofit group that examines special interest influence in politics, said there would be no legal prohibition on Giuliani moving from being paid by the group to a government job. But he still found it troubling. “People would reasonably question his fitness for this political appointment given that he received payments from supporters of this organization, and these are matters he would be charged with dealing with as secretary of state,” he said. Torricelli said that Giuliani had agreed to give the paid speeches because he supported the group’s message, and that he had volunteered his time to participate in negotiations in Europe to help prevent further attacks on refugees from the group who were then living in Iraq. Giuliani’s work earned him a spot on several lists of the highest-paid speakers in the world, just one spot below Bill Clinton, in one ranking. In the afterglow of his post-9/11 fame, Giuliani could certainly ignite large rooms. Giuliani spoke at dozens of events with Zig Ziglar, a motivational speaker. Ziglar’s daughter, Julie Ziglar Norman, who traveled with her father in those years, said Giuliani was a crowd favorite, along with her father and Colin L. Powell. “I know everybody always loved what he had to say,” Ziglar Norman said. “It was always very pro-American. And he was just beloved. That’s the best way I can describe him.” Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular USC bowls over UCLA, 36-14 Suspect shot by Anaheim police officer Miller: Another dose of reality for Mora, UCLA Election 2016: A tale of three cities reflects national contrasts Firefighters battle blaze in Anaheim User Agreement Comments are encouraged, but you must follow our Privacy Policy Policy & Terms of Use Keep it civil and stay on topic.

Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends in early 2018, reiterated the Fed's political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress' Joint Economic Committee. Economic data since Fed policymakers gathered in early November reinforced her view that the economy is making progress toward the Fed's goals on employment and inflation. She said that at the meeting, she and her colleagues believed that the case for a rate increase "had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon." Analysts viewed Yellen's comments as an effort to put financial markets on notice that a rate hike is likely to occur at the Fed's last meeting of the year on Dec. 13-14. They noted that she dismissed a suggestion that increased market uncertainty after Trump's election might be cause for a delay. Asked whether it might be better to push back a move until January, Yellen said that uncertainty surrounding Trump's proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending could well last for a good deal longer than one month. "Yellen's testimony before Congress ... further cemented in place expectations that the Fed will hike rates next month," said Michael Feroli, senior economist at JPMorgan. Asked about her own future, Yellen said it was "fully my intention" to remain as Fed chair until her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018. She said she could not imagine any circumstance that would cause her to leave early, addressing speculation that she might step down once Trump takes office, given his critical comments of her during the election campaign. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 and projected that it could raise rates as many as four times in 2016. But it deferred as the U.S. economy went through a prolonged soft-patch. The rate has remained in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent for the entire year. The rate had been at a record low near zero for seven years. Economists are forecasting that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter-point in December and then will boost rates two more times in 2017. Yellen stressed in her testimony that the slow recovery and absence of inflation pressures should allow the Fed to move gradually in raising its key rate, the federal funds rate. "Gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years," Yellen said, referring to the point where the funds rate is neither promoting economic growth nor slowing growth. As measured by the gross domestic product, the economy grew at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, the government has estimated, more than twice the rate in the April-June quarter. The unemployment rate is 4.9 percent, around the level typical of a healthy economy, down from 10 percent in 2009. In addition to firmly stating that she has no plans of leaving the Fed before her term as chair is complete, Yellen also made clear that her views on bank regulation differ from Trump's. Yellen gave a strong defense of the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress in 2010 to increase financial market regulations in an effort to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. After the country lived through a "devastating financial crisis," Yellen said that "I would not want to see the clock turned back on all the improvements we have made." Trump and other Republicans have attacked Yellen and other federal bank regulators for imposing too-restrictive rules on banks, pledging that they will seek to repeal major parts of the 2010 law. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Yellen's term ends Feb. 3, 2018, not January 2018.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo 1/3 left right A banner promoting Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect is displayed at the Hong Kong Exchanges in Hong Kong August 16, 2016. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo 2/3 left right Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Chief Executive Charles Li speaks during a news conference introducing Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, at the Hong Kong Exchanges in Hong Kong August 16, 2016. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo 3/3 A long-awaited stock trading link between Hong Kong and Shenzhen will go live in coming days, the CEO of Hong Kong's bourse said, further opening up China's capital markets to global investors and giving them access to some of its fastest growing companies. With more than 1,800 listed companies that have a combined market capitalization of $3.3 trillion, the Shenzhen stock market is viewed by analysts as offering tremendous investment potential. HSBC, in fact, calls it the "largest untapped investment opportunity in the world". But sky high valuations and wild swings in Chinese stock prices mean investment flows from Hong Kong into its northern neighbor could take time to materialize. On the other hand, as Chinese retail investors seek to diversify away from their home market and put their funds into assets in a stronger currency, Hong Kong may be a key beneficiary. "Certainly I don't think you will see significant interest in the northbound part of the connect until you have greater optimism about the outlook for domestic equities," Richard Titherington, head of the Asia Pacific Equities team at JPMorgan Asset Management, told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in Hong Kong. The launch of the so-called Shenzhen Connect scheme is expected "in a few more days," Charles Li, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (0388.HK), said on Friday. The move expands an existing trading link between Hong Kong and Shanghai, allowing foreign investors to trade stocks directly in Shenzhen, the world's second-busiest exchange, from Hong Kong. Speaking at the Shenzhen stock exchange in the first stop of a roadshow in mainland China to promote the trading link, Li urged Chinese investors to diversify their holdings with Hong Kong stocks and joked that with real estate prices in the city so expensive, shares may be a better bet. "China residents have a lot of wealth and they need to preserve the value and add value to it, so they have to diversify their investments," Li said. DELAYED START The Shenzhen Connect had been expected to start more than a year ago, but was put on hold after a slump in the Shenzhen and Shanghai bourses, with stocks diving more than 40 percent and the government implementing a series of measures to prop up markets. China approved the Shenzhen trading scheme in August. Among HSBC's top recommendations to investors on Shenzhen-listed companies are Wanda Cinema Line Co Ltd (002739.SZ), China's largest cinema operator, and Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology (002415.SZ), the world's second largest maker of video surveillance cameras, the bank said a report this month. For Chinese investors facing a weakening economy and currency, investing in mid-size Hong Kong-listed companies may be one way to offset the domestic downturn, investors said. Investment flows into Hong Kong shares since the trading link with Shanghai was unveiled two years ago are nearly double the volumes from Hong Kong into China and the Shenzhen link means "strong southbound inflows" will continue, HSBC said. "We do see pretty strong interest, at least from our client base, in investing in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong link," said Wang Ren, chief financial officer at China Minsheng Financial, the investment arm of China's largest private fund, at the Reuters summit. "In the initial few days definitely we will see a pickup in volume, but it depends on the currency situation. People want to allocate more money offshore," Wang said.

Photographer: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images Gone are threats of imminent exodus and economic calamity Finance executives say London’s status not under threat Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Global bank executives are softening their warnings that the U.K.’s looming withdrawal from the European Union will spur an imminent exodus of staff from London.  Bankers are gaining confidence that U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will be able to secure a lengthy transition period that would carry them over from the current rules to whatever fresh terms of trade are agreed with the EU, according to two people with knowledge of their firm’s contingency plans. That’s led to more measured language from many of the industry’s leaders. “Wait and see is also UBS’s attitude toward Brexit," UBS Group AG Chairman Axel Weber said Wednesday at a conference in the U.K. capital. “No doubt London will remain an important financial center. UBS will be here.” The shift in tone, also evident from banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc, comes after May sought to quell fears in the finance industry that her government wouldn’t fight to protect it from the fallout of Brexit when negotiations begin early next year. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney also called this week for a long transition period to give banks a chance to adapt. “Nobody wants to make a bad decision by moving quickly with the amount of uncertainty around," Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan’s head of corporate and investment banking, said in an interview. “We will be ready to make a permanent decision once we have a better idea of the direction of travel.” ‘Gravitational Pull’ Banks continue to plan for the worst: the loss of their right to sell services freely around the EU from London after the end of the two-year Brexit negotiation period. And they are ready to start the process of moving people abroad within weeks of Britain triggering Article 50, scheduled for March, as May would still have to convince EU counterparts to agree to a transition period. But bankers have paused on issuing warnings of pandemonium and threats to relocate abroad that circulated in the months before and after June’s referendum. "I don’t think London will lose its gravitational pull in terms of the management of capital in any reasonable time-frame," Barclays Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley said at a conference this week. "I would not underestimate at all the ability of the U.K. to remain as creative as it’s been historically." Before the referendum, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he would relocate as many as 4,000 employees to the continent after Brexit. In September, UBS said that it may have to move 1,500 staff out of London after Brexit, or 30 percent of its U.K. workforce. That same month, one of JPMorgan’s top executives in Europe said there would be "pandemonium" unless there was an agreement for a transition period. Mending Fences Relations between the finance industry and May’s government reached a low point at the Conservative Party conference in early October when officials said banks would get no special favors in the Brexit negotiations and suggested their threats to leave London were empty. Since then, there has been a concerted effort within government to mend relations with the City, officials said earlier this month. That involved Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, who campaigned against Brexit, and pro-leave lawmakers such as David Davis setting aside their ideological differences in pursuit of a common strategy to quit the EU. Davis said recently he was "determined to get the best possible deal” for London-based banks. Recently, bankers have laced their warnings with some optimism. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc Chairman Howard Davies said Sunday in an interview on ITV that triggering Brexit without a transitional deal would be damaging to all parties. Asked whether a deal is likely, Davies said: "I think that it is possible." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

With more than 1,800 listed companies that have a combined market capitalization of $3.3 trillion, the Shenzhen stock market is viewed by analysts as offering tremendous investment potential. HSBC, in fact, calls it the "largest untapped investment opportunity in the world". But sky high valuations and wild swings in Chinese stock prices mean investment flows from Hong Kong into its northern neighbour could take time to materialize. On the other hand, as Chinese retail investors seek to diversify away from their home market and put their funds into assets in a stronger currency, Hong Kong may be a key beneficiary. "Certainly I don't think you will see significant interest in the northbound part of the connect until you have greater optimism about the outlook for domestic equities," Richard Titherington, head of the Asia Pacific Equities team at JPMorgan Asset Management, told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in Hong Kong. The launch of the so-called Shenzhen Connect scheme is expected "in a few more days," Charles Li, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, said on Friday. The move expands an existing trading link between Hong Kong and Shanghai, allowing foreign investors to trade stocks directly in Shenzhen, the world's second-busiest exchange, from Hong Kong. Speaking at the Shenzhen stock exchange in the first stop of a roadshow in mainland China to promote the trading link, Li urged Chinese investors to diversify their holdings with Hong Kong stocks and joked that with real estate prices in the city so expensive, shares may be a better bet. "China residents have a lot of wealth and they need to preserve the value and add value to it, so they have to diversify their investments," Li said. DELAYED START The Shenzhen Connect had been expected to start more than a year ago, but was put on hold after a slump in the Shenzhen and Shanghai bourses, with stocks diving more than 40 percent and the government implementing a series of measures to prop up markets. China approved the Shenzhen trading scheme in August. Among HSBC's top recommendations to investors on Shenzhen-listed companies are Wanda Cinema Line Co Ltd , China's largest cinema operator, and Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, the world's second largest maker of video surveillance cameras, the bank said a report this month. For Chinese investors facing a weakening economy and currency, investing in mid-size Hong Kong-listed companies may be one way to offset the domestic downturn, investors said. Investment flows into Hong Kong shares since the trading link with Shanghai was unveiled two years ago are nearly double the volumes from Hong Kong into China and the Shenzhen link means "strong southbound inflows" will continue, HSBC said. "We do see pretty strong interest, at least from our client base, in investing in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong link," said Wang Ren, chief financial officer at China Minsheng Financial, the investment arm of China's largest private fund, at the Reuters summit. "In the initial few days definitely we will see a pickup in volume, but it depends on the currency situation. People want to allocate more money offshore," Wang said.

(Carolyn Kaster/AP) The former New York mayor, filing a federal form in 2007, detailed earning $10 million in a year by giving speeches. The man who may nominate him for a Cabinet post repeatedly mocked Hillary Clinton, his opponent, for her many paid speeches after she left office. Share story By ERIC LIPTONand RUSS BUETTNER The New York Times WASHINGTON — It was a golden year for Rudolph Giuliani, a mad dash that would take him to 11 countries on four continents, and by the time 2006 was done, earn him $16 million — a princely sum compared with the $7,000 he claimed to have in 2001, when he went through a divorce. With salaries from a law firm and a consulting firm, and most of all $10 million from 108 speeches he delivered to audiences around the world, the lucrative year of 2006 will now, along with the rest of Giuliani’s career after his tenure as New York’s mayor, be getting a new round of scrutiny if he is nominated as secretary of state or another Cabinet post by President-elect Donald Trump. The blitz of activity by Giuliani in 2006 — speaking to Wall Street banks; oil, gold mining and pharmaceutical companies; and investor groups in Japan and Singapore — is public because the next year he began a campaign for president and had to file a financial-disclosure form. But that public ledger offers the most detailed look at just how Giuliani managed to become so wealthy after he left office, with assets worth tens of millions of dollars, including homes he now owns in Palm Beach, Fla., the Hamptons and New York City.

Giuliani’s speeches and travel that year and in the decade since were often related to business deals he was pursuing, or even standing agreements he had reached, like the one with backers of the dissident Iranian political party known as the Mujahedeen Khalq, which until 2012 was considered a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department. They offer a road map of sorts to the kinds of potential conflict-of-interest questions that are already emerging as Giuliani’s name is floated as a possible Trump Cabinet member, particularly given that Trump repeatedly mocked Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, for the many paid speeches she and her husband gave after they left public office. “When she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests — in less than two years — secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public,” Trump said in June. “Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs and foreign governments in the years since 2001. They totally own her, and that will never change.” In particular, Trump criticized Clinton’s speeches to Wall Street banks. But Giuliani, in a one-year year period that ended in January 2007, earned $750,000 in speaking fees — before the 20 percent cut taken by the speakers’ agency — for eight speeches he gave to Wall Street banks and other major financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Bros., before its collapse. As with Clinton, there is little public record of what Giuliani said during these events. Giuliani had rules about keeping his remarks private, as a contract “addendum” to which organizations that invited him to speak had to agree makes clear. Giuliani stipulated that his remarks could not be recorded, nor could “general press or other media coverage” of the remarks be allowed without his explicit permission. He also had some elaborate demands, including that if he traveled by private plane, it be a Gulfstream IV or bigger, a plane that costs about $40,000 for a one-day trip within the United States. Years of speeches Some members of the Senate, which will hold hearings and vote on his nomination if Trump selects him, are already saying they want to learn more about Giuliani’s work in the years since he left City Hall. “I’m concerned generally about conflicts of interest on the part of prospective members of the administration, in every role,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said when asked about Giuliani’s business ventures since he left office. “And that concern is well justified in terms of the backgrounds of some of the potential nominees that have been discussed.” Giuliani, in an interview this week, defended his activities since he left office, saying he had been open about his dealings with private companies and foreign states or political parties, including the Iranian group. “My ties to them are completely open,” Giuliani said. Giuliani kept up a feverish pace. In one month alone during 2006, he gave 20 speeches. From 2001 to 2008, the year he ran for president, he was on the road as much as 200 days a year, according to Anthony Carbonetti, a former New York City Hall aide. “Every time I turned, he was calling me from a different country or a different city,” Carbonetti said. For most of those trips, he had a standard speech that mixed a retelling of leadership lessons outlined in his book and memories from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which ultimately earned him the nickname “America’s mayor.” “I heard it so many times, I could have given the speech,” Carbonetti joked. One area of particularly focused travel was Asia. Giuliani formed a partnership with Sage Capital Growth, a Manhattan-based investment firm that was exploring business opportunities in Japan. Giuliani’s disclosure form showed a $300,000 speaking fee for one event in November 2005, the largest single fee on the form, which covered 123 speeches given over a 14-month period. Giuliani was separately retained by Mark Advent, a Las Vegas-based casino developer, to help him with his attempt to build a resort and casino in Singapore. Giuliani personally presented parts of the plan to Singapore’s authorities in hearings during an arduous review process. One of Giuliani most frequent employers as a speaker was HSM, a company that arranges “executive education” events around the world. In 2006, he made eight speeches for the company and was paid $550,000 (his booking agent kept 20 percent of that). At least three times, in 2003, 2004 and 2006, Giuliani was to be among the featured speakers at HSM World Business Forums along with Bill Clinton. The Iranian dissidents The speeches that have drawn the greatest scrutiny are those he gave from 2012 through last year at events organized by the Mujahedeen Khalq, a dissident group of Iranians that holds a rally in France every year to draw attention to the persecution of its members by the government of Iran. Giuliani was paid for “three or four” speeches he delivered to the group, said Robert Torricelli, a former senator from New Jersey who served as a lawyer for the MEK, as the group is known, as it sought to be removed from a State Department list of terrorist organizations. Giuliani, after receiving payments from U.S.-based groups of Iranian immigrants who had ties to the MEK, gave rousing speeches at these annual rallies condemning Iranian leaders and the Obama administration for negotiating with them. “The ayatollah must go,” Giuliani yelled, referring to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, as thousands stood and cheered him. “Gone, out, no more,” he said, adding that Khamenei and other leaders of Iran should “be put on trial for crimes against humanity for the thousands and hundreds of thousands of people that they have killed.” Paul S. Ryan, a vice president for policy and litigation at Common Cause, a nonprofit group that examines special-interest influence in politics, said there would be no legal prohibition on Giuliani moving from being paid by the group to a government job. But he still found it troubling. “People would reasonably question his fitness for this political appointment given that he received payments from supporters of this organization, and these are matters he would be charged with dealing with as secretary of state,” he said. Torricelli said that Giuliani had agreed to give the paid speeches because he supported the group’s message, and that he had volunteered his time to participate in negotiations in Europe to help prevent further attacks on refugees from the group who were then living in Iraq. Giuliani’s work earned him a spot on several lists of the highest-paid speakers in the world, just one spot below Bill Clinton in one ranking. In one instance in 2006, Giuliani collected $100,000 for speaking at Oklahoma State University. His contract with the university, which is public, laid out what appeared to be his standard demands beyond a fee. A room with a view Besides the requests related to air travel, his team required a sedan and an SUV, and an extra SUV for luggage when he traveled to other countries. His room tastes were specific: a “large two-bedroom, nonsmoking suite with a king-size bed, on an upper floor, with a balcony and view if applicable.” He required four more rooms on the same floor for security and staff. Eric Money, who led the speakers bureau at Oklahoma State University at the time Giuliani visited the campus, said Giuliani’s speech to students and faculty members in the university’s basketball arena had focused on leadership and Sept. 11. Money said the fee was high, but he did not recall hearing complaints. “That is what Bill Clinton was getting at the time,” Money said. “It was on par. I did not have sticker shock.” In the afterglow of his post-9/11 fame, Giuliani could certainly ignite large rooms. Giuliani spoke at dozens of events with Zig Ziglar, a motivational speaker. Ziglar’s daughter, Julie Ziglar Norman, who traveled with her father in those years, said Giuliani was a crowd favorite, along with her father and Colin Powell. “I know everybody always loved what he had to say,” Ziglar Norman said. “It was always very pro-American. And he was just beloved. That’s the best way I can describe him.” ERIC LIPTONand RUSS BUETTNER Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

Thakor, Washington University in St Louis Published 7:44 pm, Thursday, November 17, 2016 Anjan V. Thakor, Washington University in St Louis Deutsche Bank, a venerable 146-year-old bank whose very name symbolizes the German financial system, has recently found itself in considerable turmoil. The kicker came in September when the Department of Justice slapped it with a US$14 billion fine for alleged wrongdoing during the financial crisis. But Deutsche Bank was already being buffeted by a string of bad news. Its stock price has slumped over the past year due to a decline in investment banking and dim prospects for its commercial banking business. This has led to speculation about whether the German government will have to bail it out and, if it doesn’t, whether markets will soon experience another “Lehman moment” – referring to how the collapse of the U.S. investment bank sparked a global financial meltdown in 2008. As I see it, these concerns obscure the much deeper problem that afflicts the European banking sector and that a bailout alone will do nothing to resolve: a lack of capital. It also offers a stark warning for U.S. regulators amid talk of changes to banking rules – especially Dodd-Frank – under the new administration. While some changes to the U.S. financial system may be worthwhile, easing capital standards would be a mistake and make another financial crisis much more likely. Instead, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic need to make sure there’s no question their banks are able to withstand a shock – whether a billion-dollar fine or something much more severe. While allowing a bank that has the size and prominence of Deutsche Bank to fail is obviously an event that could have seismic repercussions, bailing it out is not something that would be easy for the German government to do. There are many reasons for this. One is reputational. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has been critical of other governments (especially in Europe) for using taxpayer funds to bail out their banks. Second, there is little support among German taxpayers for the bailout, so it would also be politically costly. While it’s interesting to speculate about this, there are other questions that are even more pertinent. First, what is the real problem here? Why is Deutsche Bank in the mess it finds itself in? What can we do to prevent our major financial institutions from being so fragile in the future? There are many factors responsible for what ails Deutsche Bank. Perhaps none figures more prominently than its capital position during and after the crisis. Among its peer institutions, Deutsche Bank is the riskiest based on its “leverage ratio,” which essentially measures how much equity capital it has as a percentage of total assets. On June 30, its leverage ratio stood at a shockingly low 2.68 percent, or about half the average for the eight biggest U.S. banks, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That means it had only $2.68 in equity for every $100 in assets. A low ratio means it has less cushion if there’s a problem. Since banks are required to mark many of their assets to market, an adverse price movement that reduces the value of its assets by just 3 percent would completely wipe out its equity. We can see that the bank’s low capital is bad from at least two perspectives. One is that a 2.68 percent leverage ratio is less than what Bear Stearns had (2.78 percent) in early 2008 before it collapsed and had to be rescued by the U.S. government via a deal with JPMorgan Chase. Another is that under the Basel III’s capital rules, banks are required to have a leverage ratio exceeding 3 percent. As an interesting contrast, U.S. bank regulators have adopted a 5 percent minimum leverage ratio for domestic banks. (One caveat is that European regulators [European Banking Authority] gave Deutsche Bank a ratio of 2.96 percent earlier this year,slightly higher than what the FDIC gave it, but still very worrisome.) Extensive academic research has revealed that a lot of bad things can happen when a bank has critically low capital. One is that its internal culture gets skewed in favor of growth and excessive risk taking. Deals that can make the bank a lot of money if they pan out (but can also cost the taxpayers a lot) become more attractive. The other consequence is that there is “debt overhang” – so much debt that shareholders are unwilling to infuse any more equity into the bank since most of the benefits of the new equity will flow to the depositors and other creditors. So this creates a sort of “doom spiral”: More equity is needed to rescue the bank, but excessive debt stands in the way. So the government finds itself on the horns of a dilemma, either let the bank fail or infuse taxpayer money to rescue it. Finally, more highly levered banks also make a bigger contribution to systemic risk, which is the risk that the whole system will fail, as we saw during the financial crisis. We see some evidence of these forces operating at Deutsche Bank. Reports suggest the bank is unlikely to raise new equity because its stock price is “too low” and trading at about 25 percent of the book value of its equity. That means the market thinks the value of the bank’s equity is worth just 25 cents when the bank’s balance sheet states it as one dollar. Put slightly differently, if Duetsche bank states its shareholders equity on its balance sheet as $100, the market will actually pay only $25 to buy it. One reason for the low stock price is its dim business prospects, thanks to anemic economic growth in Europe and tighter banking regulations. The other, of course, is the aforementioned debt overhang. With such low capital, it is also hardly surprising that its U.S. unit failed the Federal Reserve Bank’s stress test in June. The only other major bank that failed was the U.S. unit of Santander. When a bank fails a test, it is not allowed to remit dividends back to its parent company and may face harsher sanctions. In addition there is reputational damage and potential loss of customer trust, which can be very damaging to the stock price. Moreover, consistent with the predictions of academic research, the International Monetary Fund named the bank as “the most important net contributor to systemic risk.” In other words, by keeping capital that is too low from a prudential regulation standpoint, Deutsche Bank is creating risk, not only for itself but for the whole global financial system. So, the real problem for global financial stability is not whether Deutsche Bank will be bailed out. It is the question of what bank regulators are going to do to get more equity capital into banking. In this regard, U.S. bank regulators have done considerably better than European (and Japanese) bank regulators. During the financial crisis, the U.S. government took equity stakes in banks, effectively recapitalizing them. When the shareholders of these banks repurchased the government’s stakes, private equity capital replaced taxpayer-provided capital, and the U.S. banking system ended up on a much sounder footing as a result. By contrast, this did not happen in Europe. In fact, banks in Europe lobbied their bank regulators to water down the Basel III capital rules so as to avoid having to raise billions of euros in new capital. As a result, banking fragility in Europe remains considerably higher than in the U.S. What should be done going forward? I think the single biggest regulatory imperative in banking is to get banks to have significantly higher capital ratios, both in the U.S. and in Europe, although the problem in Europe is more pressing. And American taxpayers and bank regulators cannot afford to be smug about American banks being better capitalized than European banks. There may be lobbying of the new administration to water down capital requirements but doing so will be bad for the economy, both here and globally. Hopefully we will not repeat the mistakes made in Europe. We live in a highly interconnected global financial system. European banking fragility imperils the U.S. and indeed the global financial system. Bailouts generally do not foster future financial stability; higher capital does. That’s where the answer lies.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) By MARTIN CRUTSINGER The Associated Press WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen appears unruffled by incoming President Donald Trump's victory last week. Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends in early 2018, reiterated the Fed's political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress' Joint Economic Committee. Economic data since Fed policymakers gathered in early November reinforced her view that the economy is making progress toward the Fed's goals on employment and inflation. She said that at the meeting, she and her colleagues believed that the case for a rate increase "had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon." Analysts viewed Yellen's comments as an effort to put financial markets on notice that a rate hike is likely to occur at the Fed's last meeting of the year on Dec. 13-14. They noted that she dismissed a suggestion that increased market uncertainty after Trump's election might be cause for a delay. Asked whether it might be better to push back a move until January, Yellen said that uncertainty surrounding Trump's proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending could well last for a good deal longer than one month. "Yellen's testimony before Congress ... further cemented in place expectations that the Fed will hike rates next month," said Michael Feroli, senior economist at JPMorgan. Asked about her own future, Yellen said it was "fully my intention" to remain as Fed chair until her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018. She said she could not imagine any circumstance that would cause her to leave early, addressing speculation that she might step down once Trump takes office, given his critical comments of her during the election campaign. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 and projected that it could raise rates as many as four times in 2016. But it deferred as the U.S. economy went through a prolonged soft-patch. The rate has remained in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent for the entire year. The rate had been at a record low near zero for seven years. Economists are forecasting that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter-point in December and then will boost rates two more times in 2017. Yellen stressed in her testimony that the slow recovery and absence of inflation pressures should allow the Fed to move gradually in raising its key rate, the federal funds rate. "Gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years," Yellen said, referring to the point where the funds rate is neither promoting economic growth nor slowing growth. As measured by the gross domestic product, the economy grew at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, the government has estimated, more than twice the rate in the April-June quarter. The unemployment rate is 4.9 percent, around the level typical of a healthy economy, down from 10 percent in 2009. In addition to firmly stating that she has no plans of leaving the Fed before her term as chair is complete, Yellen also made clear that her views on bank regulation differ from Trump's. Yellen gave a strong defense of the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress in 2010 to increase financial market regulations in an effort to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. After the country lived through a "devastating financial crisis," Yellen said that "I would not want to see the clock turned back on all the improvements we have made." Trump and other Republicans have attacked Yellen and other federal bank regulators for imposing too-restrictive rules on banks, pledging that they will seek to repeal major parts of the 2010 law. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Yellen's term ends Feb. 3, 2018, not January 2018.

Yellen sketched a picture of an improving U.S. economy and said "the case for an increase" in interest rates has strengthened. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates when it meets in mid-December. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen appears unruffled by incoming President Donald Trump’s victory last week. Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends in early 2018, reiterated the Fed’s political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress’ Joint Economic Committee. Economic data since Fed policymakers gathered in early November reinforced her view that the economy is making progress toward the Fed’s goals on employment and inflation. She said that at the meeting, she and her colleagues believed that the case for a rate increase “had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon.” Analysts viewed Yellen’s comments as an effort to put financial markets on notice that a rate hike is likely to occur at the Fed’s last meeting of the year on Dec. 13-14. They noted that she dismissed a suggestion that increased market uncertainty after Trump’s election might be cause for a delay. Asked whether it might be better to push back a move until January, Yellen said that uncertainty surrounding Trump’s proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending could well last for a good deal longer than one month. “Yellen’s testimony before Congress … further cemented in place expectations that the Fed will hike rates next month,” said Michael Feroli, senior economist at JPMorgan. Asked about her own future, Yellen said it was “fully my intention” to remain as Fed chair until her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018. She said she could not imagine any circumstance that would cause her to leave early, addressing speculation that she might step down once Trump takes office, given his critical comments of her during the election campaign. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 and projected that it could raise rates as many as four times in 2016. But it deferred as the U.S. economy went through a prolonged soft-patch. The rate has remained in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent for the entire year. The rate had been at a record low near zero for seven years. Economists are forecasting that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter-point in December and then will boost rates two more times in 2017. Yellen stressed in her testimony that the slow recovery and absence of inflation pressures should allow the Fed to move gradually in raising its key rate, the federal funds rate. “Gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years,” Yellen said, referring to the point where the funds rate is neither promoting economic growth nor slowing growth. As measured by the gross domestic product, the economy grew at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, the government has estimated, more than twice the rate in the April-June quarter. The unemployment rate is 4.9 percent, around the level typical of a healthy economy, down from 10 percent in 2009. In addition to firmly stating that she has no plans of leaving the Fed before her term as chair is complete, Yellen also made clear that her views on bank regulation differ from Trump’s. Yellen gave a strong defense of the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress in 2010 to increase financial market regulations in an effort to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.

Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed Rs 500- and Rs 1,000 notes from the circulation, currency exchange providers in the US have been unable to take the outlawed bills. Some of the country’s biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc, work with vendors to provide rupees to clients and those vendors have made the bills unavailable, spokesmen for the banks said. Wells Fargo & Co also said it can’t supply rupees at this time, while Bank of America Corp said it has never accepted the currency for exchange. “If you have a euro, you can go to a bank and exchange it,” Desai, 76, of Cliffside Park, New Jersey, said in a telephone interview. “For an Indian rupee, I don’t think there’s any bank that does that here.” Notes of Rs 500 ($7.34) and Rs 1,000 ceased to be legal tender November 9, Modi said last week in a surprise announcement, sweeping away 86 per cent of the total currency in circulation. The move has been seen as an attempt to fulfill his election promise of curbing tax evasion and recovering illegal income, locally known as black money, stashed overseas. The notes will have to be deposited in banks by the end of December, Modi said. “For our clients, it’s very hard,” Nandita Chandra, head of Great Indian Travel Co’s New York office, said in a telephone interview while visiting New Delhi. “A lot of people are affected and we don’t have a culture that is credit-card friendly, it’s a cash-based economy.” Mastercard Inc., the second-largest payment network, heralded the move as one that will reduce crime and drive growth in the Indian economy. Modi’s “bold action and leadership is a critical step in positioning India to be a leader in the global cashless and digital economy movement,” Porush Singh, the firm’s president for South Asia, said in a statement. “Mastercard is committed to working with the government to provide the cashless solutions that combat corruption and create growth, and inclusion for all members of society.” Travelex Ltd, which operates more than 200 currency exchange stores in the US, said it’s unable to accept the  Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bills from customers because it can’t repatriate the cash in bulk under India’s current rules, said Lucie Smith, a spokeswoman for the London-based company. Western Union Co, the world’s largest money-transfer service, said for those locations facing a shortage of rupees, customers are able to receive checks or remittances to their bank accounts. “A lot of people are trying to give money to their friends to spend it, or else it will go to waste,” said Desai, who makes a yearly trip to India to work at a medical camp. If she can’t find a place to exchange or use the bills, she’ll “just have to throw it away.” Bloomberg Read More On Demonetisation Effect PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY Advertisements Punto Evo - With Cash Benefits upto ? 60,000.

Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed Rs 500- and Rs 1,000 notes from the circulation, currency exchange providers in the US have been unable to take the outlawed bills. Some of the country’s biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc, work with vendors to provide rupees to clients and those vendors have made the bills unavailable, spokesmen for the banks said. Wells Fargo & Co also said it can’t supply rupees at this time, while Bank of America Corp said it has never accepted the currency for exchange. “If you have a euro, you can go to a bank and exchange it,” Desai, 76, of Cliffside Park, New Jersey, said in a telephone interview. “For an Indian rupee, I don’t think there’s any bank that does that here.” Notes of Rs 500 ($7.34) and Rs 1,000 ceased to be legal tender November 9, Modi said last week in a surprise announcement, sweeping away 86 per cent of the total currency in circulation. The move has been seen as an attempt to fulfill his election promise of curbing tax evasion and recovering illegal income, locally known as black money, stashed overseas. The notes will have to be deposited in banks by the end of December, Modi said. “For our clients, it’s very hard,” Nandita Chandra, head of Great Indian Travel Co’s New York office, said in a telephone interview while visiting New Delhi. “A lot of people are affected and we don’t have a culture that is credit-card friendly, it’s a cash-based economy.” Mastercard Inc., the second-largest payment network, heralded the move as one that will reduce crime and drive growth in the Indian economy. Modi’s “bold action and leadership is a critical step in positioning India to be a leader in the global cashless and digital economy movement,” Porush Singh, the firm’s president for South Asia, said in a statement. “Mastercard is committed to working with the government to provide the cashless solutions that combat corruption and create growth, and inclusion for all members of society.” Travelex Ltd, which operates more than 200 currency exchange stores in the US, said it’s unable to accept the  Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bills from customers because it can’t repatriate the cash in bulk under India’s current rules, said Lucie Smith, a spokeswoman for the London-based company.

provided by United Way of Greater Los Angeles Nov 19, 2016, 15:33 ET Share this article LOS ANGELES, Nov. 19, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Today, United Way of Greater Los Angeles hosted its 10th Annual HomeWalk, a 5K family run/walk to raise public awareness and funds to end homelessness in Downtown Los Angeles' Grand Park. United Way President and CEO, Elise Buik, L.A. County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, City Council President Herb Wesson, City Councilmember Marqueece Harris-Dawson, other elected and civic leaders, Presenting Sponsor representatives, Cinny Kennard, Annenberg Foundation, and Peter Laugharn and Steve Hilton of the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, and a special appearance by former Los Angeles Rams player, Hall of Famer Eric Dickerson, were among the nearly 12,000 participants who came together to raise awareness and funds necessary to help end homelessness. This year's top individual fundraiser was Dennis Arriola, chairman and chief executive officer of SoCalGas and the top team fundraiser was SoCalGas. Over the past nine years, HomeWalk has raised over $6.5 million, helping to house 17,000 people. This year's event raised more than $1 million, with help from the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, which matched every $5,000 a person or team raised with another $5,000. "United Way remains deeply committed to ensuring that every single one of our neighbors has a safe place to live, and with a record of nearly 12,000 HomeWalk participants this year, we are so grateful for the continued support we've seen from the community," said Elise Buik, President and CEO, United Way of Greater Los Angeles. "We will continue working tirelessly with our partners across all sectors to combat this homelessness crisis that has plagued our region for far too long. We thank our supporters and donors across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors for the unprecedented collaboration, driving public and civic will towards the solutions that work to end homelessness, such as permanent supportive housing." With nearly 47,000 men, women, and children suffering from homelessness in Los Angeles County, of which over 3,000 are veterans, United Way and its partners have long been committed to permanently ending homelessness in the area. Support from HomeWalk sponsors, including Presenting Sponsors Annenberg Foundation, and Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, and Major Sponsors including ACCO Engineering Systems, AEG, Edison International, JP Morgan Chase & Co., Learn4Life, SoCalGas, and Wells Fargo, ensures that 100 percent of funds raised go directly to the community. In addition to the annual HomeWalk fundraiser, United Way has also spearheaded the groundbreaking Home for Good initiative, which was built in collaboration with more than 200 business, government, faith, and philanthropic leaders and organizations to end homelessness in L.A. County, starting with chronically homeless individuals and veterans. Homeless statistics in Los Angeles County: Nearly 47,000 men, women, children and veterans are living without the safety and comfort of a home on any given night. 40% are women, children and youth. While we have made tremendous impact reducing veteran homelessness by 57% -- over 3,000 are still suffering on our streets. Homelessness exists in all of our communities: 90% of homeless individuals live outside of Skid Row. Today's event commenced with elected officials, celebrities, athletes, and thousands of participants in this year's new location in Downtown Los Angeles' Grand Park. The homelessness crisis in Los Angeles County is one of United Way's core priorities in its efforts to develop pathways out of poverty. HomeWalk is one part of United Way's work to raise public awareness and create solutions to end homelessness.

“No warning can save people determined to grow suddenly rich” – Lord Overstone Home Articles Authors Email Groups Search About Us HOME / Articles / John Rubino / So Much For Electing An Outsider So Much For Electing An Outsider By: John Rubino | Sat, Nov 19, 2016 Share Print Email During his run for the presidency, Donald Trump took the occasional break from insulting women and minorities to toss off some decent - even exciting - policy ideas. Term limits for congressmen and a ban on politicians becoming lobbyists, for instance, were straight from the Libertarian good-government Christmas list. But best of all was the effective break-up of the big banks through the re-imposition of Glass-Steagall, a law passed during the Great Depression to separate taxpayer-protected commercial banks from free-to-fail investment banks. Here's an article published during the campaign noting Wall Street's angst at the prospect: Glass-Steagall: Wall Street is not happy with Donald Trump (CNBC) - The GOP candidate's pledge to bring back Glass-Steagall is an unwelcome surprise for the financial services industry. A top advisor to presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Monday that the party wants to reimplement Glass-Steagall, Depression-era legislation that was designed to prevent big bank "supermarkets," but which was repealed in 1999. After the surprise announcement, which came on the first day of the Republican National Convention, Wall Street sources sounded off on the idea that a Republican would reverse course on policies nearly 20 years old and now taken for granted by big banks. One lawyer, who works with financial institutions on behalf of a white-shoe firm in New York, called the idea "scary." Even Wilbur Ross, one of the Trump campaign's biggest supporters from the finance industry, called it "surprising." Others on Wall Street who spoke to CNBC used stronger language that can't be printed. Glass-Steagall is legislation the U.S. imposed in the wake of the 1929 market crash aimed at limiting the relationships between securities firms and commercial banks, and by extension of that, systemic risk to U.S. markets and the economy. In 1999, legislation was passed that did away with Glass-Steagall, but now, the GOP is ready to bring it back and break up banks. President Trump, however, seems to have quickly changed his mind: The wolves of Wall Street: Trump's Treasury contenders -- what big teeth they have ... (Salon) - Judging by who Trump is considering for Treasury secretary, Wall Street banks could have unprecedented influence. Donald Trump may have sounded like an economic populist to his voters during the presidential campaign, but his administration is shaping up to be the best thing to happen to Wall Street since the Roaring '20s, that regulation-free era that preceded the Great Depression. And we know how well that worked out for the nation. This might sound like hyperbole, but Politico yesterday quoted an historian to back it up: "You would have to go back to the 1920s to see so much Wall Street influence coming to Washington," said Charles Geisst, a Wall Street historian at Manhattan College. "It's the most dramatic turnaround one could imagine. That's the truly astonishing part." It's a little scary when historians are saying that the major Wall Street banks had even less power in Washington during our recent period of deregulation, which spanned the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, than they probably will have over the upcoming four to eight years of the Orange Reign. And it is also a remarkable turnaround since Trump spent so much of his general election campaign bashing Hillary Clinton for her ties to Wall Street. This came after a bruising Democratic primary in which Bernie Sanders bashed her for the same reason. Sanders's popularity and Trump's win, the pundits said, indicated an ascendant populist mood in the country. The fact that, in Trump's case at least, said populism was a distraction meant to keep his fans from noticing that he would be restoring all the old Wall Street thieves and lackwits to prominent positions in Washington was duly noted by liberals but did not break through to enough voters. Or if it did, they did not care. Trump, of course, is spinning his economic plans as the responsible way to unleash the great power of the American economy. From his transition website: Federal policy should focus on free enterprise, while protecting consumers by policing markets for force and fraud. Both Wall Street and Washington should be held accountable. To hold Wall Street accountable, Trump has been looking to name a Treasury secretary who will do anything but. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has been in the running and according to CNBC he's pitching hard for the gig -- what wolf wouldn't to get into the sheep pen? Right now, however, the top contender is said to be another wolf: Seth Mnuchin, a longtime Goldman Sachs executive and hedge fund manager. Mnuchin was recently the CEO of a regional bank, OneWest, which was previously known as IndyMac. The bank was one of the major players in the foreclosure crisis during the Great Recession and is accused of fraudulently foreclosing on thousands of homes, particularly those owned by seniors and low-income minorities who did not have the resources to pursue legal recourse. Mnuchin, by the way, is not a fan of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act signed by President Barack Obama, which was intended to rein in some of the banking practices by which Mnuchin made his fortune. Since one of Trump's goals for the entire campaign has been the repeal of the Dodd-Frank act and because the deregulation-happy Republicans who control Congress share that goal, you can expect that legislation, signed in 2010 in response to the banking excesses that brought on the Great Recession, to disappear into the mists of history once Mnuchin is confirmed. Congressional Republicans are also likely going to use this new business-friendly atmosphere to destroy or at least hamstring the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the baby of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who helped set it up in 2010 before her run for the Senate. Republicans have been gunning for the CFPB, which helps protect consumers from predatory businesses. According to The Huffington Post, the CFPB has found redress for 27 million consumers to the tune of nearly $12 billion in its short history. The GOP now plans to rein in the CFPB, possibly by naming recently retired Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Texas, to run it. Neugebauer, who like Hensarling has ties to the payday loan industry, has long opposed the CFPB. So putting him in charge of it is the proverbial case of the fox guarding the henhouse. Clearly some back-channel discussions took place in which: 1) Trump made it clear to Wall Street that he was just kidding about Glass-Steagal and that once elected he'd take care of his banker friends, or... 2) Wall Street made it clear to Trump that the rewards for playing ball would be as great as the penalties for not playing ball would be terrible. Either way, message received. The aristocrats seem to have weathered the peasant revolt just fine and are back to happily fleecing their sheep.     Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

News Wells Fargo Faces Tight Limits After Regulator Rips Up Phony Accounts Settlement The Officer of the Comptroller of the Currency ripped up the September settlement over Wells Fargo's fradulent accounts scandal. (iStockphoto) ED CARSON 11/19/2016 Reprints Wells Fargo (WFC) faces strict new restrictions after a banking regulator ripped up part of the settlement over its phony accounts scandal. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency late Friday, in a terse statement, revoked some waivers from the September agreement that imposed a $185 million fine on Wells Fargo for opening as many as 2.1 million fradulent accounts. Wells Fargo said it fired 5,300 workers for the sales practices, but no senior staff were affected, at least initially. The banking giant will now need OCC approval for major business moves or hiring of senior employees. Wells also will be restricted on making so-called golden parachutes to departing staff. The OCC did not explain its unilateral move, which apparently caught Wells Fargo by surprise. But politicians had complained that regulators did impose significant punishment on Wells Fargo for its sales practices and lax oversight. Those charges continued even after CEO John Stumpf resigned and agreed to forgo severance and various stock options. The SEC and Justice Department are conducting their own probes into Wells Fargo. Regulators also may have acted during the current Obama administration. President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, and there's a general sense that a Trump administration and GOP Congress will tighter a lighter touch on banking regulation. Wells Fargo new customer accounts fell 44% in Q3 vs. a year earlier, the bank said on Wednesday, citing fallout from the scandal. Still, Wells Fargo shares have been rebounding in recent weeks. After tumbling in September and October while rival banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) were breaking out of consolidations, Wells Fargo has rallied nearly 15% so far in November. That reflects surging Treasury yields since the election, with expectations that the Federal Reserve will go ahead with an interest rate hike next month.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton Reuters/Shannon Stapleton Friday, Nov 18, 2016 London: Citigroup is ready to face Brexit in whatever form it finally manifest, ranging from a softer negotiated exit of the UK from the European Union (EU) retaining passporting of financial transactions, or a hard Brexit cutting off the country from rules of the single market, restricting banks and financial institutions in UK conducting business in EU. “Regardless of what happens with Brexit, Citigroup will continue to provide products and services we have been providing in both UK and EU countries and London will remain important international hub,” said Jim Cowles, EMEA CEO of Citi. A recent ruling by UK’s High Court has added further uncertainty to the Brexit schedule of the government. The court has ruled that Parliament should have a say before the UK invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty — which triggers up to two years of formal EU withdrawal talks. The government’s appeal against the High Court ruling that MPs must vote on triggering Brexit will be heard in the Supreme Court from December 5. There have been recent reports suggesting that post-Brexit, Citigroup will be relocating staff to other European locations. Earlier this year, the bank merged its UK and European operations now headquartered in Dublin. Advertisement “This gives us a clear competitive advantage in terms of formulating our business plans for Europe, post-Brexit. However, at this point in time we have not decided on moving people or resources across borders ahead of Brexit plans,” Cowles said. Earlier this week, The Sunday Times reported that Citigroup conducted a board meeting in Dublin last month, and was trying to explore options for office space in the Irish capital. The newspaper quoted a source saying, “They have been testing the Irish political and regulatory regime on a macro level.” Citi officials said the bank has not started any transfer of people from London to any other European location as part of post-Brexit business plan. But bank officials said there have been normal staff moves across geographies as part of regular operational requirements. Officials said the bank’s brokerage business based out of London could be affected if passporting is impacted. “We have total of 19,000 people in 21 EU countries including the UK. We are closely watching the developments. We have the optionality [of moving] based on the course Brexit negotiations would take. We are fully prepared for the outcome whatever it may be,” said Cowles. Officials confirmed that several dozens of people across the organisation are working on the bank’s potential options in the event of a hard Brexit. “The planning at this point is not about moving people to a new location. Our teams are weighing various options to face different scenarios related to Brexit,” said Michael Lavelle, Head of Corporate and Investment Banking, UK. While many banks are considering the option of moving their European businesses to other European financial hubs, the move could be very expensive, given the fact many of them have huge infrastructure and staff concentration in London. With the Brexit threat looming, London’s financial industry circles are buzz with talks of many banks moving their European business out of London. Currently Ireland is being considered an attractive destination for many banks because of English language, its proximity to London and the relatively flexible labour laws. A number of banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM and Bank of America Corp. have either already established their offices in Dublin or have the license to conduct business there. Passporting restrictions to hurt banks London: One of the biggest fallouts of Brexit will be that British banks can expect reduced access to the market for financial services in the 27 EU states. In the event of a full exit of UK from EU translating into UK’s withdrawal from rules of the single market which include free movement of worker could mean UK banks could lose the so called banking passporting. Banks and other financial companies can be authorised to do business in one member state of the EU, or the slightly wider European Economic Area (EEA), and then ply their trade across the region without having to be separately authorised in each country. The EEA is a grouping made up of the EU, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein who have access to the EU’s single market. A bank using this system can provide services by offering them from its home base to a customer in another country, or it can establish a branch abroad. It is widely used by financial firms in the EU. They establish themselves in one place in the EU, typically in London as the continent’s dominant financial centre, and use that as their headquarters for selling services across the single market. If the banking passport is no longer available to British-based firms, then some operations would clearly have to shift to a location inside the EEA.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel A US appeals court appeared unlikely on Friday to overturn an order requiring Nomura Holdings Inc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc to pay USD839 million for making false statements while selling mortgage-backed securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Lawyers for both banks urged the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York to reverse a 2015 ruling that followed a non-jury trial in lawsuit by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) over mortgage bonds sold before the 2008 financial crisis. David Tulchin, Nomura's lawyer, argued a lower-court judge had no basis to find the alleged false statements were material, arguing she excluded evidence showing mortgage giants Fannie and Freddie knew of the loan underwriting practices at issue. "The district court excluded all evidence that Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or any reasonable investor standing in their shoes knew about the underwriting practices at the time," he said. But several members of the three-judge panel questioned Tulchin and RBS's lawyer about how that would excuse the banks if they made representations about the quality of the loans that Fannie and Freddie relied on in buying the mortgage bonds. "Couldn't Fannie and Freddie rely on you to do your job?" US Circuit Judge Richard Wesley asked. The lawsuit was one of 18 filed by the FHFA in 2011 over some USD200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that banks sold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FHFA has acted as conservator for Fannie and Freddie since their 2008 government takeover. The case is so far the only case to reach trial, after the regulator obtained nearly USD17.9 billion in settlements from institutions that include Bank of America Corp , JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG Following a non-jury trial, US District Judge Denise Cote, who presided over most of the cases, ruled against Nomura, which sponsored USD2 billion of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, and RBS, which underwrote four of the deals. The judge ruled that the offering documents did not correctly describe the mortgage loans. She awarded USD806 million. The banks later agreed to pay another USD33 million for costs and attorneys' fees subject to the appeal's outcome. At Friday's arguments, Kathleen Sullivan, the FHFA's lawyer, urged the court uphold that ruling, saying the evidence showed the bonds' offering documents falsely represented the quality of the mortgages. "We had every reason to rely on their representations," she said. The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Nomura Holding America Inc et al, 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-1872.

By Michael Vallo Biography December 23, 2014 Table: America’s Top 40 Wealth Management Firms (See related story: 2015 Top 40 Wealth Management Firms) In the fiercely competitive arena of managing serious wealth, Bank of America has just rung the bell. It has become the first firm to handle more than $1 trillion in U.S. investment accounts for wealthy families. As of June 30, the banking giant, including its Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust units, had $1.08 trillion under management in accounts of $5 million or more, up 19% from a revised 2013 total. That was more than enough for BofA to retain the top spot in Penta’s annual survey of America’s top 40 wealth managers. The top five firms as a group increased their assets by a healthy 17%, thanks to both a strong stock market and a steady flow of new business. But not all the action was at the top. A number of smaller firms added muscle even faster. Result: The top five actually saw their share of the top 40’s assets slip -- to 62% from an average of 64% in the past few years. With wealth management growing explosively, only one firm in the top 40, Barclays, reported a decrease in asset under management; the British bank dropped to No. 20 from No. 18 as a result. Penta ranks America’s wealth managers annually, focusing only on accounts of $5 million and up. We get most of the data directly from the firms, but in two cases this year, Goldman Sachs and UBS, we had to make our own estimates. All players in the top five retained their rankings from last year. No. 2–ranked Morgan Stanley, though behind BofA, has assembled $937 billion in assets from wealthy families, and is comfortably ahead of the No. 3 firm, JPMorgan, with $625 billion in assets. Wells Fargo and UBS round out the top five, with $495 billion and $403 billion, respectively. We’ve identified one new entry in the top half of the list: Bernstein Global Wealth Management, a division inside Alliance Bernstein, is ranked No. 19, with $48.3 billion in assets under management. There are three newcomers in the bottom half. Boston-based SCS Financial, founded just 12 years ago, is ranked at No. 40, as Los Angeles–based Capital Group’s Private Client Services joins the group at No. 33. After electing not to participate last year, Brown Advisory from Baltimore returns to the 2014 list in the 34th position.

The leading candidate for secretary of state remains Rudy Giuliani, and Steven Mnuchin is the top candidate for treasury secretary.  For commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross is far and away the leading candidate. An ally during Trump’s election campaign, the 78-year-old mild-spoken Ross is known for rescuing the types of old-fashioned industrial businesses that Trump has vowed to revive: steel, mining and textiles.  Play Video On The Road Trump's national security team taking shape After a week of tough headlines about the Trump transition in disarray, it appears that the team is starting to take shape. Alabama Sen. Jeff Ses... Ross is chairman of WL Ross & Co., an investment firm that specializes in corporate restructuring. As commerce secretary, Ross would serve as the country’s chief business promoter and overseer of trade and investment issues, in addition to running the Census Bureau and Patent and Trademark Office. The billionaire who may run the Commerce Department Ross will meet with Mr. Trump this weekend at Bedminster to finalize the deal. He wants the job and the president-elect, by all accounts, is eager to give it to him. As for Giuliani, the Trump transition has sought assurances, which I am told have been given, from Senate GOP leaders that he can be confirmed. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is prepared support Giuliani -- this was discussed when Mr. Trump met earlier this week with Kissinger. The transition team has also reached out to another former secretary of state, Gen. Colin Powell (ret.), and I am told he is generally supportive of the former New York City mayor.  Trump transition to the White House - live blog Mnuchin has been the clear front runner to head Treasury, but JP Morgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon was, for a brief period last weekend, a very real contender. Mr. Trump thought that Dimon’s star status in the financial world could be an asset, but campaign officials argued persuasively to Trump he needed a close friend and confidant to speak on his behalf in all negotiations with Congress over his economic agenda and policies. They argued successfully that Dimon could not carry the voice of Trump the way Mnuchin would. CBS News’ Aimee Picchi contributed to this report. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

"Couldn't Fannie and Freddie rely on you to do your job?" U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Wesley asked.The lawsuit was one of 18 filed by the FHFA in 2011 over some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that banks sold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FHFA has acted as conservator for Fannie and Freddie since their 2008 government takeover.The case is so far the only case to reach trial, after the regulator obtained nearly $17.9 billion in settlements from institutions that include Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) Following a non-jury trial, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who presided over most of the cases, ruled against Nomura, which sponsored $2 billion of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, and RBS, which underwrote four of the deals.The judge ruled that the offering documents did not correctly describe the mortgage loans. She awarded $806 million. The banks later agreed to pay another $33 million for costs and attorneys' fees subject to the appeal's outcome. At Friday's arguments, Kathleen Sullivan, the FHFA's lawyer, urged the court uphold that ruling, saying the evidence showed the bonds' offering documents falsely represented the quality of the mortgages."We had every reason to rely on their representations," she said.The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Nomura Holding America Inc et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-1872.

The pilot episode of the series Long Island Lights won Best New Media/Series at the Hollywood Boulevard Film Festival and the IndieFest Film awards. It also copped the Best Web Series/New Media at the Los Angeles International Film Festival Awards and was also a semifinalist at the Los Angeles Cinefest. The pilot episode was screened at the Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, California, last month. Conceived by A.J. Scordio, a graduate of Paul D. Schreiber Senior High School and Bucknell University, Long Island Lights is a half-hour comedy about a group of misfits at an amateur production company on Long Island who are hungry to become rich and famous. It was inspired Scordio’s life story; he quit his promising career at JPMorgan Chase to pursue his dream of becoming a filmmaker. According to a press release, “It features the romantic story lines and coworker drama of The Office, the goofy family dysfunction of Arrested Development and the dark and often raunchy humor of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. In today’s social media frenzy, fame can appear so accessible to everyone, and this hapless group is determined to become Hollywood famous and they’re doing it on Long Island. So they come up with these crazy ideas and stumble every step of the way on their journey to become famous…even if it means being infamous. “We watch them fail over and over again but the real success comes in the bonds that they form with one another,” the release added. The crew filmed numerous scenes in Port Washington, Huntington, Baiting Hollow, Riverhead as well as Brooklyn and Times Square.

Judging by who Trump is considering for Treasury secretary, Wall Street banks could have unprecedented influence Gary Legum Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics: Donald trump administration, Jamie Dimon, Jeb Hensarling, Seth Mnuchin, Treasury Secretary, Business News, News, Politics News Steve Mnuchin; Jamie Dimon; Jeb Hensarling (Credit: AP/Carolyn Kaster/Richard Drew/Carolyn Kaster) Donald Trump may have sounded like an economic populist to his voters during the presidential campaign, but his administration is shaping up to be the best thing to happen to Wall Street since the Roaring ’20s, that regulation-free era that preceded the Great Depression. And we know how well that worked out for the nation. This might sound like hyperbole, but Politico yesterday quoted an historian to back it up: “You would have to go back to the 1920s to see so much Wall Street influence coming to Washington,” said Charles Geisst, a Wall Street historian at Manhattan College. “It’s the most dramatic turnaround one could imagine. That’s the truly astonishing part.” It’s a little scary when historians are saying that the major Wall Street banks had even less power in Washington during our recent period of deregulation, which spanned the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, than they probably will have over the upcoming four to eight years of the Orange Reign. And it is also a remarkable turnaround since Trump spent so much of his general election campaign bashing Hillary Clinton for her ties to Wall Street. This came after a bruising Democratic primary in which Bernie Sanders bashed her for the same reason. Sanders’s popularity and Trump’s win, the pundits said, indicated an ascendant populist mood in the country. The fact that, in Trump’s case at least, said populism was a distraction meant to keep his fans from noticing that he would be restoring all the old Wall Street thieves and lackwits to prominent positions in Washington was duly noted by liberals but did not break through to enough voters. Or if it did, they did not care. Trump, of course, is spinning his economic plans as the responsible way to unleash the great power of the American economy. From his transition website: Federal policy should focus on free enterprise, while protecting consumers by policing markets for force and fraud. Both Wall Street and Washington should be held accountable. To hold Wall Street accountable, Trump has been looking to name a Treasury secretary who will do anything but. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has been in the running and according to CNBC he’s pitching hard for the gig — what wolf wouldn’t to get into the sheep pen? Right now, however, the top contender is said to be another wolf: Seth Mnuchin, a longtime Goldman Sachs executive and hedge fund manager. Mnuchin was recently the CEO of a regional bank, OneWest, which was previously known as IndyMac. The bank was one of the major players in the foreclosure crisis during the Great Recession and is accused of fraudulently foreclosing on thousands of homes, particularly those owned by seniors and low-income minorities who did not have the resources to pursue legal recourse. Mnuchin, by the way, is not a fan of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act signed by President Barack Obama, which was intended to rein in some of the banking practices by which Mnuchin made his fortune. Since one of Trump’s goals for the entire campaign has been the repeal of the Dodd-Frank act and because the deregulation-happy Republicans who control Congress share that goal, you can expect that legislation, signed in 2010 in response to the banking excesses that brought on the Great Recession, to disappear into the mists of history once Mnuchin is confirmed. Trump is also said to be considering Rep. Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican, for Treasury secretary. If Hensarling does not get the job, he’ll still be a valuable ally. He chairs the House Finance Committee and champions something called the Financial CHOICE Act, which would act as essentially a repeal of most of Dodd-Frank’s more restrictive measures. Though now that Trump is in office, maybe he’ll just chuck the act (whose acronym stands for Creating Hope and Opportunity for Investors, Consumers and Entrepreneurs) and help dispense with Dodd-Frank altogether. In other words, the Trump administration is setting itself up to roll back the hard-won financial regulations put in place after the Great Recession, which could unleash the financial monoliths of Wall Street whose reckless actions brought it about in the first place. And Trump will do so quickly, likely as fast as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan can push legislation through Congress. Congressional Republicans are also likely going to use this new business-friendly atmosphere to destroy or at least hamstring the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the baby of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who helped set it up in 2010 before her run for the Senate. Republicans have been gunning for the CFPB, which helps protect consumers from predatory businesses. According to The Huffington Post, the CFPB has found redress for 27 million consumers to the tune of nearly $12 billion in its short history. The GOP now plans to rein in the CFPB, possibly by naming recently retired Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Texas, to run it. Neugebauer, who like Hensarling has ties to the payday loan industry, has long opposed the CFPB. So putting him in charge of it is the proverbial case of the fox guarding the henhouse. Considering that Trump spent his entire campaign taking on the mantle of the economically downtrodden common man, destroying the CFPB would seem to be at odds with the populist wave that allegedly swept him into office. But there is no reason to think he’ll fight Congress on this or stand up for the type of consumers the agency has helped. Why would he? His entire business history is replete with examples of him screwing over working people. If the Wall Street powers that are already cashing in on Trump’s administration have their way, his voters will soon discover just how much snake oil they bought with their votes. Whether any of them will care is a whole other question. More Gary Legum. Comments Loading Comments...

(CRM) Stock Cruises on Yet Another Beat Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Challenged by … PetSmart, Inc. (PETM)?? View All Posts Trying to catch dry bulk shipper DryShips Inc. (NASDAQ:DRYS) has been like trying to catch a greased pig — only a lot more profitable for the fortunate. DRYS stock has put together gains of about 260% in just the small bit of time since Election Day. But a few things have happened in between here and there. At its best, DryShips stock returned nearly 1,900%. However, yesterday, shares dropped some 75%, crushing anyone who tried to chase the stock in its breakneck run higher. Listen, we said DRYS would burn you. Such is the nature of irrational, overnight exuberance. What the Heck Is Going On? Part of the thanks should go to President-elect Donald Trump, if you managed to get in and out at the right points. Prior to Trump’s victory, DRYS stock was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, selling assets and undergoing reverse stock splits and all sorts of financial engineering shenanigans to stay afloat. Then, as JPMorgan analyst Noah Parquette noted, “The dry bulk shipping sector (went) bananas since Trump was elected,” as traders were emboldened by improvements in shipping rates and DryShips’ limited amount of shares. 7 Stocks to Buy From the Scrap Heap The intense run-up prompted the Nasdaq to halt DRYS stock for the entirety of Wednesday’s session, seeking more information for the sudden gains. Then, on Thursday, DryShips decided to leverage its recent fortune, announcing it had entered into a deal to sell convertible preferred stock in the neighborhood of $20 million to Kalani Investments Ltd. Kalani has the right to convert its preferred shares into common stock of DRYS at $30 per share. That deal could see DryShips receive as much as $80 million if all warrants are exercised, and could give Kalani control of about 76% to 98% of the company. The proceeds, according to DRYS, will go to paying down its debt and to “general corporate purposes.” Investors obviously disapproved of the dilution and below-value cash raise. So when trading resumed on Thursday, they sold DryShips stock off en masse. Buy that wasn’t the end.

(Photo: iStock) (Bloomberg) -- The booming demand for hot exchange-traded funds has finally caught up with the staid, sleepy insurance industry. U.S. insurers are the latest group of investors to start buying ETFs en masse, with one of the fastest adoption rates among institutions. And they’re not done yet, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Mark Snyder, who helps oversee funds for the industry. Insurance companies are holding an estimated $200 billion in cash and another $80 billion in equities that could be reallocated, he said, and by shifting some of their portfolios about $25 billion to $50 billion could flow into ETFs.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: A U.S. appeals court appeared unlikely on Friday to overturn an order requiring Nomura Holdings Inc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc to pay US$839 million for making false statements while selling mortgage-backed securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Lawyers for both banks urged the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York to reverse a 2015 ruling that followed a non-jury trial in lawsuit by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) over mortgage bonds sold before the 2008 financial crisis. David Tulchin, Nomura's lawyer, argued a lower-court judge had no basis to find the alleged false statements were material, arguing she excluded evidence showing mortgage giants Fannie and Freddie knew of the loan underwriting practices at issue. "The district court excluded all evidence that Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or any reasonable investor standing in their shoes knew about the underwriting practices at the time," he said. But several members of the three-judge panel questioned Tulchin and RBS's lawyer about how that would excuse the banks if they made representations about the quality of the loans that Fannie and Freddie relied on in buying the mortgage bonds. "Couldn't Fannie and Freddie rely on you to do your job?" U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Wesley asked. The lawsuit was one of 18 filed by the FHFA in 2011 over some US$200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that banks sold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FHFA has acted as conservator for Fannie and Freddie since their 2008 government takeover. The case is so far the only case to reach trial, after the regulator obtained nearly US$17.9 billion in settlements from institutions that include Bank of America Corp , JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG Following a non-jury trial, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who presided over most of the cases, ruled against Nomura, which sponsored US$2 billion of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, and RBS, which underwrote four of the deals. The judge ruled that the offering documents did not correctly describe the mortgage loans. She awarded US$806 million. The banks later agreed to pay another US$33 million for costs and attorneys' fees subject to the appeal's outcome. At Friday's arguments, Kathleen Sullivan, the FHFA's lawyer, urged the court uphold that ruling, saying the evidence showed the bonds' offering documents falsely represented the quality of the mortgages. "We had every reason to rely on their representations," she said. The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Nomura Holding America Inc et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-1872.

Read More. @matt_levine Nov 18, 2016 9:26 AM EST a | A By Matt Levine Book-building. Here's how you sell bonds. You are an investment bank working for a company that wants to sell $1 billion of bonds. You go out and market the bonds, find people who want to buy them, take their orders, and "build a book" of demand. Eventually you get $1 billion worth of orders. But you can't stop there: If people want to buy exactly $1 billion worth of bonds, then their price will be pretty fragile; if even one investor decides to sell them, there'll be no one around to buy. It is not great for your reputation to underwrite deals that drop in price immediately. So you can't consider the deal a success until you have a nice cushion, say $2 billion worth of orders. Once you have that comfortable cushion, you stop, and price the deal, and issue the bonds. But there's a problem -- two problems, really. The first problem is that you have $2 billion of orders for $1 billion of bonds, so you have to decide who gets the bonds. (You can't decide by price; the point is that you want $2 billion of orders at the deal price.) These decisions are ... awkward. You have your own preferences: Investors who give you a lot of business, or whom you like hanging out with, will get bigger allocations of popular deals than customers you barely know. Your issuer client's preferences might matter too: Investors who will probably hold on to the bonds, or even buy more, are better than investors who will quickly flip them. You also have preferences in your role as a repeat gate-keeper of the capital markets: Investors who helped get the last difficult deal done, or who will help with the next one, should be rewarded with big allocations in popular deals. But there are conflicts, and favoritism, and investors who are frozen out often feel aggrieved. Every so often you read about regulators investigating these allocation practices. The second problem flows from the first. Everyone knows that you will be taking more orders than there are bonds. So they know that if they put in an order for $50 million of bonds, they may only get $25 million. So if they really want $50 million, they have to do something about it. One thing they can do is say "hey, we are a great customer, we really want $50 million, please help us out." That might work, if they really are a great customer. Another thing they can do is put in an order for $100 million. But if lots of customers do that, then you need to take even more orders for the same-sized deal. If you get $2 billion of orders for a $1 billion deal, but everyone has inflated their demand by 100 percent, then you still have barely enough orders to price the deal. So you take $3 billion, just to be safe. (And if they know you're doing that, then their orders get even bigger, etc.) So you get $20 billion bond deals with $50 billion or $80 billion worth of orders. That's a lot of demand! Some of it is real, and the deals are hot, and the allocation process is contested. But some of it is fake, because people know they're not getting $50 million worth of bonds unless they put in orders for $100 million. Oh, one other thing that happens along the way is that as you are building the book, investors will ask you "how's it going," and you will respond "good." Because if you respond "bad," they're not going to put in an order, because who wants to buy bonds that no one else wants?  All of this is pretty intuitive. But it also ... creates ... the possibility ... of some dishonesty? Like, that investor who puts in an order for $100 million might really, in her heart of hearts, want only $50 million. She is being a bit dishonest with you. When investors call you up and ask how the deal is going, and you say "good, great, almost done," when really you only have $100 million worth of orders, you are being a bit dishonest with them. And when you go to the company with $3 billion worth of orders for a $1 billion deal, and the company says "hey wait why don't we just lower the interest rate a bit," and you say "no we can't do that because then all the demand will vanish" -- you might be right, in some broad sense, but the company might also have reason to doubt you and think that you just want a hot deal to allocate among your investor buddies.  It's a market! It's the bond market. People expect a certain amount of dishonesty, of fudging, of bluffing, of concealing information, of looking out for one's own best interests. But those excuses don't feel as good these days as they used to. The basic small-scale dishonesty that has long lubricated the bonds markets may now just be illegal. There have been criminal and civil cases against bond traders who misrepresented their positions to customers in ways that "have been tolerated for years." The new-issue book-building and allocation process, with its own customary mild dishonesty, looks ripe for disruption. Anyway today the FICC Markets Standards Board, a U.K.-based trade organization made up of big investors, issuers and investment banks (and set up at the suggestion of the U.K. Treasury, Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority), released its "New Issue Process Standard for the Fixed Income Markets." The standards are intended to make all of this a bit more honest. For instance: Core Principle 3: Lead banks should agree a strategy on book disclosure frequency with the issuer before opening the book of investor interest. Any disclosure should be made public and must be accurate and not misleading at the time it is made. Out: someone calling you up, asking how the deal is going, and you responding "good" when it's bad. In: you telling everyone, on a pre-set schedule, honestly, how the deal is going. Or: Core Principle 5: Investors should be mindful that all orders: (i) should be a true representation of their demand; (ii) should take into account their investment limitations; and (iii) should be clear, fair and not misleading. Out: putting in a $100 million order for a hot deal when you only want $50 million. In: putting in a $50 million order, but looking very solemn when you do.  Trump regulation etc. I said last week: "If you are the law firm associate drafting the extensive flowchart showing how to comply with a recent controversial Obama financial regulation, you must feel a bit like you're wasting your time," what with all the bold but vague talk about how the Trump administration will roll back financial rules. I was thinking mostly of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, a firm that has produced many of our era's defining financial-regulatory flowcharts. (Try their Volcker Rule flowcharts! There are two!) But they are moving right along, and they have produced, if not exactly a flowchart, at least a pretty comprehensive chart of what one major proposal -- the "Financial CHOICE Act," which would repeal a lot of the Dodd-Frank Act and do a bunch of other stuff -- would mean for financial regulation. I should clarify that, while law firm associates might feel a bit sad about tearing up all their Obama-era regulatory flowcharts, law firm partners are undoubtedly thrilled about the coming vast, piecemeal and uncertain changes to financial regulation. Just when they were winding up billing clients to help them respond to Dodd-Frank, now they can start billing clients to help them prepare for Financial CHOICE -- and whatever comes after that. Wild uncertain swings in financial regulation are probably bad for finance, but they're great for lawyers. Anyway go read the chart if you want. I may wait for actual legislation? But if you're a bank, I guess you should start preparing now. Incidentally, if you are a bank, the news isn't all good: House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, the main sponsor of the Financial CHOICE Act, may want to repeal the Volcker Rule, but he is also a semi-populist who talks a lot about ending "too big to fail": “Wall Street has long believed Hensarling is their obstacle to getting reasonable compromise,” said Mark Calabria, a financial regulation expert at the conservative think tank Cato Institute. “There’s a perception that he’s an ideologue who won’t compromise. When bankers go into meet with him, they feel like they are getting a lecture.” But there's something else. Here's Politico: “There is a joke going around here that if I’d have known how good Trump was going to be for Wall Street, I’d have campaigned for him,” said one Goldman Sachs executive who declined to be identified by name speaking about the incoming president. “What people are reacting to is this incredible cultural shift. People thought it might be 10 or 15 years until regulators stopped demanding heads and now all of a sudden you can envision it happening overnight.” The Volcker Rule -- the rule that banks can't engage in "proprietary trading" -- isn't just the Volcker Rule; its effects go beyond the letter of the law. They are cultural and symbolic; they stand for the idea that trading, risk-taking, swagger are out of place in modern banks. The post-crisis period has been a dull gray time for the big banks. They make less money on trading, they pay more money in fines, and they generally feel unloved and unpopular, especially compared to tech unicorns and fintech startups. It is not 2007 any more; investment banks are not the cool place to be. Rolling back the last eight years of regulation won't necessarily change that: The culture, and the economy, have moved on for their own reasons. But you can see why nostalgic bankers might take some hope from it. Another view: "Bankers predict Trump will not reshape regulatory agenda." Elsewhere, he sighed heavily: "Trump’s Changes to the Tax Codes May Encourage Dynastic Wealth." "Mnuchin’s Bank Accused of Redlining Black, Latino Home Buyers." "The Glory Days of Elizabeth Warren’s CFPB Are Numbered." "How Republicans Plan to Spend Like Crazy Without Running Up Debt." "An NFL Executive Thinks Football Will Thrive Under Trump Because America Will Be ‘More Raw and Brutal.’" And the president-elect is trying to delay the fraud trial over his fake university until after he is inaugurated. Jamie Dimon. When should I stop beating the drum for Jamie Dimon to be Treasury Secretary? He has apparently already said no, repeatedly, so there's that. I suppose when Donald Trump names someone else, that will be a reason for me to stop. But what if the Senate doesn't confirm him? What if Trump fires him? Let's keep a slow fire burning under Dimon for a little while, no? You know who can help with that? All the people named in this article about Dimon's possible successors as Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Daniel Pinto, Doug Petno, Mary Erdoes, Marianne Lake, Matt Zames: This is a rare opportunity for you to combine patriotic duty with personal ambition. Maybe whisper in Dimon's ear a bit, see what happens. Also, a word on that list. I think of JPMorgan as being like the old General Electric Co., a training ground for generalist managerial talent. So the fact that Petno runs commercial banking, say, or that Zames is a former fixed-income trader with London Whale cleanup experience doesn't necessarily tell you what to expect from them. If Petno is the next CEO, that doesn't mean that JPMorgan is re-focusing on commercial banking; Zames doesn't mean a return to high-risk bond and derivatives trading. But if Dimon does leave, it will be at least a little tempting to interpret his choice of successor as a sign of the new cultural climate for universal banks. Congrats TeslaCity! The biggest shareholder of SolarCity Corporation is Elon Musk. Musk is also the biggest shareholder of Tesla Motors Inc. He is also the chief executive officer and chairman of the board at Tesla, and the board chairman at SolarCity. (There are other connections.) He wanted to merge Tesla and SolarCity. The boards of the two companies -- with conflicted directors, like Musk, recused -- thought about it and approved the deal. They put it to shareholders. Musk called it a "no-brainer." Some investors complained that it was a conflicted bailout of Musk's troubled solar company by his more stable car company. Institutional Shareholder Services recommended voting for the deal. Glass Lewis & Co. recommended against, calling it a "thinly veiled bailout plan." Yesterday shareholders voted, and the deal passed with about 85 percent of the (non-Musk) vote. The second biggest shareholder of SolarCity is FMR LLC, the reporting entity for Fidelity, the giant mutual fund company. FMR is also the second biggest shareholder of Tesla. The third biggest shareholder of SolarCity is the Vanguard Group, which is also the fifth-biggest holder of Tesla. The Bank of Montreal and BlackRock are both top-10 holders of both companies. That doesn't always mean that their interests are aligned -- Fidelity has lots of different funds, and presumably some of them own Tesla but not SolarCity or vice versa -- but there is clearly some overlap. If the deal really was a bailout for SolarCity, some Tesla shareholders would have liked it anyway, because they are also SolarCity shareholders. There is also an obvious investing-thesis overlap. Tesla and SolarCity are in different though vaguely related (renewable energy, etc.) businesses. But apart from that, Tesla is run by Elon Musk, and SolarCity is ... let's say, spiritually affiliated with Elon Musk. You might invest in Tesla or SolarCity because you like cars or solar panels, but you might also invest because you like Elon Musk. "Vision is what Tesla’s shareholders are buying into," and Musk's vision encompasses SolarCity. If you invest in Tesla because you like Elon Musk, then acquiring SolarCity just gives you more Elon Musk. What's not to like?  We talk a lot about the governance and antitrust implications of diversified shareholders -- like Fidelity and Vanguard -- owning shares in multiple companies in the same industry. These shareholders, the theory goes, will push companies to compete less, since their main incentive is to maximize overall industry profits. But they'll also be more welcoming to mergers: Target shareholders won't demand huge takeover premiums if they are also shareholders of the acquirer. They'll share in the profits either way. The first objection isn't really relevant here: Tesla and SolarCity are in different businesses and never really competed with each other. But the second might be. Should we care? Musk's interests, as a huge shareholder of both Tesla and SolarCity, aren't necessarily aligned with the interests of a Tesla-only or SolarCity-only shareholder. But they are aligned with the interests of a broadly diversified investor. The broadly diversified investor is increasingly the norm. Should mergers-and-acquisitions decisions start catering to her?  People are worried about unicorns. Jonathan Badeen is a co-founder of Tinder. He is very rich. This is why: About half way through my shower I realized I forgot to turn on the fan. No big deal, it happens all the time. When I stepped out, the room was especially foggy. I wiped the mirror clean, but within a minute it was fogging up again. I wiped it clean a second time, only this time, I wiped in the opposite direction. I saw a familiar face looking back at me in the clear sliver of the mirror that my hand had just…swiped. The coolest of stories, from the bro-est of bros. I don't care that Tinder is not technically a unicorn. Meanwhile, Airbnb has apparently decided that its future is as a travel agency?  Airbnb said Thursday that it is expanding beyond its core short-term rental business, which faces pushback from local governments around the world, to become a fuller service travel agency. In a step toward that, the company launched a service called Trips, which will provide tours, tailored activities and other experiences. Disruptive! And Udacity, an online learning startup, is moving into the gig economy for startup workers? The program, called Blitz, provides what is essentially a brief contract assignment, much like an internship. Employers tell Udacity the skills they need, and Udacity suggests a single candidate or a few. For the contract assignment, which usually lasts about three months, Udacity takes a fee worth 10 to 20 percent of the worker’s salary. If the person is then hired, Udacity does not collect any other fees, such as a finder’s fee. This is about improving and democratizing the hiring process, reducing reliance on elite-school pedigrees, etc. I think. Or is it about making high-skilled technical jobs as temporary and precarious as Uber driving gigs?  Elsewhere, here's a story about ties between Peter Thiel's Palantir Technologies, the Spy Unicorn, and Michael Flynn, the apparent incoming national security adviser. And: "Tech IPOs Want to Get Ahead of Trump." People are worried about bond market liquidity. Here's a Center for American Progress report from this week called "Phantom Illiquidity." "There simply are not, at present, broad or significant liquidity issues in the fixed-income markets," say the authors. "What’s more, the entire theoretical foundation of the illiquidity argument is off base. Dealers do not jump into the market—known as catching the falling knife—to provide liquidity during times of market stress." And: "Rather than trying to undo financial reform, regulators should stay the course and ensure strong, reliable capital and regulatory approaches." Tough timing on that one! Me yesterday.

Now he is president-elect, things are different. Ahead of the election, Trump was adamant about what he thought of bankers in general. "I know Wall Street. I know the people on Wall Street… I'm not going to let Wall Street get away with murder. Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us," he said. Trump has had run-ins with bankers over decades, during his patchy business career that has seen him amass fortunes in real estate and lose big bucks in failed projects.

Fox News Fox Business News Is It Time to Bail on Bank of America? By John Maxfield - November 18, 2016 69 Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Continue Reading Below Given that Bank of America‘s (NYSE: BAC) stock has outperformed its closest competitors and reached a new 52-week high this month, there’s a growing sense that investors should try to call the top and sell its shares. BAC data by YCharts. More From Fool.com Be wary of bad advice Consider this recent headline from Barron’s: Bank of America: Three Reasons It’s Time to Bail.To be fair, despite the headline, the article doesn’t say that investors should sell their Bank of America shares. It instead quotes a report from Guggenheim’s Eric Wasserstrom and Jeff Cantwell that downgrades the bank from buy to hold. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT The rationale in the report is threefold. First, Bank of America’s shares are now within 10% of Guggenheim’s fair value estimate. Second, any additional upside in its shares will be macro-driven — i.e., outside of Bank of America’s control. And third, Bank of America’s valuation is now in line with the bank’s historical level relative to its peer group. All of these things may be true, but given the headline of the piece it’d still be easy for shareholders to conclude that the article by Barron’s, a respected and storied media company, is urging Bank of America’s shareholder to shed their stakes. As a shareholder myself, I think this is bad advice. Bank of America’s best days are still ahead While Donald Trump’s victory in last week’s presidential election isn’t without controversy, it’s become clear that banks may be some of the biggest beneficiaries given Trump’s promise to spur economic growth and roll back significant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Most importantly, if Trump’s administration adopts the approach recommended by Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, who was purportedly being considered by Trump for Treasury Secretary, then it’s almost certain that banks’ earnings will dramatically improve. This follows from Hensarling’s proposal to free well-capitalized banks from the suffocating capital and liquidity standards that have been enacted by financial regulators over the past few years. This would allow Bank of America to redirect potentially hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of its assets from low-yielding government bonds into higher-yielding loans. This alone would materially improve Bank of America’s earnings. On top of this, if Trump is able to stimulate the economy through lower taxes and increased spending on infrastructure, as he says he’s focused on doing, then Bank of America would benefit in two ways. A healthier economy would increase loan demand, and it’d also likely translate into higher inflation, which would free the Federal Reserve up to raise interest rates. Just how much might this help Bank of America? In its latest quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, its 10-Q, the bank forecasts that a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates would translate into an additional $5.3 billion in net interest income. To put that in perspective, Bank of America currently earns only around $5 billion a quarter in net income. And the benefits don’t end there, as Trump has also promised to dismantle major portions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. One such change could be to take away the Federal Reserve’s ability to veto big bank capital plans — namely, dividend and share buybacks. Working in concert with higher earnings flowing from an improved economy and higher interest rates, this would almost certainly translate into a substantial increase in Bank of America’s quarterly dividend. Indeed, even after the North Carolina-based bank raised its dividend by 50%earlierthis year, to $0.075 per share, it could still double it from here while maintaining a dividend payout ratio in line with its closest competitors, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. It’s those kind of things that lead to a rapid increase in value over time. Thus, while there’s no getting around the fact that Bank of America’s shares aren’t as attractive today as they were at the beginning of November, it would be silly for shareholders to interpret this as a signal to sell their stakes in the nation’s second biggest bank by assets.

Embed from Getty Images   Bloomberg News reports that bankers are gaining confidence that U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will be able to secure a lengthy transition period that would carry them over from the current rules to whatever fresh terms of trade are agreed with the EU, according to two people with knowledge of their firm’s contingency plans. That’s led to more measured language from many of the industry’s leaders. “Wait and see is also UBS’s attitude toward Brexit," UBS Chairman Axel Weber said Wednesday at a conference in the U.K. capital. “No doubt London will remain an important financial center. UBS will be here.” The shift in tone, also evident from banks including JPMorgan and Barclays, comes after May sought to quell fears in the finance industry that her government wouldn’t fight to protect it from the fallout of Brexit when negotiations begin early next year. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney also called this week for a long transition period to give banks a chance to adapt.

The dollar reached its highest level in almost 14 years and U.S. bond yields soared amid growing expectations the policies of President-elect Donald Trump could push up inflation. However, Yellen said his victory had done nothing to change Fed plans for a rate rise "relatively soon." Emerging market equities fell 0.6 percent and were on course for their fourth week of losses. "The Fed hiking cycle will be more aggressive and persistent than before," said Jakob Christensen, head of emerging markets research at Danske Bank. "So countries with large dollar debt or large external imbalances will be more vulnerable than before, and there will be more pressure on emerging markets." Currencies struggled against the strong dollar with Turkey's lira down nearly 1 percent to a record low and on track to weaken for the fourth straight week. "It's a perfect storm they are facing from higher U.S. yields, a stronger dollar and the geopolitical uncertainty, and the big unknown is (President Tayyip) Erdogan - what direction policy will take in Turkey," said Danske Bank's Christensen. The Mexican peso, a lightning rod for market anxiety over Trump, more than matched the lira's fall. Investors were disappointed the central bank raised rates by only 50 basis points to 5.25 percent on Thursday to stem the sell-off, which saw the currency plunge to record lows after the election. Analysts had hoped the bank would raise rates by 75 bps. However, the peso was on track to end the week a touch stronger. Asian currencies fared little better with China's yuan falling to an eight-year low. The Malaysian ringgit languished at a 10-month trough, with the country's central bank saying the latest steps to support the currency were not capital controls, ahead of its next interest rate decision next Wednesday. In emerging Europe, currencies stayed near the lows hit last week, with Poland's zloty weakening 0.3 percent against the euro, weighed down by the introduction of a new pension bill raising concerns about fiscal sustainability. Hungary's forint slipped 0.2 percent. Flow data released on Friday reflected investors' frayed nerves over emerging market assets. They pulled $6.4 billion from dedicated bond funds after the U.S. presidential election, the biggest weekly outflow on record, according to JPMorgan. Emerging market equity funds also suffered outflows, haemorrhaging $6.2 billion, the most since August 2015, undoing 35 percent of inflows year-to-date. Investors were also awaiting a ratings review of Hungary from Fitch due later in the day. Moody's will review Bosnia, Serbia and Uganda.

"The surprise scrapping of what amounted to 86% of the cash in circulation could, in fact, turn out to be the worst mistake of Mr Modi's career," the London-based weekly wrote.  The dominance of cash-based transactions in many sectors of the economy and the lack of banking facilities in many parts of India makes Modi's move a wrong gambit, according to the magazine. "For many among the estimated 80 percent of wage earners who are paid in cash, for the tens of thousands of villages with no banking facilities, and for the traders, drivers, farmers, prostitutes, beggars and others who work in the 'informal' economy that accounts for anywhere between 25 percent and 70 percent of India's GDP, it has brought anxiety and hardship," the weekly, which has rarely taken a favourable view of Modi and the BJP, wrote. The Financial Times preferred to call it a significant move in Modi's avowed decision to crackdown on black money, starting with the tracking of large cash transactions, typically done at luxury and jewellery stores.  "The campaign hit its apogee last week, with New Delhi's surprise ban on the use of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes — a radical action intended to catch black money hoarders," the daily wrote. Besides, the decision, which the BJP prefers to call a "surgical strike on black money," is ill-advised in an economy where cash transactions are prevalent in a big way, according to the Financial Times, besides raising doubts on the benefits of such a decision. An analyst at JPMorgan told the daily that it's difficult to assess the impact on India's economy. "No country has done this kind of shock therapy. We don't have any precedents of doing anything of this sort. We are flying by the seat of our pants," Jahangir Aziz, global emerging markets analyst at JPMorgan, told the Financial Times.  It said that such unprecedented measures are undertaken only during exceptionally bad conditions "such as in Germany after the second world war, or the former Soviet Union — or in the throes of hyperinflation," and not by a country like India that is growing at upwards of 7 percent.

WASHINGTON — The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to a 43-year low last week, pointing to a rapidly tightening labor market that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 235,000 for the week ended Nov. 12, the lowest level since November 1973, the Labor Department said Thursday. Claims for the prior week were unrevised. Claims have been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 89 straight weeks. That is the longest run since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 257,000 in the latest week. Rob Martin, an economist at Barclays Bank PLC, said the data points “to a pickup in employment growth relative to the past several months,” when job gains have been steady if unspectacular. “On the whole, we view incoming claims data as very supportive of further improvement in labor market conditions this year,” Martin said in a note to clients. A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's data and that no states had been estimated. Last week's data included the Veterans Day holiday, and claims tend to fall during weeks including a holiday. As such, last week's drop likely exaggerates labor market strength. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends because it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 6,500 to 253,500 last week. “Clearly the latest news ... sent an upbeat signal about the labor market,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan. Some of the drop may reflect last week's Veterans' Day holiday, Silver said. The government sometimes has difficulty seasonally adjusting for the holiday, Silver said, meaning that applications could bounce back up next week. The claims data covered the survey period for November nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims rose 1,500 between the September and October survey periods, still pointing to solid job gains this month. Employment increased by 161,000 jobs in October. “Jobless claims have not been a useful indicator of payroll gains for about the past two years,” noted Joshua Shapiro, chief economist at MFR Inc. The strong labor market, viewed as being at or near full employment, and steadily rising inflation are expected to encourage the Fed to hike interest rates at the Dec. 13-14 policy meeting. The central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade. Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 66,000 to 1.98 million in the week ended Nov. 5, the lowest reading since April 2000. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims fell 19,250 to 2.02 million. That was the lowest level since June 2000. More Business Cozy retirement?

Picture: REUTERS New York — Global stock indexes edged higher while the US dollar was little changed on Thursday after US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank could raise interest rates "relatively soon." Yellen, who was testifying on the economic outlook before the congressional Joint Economic Committee, indicated little had changed yet following the victory of Donald Trump in the November 8 US presidential election. She said she intended to serve out her term, which ends in 2018, and indicated the Fed remained on track to raise rates at its meeting next month. The dollar receded earlier in the day from a 13-and-a-half-year peak, though it turned higher after upbeat US economic data, that stoked expectations of an acceleration of US economic expansion in the fourth quarter, helped the dollar. The dollar index, tracking the greenback relative to a basket of key foreign currencies, was last up 0.1%. US stocks, which rallied after Republican Donald Trump’s surprise White House win, were mostly higher. "A December rate hike is priced in. A number of Fed speakers have indicated that and they want the market to be prepared for when they do," said Erik Wytenus, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. "The Fed, though, is sensitive to the strength of the dollar and they don’t want to hike too far too quickly." The Dow Jones industrial average was up 3.35 points, or 0.02%, to 18,871.49, the S&P 500 had gained 6.81 points, or 0.31%, to 2,183.75 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 24.57 points, or 0.46%, to 5,319.15. MSCI’s all-country world stock index was up 0.3%, while Europe’s STOXX 600 was up 0.5 percent. In the US bond market, the yield curve steepened after the U.S. data suggested the labour market is tightening and inflation is beginning to gain traction. That prompted investors to sell government debt with longer-dated maturities. US consumer prices posted their biggest increase in six months in October, while housing starts surged to a 9-year high and jobless claims fell to the lowest since November 1973. The 10-year note fell 11/32 in price to yield 2.263%. Earlier, the Bank of Japan offered to buy unlimited bonds for the first time under a revamped policy framework, as domestic debt yields surged in the wake of Donald Trump’s upset US election victory. More broadly, Japan’s efforts will raise questions about how far central banks such as the ECB and others will be willing to tolerate steep and sudden rises in government borrowing costs. Oil prices were higher as expectations of an OPEC deal to limit production outweighed global oversupply concerns. Brent crude oil was up 17c a barrel at $46.8, while US was up 28c at $45.85.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Nov 19, 2016 at 10:44AM Host of CNBC's Mad Money, Jim Cramer. Image source: Wikimedia Commons. CNBC host Jim Cramer certainly has his detractors, but I've found that a lot of his opinions tend to coincide with mine. His position on Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) offers a case in point. Cramer's opinion on Bank of America In an article this week, Cramer asked one of the most important questions facing prospective investors in Bank of America right now: Given the rapid ascent of its stock in the wake of the presidential election, is it too late to buy the bank's shares? Cramer doesn't think it is for two reasons. First, he believes that interest rates could soon rise in a series of multiple rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. And second, the incoming Trump administration's promises to roll back the suffocating regulatory regime under the Dodd-Frank Act will reduce compliance costs for Bank of America and thereby boost its bottom line. With regard to Bank of America's share price, here's where Cramer stands: I think the answer is that if you believe there are going to be multiple rate hikes, like I do, you wait to see if it gets back to $18, but that you accept that you may end up paying $20 because in this new regime I just don't think the buyers will let it go back to $16. Why I agree with Cramer I think Cramer is absolutely right. Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen said as much in testimony to Congress this week, praising the ongoing improvement in employment, inflation, and the economy more generally. The central bank's monetary policy committee thus concluded at its latest meeting that "the case for an increase in [the Fed Funds rate] had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon." Traders have already sent long-term interest rates surging in anticipation of such a move. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds climbed from around 1.8% at the time of the election to over 2.2% today. That's a huge move given the size of the market for 10-year Treasuries. It's also music to the ears of Bank of America, which stands to earn billions in additional net interest income as rates rise. 10 Year Treasury Rate data by YCharts. Additionally, if Trump follows through on his promise to cut taxes and boost spending on infrastructure projects, as well as to reduce regulations, then banks would be free to make a lot more loans. "We could lend more money if the capital levels were different," Bank of America chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan said earlier this year at a conference organized by The Wall Street Journal. The annual stress tests mandated by Dodd-Frank are a drag, as well, he said. "It will make you very safe," Moynihan said of the tests. "The question is whether it restricts lending." More loans will translate into higher profits The answer to that question is clearly yes. Not only do the stress test and capital requirements mean that banks have to keep more capital on their books as opposed to investing it in interest-earning assets, but the rules also dictate how banks allocate their assets between highly liquid securities and illiquid loans -- showing a clear preference for the former. At the end of the third quarter, which concluded on Sept. 30, Bank of America had $522 billion worth of so-called global liquidity sources -- namely cash and low yielding government securities. If it were able to reallocate a portion of that into higher yielding loans, it would stimulate both the economy and Bank of America's bottom line. Based on very rough math, for every $100 billion the bank cycled into loans, it'd earn $550 million or so in added net interest income a quarter, which would boost its earnings by upwards of 10%. It's also worth noting that Trump's reform agenda could very well remove the Fed's veto power over bank capital plans. Combined with higher earnings, that would free Bank of America up to double its quarterly dividend while still paying out a comparable share of its earnings to shareholders relative to banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Finally, even though Bank of America's shares have surged 18% since the presidential election, and are thus nowhere near as cheap as they were beforehand, they're still a far cry from expensive. They trade for a 17% discount to book value per share and an only 14% premium to its tangible book value per share. These are very reasonable valuations. The point being, just like Cramer says, if you're on the fence about buying Bank of America stock, your primary concern shouldn't be its price/valuation. Yes, its shares are more expensive than they were two weeks ago. But no, that doesn't mean that they don't have room to grow from here. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

The most common uncouth word to show up in conference calls over the last 10 years was "damn," as in "pretty damn profitable."Words like "a--" and "s---" also showed up hundreds of times across more than 100,000 transcripts in both positive and negative contexts ( as in "we kicked a--!"). Using a fairly wide definition of profanity that includes most words that are frowned upon in polite society, it's clear that a small number of companies are responsible for a good portion of foul language in conference calls. These include Cypress Semiconductor , Titan International , Scotts Miracle-Gro , Wynn Resorts and Emerson Electric . Major household names like T-Mobile and Yum Brands are also relatively high on the list. For the most part, executives stuck to the less offensive curse words, but there have only been a few instances of CEOs dropping f-bombs while talking to investors. We found thousands of profane words in the transcripts we searched, but use of the f-word tends to make people sit up and take notice. While profanity in earnings calls seems to be on the rise compared to the last few years, we didn't find any CEOs who had used an f-word in the last three years. One of the most famous examples was from Carol Bartz, CEO of Yahoo in 2009, who criticized the company for having too many management employees compared to engineers. Bartz immediately apologized on the call, saying "I knew that would slip out one of these times." At times, executives' ire was directed at specific analysts. In 2013, natural gas company Encana Corp apologized after an unknown employee could be heard whispering "f-----g a-----e" in response to an analyst's question. Enron's CEO also famously employed "a-----e" against a hedge fund manager who questioned the company's opaque accounting. Intuitively, the use of R-rated language in a conference call has the possibility to cast corporate leaders in a negative light if the profanity seems inappropriate or unprofessional. On the other hand, there is some evidence that using profanity selectively can make a person seem more intense and persuasive. If asked whether swear words make a person seem more trustworthy, people will often say no, but if asked to rate the credibility of statements with and without swearwords, the profanity actually seems to make the information seem more believable. As a composite index, the companies with relatively high levels of profanity don't seem to be harmed too much by their word choices. In fact, that index would have beaten the S&P 500 by about 40 points over the past decade, even if that gain is mostly driven by the potty mouths at a few large companies. Most of the businesses in the index have smaller market caps, so big companies like Mastercard and JPMorgan have outsized influence. Certainly not all profanity helps build confidence in a company. In 2007, CEO Albert Lord of Sallie Mae (SLM Corp ) failed to reassure investors who were growing nervous about certain mortgage-backed securities. The executive appeared "agitated" on the call, leading into a 21 percent drop in the company's stock price. "Let's go," Lord said as the conference call was wrapping up. "There's no questions. Let's get the f--- out of here." And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is...

Jeb Hensarling has an important ally in Vice President-elect Mike Pence, chairman of the Trump transition team. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) Alan K. Ota @Alan K. Ota Posted Nov 18, 2016 3:57 PM Save for later President-elect Donald Trump could face a classic choice between a Wall Street insider and a GOP strategist — investor Steve Mnuchin and House Financial Services Chairman, Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling — as he moves to replace outgoing Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew. Trump advisers such as investor Carl Icahn and Stephen Moore, a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, describe Mnuchin, Trump’s campaign finance director, as the front-runner for the Treasury post. But GOP allies of Hensarling — including Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, Sen. Ted Cruz and former Sen. Phil Gramm, all fellow Texans — say they believe Hensarling has emerged as a strong challenger after meeting with Trump on Thursday. Gramm said in an interview that the next Treasury secretary would need several qualities: “Knowing public finance, knowing the tax system and, obviously in this case, knowing how to dismantle Dodd-Frank. All of those would be helpful.” During the campaign, Hensarling visited Trump’s team in Manhattan to explain his proposal to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank, the 2010 financial services overhaul. Hensarling’s bill has broad GOP support. Trump’s choice may be a bellwether of his fiscal and regulatory priorities, and it may reveal whether he puts more value on an emissary to Wall Street or an architect of legislation with ties to Republicans. While Mnuchin has support from Icahn, Moore and other Trump associates, Hensarling has a key ally in Vice President-elect Mike Pence, chairman of the Trump transition team. In an interview this week, Hensarling described Pence as a friend, and recalled being a passenger on Pence’s campaign plane when it skidded off the runway at New York City’s LaGuardia Airport on Oct. 27. Both men also became well-acquainted as leaders of the conservative Republican Study Committee in the House. [Wall Stret Eyes Dodd-Frank Changes in Spending Bill] In his visit to Trump Tower on Thursday, Hensarling said he asked Trump to “tell me what position you want me to play” while also making clear that he was happy to remain a House chairman. “We were talking tax policy. We were talking Dodd-Frank. We were talking trade. This was a wonderful conversation,” Hensarling said. Gramm called Hensarling “the best and the brightest” and a quick study in the money and banking class that the former senator once taught as an economics professor at Texas A&M University. Gramm is now vice chairman of UBS Investment Bank and serves as a senior adviser for Gramm Partners, a consulting and lobbying firm. Cruz told Roll Call he agreed with Gramm’s assessment: “Jeb is smart, talented and principled. He does a terrific job representing Texans in the House, and I am sure he would do a terrific job in any number of positions in a new administration.” Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul played down the idea of picking a Treasury secretary with Wall Street experience in an interview and called Hensarling “a very bright congressman.” “I think it should be based on policy more than where you work and things,” Paul said. While Republicans weigh the Treasury candidates, many Democrats are focusing their fire on Mnuchin, chairman and co-CEO of Dune Capital Management. Liberal critics are taking jabs at Mnunchin’s role as a former Goldman Sachs executive and former owner of California-based OneWest Bank, which he sold last year. Two advocacy groups, the California Reinvestment Coalition and the Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California, filed a complaint with the Housing and Urban Development Department, charging that the bank failed to place enough branches or mortgage loans in minority communities. “I think we’ve had enough Goldman Sachs people running the Treasury Department. I think you need a perspective that represents working people and not Wall Street,” Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders said.  [Who’s Bankrolling Murphy and Rubio in Florida?] Sanders pointed to the Goldman Sachs experience of three former Treasury secretaries: Henry M. Paulson Jr., Larry Summers and Robert Rubin. If selected, Hensarling would be the first lawmaker to head the department since former Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat, under President Bill Clinton. Others mentioned as potential candidates for Treasury secretary include billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, chairman of a private equity firm; Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase; and Lawrence Kudlow, a CNBC commentator and former chief economist for Bear Stearns. If Hensarling is nominated for a new post, it would set up a competition to replace him as chairman, with several candidates including Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce of California, Frank D. Lucas of Okalahoma, Patrick T. McHenry of North Carolina, chief deputy whip; and Blaine Luetkemeyer of Missouri, a former banker and insurance agency operator. Lucas said Hensarling would be a strong choice for several administration jobs. “Whether it’s Treasury secretary or Office of Management and Budget director, or any other senior position, he would bring energy, enthusiasm, and a never-say-die spirit,” he said.

President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski told delegates gathering in Lima for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum that global trade has already stopped growing in the last two years and would get much worse if nations close off their economies. “It is fundamental that world trade grow again and that protectionism be defeated,” Kuczynski said. The Peruvian president cited the recent U.S. election, though he did not specifically mention President-elect Donald Trump, who pledged to overhaul the country’s trade policy and tear up trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. Kuczynski also cited the vote in June by Britain to leave the European Union as evidence that “protectionist tendencies are taking over” in the world. APEC has brought more than 1,000 delegates from 21 countries to Lima for a forum aimed at easing global commerce. President Obama was expected to arrive late Friday. — Associated Press ENERGY Pipeline firm seeks to meet with tribe The head of the company building the Dakota Access oil pipeline said Friday that the line will not be rerouted but that he would like to meet with the head of a Native American tribe to try to ease concerns about the project. Kelcy Warren, chief executive of Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners, said the company has no alternative than to stick to its plan for the $3.8 billion pipeline, which would ship oil from North Dakota to Illinois. “There’s not another way,” Warren said. He said he would like to meet with Dave Archambault, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, whose reservation is near the pipeline. Archambault said Friday that he’s willing to meet with Warren but is skeptical about the intent. “We already know what he’s going to say — that this is the cleanest, safest pipeline ever,” Archambault said. “What he doesn’t know is that this is still an issue for Standing Rock and all indigenous people.” The 1,200-mile, four-state pipeline is largely complete except for a section that would pump oil under Lake Oahe, a Missouri River reservoir in southern North Dakota. The Standing Rock tribe fears that a leak could contaminate the drinking water on its reservation and also threaten sacred sites, which Warren disputes. — Associated Press Also in Business ● The Federal Reserve is slamming a wedge into the revolving door between government and Wall Street by placing several restrictions on former officials who go to work for financial firms. The Fed expanded the number of its employees subject to a one-year ban on working for a company they have been overseeing, the agency said. New measures will also prohibit examiners from representing any financial firm before the regulator for one year and ban current Fed workers from talking about official matters with people who have left the agency within the last 12 months. The actions come on the heels of a $36.3 million settlement with Goldman Sachs over allegations that a former employee obtained confidential documents from a former colleague at the Fed. ● U.S. Treasury note yields rose to their highest levels of the year, spurred by technical positioning and expectations of higher inflation and interest rates after Trump’s election victory. The yield on U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.355 percent, the highest since Dec. 4, 2015. Yields on the 10-year note looked set to post their largest two-week rise since November 2001. Yields on all maturities have registered the largest two-week gains in more than five years as investors have dumped U.S. government debt since Election Day. ● A former JPMorgan Chase executive who spent eight years on the run in Argentina pleaded guilty to charges that he embezzled $5.4 million from clients at the bank and at a prior employer, UBS AG. Hernan Arbizu, who became involved in a tax-evasion probe involving JPMorgan Chase, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to charges including wire fraud and embezzlement. Arbizu, 48, was extradited in June from Argentina, where he is a citizen. He faces a mandatory minimum two-year prison sentence and a maximum of 422 years. — From news services business economy true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends in January 2018, reiterated the Fed's political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress' Joint Economic Committee. Economic data since Fed policymakers gathered in early November reinforced her view that the economy is making progress toward the Fed's goals on employment and inflation. She said that at the meeting, she and her colleagues believed that the case for a rate increase “had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon.” Analysts viewed Yellen's comments as an effort to put financial markets on notice that a rate hike is likely to occur at the Fed's last meeting of the year on Dec. 13-14. They noted that she dismissed a suggestion that increased market uncertainty after Trump's election might be cause for a delay. Asked whether it might be better to push back a move until January, Yellen said that uncertainty surrounding Trump's proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending could well last for a good deal longer than one month. “Yellen's testimony before Congress ... further cemented in place expectations that the Fed will hike rates next month,” said Michael Feroli, senior economist at JPMorgan. Asked about her own future, Yellen said it was “fully my intention” to remain as Fed chair until her four-year term ends in late January 2018. She said she could not imagine any circumstance that would cause her to leave early, addressing speculation that she might step down once Trump takes office, given his critical comments of her during the election campaign. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 and projected that it could raise rates as many as four times in 2016. But it deferred as the U.S. economy went through a prolonged soft-patch. The rate has remained in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent for the entire year. The rate had been at a record low near zero for seven years. Economists are forecasting that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter-point in December and then will boost rates two more times in 2017. Yellen stressed in her testimony that the slow recovery and absence of inflation pressures should allow the Fed to move gradually in raising its key rate, the federal funds rate. “Gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years,” Yellen said, referring to the point where the funds rate is neither promoting economic growth nor slowing growth. As measured by the gross domestic product, the economy grew at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, the government has estimated, more than twice the rate in the April-June quarter. The unemployment rate is 4.9 percent, around the level typical of a healthy economy, down from 10 percent in 2009. In addition to firmly stating that she has no plans of leaving the Fed before her term as chair is complete, Yellen also made clear that her views on bank regulation differ from Trump's. Yellen gave a strong defense of the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress in 2010 to increase financial market regulations in an effort to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. After the country lived through a “devastating financial crisis,” Yellen said that “I would not want to see the clock turned back on all the improvements we have made.” Trump and other Republicans have attacked Yellen and other federal bank regulators for imposing too-restrictive rules on banks, pledging that they will seek to repeal major parts of the 2010 law.

The recent surge in Bank of America’s stock price has some commentators questioning whether it’s time to sell the bank’s shares. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Nov 18, 2016 at 10:47AM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Given that Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) stock has outperformed its closest competitors and reached a new 52-week high this month, there's a growing sense that investors should try to call the top and sell its shares. BAC data by YCharts. Be wary of bad advice Consider this recent headline from Barron's: Bank of America: Three Reasons It's Time to Bail. To be fair, despite the headline, the article doesn't say that investors should sell their Bank of America shares. It instead quotes a report from Guggenheim's Eric Wasserstrom and Jeff Cantwell that downgrades the bank from buy to hold. The rationale in the report is threefold. First, Bank of America's shares are now within 10% of Guggenheim's fair value estimate. Second, any additional upside in its shares will be macro-driven -- i.e., outside of Bank of America's control. And third, Bank of America's valuation is now in line with the bank's historical level relative to its peer group. All of these things may be true, but given the headline of the piece it'd still be easy for shareholders to conclude that the article by Barron's, a respected and storied media company, is urging Bank of America's shareholder to shed their stakes. As a shareholder myself, I think this is bad advice. Bank of America's best days are still ahead While Donald Trump's victory in last week's presidential election isn't without controversy, it's become clear that banks may be some of the biggest beneficiaries given Trump's promise to spur economic growth and roll back significant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Most importantly, if Trump's administration adopts the approach recommended by Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, who was purportedly being considered by Trump for Treasury Secretary, then it's almost certain that banks' earnings will dramatically improve. This follows from Hensarling's proposal to free well-capitalized banks from the suffocating capital and liquidity standards that have been enacted by financial regulators over the past few years. This would allow Bank of America to redirect potentially hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of its assets from low-yielding government bonds into higher-yielding loans. This alone would materially improve Bank of America's earnings. On top of this, if Trump is able to stimulate the economy through lower taxes and increased spending on infrastructure, as he says he's focused on doing, then Bank of America would benefit in two ways. A healthier economy would increase loan demand, and it'd also likely translate into higher inflation, which would free the Federal Reserve up to raise interest rates. Just how much might this help Bank of America? In its latest quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, its 10-Q, the bank forecasts that a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates would translate into an additional $5.3 billion in net interest income. To put that in perspective, Bank of America currently earns only around $5 billion a quarter in net income. And the benefits don't end there, as Trump has also promised to dismantle major portions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. One such change could be to take away the Federal Reserve's ability to veto big bank capital plans -- namely, dividend and share buybacks. Working in concert with higher earnings flowing from an improved economy and higher interest rates, this would almost certainly translate into a substantial increase in Bank of America's quarterly dividend. Indeed, even after the North Carolina-based bank raised its dividend by 50% earlier this year, to $0.075 per share, it could still double it from here while maintaining a dividend payout ratio in line with its closest competitors, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. It's those kind of things that lead to a rapid increase in value over time. Thus, while there's no getting around the fact that Bank of America's shares aren't as attractive today as they were at the beginning of November, it would be silly for shareholders to interpret this as a signal to sell their stakes in the nation's second biggest bank by assets. The best days are still ahead for Bank of America and its stock. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The Motley Fool owns shares of Wells Fargo.

U.S. Supreme Court dismisses ATM fee antitrust cases Reuters 2 days ago Lawrence Hurley The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday gave the green light to class action lawsuits by consumers accusing Visa Inc, Mastercard Inc and several U.S. banks of conspiring to inflate the prices of ATM access fees in violation of antitrust law. Quotes in the article MasterCard Inc MA ▲ 104.78 +0.33 +0.32% The justices dismissed two related cases they earlier had agreed to hear in which the companies had sought to overturn an August 2015 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that had revived the three lawsuits. The justices had been scheduled to hear oral arguments on Dec. 7. In the order, the court said the cases were dismissed because the companies had changed their legal arguments after the justices agreed to hear the dispute. The court frowns upon such practices. The appeals court ruled that a district court had erred when it concluded that consumers had no legal standing to sue and had not adequately alleged antitrust violations. It remanded the three consolidated lawsuits to the district court for further proceedings. The lawsuits accused Visa and MasterCard of adopting rules protecting themselves from competition with lower-cost ATM networks. The rules blocked ATM operators from charging less when ATM transactions were processed by networks competing with Visa and Mastercard, the lawsuits said. The rules also benefited major banks, which were equity shareholders of Visa and Mastercard, the lawsuits said. The lawsuits seek damages for consumers and ATM operators for violations of antitrust law. Also named as defendants in the lawsuits were Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co.
