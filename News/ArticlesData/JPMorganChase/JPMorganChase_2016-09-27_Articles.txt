Now, the high-pressure sales scandal at Wells Fargo & Co provides more evidence that large U.S. banks may have little to show for the effort. Bank consultants say tens of millions of dollars are spent each year on initiatives to build a culture of integrity, partly at the urging of regulators such as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Octavio Marenzi, co-founder of Opimas, a management consultant that focuses on the finance industry, said banks have spent a lot of money researching their culture and updating ethics handbooks - with little impact. "A lot of what the banks are doing are superficial attempts," said Marenzi. "It's more window-dressing than anything else." The continuing spate of scandals reinforces doubts about the effectiveness of such efforts. Wells Fargo's debacle - involving the creation of as many as 2 million accounts without customers' permission - is only the latest black eye for bankers. Other recent lapses have included widespread rigging of benchmark interest rates by traders at several banks; reports that JPMorgan Chase & Co hired children of high-ranking Chinese officials to curry favor; and allegations in a London court that Goldman Sachs Group Inc bankers hired prostitutes for officials at Libya's sovereign wealth fund to win business. Wells has also previously faced accusations of discriminatory mortgage lending practices from local and federal authorities. Wells, which has denied the accusations, reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2012. A FEW BAD APPLES? Earlier this month, Wells reached a $185 million settlement with the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Los Angeles City Attorney over abusive sales tactics involved in the creation of bogus customer accounts. In a statement, Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk said the bank takes responsibility for customers receiving products they did not request. "Wells Fargo's culture is committed to the best interests of our customers, providing them with only the products they want and value," Folk wrote. Workers have described a pressure-cooker atmosphere where they risked losing their jobs if they did not hit unrealistic sales targets. They say this pressure defined working for Wells Fargo and directly led to widespread fraud in the opening of bogus accounts. Wells Fargo officials have countered that problems were isolated to a relatively small number of workers. Lawmakers who questioned Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf at a heated Senate Banking Committee hearing last week were unmoved by this explanation, particularly in light of the bank's firing of 5,300 workers over what it described as improper sales. "Is it normal for 1 percent of a business unit to be fired over fraud?" Republican Sen. David Vitter asked. Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley later asked a panel of government officials who regulate Wells Fargo or were involved in the settlement why Stumpf attributed the problem to rogue individuals rather than a pervasive culture or structural incentives installed by bank executives. "It's inconsistent with our findings," responded Thomas Curry, U.S. comptroller of the currency. On Tuesday evening, independent directors on the bank's board said they would pursue their own investigation and claw back $41 million worth of previously granted stock awards from Chairman and Chief Executive John Stumpf, who would also forego his salary as the directors' probe continued. In a statement, Lead Independent Director Stephen Sanger said directors would "take all appropriate actions to reinforce the right culture and ensure that lessons are learned, misconduct is addressed, and systems and processes are improved." REDOUBLED EFFORTS Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman has said that a creating a culture of integrity is among his top priorities. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in the bank's 2014 annual report that his firm needed to "redouble" efforts to reform its culture after making "a number of mistakes - some of them quite painful and costly - over the last several years." The mistakes included a $13 billion deal with the U.S. government to settle allegations of overstating the quality of bad mortgages to investors. Since then, JPMorgan launched an examination of its culture that included interviews between senior executives and over 16,000 employees. Citigroup Inc also recently launched an internal video series in which senior executives discuss how they handled business decisions in grey areas of ethics. The bank also lets employees know when colleagues are dismissed for inappropriate conduct, such as in 2014 when it dismissed 12 employees after finding fraudulent loans in Mexico. This was communicated to the firm in a memo from CEO Michael Corbat. For the first time this year, Morgan Stanley will ask risk and compliance officers to evaluate so-called "material risk-takers," such as bankers and traders. This feedback will play a factor in promotion and compensation decisions. European bank executives are also focused on promoting a culture of honesty. Deutsche Bank AG CEO John Cryan has spoken publicly about the German lender's need to change, while former Barclays PLC CEO Antony Jenkins was so focused on improving the British bank's culture that some employees dubbed him St. Antony. The banks declined to comment for this story. MEASURING CHANGE As they have embarked on these cultural-change campaigns, banks have struggled with how to measure progress. Bankers who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity mostly acknowledged their institutions have more work to do. Some have started running employee opinion surveys with questions such as, "What makes you proud to come to work?" and "What impedes the way you do business?" Personality tests can also examine how employees think about risk and how their personal values affect business decisions, said Ernst and Young's Clive Martin, who works with banks on culture issues. Banks are also looking for signs that an employee might engage in bad behavior. For example, if a trader who frequently hits risk limits, misses compliance training, or doesn't take a mandatory two week holiday that is imposed to catch fraud, it could be a red flag, consultants and bank lawyers say. The New York Fed, which has held symposiums on changing the culture of Wall Street, has suggested creating a database of bank employees who were dismissed for bad behavior. Even with all these methods and tactics, some experts see little fundamental improvement. "You can tell banks to be good, and the Fed tries hard - it holds gatherings and seminars, gets us academics in and we talk about stuff," said Shivaram Rajgopal, a professor at Columbia Business School who has researched corporate culture. "The less cynical perspective is, maybe it's hard to move the needle."

Friday 18 November 2016 Home Trade News Trade News Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Media & Promotion Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Lifestyle Analysis, Interviews, Opinions Miscellaneous Other Sectors Business Directory Contact Advertise Newsletter Premium Content Home   » Analysis, Interviews, Opinions   » MONEY MATTERS Wells Fargo scam triggers debate on big bank culture WASHINGTON, September 28, 2016 In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the banking industry sought to address an ethics crisis with surveys, town hall meetings, appointments of overseers and mechanisms for employees to report malfeasance. Now, the high-pressure sales scandal at Wells Fargo & Co provides more evidence that large US banks may have little to show for the effort. Bank consultants say tens of millions of dollars are spent each year on initiatives to build a culture of integrity, partly at the urging of regulators such as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Octavio Marenzi, co-founder of Opimas, a management consultant that focuses on the finance industry, said banks have spent a lot of money researching their culture and updating ethics handbooks - with little impact. "A lot of what the banks are doing are superficial attempts," said Marenzi. "It's more window-dressing than anything else." The continuing spate of scandals reinforces doubts about the effectiveness of such efforts. Wells Fargo's debacle - involving the creation of as many as 2 million accounts without customers' permission - is only the latest black eye for bankers. Other recent lapses have included widespread rigging of benchmark interest rates by traders at several banks; reports that JPMorgan Chase & Co hired children of high-ranking Chinese officials to curry favor; and allegations in a London court that Goldman Sachs Group Inc bankers hired prostitutes for officials at Libya's sovereign wealth fund to win business. Wells has also previously faced accusations of discriminatory mortgage lending practices from local and federal authorities. Wells, which has denied the accusations, reached a settlement with the US Department of Justice in 2012. A FEW BAD APPLES? Earlier this month, Wells reached a $185 million settlement with the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Los Angeles City Attorney over abusive sales tactics involved in the creation of bogus customer accounts. In a statement, Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk said the bank takes responsibility for customers receiving products they did not request. "Wells Fargo's culture is committed to the best interests of our customers, providing them with only the products they want and value," Folk wrote. Workers have described a pressure-cooker atmosphere where they risked losing their jobs if they did not hit unrealistic sales targets. They say this pressure defined working for Wells Fargo and directly led to widespread fraud in the opening of bogus accounts. Wells Fargo officials have countered that problems were isolated to a relatively small number of workers. Lawmakers who questioned Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf at a heated Senate Banking Committee hearing last week were unmoved by this explanation, particularly in light of the bank's firing of 5,300 workers over what it described as improper sales. "Is it normal for one per cent of a business unit to be fired over fraud?" Republican Senator David Vitter asked. Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley later asked a panel of government officials who regulate Wells Fargo or were involved in the settlement why Stumpf attributed the problem to rogue individuals rather than a pervasive culture or structural incentives installed by bank executives. "It's inconsistent with our findings," responded Thomas Curry, US comptroller of the currency. On Tuesday evening, independent directors on the bank's board said they would pursue their own investigation and claw back $41 million worth of previously granted stock awards from chairman and chief executive John Stumpf, who would also forego his salary as the directors' probe continued. In a statement, Lead independent director Stephen Sanger said directors would "take all appropriate actions to reinforce the right culture and ensure that lessons are learned, misconduct is addressed, and systems and processes are improved." Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman has said that creating a culture of integrity is among his top priorities. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in the bank's 2014 annual report that his firm needed to "redouble" efforts to reform its culture after making "a number of mistakes - some of them quite painful and costly - over the last several years." The mistakes included a $13 billion deal with the US government to settle allegations of overstating the quality of bad mortgages to investors. Since then, JPMorgan launched an examination of its culture that included interviews between senior executives and over 16,000 employees. Citigroup Inc also recently launched an internal video series in which senior executives discuss how they handled business decisions in grey areas of ethics. The bank also lets employees know when colleagues are dismissed for inappropriate conduct, such as in 2014 when it dismissed 12 employees after finding fraudulent loans in Mexico. This was communicated to the firm in a memo from CEO Michael Corbat. For the first time this year, Morgan Stanley will ask risk and compliance officers to evaluate so-called "material risk-takers," such as bankers and traders. This feedback will play a factor in promotion and compensation decisions. European bank executives are also focused on promoting a culture of honesty. Deutsche Bank AG chief executive John Cryan has spoken publicly about the German lender's need to change, while former Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins was so focused on improving the British bank's culture that some employees dubbed him St. Antony. As they have embarked on these cultural-change campaigns, banks have struggled with how to measure progress. Bankers who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity mostly acknowledged their institutions have more work to do. Some have started running employee opinion surveys with questions such as, "What makes you proud to come to work?" and "What impedes the way you do business?" Personality tests can also examine how employees think about risk and how their personal values affect business decisions, said Ernst and Young's Clive Martin, who works with banks on culture issues. Banks are also looking for signs that an employee might engage in bad behavior. For example, if a trader who frequently hits risk limits, misses compliance training, or doesn't take a mandatory two week holiday that is imposed to catch fraud, it could be a red flag, consultants and bank lawyers say. The New York Fed, which has held symposiums on changing the culture of Wall Street, has suggested creating a database of bank employees who were dismissed for bad behaviour. Even with all these methods and tactics, some experts see little fundamental improvement. "You can tell banks to be good, and the Fed tries hard - it holds gatherings and seminars, gets us academics in and we talk about stuff," said Shivaram Rajgopal, a professor at Columbia Business School who has researched corporate culture. "The less cynical perspective is, maybe it's hard to move the needle," he added.-Reuters Tags: Debate | Wells Fargo | More Analysis, Interviews, Opinions Stories Digital transformation – Ocean of a difference Mena M&A deals fall 24 per cent in third quarter 5G subscriptions to reach half a billion in 2022 Turning data chaos into value via digital change UAE Bankruptcy Law a 'life support' for businesses GCC can become 'world’s major e-commerce market' Crystal-gazing consumer spending in Saudi Arabia Trump has opportunity to advance growth policies 5G set to be a game-changer for networked society Demonetisation 'could add $18bn to Indian banking system' UAE employees look for flexible working hours Waste generated in GCC to hit 120m tonnes a year Global IoT market likely to top $7 trillion by 2020 Customer analytics key retail growth says report Global inflation about to spike: Saxo Bank Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Part 7 The Half Billion Dollar GlitchSee all (7)⟶ The Penny Stock Chronicles Part 7 Knight Capital made headlines around the world when one of its computers went on a shopping spree that ended up costing the company $440 million. So surely its secrets would come out now.˅ Expand All Parts Share the whole series f t ✉ Part 1 The Money Is Gone Part 2 Big Players, Little Stocks, and Naked Shorts Part 3 Naked Shorts Can’t Stay Naked Forever Part 4 Calling the SEC Part 5 Turning Up Like a Bad Penny Part 6 Were Paper Losses the Goal All Along? Part 7 The Half Billion Dollar Glitch On August 1, 2012, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened the day at 13,007.47. Business headlines that morning included conservative opponents of gay marriage celebrating “Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day,” the continued reluctance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to offer debt relief to their borrowers, and profit declines at the video game company Electronic Arts. And then the Glitch happened. Knight Capital, the company Chris DiIorio had insisted to the SEC for a year was engaged in a monumental fraud, opened the day by inadvertently buying millions of shares in 154 different stocks. The company blamed an untested software installation that triggered the rapid-fire trades. In an environment where milliseconds can mean millions, it took Knight Capital 45 minutes to turn the software off. Stock values surged from the high demand, and when Knight sold back the shares it had bought by mistake, it was left with a net loss of around $468 million. The New York Stock Exchange canceled trades in six of the 154 stocks involved but deemed itself “hamstrung” by SEC rules that prevented it from breaking all of them. Knight could have used the assets on its balance sheet to absorb the loss, but DiIorio had maintained for years that many of those assets were inflated or even fictional — ghost receivables intended to balance out the massive liabilities Knight had accrued by selling stocks it didn’t really have. And DiIorio alleged that Knight’s immediate efforts to raise the full amount of its Glitch losses, instead of offsetting them with existing assets, proved that something was amiss on its balance sheet. Jason Blatt of Knight Capital Americas reacts to down market on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Aug. 8, 2011. Photo: Stan Honda/Getty Images In one of those attempts, Knight sent 7,000 securities to JPMorgan Chase as collateral for a tri-party loan, but the Wall Street Journal reported that JPMorgan deemed 4,000 of them “unreadable through databases used to reach valuations,” and refused to accept them. DiIorio saw this as consistent with shares in companies whose CUSIP, or unique identifying symbol, had changed after a reverse merger or split — just what he had been warning about for years. Such stocks would be unredeemable for any real value. “Those were the stocks that no longer traded!” DiIorio says. “They were pledging worthless collateral.” The proposed loan collapsed. The funding Knight did receive, from a consortium of investors that took 73 percent of the company without a shareholder proxy vote, was not collateral-based. In late 2012, Knight announced a merger with rival market maker Getco. DiIorio filed a new “tip, complaint or referral” form to the SEC — this one vetted by the law firm Berger & Montague — highlighting Knight’s post-Glitch funding issues and how they pointed to evidence of a naked short selling scheme. DiIorio’s “findings — the product of thousands of hours of careful study — can protect others from falling victim to these same frauds,” the TCR concluded. Berger & Montague eventually parted ways with DiIorio. The lead attorney on the complaint, Daniel Miller, did not respond to requests for comment. The SEC did not respond to the new TCR, nor did it prevent the Knight/Getco merger. It did fine Knight Capital $12 million related to violations of the market access rule when it committed the Glitch. But compared to DiIorio’s claims, that was miniscule. DiIorio even tried to collect a whistleblower award for a 2011 enforcement against UBS for violations of Regulation SHO. He wanted to force the SEC to look at his claims again, and hopefully open a new investigation. The SEC denied DiIorio’s application to collect the award. While he is not privy to undisclosed SEC investigations, DiIorio does not believe the agency has investigated Knight’s or UBS’s involvement in penny stocks. DiIorio thinks the agency could audit Knight’s profit and loss statements to understand its concentration in penny stocks. Or officials could deny the numerous penny stock reverse mergers and reverse splits that DiIorio says drive the scheme. Or they could investigate why the splits proliferate. SEC spokesperson Ryan White declined to comment. SEC Chief of the Office of the Whistleblower Sean McKessy and Chief of Enforcement Andrew Ceresney did not respond to requests for comment. The agency did recently tout its whistleblower program as “a gamechanger … in its short time in existence.” In July, McKessy announced his exit from the agency after five years running the Office of the Whistleblower. In September, he became a partner at the law firm Phillips & Cohen, which has won for clients one-third of the total whistleblower awards granted by the SEC. Meanwhile, the Justice Department is reportedly investigating Knight, now known after the merger as KCG, over allegedly executing stock trades to shortchange its clients. KCG’s most recent quarterly report acknowledges that “the Company is currently the subject of various regulatory reviews and investigations,” including by the SEC and the Justice Department. But there’s been no public acknowledgment of any investigation into penny stock activity. KCG declined to comment, through its spokesperson Sophie Sohn. UBS only responded to multiple requests by saying, “UBS applies strict due diligence and anti-money-laundering standards to all its business.” Knight’s own trading data confirms that it never stopped selling penny stocks. It boasted in its 2013 annual report of being “the clear market leader in over-the-counter (OTC) traded stocks.” And it increased its volume  in 2014, trading 19.1 billion shares of OTC and Pink Sheet stocks per day in February of that year, up from a little over 4 billion a day in the previous quarter. While those volumes have lessened somewhat, to this day between 73 and 80 percent of Knight’s share volumes are in OTC and Pink Sheet stocks. “The activity continues today and the investing public remains at risk,” DiIorio says. DiIorio is highly skeptical of the SEC’s intentions at this point. He believes the agency has all the information it needs to move on the scheme. But prosecuting Knight and UBS would raise questions about the SEC’s silence before and during the Glitch, and its decision to dismiss criminal charges against UBS in 2010 on the grounds that UBS had changed its ways. “How are they going to say that [UBS] did penny stock money laundering?” DiIorio asks. The charge is explosive. It’s hard for a member of the public, lacking access to the SEC’s data and analytics, to fully vet DiIorio’s claims. This rankles even securities regulators. “I have no authority to look at a reverse split unless someone alleges fraud on the markets,” said Joseph Borg, director of the Alabama Securities Commission. “Enforcement is after you burn down the forest. I can’t blow out the match because I can’t even ask what you’re doing in the forest to begin with!” Since the Bernie Madoff scandal, the SEC’s Office of the Whistleblower has professed a greater desire to fully investigate cases. Part of the post-Madoff recommendations mandated that the SEC’s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations vet all whistleblower information. But last year, when DiIorio contacted Kevin Goodman, director of OCIE for broker-dealers, Goodman responded, “Thank you for your recent emails. I wanted to acknowledge them and let you know I have received and will consider the information you have provided.” To DiIorio, that suggested Goodman had not seen the claims before. The SEC would not make Goodman available for comment. Frustrated with the SEC, DiIorio reached out to the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency, the security industry’s self-regulatory organization. DiIorio had a two-hour conference call in August 2012 with a team leader at Finra’s whistleblower office shortly after the Glitch. He had another meeting later with FBI agents. And this April, he met with IRS officials. Chris DiIorio. Photo: Matt Slaby for The Intercept Since he first contacted Finra, the agency has issued several complaints against brokers other than Knight over failing to comply with anti-money laundering regulations. Some of them cited penny stocks DiIorio highlighted in his claims. In particular, Finra fined Brown Brothers Harriman $8 million for violating money-laundering rules by turning a blind eye to “suspicious penny stock transactions,” executed “on behalf of undisclosed customers of foreign banks in known bank secrecy havens.” But none of those foreign banks or their customers were named. “Who does that protect?” DiIorio asked. Richard Best, the lead enforcement official at Finra on the Brown Brothers Harriman case, now runs the Salt Lake City regional office for the SEC. The agency declined to make him available for comment. Five years after alerting the SEC to his allegations, DiIorio has never been brought in for a meeting. He’s going public now because he’s fed up with the inaction. “I’ve always said to the SEC, ‘I’ll be there tomorrow, I’ll come without an attorney,’” DiIorio says. “They won’t even pick up the phone.” DiIorio doesn’t do much investing anymore. But he never sold off his original investment in Best Rate Travel, now known as Yora International, which has traded at a fraction of a penny for several years. It’s still sitting in his IRA account, the shares having been reduced through more reverse splits to 3,299. Under market value, it just says, “$NP,” or “no price.” Chris DiIorio’s IRA statement.

Could the tech giant see more gains? Larry McDonald of ACG Analytics and Craig Johnson of Piper Jaffray discuss with Brian Sullivan.</p> Amazon hits record high    Tuesday, 27 Sep 2016 | 3:21 PM ET | 03:38 Amazon $1,000? Shares of the e-retailer jumped 2 percent on Tuesday after JPMorgan raised its price target to $1,000 by December 2017, up from its previous target of $925 for December 2016. "We believe Amazon continues to show strong ability to take share of overall eCommerce, and its flexibility in pushing first-party versus third-party inventory is a major advantage compared with other retailers," analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note published Tuesday. JPMorgan rates the company as overweight, and notes its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-computing services has proved successful. And the charts may point to the same conclusion. "The chart has been a terrific trending stock over the last several years," Craig Johnson, technical research analyst at Piper Jaffray, said Tuesday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." "And at this point in time you can see a very well-defined channel that the shares have been in," Johnson said, adding that the charts may point to a price target of $875 to $900. Larry McDonald, head of global macro at ACG Analytics, said now is not the best time to buy Amazon. The company has over the years invested "heavily" in new vehicles of revenue creation and has at times not seen its return pay off, McDonald said Tuesday on "Trading Nation." "The one consistent thing we've seen with Amazon the last 15 years, really, is they have a big capital expenditure investment cycle that repeats itself over and over again," McDonald said. But when Amazon has historically gone "out of favor" at these times, according to McDonald, that is the best opportunity to buy its shares. JPMorgan's bullish price target joins two recent calls of $1,000 or more; earlier this month, Evercore ISI raised its price target to $1,015 and RBC Capital raised its price target to $1,000. Analysts' average target price is $900.21, according to FactSet estimates. Nomura on Wednesday resumed coverage of Amazon with a buy rating and a $950 price target, citing Amazon's focus on growing Amazon Prime memberships and investment in Prime Instant Video, as well as the company's "leadership in the cloud industry via AWS." Evercore ISI analyst Ken Sena wrote in a note earlier this month that Amazon's venture into the cloud space and utilization of artificial intelligence has fueled the bullish sentiment. He reiterated the firm's buy rating. "Not only are these advancements leading to higher overall customer satisfaction as delivery of food, packages, or other is becoming faster and more reliable, but we also see where many of the automation technologies are already offering quantifiable financial benefits," including savings in areas such as labor and improved inventory turns, Sena wrote in his note entitled, "AMZN - An Automated Vision of the Future."

 JPMorgan just promoted a rising star in its biggest business Matt Turner Sep. 27, 2016, 5:36 PM 23,260 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan JPMorgan just announced a change at the top of its consumer banking business. The US bank has named Thasunda Duckett as CEO of the consumer bank, reporting to Gordon Smith, CEO of consumer and community banking. "T is an extraordinary leader and talent," Smith said in a memo announcing the appointment. "For anyone who knows T, you know she has both great IQ and EQ." The new role puts Duckett, who was previously CEO of Chase Auto Finance, at the heart of JPMorgan's biggest business. Consumer and community banking generated $11.5 billion in revenue in the second quarter, with $2.7 billion in net income. Duckett replaces Barry Sommers, who is moving to a new unit called Wealth Management and Investment Solutions. That unit will combine the wealth management businesses across asset management and consumer and community banking, according to a separate memo from Mary Erdoes, CEO of asset management at JPMorgan. Sommers will become CEO of wealth management, while Brian Carlin will become CEO of investment and banking solutions. Carlin will also oversee the bank's digital wealth management and institutional wealth management business.  SEE ALSO: Bank of America has officially crowned one of the most senior women in finance NOW WATCH: Here’s what happens when interest rates go negative Loading video...

Chauncey Lennon is the head of workforce initiatives at JP Morgan Chase. He says workers need to have so-called "soft skills", like teamwork and communication. But many of today's in-demand jobs also require greater technical expertise.  "When we think about some of the growing and strong sectors in Detroit, things like information technology, manufacturing, healthcare, advanced manufacturing, transportation and logistics, all of those, you don't necessarily need a four-year degree, but you do typically need some sort of post-secondary training." The money will go to local training partners to help develop programs to teach the skills employers need workers to have, while also making jobs and training more accessible to people in Detroit.  The Corporation for a Skilled Workforce, the Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation and the United Way for Southeast Michigan will all receive a portion of the $1.3 million. Lennon says it's important that workforce training programs work both with employers and Detroit residents to be best effective.  "At the same time that we're trying to meet the needs of employers, we're also trying to build these strong career pathways. So all Detroiters understand how they can begin to develop the skills, so they have opportunities over time to build up their skills, (and) they're able to find good jobs in these growing sectors." Lennon credits Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan's office, local training providers and business owners for working to build a training network in Detroit that focuses on helping more workers learn in-demand skills. One of the challenges facing these training programs is finding a way to make sure Detroit residents actually get involved. Lennon says not everyone is ready to dive into intensive on-the-job training. Introductory training programs therefore are an important part of the solution. The Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation will use the money to develop pre-apprenticeships designed to teach workers fundamental skills, while opening the door to more opportunity. Similarly, the United Way of Southeast Michigan focuses on construction and manufacturing industries, and training new workers through their "Access for All" program.  According to Lennon, workforce training is a critical component of sustaining Detroit's economic growth. "A key piece of how we continue to support Detroit is to have a strong, demand-driven workforce system," Lennon said.  Tags:  Detroit united way Mayor Mike Duggan TweetShareGoogle+Email Related Content 'More and better jobs in Michigan': Gov.

JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on AMZN and lifted its price target from $925 to $1,000, citing strong growth catalysts in the company’s electronics, general merchandise, media, and services segments. That new price target suggests a 25% upside to the stock’s Monday closing price of $799.16. “We believe Amazon continues to show strong ability to take share of overall eCommerce, and its flexibility in pushing first-party versus third-party inventory is a major advantage compared with other retailers,” said the firm in a research note to clients this morning. Related: See what ETFs own the most AMZN stock Just ten weeks ago, JPMorgan set a $908 price target on AMZN. The stock has gained 6% since then, prompting the firm to boost its target to $925 in late July, and now $1,000 today. Amazon has serious growth potential in many avenues. Its Prime subscription service is doing better than all other membership services, and it could be a short time away from becoming a shipping company to rival UPS and FedEx. It’s also seeing huge growth on the retail side in overseas markets. Amazon shares rose $3.34 (+0.42%) to $802.50 in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, AMZN has gained 18.24%, versus a 5% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 during the same period.

Here is something that you might not be aware of; many credit cards offer a feature called price protection.  The exact details vary by Issuer but the general idea is that after you make a purchase, for a specific and limited period of time  up to 50 or even 80 days depending on which card issuer you go with), your credit card company will refund the difference if your purchase drops in price. Very few people take advantage of this feature because a) they probably don’t know the feature exists and b) no one has time to constantly monitor price changes. Let’s begin by tackling issue #1 Our friends at CardRatings have compiled a list of credit cards that offer price protection so go here to find out if your card offers this feature. And if you don’t have a card that offers price protection you might want to check out the Chase Freedom card. What is the Chase Freedom card? Chase Freedom offers price protection as well as 5% cash back on select categories. From now until Sept 30th you can get 5% cash back on purchases made at restaurants as well as purchases made at wholesale clubs like Costco.  So you can sleep easy knowing that you’re getting 5% cash back on your toilet paper purchases, and if the price drops, you’re covered!  And if that wasn’t good enough, on October 1st the 5% cash back category “switches” to Holiday Shopping, and while the exact details have not been released, price protection coupled with 5% cash back is a pretty enticing offer to minimize holiday shopping buyer’s remorse. In other words, the Chase Freedom has you covered. Now that you have a card that offers price protection how do you take advantage of the feature? Enter Paribus.  Paribus is an app that will detect the receipts in your mailbox and track your purchases and monitor price drops, missed coupons and price match opportunities to save you money. If a price drops, Paribus will check it against the issuer’s policies and communicate with their customer service on your behalf to get you paid. A card that offers price protection coupled with the Paribus app can really save people some money.  Now that you are in the know, leave a comment in the space below if this worked for you and let us know how much money you saved.

Business ‘King of mining’ Ian Hannam digs up profits despite industry gloom Jamie Nimmo Tuesday 27 September 2016 13:06 BST Sales leap: Hannam & Partners saw turnover rise 37% to £7.4 million in the 12 months ended March Jorge Mu-Oz/Getty Images Ian Hannam, the former JPMorgan rainmaker who was fined for market abuse, saw profits leap at his new corporate finance boutique, despite a dearth of natural resources deals. Turnover rose 37% to £7.4 million and pre-tax profits rose from £570,000 to £2.4 million in the 12 months ended March, accounts for Hannam & Partners filed at Companies House show. Chief executive Neil Passmore, the former JPMorgan colleague of the so-called “King of Mining”, said profits were re-invested by the company’s partners, who include Hannam and veteran City broker Tim Hoare. The firm’s biggest public deals included advising on the £135 million takeover of Asia Resource Minerals, the Indonesian miner formerly known as Bumi, and Worldview’s equally divisive buyout of Irish oil explorer Petroceltic. Much of its business is raising capital for private clients. Hannam, a former Territorial Army captain who earned a reputation for arranging huge mining deals including Glencore’s tie-up with Xstrata, was fined £450,000 by the Financial Services Authority in 2012 for giving insider information on Heritage Oil to Kurdistan’s oil minister. He resigned from JPMorgan in 2012 and bought Strand Partners the same year before rebranding it Hannam & Partners. Passmore said the business was “in good shape” in a market where “a lot of our competitors blew up last year”, referring to the closure of GMP Securities’ London office and job cuts for Canaccord Genuity. “In relative terms we’re very happy we’re weathering the downturn and building a brand when others are failing to do so. In absolute terms, I was frustrated that the business stayed stuck in the same kind of modest revenue zone,” he said. Passmore said trading in the six months since March had been “much better”.

Yet the executives' participation in this year's biggest initial public offering also serves as a reminder that investing in Chinese banks isn't what it used to be. PHOTO: REUTERS Sep 27, 2016 7:49 PM [SHANGHAI] Jamie Dimon and Sergio Ermotti starred in the roadshow promoting Postal Savings Bank of China Co's share sale. Yet the executives' participation in this year's biggest initial public offering also serves as a reminder that investing in Chinese banks isn't what it used to be. When China's fifth-largest bank priced its US$7.4 billion share sale last week, UBS and JPMorgan snared 5 per cent paper gains on investments made nine months earlier. The shares will start trading in Hong Kong on Wednesday after being priced near the bottom of a marketed range. Bank of America Corp and Goldman Sachs Group Inc more than doubled their money with China Construction Bank Corp and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd stakes respectively in 2005 and 2006 before those firms' shares started trading. History is failing to repeat itself as investors fret at the risks weighing down Chinese lenders. JPMorgan's first purchase of a stake in one of the biggest Chinese lenders came a decade after a wave of bank IPOs in China generated multibillion-dollar windfalls for foreign banks. Goldman and Bank of America bought in before the global financial crisis when the Chinese economy was booming and sold after post-crisis banking rules made it more expensive to hold minority stakes. In a video played at roadshow briefings in Hong Kong and London, Mr Dimon, 60, and Mr Ermotti, 56, highlighted "strategic" tie-ups with Postal Savings Bank. JPMorgan will provide advice for the Chinese lender's retail finance business and help it to bolster trade finance capabilities, while UBS will aid efforts to provide wealth management services, according to the share sale prospectus. Spokesmen for JPMorgan, which is among joint sponsors of the IPO, and UBS, the sole financial adviser to the offering, declined last week to comment further. Ten strategic investors put 45.1 billion yuan (S$9.2 billion) into the bank in December. UBS accounted for the largest share at 13.3 billion yuan, while JPMorgan took a 2.5 billion yuan stake. UBS could syndicate a significant portion of its stock to other investors, people familiar with the matter said ahead of the purchase. Global investors have become increasingly concerned that a rising tide of bad loans will threaten banks and the economy. While the lender's stock was priced near the low end, its valuation as measured by its price-to-book ratio is higher than those of other big state lenders. The stock fell as much as 2.3 per cent to HK$4.65 on Tuesday in a grey market operated by Phillip Securities Group. "I won't be surprised if Postal Savings Bank's shares fall below the IPO price on their debut," said Li Bin, a Shanghai- based analyst at Capital Securities Corp. "Their strategic investors must look at the deal from a very, very long-term perspective, betting they will be compensated by something else - such as extra local government support for their own China businesses." UBS made a pre-IPO gain of about 160 per cent in nine months on a US$492 million investment in Bank of China Ltd in 2005. The Swiss lender reaped about 35 percent on paper when a "bad bank" - China Cinda Asset Management Co, a manager of nonperforming loans - priced its initial share offer in 2013. Bank of America reaped 110 per cent in two months from buying a US$2.5 billion holding in China Construction Bank. Goldman Sachs more than doubled the value of its US$2.6 billion stake in Industrial & Commercial Bank of China in six months. The gain was one of the firm's biggest investment wins since being founded in 1869, people with knowledge of Goldman's investments said at the time. Those investments were made "during the golden age of the Chinese economy," said Richard Cao, a Shenzhen-based analyst at Guotai Junan Securities Co. "Now, it's a different time, so that kind of return is not realistic." The global financial institutions that spent US$33 billion buying stakes in Chinese lenders from 2001 and 2009 mostly later exited - leaving the likes of HSBC Holdings Plc, with its shareholding in Bank of Communications Co. Goldman Sachs earned about US$12 billion in sales proceeds and dividends from its seven-year investment in ICBC, while Bank of America reaped at least US$15 billion after buying in to Construction Bank. The strategic investors in Postal Savings Bank face a three-year lock-up on their investments. Ubiquitous in small-town China with 500,000 customers, the bank is the last major state-controlled lender to sell stock publicly to fund expansion. In a sign of what's changed, Chinese bank shares have lagged behind the benchmark Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong for five of the past six years while their profit growth has slumped to the lowest level in a decade. While Postal Savings Bank's strengths include an extensive network, a strong deposit base, and a non-performing loan ratio less than half that of the industry as a whole, it also has weaknesses. In a note this month, analysts at Sanford C Bernstein & Co highlighted inefficiencies, concentrated lending - including a large exposure to the cash-burning China Railway Corp - and increased shadow-banking exposures, such as investments in asset management plans. Adding to concerns about the industry, a Bank for International Settlements warning gauge for banking stress rose to a record in China in the first quarter, after an explosion in credit since the global crisis. At the same time, the government's control of the banking system and of the levers of economic policy may limit the risk of a Chinese financial crisis. "Although there's a low probability that China's banks and the Chinese economy can recover any time soon, we should never underestimate the capacity of the Chinese government," Mr Li said. "If that day comes, those who still have bets on China will do well."

The study finds that women fall behind early and face ever-greater challenges the more senior they become. Women are less likely to receive the first critical promotion to manager—so far fewer end up on the path to leadership—and they are less likely to be hired into more senior positions. As a result, the higher you look in companies, the fewer women you see. "When women are stuck, corporate America is stuck," said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO and founder of LeanIn.Org. "We know that diverse teams perform better and inclusive workplaces are better for all employees, so we all have strong incentives to get this right." The Women in the Workplace 2016 report is part of an ongoing partnership between McKinsey & Company and LeanIn.Org to give companies the information they need to promote female leadership and foster gender equality in the workplace. The study is based on pipeline data and information on human resources practices from 132 companies that employ more than 4.6 million people, including Visa, MetLife, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Procter & Gamble, Facebook, and General Motors. In addition, more than 34,000 employees completed a survey designed to explore their experiences regarding gender, opportunity, career, and work-life issues. The study builds on the Women in the Workplace 2015 report and a baseline study of sixty companies conducted by McKinsey & Company in 2012. "To accelerate progress on gender parity, we first must understand what is holding women back," said Dominic Barton, global managing partner of McKinsey & Company. "This study seeks to do exactly that. It provides companies with both industry benchmarks and data on their own talent pipeline and employees' work experiences. These insights will help companies drive bolder and more effective solutions." Contrary to conventional wisdom, this year's study found that women negotiate for promotions and raises as often as men, but face pushback when they do. They are far more likely than men who negotiate to receive feedback that they are "intimidating," "too aggressive," or "bossy." Women also receive informal feedback less frequently than men—despite asking for it as often—and have less access to senior-level sponsors. So not surprisingly, women are almost three times more likely than men to think their gender will make it harder to get a raise, promotion, or chance to get ahead. The study found that, compared to white women, women of color face the most barriers and experience the steepest drop-offs with seniority despite having higher aspirations for becoming a top executive. Women of color also report they get less access to opportunities and see a workplace that is less fair and inclusive. They are 9% less likely to say they've received a challenging new assignment, 21% less likely to think the best opportunities go to the most deserving employees, and 10% less likely to feel comfortable being themselves as work. Although company commitment to gender diversity is at an all-time high, companies are struggling to put their commitment into practice. Less than half of employees say their company is doing what it takes to improve diversity, and many employees do not see gender diversity as a personal priority. The report identifies concrete steps companies can take to advance their gender diversity efforts. They can make a stronger case for gender diversity, explaining why it matters and how it benefits everyone. They can also ensure their hiring, promotion, and performance review polices are fair, and invest in training so employees know the steps they can take to promote gender diversity. And they can place more emphasis on accountability and set gender targets so it's easier to track and make progress. The complete Women in the Workplace 2016 report, including detailed findings and recommendations, is available at womenintheworkplace.com. From the website, organizations can download the report and sign up to participate in this ongoing research. QUOTES FROM PARTICIPATING CEOS Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co."At JPMorgan Chase, we foster a diverse and inclusive workplace where everyone can thrive. We believe it's not only the smart thing to do, it's the right thing to do and it's also good for business. We've implemented a number of initiatives aimed at helping make sure women advance and achieve their career goals at our company. This study will help us continue to build on the momentum we've attained." Charles Scharf, CEO of Visa"At Visa, advancing diversity and inclusion is a strategic imperative. Data from this Women in the Workplace study has reaffirmed the reality that there is still a lot more work to be done in both investing in and advancing women in the workplace. Dialogue is critical, along with swift action. As one of several initiatives we have in place to advance this discussion, Visa recently joined a consortium that brings together companies who are as committed as we are to addressing the issues around equal pay to ensure the right questions are being asked." David Taylor, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Procter & Gamble"We aspire to create a better world for everyone—a world free of gender bias with equal representation and an equal voice for women and men. This begins inside our own company, where we're striving for equal representation for women and men at all levels and building an inclusive culture where everyone can contribute to their full potential. We seek insights that can shed light and inspire action to achieve gender equality—inside our workplace and more broadly in the world." KEY FINDINGS For every 100 women promoted to manager, 130 men are promotedPromotion rates for women lag behind those of men, and the disparity is the largest at the first step up to manager. As a result, far fewer women end up on the path to leadership. Very few women are in line to become CEOBy the time women reach the SVP level, they hold just 20% of line roles, and line roles lead more directly to the C-suite: In 2015, 90% of new CEOs in the S&P 500 were promoted or hired from line roles. Women experience an uneven playing fieldWomen get less access to the people and opportunities that advance careers and are disadvantaged in many of their daily interactions. These inequities appear to take a toll on women: They are less likely to think they have equal opportunities for growth and development—and more likely to think their gender will play a role in missing out on a raise, promotion, or chance to get ahead. Women of color have higher leadership aspirations, but face more barriers Compared to white women, women of color have higher aspirations to become a top executive but get less access to opportunities for growth and advancement. They also see a workplace that is less fair and inclusive. In all cases, Black women appear to be the most disadvantaged. Women are negotiating as often as men—but face pushback when they do Women who negotiate for a promotion or compensation increase are 30% more likely than men who negotiate to receive feedback that they are "bossy," "too aggressive," or "intimidating." Women get less access to senior leadersWomen and men both view sponsorship by senior leaders as essential for success. Yet women report fewer substantive interactions with senior leaders than their male counterparts do—and this gap widens as women and men advance. Women ask for feedback as often as men—but are less likely to receive itDespite asking for informal feedback as often as men do, women report they receive it less frequently. Moreover, there appears to be a disconnect in the way managers convey difficult feedback. Most managers say they rarely hesitate to give difficult feedback to both women and men, but women report they receive it less frequently.   Women are less interested in becoming top executives—and see the pros and cons of senior leadership differentlyOnly 40% of women are interested in becoming top executives, compared to 56% of men. Women and men worry equally about work-life balance and company politics. However, women with and without children are more likely to say they don't want the pressure, and women who want a top job anticipate a steeper path than men who do. Companies are highly committed to gender diversity, but struggling to put it into practiceLess than half of employees think their company is doing what it takes to improve gender diversity. In addition, less than a third of employees say senior leaders regularly communicate the importance of gender diversity and are held accountable for making progress. There are steps companies can take to promote gender equalityAlthough there's no "one size fits all" solution, the report identifies steps companies can take to advance gender equality: make a compelling case for gender diversity; ensure hiring, promotions, and reviews are fair; invest in more employee training; and focus on accountability and results.

Yet the executives' participation in this year's biggest initial public offering also serves as a reminder that investing in Chinese banks isn't what it used to be. When China's fifth-largest bank priced its $7.4 billion share sale last week, UBS and JPMorgan snared 5 percent paper gains on investments made nine months earlier. The shares will start trading in Hong Kong on Wednesday after being priced near the bottom of a marketed range. Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. more than doubled their money with China Construction Bank Corp. and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. stakes respectively in 2005 and 2006 before those firms' shares started trading. History is failing to repeat itself as investors fret at the risks weighing down Chinese lenders. VIDEOS TOP JOBS JPMorgan's first purchase of a stake in one of the biggest Chinese lenders came a decade after a wave of bank IPOs in China generated multibillion-dollar windfalls for foreign banks. Goldman and Bank of America bought in before the global financial crisis when the Chinese economy was booming and sold after post-crisis banking rules made it more expensive to hold minority stakes. In a video played at roadshow briefings in Hong Kong and London, Dimon, 60, and Ermotti, 56, highlighted "strategic" tie-ups with Postal Savings Bank. JPMorgan will provide advice for the Chinese lender's retail finance business and help it to bolster trade finance capabilities, while UBS will aid efforts to provide wealth management services, according to the share sale prospectus. Spokesmen for JPMorgan, which is among joint sponsors of the IPO, and UBS, the sole financial adviser to the offering, declined last week to comment further. Ten strategic investors put 45.1 billion yuan ($6.8 billion) into the bank in December. UBS accounted for the largest share at 13.3 billion yuan, while JPMorgan took a 2.5 billion yuan stake. UBS could syndicate a significant portion of its stock to other investors, people familiar with the matter said ahead of the purchase. Global investors have become increasingly concerned that a rising tide of bad loans will threaten banks and the economy. While the lender's stock was priced near the low end, its valuation as measured by its price-to-book ratio is higher than those of other big state lenders. "I won't be surprised if Postal Savings Bank's shares fall below the IPO price on their debut," said Li Bin, a Shanghai-based analyst at Capital Securities Corp. "Their strategic investors must look at the deal from a very, very long-term perspective, betting they will be compensated by something else -- such as extra local government support for their own China businesses." UBS made a pre-IPO gain of about 160 percent in nine months on a $492 million investment in Bank of China Ltd. in 2005. The Swiss lender reaped about 35 percent on paper when a "bad bank" — China Cinda Asset Management Co., a manager of nonperforming loans — priced its initial share offer in 2013. Bank of America reaped 110 percent in two months from buying a $2.5 billion holding in China Construction Bank. Goldman Sachs more than doubled the value of its $2.6 billion stake in Industrial & Commercial Bank of China in six months. The gain was one of the firm's biggest investment wins since being founded in 1869, people with knowledge of Goldman's investments said at the time. Those investments were made "during the golden age of the Chinese economy," said Richard Cao, a Shenzhen-based analyst at Guotai Junan Securities Co. "Now, it's a different time, so that kind of return is not realistic." » Next page...

The RBS is currently preparing [Reuters report] to settle a number of other US cases dealing with mis-selling similar bonds. This comes after the 2008 financial crisis [Britannica backgrounder], in which the NCUA claim such firms "contributed to the corporate crisis." Under this settlement, the RBS does not admit fault as they currently are still facing 13 other cases for similar claims. The NCUA said that it continues to litigate against other bands for their sale of bad mortgage-backed securities to credit unions. Major banking firms have faced numerous lawsuits regarding their business practices. In December 2013 the NCUA brought a suit [JURIST report] against JPMorgan for similar RMBS products sold by Bear Stearns, which was also subsequently purchased by JPMorgan.

THE AGENDA Reading Now: Up Next: Animation by Bewilder The Agenda Future of Money The mystery of high-frequency trading How can you put a speed limit on something you can’t track? By Zachary Warmbrodt 09/28/16 04:55 AM EDT Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Something mysterious rattled one of the world’s most stable financial markets for 12 harrowing minutes on Oct. 15, 2014. During that brief window, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note—a benchmark security critical to funding the federal government—dropped dramatically and then surged, and no one could tell why. It was, said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, “an event that is supposed to happen only once in every 3 billion years. ” Like other market surprises, including a May 2010 “flash crash” in stocks and futures, it triggered an investigation. Government agencies spent months dissecting millions of data points from the Treasury market to find out just what had happened that day. Their conclusion was unsettling: They still had no idea what had caused it. What they were able to document, however, was the rise of a new major player in Treasury notes: a group of investors using ultra-fast trading systems to make money by quickly flipping government debt. The agencies found that the firms, privately trading their own capital rather than the money of outside investors, accounted for the majority of trading in this crucial market. High-speed algorithmic trading had long been a big concern in stock markets, where sophisticated but obscure firms with lightning-fast connections to exchanges were forcing regulators to grapple with potential problems, including market volatility. What the T-note investigation found is that such traders had also made deep inroads into the globe’s premier government funding market, a safe haven for investors and a vital tool for implementing U.S. monetary policy. The findings underscored just how hard it could be to keep markets stable and fair as faster, more opaque players show up. The most aggressive algorithmic trading firms have been viewed with suspicion for years because of concerns that their business is essentially predatory, exploiting tiny technical gaps in the market to the disadvantage of other investors. Michael Lewis, the author of “Moneyball” and “The Big Short,” tackled this shadowy world in his 2014 book “Flash Boys," which demonized these high-frequency traders as predators who made money at the expense of more traditional firms, paying to access the markets faster than other investors. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on October 15, 2014 in New York City. For 12 long minutes that day, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note plunged in value and then suddenly bounced back. | Spencer Platt/Getty Though HFT might sound like an inside-baseball issue in the finance world, the debate has bubbled to the point that it has surfaced in the presidential race. Perhaps the most significant financial reform in Hillary Clinton's platform is a new tax aimed at excessive levels of certain types of stock market orders, a measure her campaign argues will help combat “harmful” high-frequency trading. The 2016 Democratic platform gives a nod to others in the party who want a broader Wall Street transaction tax, to “curb excessive speculation and high-frequency trading, which has threatened financial markets.” Clinton has also articulated a much more wide-ranging stock market overhaul to ensure “equal access to markets and information,” which insiders also see as a reference to the advantages high-frequency traders attempt to cultivate. (Donald Trump's plans are far less specific.) But as criticism focuses on the hard-to-monitor world of automated trading, questions remain—what is harmful trading and who is doing it? The traders themselves defend their work as not only legal, but helpful in keeping markets liquid. And even if we were to decide the trading is harmful, is there any way to get the horse back in the barn? PART OF THE challenge is that automated trading is everywhere now: The technology behind this new breed of trader is part of the fundamental fabric of the markets, used by a wide variety of firms and investors. The traders of most concern to regulators are the ones trying to game the complexity of the market itself for competitive advantage. Their success has been rooted in gaining the fastest conceivable connections to various markets and doing the best job of parsing vast amounts of trade data. The arms race has yielded numerous firms with different strategies, but observers now put them into a couple of separate categories. One type of firm buys and sells various products on a continuous basis, providing liquidity and quickly closing out its positions to limit ist own risk. Defenders of these "electronic market-makers" argue that they can help provide liquidity in the markets where they operate. One of these, Virtu Financial, last year became the first high-frequency trading firm to go public. This year, JPMorgan Chase agreed to a partnership in which Virtu will help the nation’s largest bank trade Treasurys. Such big players are becoming more mainstream and more accepted, even by some of the staunchest critics of high-frequency trading. “Years ago we thought high-frequency trading was one bucket, and we just put it into one bucket. We didn't really know too much about it, ” said high-frequency trading critic Joseph Saluzzi, co-founder of brokerage firm Themis Trading. “It was very vague and no one would speak about it. ” Then there are the traders you hear about when the Securities and Exchange Commission files a lawsuit against them. Take Athena Capital Research. The privately funded “global quantitative investment manager" was the target of the SEC's first high-frequency trading market manipulation case, resulting in a $1 million settlement in 2014. The agency alleged the firm used an algorithm code-named “Gravy" to artificially push market prices in its favor by making massive amounts of trades near the close of a day's trading. The SEC said the relatively small firm “dominated the market” in the last few seconds of a trading day for tens of thousands of stocks using “high-powered computers, complex algorithms, and rapid-fire trades. ” A trader sits and monitors his computer screens as he trades on the financial markets from the offices of Futex Co. in April, 2015. Futex formerly employed Navinder Singh Sarao, who the U.S. authorities claim helped cause the 2010 flash crash. | Getty Images “Those are the guys that need to be reined in, ” Saluzzi said. “Those are the ones people don't know much about. They're predatory in nature. ” Athena neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing the case. HOW DO YOU rein them in? So far, Washington has handled the issue cautiously. SEC Chair Mary Jo White has spoken of “the need to avoid undue interference with practices that benefit investors and market efficiency.” She has also outlined ways that investors “are doing better in today’s algorithmic marketplace than they did in the old manual markets” thanks in part to lower trade execution costs. Andrei Kirilenko, a former chief economist at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said in an interview that regulators need to get a better understanding of “who is out there, why are they out there, do we know what they do, if they do something wrong can we get their records? ” Former CFTC general counsel Dan Berkovitz said regulators have moved away from the question of whether the technology is inherently good or bad. Now the focus is more about ensuring a fair market structure. “The race for speed—who’s it really benefiting, and if it benefits somebody, does that mean somebody’s hurt by it?” said Berkovitz, now a partner at WilmerHale. “If people are faster and better and they’re making money off it, where does that money come from? Is somebody getting hurt by it? … I don’t think the regulators have the ability to really understand the guts of these things. And so they’re worried it’s going to get out of control.” Rather than trying to roll back the clock of technology, agencies overseeing U.S. markets have moved to require algorithmic traders, and the people who design their trading systems, to register with regulators. “Some of the biggest traders in our markets are not currently subject to our oversight, and we need a way to make sure they are following reasonable risk controls,” CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad said in a Sept. 27 speech. “And, in fact, some of those traders have supported a registration requirement.” The CFTC, which oversees the futures market, has drafted a controversial proposal that would go further, extending its record-keeping requirements to the source code underlying automated trading systems. The rule, which has yet to be finalized, would require algorithmic traders to maintain repositories that would track changes to their code, which could then be made available to investigators in the event something went wrong in the markets. Industry critics are fighting this aspect of the rule, arguing that giving the government access to their sensitive intellectual property—the secret sauce of their algorithms—is too big a risk. In an interview, CFTC Commissioner J. Christopher Giancarlo, the lone Republican on the panel that approves rules at the agency, said it was a “retrograde action” that would have a “stifling impact on trading technology innovation in the United States.” Massad, for his part, promises final language that “respects and protects confidentiality” while still giving the agency a look at the code when it’s investigating problems. “Our desire has never been to require that source code be turned over to us routinely,” he says. In another approach, the SEC is drafting an “anti-disruptive trading" rule as a preventive measure against potentially dangerous forms of high-volume, high-frequency trading. The SEC has not announced what trading strategies it will try to outlaw—as of now, the rule is being signaled but hasn’t been formally proposed—but the head of the agency has pointed to the Treasury market report as being “instructive” in identifying aggressive activities that could work against investors. Although those solutions all come from the regulatory side, it’s possible that high-frequency traders will ultimately find themselves corralled by the private sector. The hero, if there was one, of Lewis's “Flash Boys” was a new firm called IEX: a startup stock-trading venue whose founders wanted to provide investors with a protected place to trade without being “scalped" by predatory traders who had faster access to data from exchanges. Their innovation was a “speed bump”—a coil of fiber optic cable designed to slow down market access by 350 microseconds. In September 2015, IEX asked the SEC to allow it to become a full-fledged stock exchange, like the NYSE and NASDAQ; after months of intense lobbying on both sides of the proposal, the SEC signed off on its application in June—marking a major milestone in the agency's response to high-frequency trading. It's evidence that regulators are willing to let the private sector sort out some of the big concerns cropping up with trading technology. “They’re standing on the sidelines watching the private sector experiment with market design,” Kirilenko said of regulators, predicting that not much more than that would happen soon. “They will stand on the sidelines until the next flash crash.” 5 signs you, personally, are disrupting the banking system The charter war Welcome to the Future of Money Can Washington control high-tech lending?

Cramer created the acronym FANG for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now under the parent name of Alphabet. The new abbreviation of FAAA represents Facebook, Alibaba, Alphabet and Amazon. "We have to talk about how these FAAA stocks got their groove back in order to figure out what it means for them going forward as we head into the fourth quarter," the "Mad Money" host said. On Tuesday, JPMorgan raised its 2017 year-end price targets for FANG stocks, noting that investors have returned to the group in search of growth. While many investors may question why they should care about 2017 year-end targets when it's not even the end of 2016 yet, Cramer clarified why it's important for those seeking growth. "Real growth investors don't particularly care about this year's numbers because classic high-growth stocks always look expensive on the near-term estimates. But if things go right, they will turn out to be very cheap once we get to the out-years," Cramer said. VCG | Getty Images Alibaba Group Chairman Jack Ma Alphabet currently sells for 19 times next year's earnings estimates, the same earnings multiple of the average stock in the S&P 500. Considering the company's rapid growth, Cramer found the earnings multiple insanely cheap. Facebook was even cheaper. Its growth rate is more than 30 percent, yet it only sells for 25-times earnings. Amazon and Netflix were more problematic for Cramer. JPMorgan came up with a blended formula that takes into account Amazon's Web Services to get to its $1,000 price target. The analyst got to the Netflix valuation by trying to value the company's international revenue and streaming earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Cramer explained why he booted Netflix from FANG, stating "I just can't trust Netflix after two consecutive missed quarters until I see some acceleration in domestic sign-ups." While JPMorgan did not formally cover Alibaba, it still valued the stock at $135 on the sum of parts basis, up from $108 on Tuesday. So, when Cramer heard CNBC's "Halftime Report" discussing FANG on Tuesday, he decided to make a surprise appearance on the show to present FAAA. "I made my case that FAAA has a long, long way to run, just like the 'Sound of Music,' but I stood my ground about Netflix concerns, point blank saying that Amazon is now disrupting them," Cramer said. Some of the move behind these stocks on Tuesday was simply because of scarcity of value, too. There aren't many consistent high-growth stocks out there right now. Many have also asked Cramer why he has not included Apple in the FAAA acronym. But after two down quarters, Apple no longer looked like a classic growth story to Cramer. "I think these companies have the ability to grow for years. With the exception of Alphabet's rumored interest in acquiring Twitter, FAAA represents the complete package," Cramer said. Cramer said the market is once again in fast-growth mode, thanks to the Federal Reserve admitting that the economy has slowed. Cramer's charitable trust owns Facebook and Alphabet. He thinks Amazon is too expensive currently, and he said he missed Alibaba. With a positive outlook for the future on this group, Cramer recommended investors to own one or two of FAAA in their portfolio. Questions for Cramer?

JPM Shuffles Auto Finance, Consumer, Wealth Management Heads By Tanaya Macheel September 27, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related JPMorgan Shuffles Three Top Execs in Cards, Mortgages Most Powerful Women: Thasunda Duckett, JPMorgan Chase How JPMorgan Chase Women Help Create Their Own Opportunities What Bankers Want (and Don't Want) from President Trump 'That's Just Really, Really Bad': Bank CEOs React to Wells Scandal Why Media Representation Matters for Women in Banking JPMorgan Chase's Thasunda Duckett has been named chief executive officer of consumer banking as part of one of the bank's periodic management reshufflings. Duckett, who was previously CEO of the bank's auto finance arm, is succeeding Barry Sommers, who was named a co-CEO of JPMorgan Wealth Management and Investment Solutions, a newly created unit serving the firm’s clients across the wealth spectrum, according to an internal memo shared with American Banker on Tuesday. Duckett had led auto finance since 2013, managing a portfolio of more than $60 billion in assets and relationships with 75% of U.S. franchised automotive dealers. Before that, she led national sales for mortgage banking. She was named one of American Banker's 25 Women to Watch in 2015 and 2016. In her new role she will oversee a banking network with more than $807 billion in deposits and investments, 5,300 branches and more than 47,000 employees, including 3,000 financial advisers. The bank will name her successor "shortly," Gordon Smith, CEO of consumer and community banking, said in the memo, and in the interim the auto finance leadership team will report to him. Sommers joined the consumer and community banking side of JPMorgan from asset management six years ago. In his new role he will oversee the client business — including JPMorgan Private Bank, JPMorgan Securities and Chase Wealth Management — with Brian Carlin. As the co-CEO in charge of investment and banking solutions, Carlin will be responsible for wealth management platforms and oversee the digital wealth management and institutional wealth management businesses. Carlin worked in asset management for 15 years, serving as chief financial officer for the last three. Before that he ran products and investments in JPMorgan's private bank. The reshuffling is the latest example of the company's strategic approach to ensuring its executives are well versed in all the company's businesses and fully understand the breadth of the organization. Earlier this year, Eileen Serra, then chief executive of the Chase Card Services unit, stepped down to advise the company on growth initiatives. Kevin Watters, who was previously CEO of mortgage banking, took her place.

The city’s employment growth is outpacing overall U.S. growth But Detroit has a relatively weak labor force participation rate. Only 62 percent of Detroiters between the ages of 16 and 64 are employed As part of its $100 million commitment to Detroit's economic recovery, the banking company JPMorgan Chase on Tuesday detailed how it had spent $1.3 million to boost skills training for in-demand jobs as it provided support for partnerships among job seekers, local employers and training providers. The new grants will support the Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation, United Way for Southeastern Michigan and Corporation for a Skilled Workforce. “By aligning our investments with the city’s workforce priorities, we are giving more residents the chance to climb the economic ladder and gain critical job skills and we are helping workforce leaders build effective job training and employer engagement programs,” Chauncy Lennon, head of workforce initiatives at JPMorgan Chase said in a statement. Related: Chase gives $4M jobs grant for Detroit About 6,200 more Detroiters are working today than in January and the city’s employment growth is outpacing overall U.S. growth, according to the city. Still, a recent Chase-backed report found that Detroit has a relatively weak labor force with only 62 percent of Detroiters between the ages of 16 and 64 employed. Additionally, many residents do not have the necessary skill and education levels to qualify for good-paying local jobs while workforce training programs were not well enough aligned with the needs of residents and employers.

The academy will help up to 20 local senior workforce leaders better engage employers, understand industry workforce needs, develop successful career pathway strategies and strengthen connections between training providers, job seekers and employers through a year-long program. More information about the program can be found here.  $680,000 for Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation to provide 100 pre-apprenticeships that are focused on career-specific skills development for jobs in the information technology, manufacturing, healthcare, advanced manufacturing and transportation/logistics industries. $150,000 for United Way for Southeastern Michigan to enable the Detroit Regional Workforce Fund, through its Access for All program, will create a pipeline of 100 new workers that have the necessary training and skills for careers in the construction and manufacturing industries. Also, the investment will support the growth of a prisoner re-entry program that connects ex-offenders to employment opportunities in skilled trades and other critical services.

(AMZN) Is Going to $1,000 Amazon stock is powered by the triumvirate of business: a legacy baseline, growthy projects and an all-time great leader By Tom Taulli, InvestorPlace Writer & IPO Playbook Editor  |  Sep 27, 2016, 2:35 pm EST     Popular Posts: The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the World Why Mobileye NV (MBLY) Stock Is a Buyout Lock 3 Absolutely Frightening Trends for Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Recent Posts: Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock: Is the Trump Boost Over? Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Is Screeching to a Halt The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the World View All Posts Since the dawn of the Internet Age in the mid-1990s, hundreds of dot-coms have come and gone. But Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has built a lasting empire — and made many people very rich in the process. Amazon stock has logged an astounding 47,000%-plus gain during its existence, and it’s now worth $387 billion by market capitalization. Source: Mike Seyfang via Flickr And yet, AMZN still feels like a scrappy startup. During the past 12 months, it has been one of the biggest gainers among large-cap stocks (up roughly 55%). Even Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) has only gained 40% in the past year. And it has done so not just on the back of its giant retail operations, but thanks to explosive growth in cloud services and expansion in streaming video. Can Amazon stock keep up the momentum? JPMorgan certainly thinks so — its analysts boosted their price target on AMZN from $925 to a nice, clean $1,000. That would be a return of more than 20% from today’s prices. I’m completely on board with JPMorgan’s bullishness on Amazon stock. Here are three reasons why: #1: Amazon, The E-Commerce Juggernaut Amazon has spent billions of dollars building its e-commerce platform — not just website development, but building warehouses, installing logistics systems and even deploying robots. AMZN also was smart in developing the Prime program — not just for the one-hour delivery, but because add-on services such as music and video help engage users. 10 Stocks That Should Be in Your Portfolio Right Now All in all, Amazon has built an enormous moat that most rivals can’t touch. According to eMarketer, AMZN controls nearly three-quarters of the U.S. e-commerce market. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT)? Try 3%. E-commerce still is a growth market, too. Based on research from Forrester, e-commerce sales are forecast to improve from $344 billion in 2015 to $480 billion by 2019. Consumers are shifting their buying habits, moving away from traditional brick-and-mortar operators like Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M) to digital platforms. Amazon stock should reap the benefits this holiday season, just like the rest. In anticipation of the spurt in revenues, AMZN has opened 18 new fulfillment centers, up from just six last year. It’s just prudent planning. After all, Signal and Shift Communications say about 43% of internet users already are thinking about using Amazon as their primary holiday shopping source. Amazon Web Services (AWS) One longstanding knock against Amazon stock was the company’s long history of net losses. But these are becoming a thing of the past. For the past five quarters, AMZN has pumped out profits — including three quarterly earnings that reached record levels. Yes, the aforementioned e-commerce business remains a low-margin category. But Amazon is countering that with its high-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, which provides cloud services to businesses. In the latest quarter, AWS revenues spiked from $1.82 billion to $2.89 billion. That’s nice. Operating income came to a $718 million. That’s just flat-out juicy. The cloud market represents a megatrend in the tech industry. The technology tends to be cheaper than legacy systems, but allows for better analytics and training with less overall maintenance. Amazon isn’t alone. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are ramping their cloud efforts, too. The prospects look bright for this part of the market, with Morgan Stanley predicting that global spending will jump from $70 billion last year to $141 billion by 2019. Jeff Bezos Has Been Great for Amazon Stock Jeff Bezos is one the world’s best CEOs. During the past two decades, he has fended off scores of tough competitors (and even buried a few), and survived grueling recessions and tech busts. A key to his success has certainly been the undeniable focus on his customers. He once summed up his thinking with this little phrase: “Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient.” Bezos hasn’t won on every front, of course. Anyone remember the ill-fated Fire Phone? But innovators rarely have unscathed records, and Bezos has plenty of success — like the Kindle and Echo — to make up for the failures. How Tesla Motors (TSLA) Turned a Hack Into a Competitive Advantage Bezos also has a good sense of finding breakout opportunities, such as AWS, which he built from scratch and turned into a cash cow in roughly a decade. That’s ultimately what will move the needle for Amazon stock.

The grants announced Tuesday are part its earlier $100 million commitment to Detroit's economic recovery. The company says the training will be for in-demand jobs and to help strengthen partnerships between job seekers, local employers and training providers. The funding supports efforts by the Detroit Employment Solutions Corp., the United Way for Southeastern Michigan and the Corporation for a Skilled Workforce. Plans call for a new leadership development academy for local workforce professionals, improving connections between Detroiters and existing job openings in growing local industries and addressing skills desired by local employers that job seekers might need. ___ Online: http://www.jpmorganchase.com Trending http://www.clickondetroit.com

JPM Hires Moven Co-Founder Alex Sion as Banking, Fintech Converge By Penny Crosman September 27, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Worlds collide: "The differences are actually getting smaller" between fintech and banking, says Alex Sion, who is leaving his startup to work at the country's largest financial institution RELATED Battle for Talent Heats Up as Digital Banking Becomes Paramount JPM Names Digital Boss; Memo Implies Predecessor Forced Out of Role Citi Recruits JPM's Gavin Michael to Lead Consumer Technology Digital Asset Recruits Execs from RBS, JPMorgan, B of A How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue JPMorgan Chase has hired Alex Sion, co-founder of the mobile-only neobank Moven, to lead its mobile apps. The move is an example of how banks are looking to fintech entrepreneurs to bring innovation in, and it illustrates the emphasis and importance banks are putting on their mobile channels. It's also the latest round of musical chairs for big banks' digital channel executives. Sion will start his new job, executive director of mobile banking at Chase, on Oct. 3. "My new role is to keep promoting mobile leadership and innovation across all of Chase's mobile assets," Sion said in an email interview. "Chase is absolutely committed to leading the pack in digital." Sion is not new to the challenges of working in a big bank. He was at one time senior vice president of wealth management at Citigroup. What's it like to go from the banking world to the fintech world and back? "The differences are actually getting smaller since we're all trying to accomplish most of the same things for the customer: make banking more simple and personal," Sion said. "That wasn't the focus when Moven first started. So, for banks like Chase, who are committed to customer-centricity and digital leadership, the differences become mainly around managing scale." Sion will work with the bank's digital team at 5 Manhattan West, a space that was recently renovated to foster agile development, with designated scrum rooms, play areas and white boards galore. He will report to Jason Alexander, executive director of digital platforms, who reports to Bill Wallace, a Chase veteran who took Gavin Michael's position as head of digital for consumer banking in August, when Michael left to head consumer technology for Citi. Michael replaced Mark Torkos, who retired in July. Chase's mobile app has 25 million active users. "Mobile is becoming more and more central to the banking experience, so Alex will develop and drive the evolution of that mobile strategy and execution across Chase," said spokeswoman Rebecca Acevedo. "We're seeing the importance of digital in all our businesses as customers continue to turn to Digital to complete many of their banking tasks. We want our digital experiences to be simple, personal, human and cohesive." Moven's other co-founder, Brett King, not only wishes Sion well but spent several months hashing over his different job offers with him. "We talked a lot about the opportunities that were presenting themselves to Alex," King said. "He had a number of offers, as you'd imagine. We talked through what was best for his career and also what was best for Moven. We both agreed that from a visibility perspective, this move to Chase would be seen as a win for Moven; it showed the credibility of his pedigree with Moven." King noted that Sion has been at Moven for six years. "It's not like he didn't give it a fair shot," King said. "And also, the business is fairly mature now. We've been going from that early stage to a growth company and it requires some different skills." Such skills include being able to deliver revenue and sales consistently. "It's not that Alex can't do that stuff, but I think he wanted a challenge again," King said. "Taking on 25 million mobile users at Chase, that's about as big as a challenge gets." At Moven, this transition has been in the works for months. Mircea Mihaescu, chief operating officer, and a couple of other team members have taken over Sion's responsibilities. "The transition has been lengthy and has been handled by Alex," King said. Moven, which recently signed on TD Bank and Westpac New Zealand as clients, has a couple of big banks in the pipeline to join as customers late this year or early next year. The company has also recently hired people in Europe and Asia to help oversee regional operations. This isn't the first time a bank has poached a Moven executive. Mohamed Khalil, who used to be Moven's head of product, data and partnerships, became chief innovation officer at Commonwealth Bank of Australia just over a year ago. "The overall message is we're proud of Alex and we think it's a great opportunity for him," King said. "He's done Moven proud."

Source: Xinhua News Agency—Xinhua News Agency/Getty ImagesMore There is no question that Wells Fargo’s (WFC) fraudulent creation of over 2 million accounts using personal information is bad for its business. Optics wise, it’s horrible, affecting consumers directly, leaving many of them with annoying messes to clean up. But the mess does offer the bank a silver lining amidst all the scandal—an excuse to to cull 5,300 employees from its payroll, something Wells Fargo likely would have done eventually either way. Today’s retail banking climate may paint a rosy picture with plenty of modern customer conveniences like mobile check deposit and shorter lines, as some bank branches direct customers to ATMs instead of tellers. But for the bank branch employees the apps and ATMs usurp, it’s shaping up to be a John Henry-esque tale of human versus machine that is sure to have a tragic ending. In July, Bank of America’s (BAC) president of retail banking announced that the bank would likely lay off 8,400 workers, a response to the dwindling customer base that actually wanders into branches. According to the Financial Times, Bank of America’s president of retail banking laid out the trend in numbers showing how much the head count had fallen, from 108,000 employees in 2009 to 68,400, with the final personnell goals to be around the low 60,000s. For other banks, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) made plans last year to ax one teller per branch by the end of 2016, around 5,000 total. Even banks on a slightly smaller level have suffered, with Comerica laying off 800 and closing 40 locations in July. The trend isn’t even just in the US. In Germany, Deutsche Bank (DB) shuttered 188 branches in June, cutting 3,000 employees. In this context, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s question of why the higher-ups remain while Wells Fargo has been dispatching so many lower-level employees over several years might gain an answer. There’s no question that employees defrauding customers should be dealt with accordingly, with termination the minimum. But according to reports from CNN Money, Wells Fargo did not outline many options for success, retaliating against employees who called the ethics hotline (an employee confirmed this, but Wells Fargo itself did not comment on that matter). Bloomberg’s Matt Levine laid it out best, breaking down the paths down which the bank funneled its employees: 1. Open fake accounts to meet sales goals: Maybe get fired. 2. Don’t open fake accounts, miss sales goals: Probably get fired. 3. Tell executives about all the fake accounts: Definitely get fired really fast. With all roads leading to the same outcome, it’s hard to not wonder whether Wells Fargo wasn’t looking for a certain result, given how the bank itself paved those roads with its policies. If this was in fact engineered – at least in part – to conveniently fire 5,300 employees, perhaps Wells Fargo simply underestimated the amount of bad PR. Or maybe they didn’t. After all this scandal fades into the rear-view mirror, the bank may not emerge quite so battered as it seems. The $185 million fine from the CFPB, big as it sounds, wasn’t that big as far as banking fines go, as a former director at the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection told CNN Money. From the customer side of things, though Wells Fargo may not lure any new fans, several factors will keep consumers from leaving. Not only is it a huge pain to change banks, but people who discovered credit cards in their names may not want to close them, since that would actually hurt their credit. Eventually, everybody could just forget it all, accepting the scandal as just more bad behavior of banks they’ve come to expect. Shaking matters up further, Wells Fargo’s board used the pressure applied by Congress—and the general public—to announce a clawback in executive pay on Tuesday for CEO John Stumpf and the head of community banking, Carrie Tolstedt, whose retirement was simultaneously announced. In addition to assuaging the public’s lust for executive blood, this move keeps $60 million in stock under the company’s ownership, around 32% of the fine. The bank also said it would consider further clawbacks as its independent inquiry goes forward. The stock rose in after-hours trading following the news but has since dropped back to Tuesday levels. Wells Fargo may face more fallout over the scandal: The Labor Department announced it will investigate the company’s workplace practices. And on Thursday, Congress once again hosts its top brass, and senators such as Elizabeth Warren have likely begun preheating the oven.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Failing insurers. Rising premiums. Financial losses. The deteriorating Obamacare market that the health insurance industry feared is here. As concerns about the survival of the Affordable Care Act’s markets intensify, the role of nonprofit “co-op” health insurers -- meant to broaden choices under the law -- has gained prominence. Most of the original 23 co-ops have failed, dumping more than 800,000 members back onto the ACA markets over the last two years. Many of those thousands of people were sicker and more expensive than the remaining insurers expected -- and they’re hurting results. With more of the nonprofits on the brink of folding, the situation for the remaining providers looks dire. Anthem Inc., for example, is facing an estimated $300 million in losses on its exchange business for individual plans this year, after turning a profit in 2014 and almost breaking even on the program in 2015, according to the company. “These co-ops have attracted, we think, disproportionately high health-care utilizers,” Gary Taylor, an analyst with JPMorgan who follows the industry, said in a telephone interview. Their former members “are now enrolled in these for-profit health plans. That’s been a factor driving the deterioration in their profitability.” ‘Death Spiral’ Large insurers including Aetna Inc. and UnitedHealth Group Inc. have already pulled back from Obamacare’s markets, citing losses. Anthem has said it remains committed to the program. “Are we in an Obamacare ‘death spiral?’” health insurance consultant Robert Laszewski asked in a Sept. 9 bulletin to clients, where he described the grim scenario. In a death spiral, as options for coverage shrink, insurers attract increasingly sick patients and suffer losses. That forces them to raise rates, driving away healthy, profitable customers. Facing more losses, they raise rates again, causing more healthy people to leave, and so on -- until all that’s left are high premiums and a small pool of the unwell.  People getting insurance in the ACA markets still have access to affordable plans, said Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the health-care program. “America is on stronger footing today because of the Affordable Care Act with 20 million gaining health coverage and the uninsured rate is at the lowest point on record,” he said in an e-mail. “Consumers are satisfied with their coverage, have better access to care, and greater financial security -- core metrics of success.” For a Bloomberg Quick Take on Obamacare, Click Here. Disproportionate Share Some insurers may already be feeling the burden of increasingly sick patients. Anthem’s then-Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt said in April the company was “disproportionately picking up market share” in states where co-ops had folded. On a July conference call, Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish said that as the insurer had brought in new membership, its costs of caring for patients with heart disease, diabetes and especially dialysis had increased. Jill Becher, an Anthem spokeswoman, said the CEO’s comments referred to the company’s overall ACA membership. The company expects to break even on its ACA business next year and return it to profitability in 2018, Swedish said last week at a conference in New York. Still, some analysts aren’t convinced. David Windley, an analyst at Jefferies LLC, cut his rating on Sept. 13 to “hold” from “buy,” citing in part Anthem’s “potential to inherit sick members from peers exiting exchanges.” Aetna and Humana Inc. are each on track to lose at least $300 million on Obamacare this year and have joined rivals in leaving many areas where they sell ACA plans. The broad retreat of payers -- including co-ops -- “is one of the contributing factors to our inability to responsibly maintain our current footprint,” T.J. Crawford, an Aetna spokesman, said by phone. Many Miscalculations Representatives of Humana didn’t respond to calls seeking comment. Tyler Mason, a spokesman for UnitedHealth, declined to comment. Both insurers sold Obamacare coverage in states where co-ops have closed, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jason McGorman. The demise of 17 of the 23 original co-ops came after many miscalculations. The nonprofits priced plans lower than private insurers in many states, attracting large memberships that exceeded enrollment projections by as much as three times, according to Scott Harrington, a professor of insurance and risk management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. As enrollments rose, so did costs. In states like Kentucky, Nevada and South Carolina, co-ops struggled with members who had never before had coverage and required more treatments, former executives said. South Carolina’s co-op patients “skewed older and had higher medical needs,” said Jerry Burgess, who was chief executive of the now-defunct Consumers’ Choice Health Insurance Co., in a telephone interview. “If we took in a dollar on premiums, we were spending a dollar on medical expense. You can’t sustain that, you’re in a loss position.” Co-ops were also hurt by an ACA program intended to transfer funds from insurers with healthier customers to those with sick ones, called “risk adjustment.” The program considered many of the co-ops’ members to be healthier than those with other insurers, though the co-ops say that’s not the case.  Because of risk adjustment, the co-ops were sometimes required to pay hefty sums to larger rivals. Some have sued federal officials over the program, seeking to avoid making the payments. While Albright, the CMS spokesman, declined to comment on the lawsuits, the agency has proposed implementing some of the insurers’ suggested changes. It’s not clear whether the remaining co-ops can survive without additional funding, said Deep Banerjee, an analyst with S&P Global. The nonprofit in New Jersey won’t sell policies next year, while Maine-based Community Health Options is pulling out of New Hampshire. More Exits The co-op exits this year mean that at least 60,000 people will have to pick new plans for 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. If all the remaining co-ops were to fail, it could strand another 240,000 members, the data show. If that happens, Anthem may shoulder even more of the burden, Goldman Sachs’s Matthew Borsch said Aug. 23 in a note to clients. Given its large presence on the exchanges, Anthem might be “left with a more risk-imbalanced exchange population following exits by the other public companies, and most of the remaining not-for-profit ACA co-op plans,” Borsch said.   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

Elizabeth Warren said the move is a "small step," but doesn't think the bank went far enough. The German government was forced to deny that it is working on a rescue of Deutsche Bank, and we got the internal Deutsche Bank memo on its bombed-out share price which says it doesn't need to raise money. On Wall Street, UBS has made a marquee hire in New York, and JPMorgan promoted a rising star in its biggest business. Ken Moelis, the CEO of the investment bank Moelis & Company, expects Donald Trump to win the US presidential election in November. And the Fed is thinking about making big changes to how it tests America's largest banks. Julian Robertson, the legendary hedge fund manager behind Tiger Management, thinks central banks are fueling bubbles throughout financial markets. In company news,  Tempur Sealy, the maker of TempurPedic mattresses and other bedding products, reported a dismal update on its business sending its shares in a tailspin.  SABMiller  shareholders backed the brewer's $100-billion-plus takeover by rival Anheuser-Busch InBev by a large majority on Wednesday, paving the way for one of the biggest corporate mergers in history.  In the tech industry, BlackBerry is going to stop making its own smartphones. Uber has finally a CFO.

Chandrasekaran , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ?

(NASDAQ: AMZN) have improved in the current month, as the third quarter is nearing its closure. One of the reasons for this is likely the monetization of a number of announcements made over the last several years, which can be seen from the number of analysts having $1,000+ target prices on the stock compared to previously lower objectives. Until two months back, there was only one brokerage, Bernstein, that had a price objective of $1,000 on Amazon (with an attached Buy rating). However, in September, three brokerage houses, RBC Capital, Evercore ISI and JPMorgan have boosted their price target to $1,000 or above. Related Link: Amazon Is Taking Over The Market One Sector At A Time MKM Partners and Deutsche Bank came close to the four-figure level with $995 and $985 as their respective target prices. Evercore cited four key factors for boosting the price objective: Fresh evaluation of retail automation. Realizing gains from the investments made in the last several years. Increasing estimates on FBA. Automation offering quantifiable financial gains from costs. Similarly, RBC Capital Markets pointed out online consumer survey that indicated Amazon extending its lead as the most preferred online retail site. The brokerage pointed out that 89 percent of the respondents favored the biggest online retailer. Another factor is the improving adoption rate of Prime Service that recorded 9 percentage points growth. The survey suggested that 76 percent of the respondents started using the service more compared to the time when they joined the program. The following brokerages have a $1,000+ price target on Amazon shares: JPMorgan has $1,000 target price with a Buy rating. Evercore ISI kept a price target of $1,015 with a Buy rating. RBC Capital has a price objective of $1,000 with a Buy rating. At time of writing this, the stock traded up by $12.16, or 1.49 percent, to $828.27 — still offering about a 20 percent upside potential. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

Citi Gives ClearXchange's Bank P-to-P Network a Boost By Tanaya Macheel September 28, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints IMAGE: Bloomberg News Related How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue Citi will join Early Warning's clearXchange, giving the bank-operated digital transfer network a boost as it takes on apps like PayPal’s Venmo. Like Venmo, clearXchange lets customers of participating banks send money to each other with minimal navigation, requiring only the email address or mobile phone number of the intended recipient. Citi aims to implement this function in early 2017, it said in a press release Wednesday. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo founded clearXchange to attract consumers to user-friendly bank-based money transfer systems, such as Chase QuickPay or Wells Fargo SurePay (although clearXchange has never been promoted as a consumer brand). The three cover more than half of the online banking market. U.S. Bank, Capital One, Frost Bank and FirstBank have since joined. In 2015, Early Warning, a bank-led risk management initiative, acquired clearXchange, which has since become a part of the banks' faster payments strategy, and clearXchange is considered a launch point for uses beyond P-to-P transfers, such as government payouts and insurance claims disbursements. ClearXchange is also developing a dedicated money transfer smartphone app called Zelle that would be in direct competition with with PayPal, Square and Circle for an October launch. “We are pleased to join the clearXchange network, enabling millions of Citi clients to make real-time person-to-person payments to anyone with a U.S. bank account,” Barry Rodrigues, head of global digital payments for Citi’s global consumer bank, said in the release. “As the payments landscape continues to rapidly evolve, Citi is committed to making it easier for our customers to move their money quickly, safely and seamlessly.” Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints JOIN THE DISCUSSION Comment SEE MORE IN Bank Technology RELATED TAGS Comments (0) Be the first to comment on this post using the section below.

The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this rating action commentary. Today's rating actions have been taken as part of Fitch's periodic review of U.S. consumer-focused internet banks, which comprises four publicly rated firms. KEY RATING DRIVERS VRs, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The rating affirmations and Stable Outlook reflect DFS's strong franchise supported by its owned payments network, peer-superior credit performance, strong and consistent financial performance over time, diverse funding base, ample liquidity, strong risk-adjusted capitalization, robust risk frameworks, and seasoned management team. Rating constraints include DFS's concentrated and cyclical business model, potential funding sensitivity associated with wholesale and internet deposit funding sources, the likelihood of asset quality reversion from current levels, and continued elevated regulatory and legislative risk. Furthermore, ratings remain constrained by DFS's weaker relative market position within the increasingly competitive payments industry, as evidenced by its smaller market share compared to payment network peers (e.g. Visa, MasterCard and American Express) and general purpose credit card issuers (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup). Fitch views DFS's ability to generate strong and consistent operating performance over time as a rating strength. Net income for 1H16 increased 0.5% to $1.2 billion, which included a non-recurring tax benefit of $44 million. Excluding non-recurring items, Fitch estimates net income would have declined versus the prior year period driven primarily by a 35% increase in provision for loan losses in 2Q16. Return on equity in 1H16 remained strong at 21%. Fitch expects DFS's financial performance to remain relatively stable over the near term, although with greater volatility within specific line items. Fitch expects net interest income growth to improve as a result of strategies being undertaken to increase market share in the credit card business through targeted marketing initiatives, new product introductions, innovative rewards programs, and highly regarded customer service. Loan growth and modest net interest margin expansion should be at least partially offset by further loss reserve building and elevated reward costs.. Credit performance is expected to remain relatively stable in 2H16, although charge-offs and delinquencies will likely start to normalize from historically low levels. Fitch expects the loan loss provision to increase further in 2016 driven primarily by the seasoning of balances stemming from new account growth in recent years, as well as some modest deterioration in credit metrics. Nonetheless, DFS maintains a relatively seasoned credit card portfolio, with only 18% of the portfolio having a tenure of less than three years. Credit card net charge-offs increased three basis points (bps) to 2.37% in 1H16, and remained well below other top credit card issuers and the industry average. Reserve coverage for credit card loans remained strong at 2.80% of loans and 172% of loans past due at June 30, 2016. DFS is well-positioned for further increases in U.S. interest rates. At June 30, 2016, assuming an immediate 100 bps increase in interest rates, DFS estimates that net interest income over the following 12-month period would increase by approximately $230 million, or 3%. However, the interest rate sensitivity of the online deposit channel remains untested during periods of rising interest rates. Despite high levels of capital distributions to shareholders in recent years, Fitch believes DFS remains well-capitalized. At June 30, 2016, DFS's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio (CET1) was 14.3% on a Basel III transitional basis, or an estimated 14.2% on a fully phased-in Basel III basis. DFS's tangible common equity/tangible assets ratio was 12.0% at June 30, 2016. These metrics compare favorably to peers. Additionally, DFS performed well relative to peers in the most recent Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). As part of this review, DFS received a non-objection from the Fed on its capital plan in June 2016. Fitch expects DFS's CET1 ratio to gradually decline over time before normalizing at a level in the low double digits. In this scenario, Fitch believes DFS would remain adequately capitalized relative to existing ratings. DFS maintains adequate liquidity with strong risk oversight. At June 30, 2016, DFS's liquidity portfolio amounted to $13.5 billion (or 15.5% of tangible assets), and excluding deposits, the company has a very manageable $400 million in unsecured debt maturities over the next twelve months. Fitch views DFS's liquidity position as strong and, when combined with future asset repayments, provides adequate sources to fund growth and meet its upcoming debt obligations. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES DFS's subordinated debt rating is rated one notch below the entity's VR of 'bbb+' in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profile. The subordinated note rating includes one notch for loss severity given the subordination of these securities in the capital structure, and zero notches for non-performance given contractual limitations on interest payment deferrals and no mandatory trigger events which could adversely impact performance. DFS's preferred stock ratings are rated five notches below DFS's VR of 'bbb+' in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profile. The preferred stock ratings include two notches for loss severity given these securities' deep subordination in the capital structure, and three notches for non-performance given that the dividends are non-cumulative and fully discretionary. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS Discover Bank's uninsured deposit ratings of 'A-'/'F2' are rated one notch higher than their respective IDRs because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference in the U.S. Fitch believes that this preference in the U.S. gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default. HOLDING COMPANY DFS's IDR and VR are equalized with its bank subsidiary, reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary failure and default probabilities. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR DFS has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's view, DFS is not systemically important, and therefore, the probability of sovereign support is unlikely. DFS's IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support. RATING SENSITIVITIES VRs, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that positive rating momentum is relatively limited over the outlook horizon. Longer term, rating momentum could be driven by consistent market share gains in card-based payments, increased revenue diversity, and sustained strong credit performance in non-card loan categories through the credit cycle. Other factors that could support positive rating actions include further clarity on regulatory and legislative issues (particularly as it relates to the student loan sector) and enhanced funding flexibility. In particular, the durability of DFS's internet-based deposit platform in a rising interest rate environment will be a key consideration in evaluating the strength of the company's funding profile. Negative rating action could be driven by a steady decline in profitability resulting from slowing loan growth, yield compression, a severe degradation in credit performance, a weakening liquidity profile, significant reductions in capitalization, and/or potential new and more onerous rules and regulations. Negative rating momentum could also be driven by an inability of DFS to maintain its competitive position and earnings prospects in an increasingly digitized payments and consumer lending landscape. The senior unsecured debt ratings are primarily sensitive to changes in the Long-term IDRs of DFS and Discover Bank. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The subordinated debt ratings are directly linked to Discover Bank's VR and would move in tandem with any changes in the VR. The preferred stock ratings are directly linked to DFS's VR and would move in tandem with any changes in DFS's credit profile. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS Discover Bank's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the IDR. The deposit ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in DFS's Long-and Short-Term IDRs. HOLDING COMPANY Should DFS's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to meet near-term obligations, there is the potential Fitch could notch the holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the bank subsidiary. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since DFS's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively, there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable future. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Discover Financial Services --Long-Term IDR at 'BBB+'; --Viability Rating at 'bbb+'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB+'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F2'; --Preferred stock at 'BB-'; --Support Rating at '5'; --Support Rating Floor at 'NF'. Discover Bank --Long-Term IDR at 'BBB+'; --Viability Rating at 'bbb+'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F2'; --Support Rating at '5'; --Support Rating Floor at 'NF'; --Long-term Deposits at 'A-'; --Short-term Deposits at 'F2'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB+'; --Subordinated Debt at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Additional information is available on www.fitchratings.com.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

Yellen said the Fed was looking at a more risk-sensitive, firm-specific approach to the test that would raise capital requirements for big U.S. banks based on their test results. Shares of JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup were down between 0.2-0.5 percent. Healthcare sector weighed the most on the benchmark S&P 500 index as Bristol-Myers and Amgen fell 1.2 percent each. The index had risen 0.7 percent on Tuesday. Adding to the downbeat market sentiment was the lowering of the 2016 U.S. growth forecast by the International Monetary Fund. "I think what we are seeing today is really a lot of noise," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. At 12:31 p.m. ET (1631 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.71 points, or 0.12 percent, at 18,206.59. The S&P 500 was down 3.94 points, or 0.18 percent, at 2,155.99. The Nasdaq Composite was down 11.36 points, or 0.21 percent, at 5,294.35. Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 indexes were in the red, with telecom services falling the most with a 1.4 percent drop. AT&T's 1.9 percent fall weighed the most on the sector. The stock was downgraded to "neutral" by UBS. Rival Verizon was down 1 percent. The energy index was set to have its best day in a week on speculation that OPEC members gathered in Algeria could lay the foundation for a deal to limit output. Nike dropped 3.1 percent and was among the top drags on the S&P and the Dow after the shoemaker's orders missed analysts' estimates for the third time in a row. Paychex dropped 4.5 percent after the payroll processor lowered its full-year profit forecast. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,600 to 1,29. On the Nasdaq, 1,454 issues fell and 1,211 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 12 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 71 new highs and 31 new lows.

If you intend to spend on your friends' and family's happiness this season, you might as well do it in a way that makes you happy, too. And that keeps your wallet in good shape while you're at it. Experts on credit cards and holiday shopping have some ideas about how to make that happen. Let’s look at the best options when it comes to credit cards that make it easier to say "Yes," and less likely to say "Oh no" when the bills arrive. 5 Cards for the Holidays When we talk about credit cards for holiday shopping, we’re looking at three key criteria: bonuses for signing up, cash back and rewards, and low interest rates. You want to get the most back for what you spend. Our experts include Bryan Marsden, personal-finance writer at FatWallet, and Matthew Goldman, founder and CEO of Wallaby Financial. Here’s what they recommend — both tapped the first three, and then we supply one additional pick from each. Citi Dividend Platinum: This card offers a $100 bonus when you spend $500 in three months (for new members). You get 1% cash back on all purchases, with an additional 4% on a rotating list of product categories. For this holiday season, that bonus 4% applies to Best Buy, department stores, and toy stores. It also features 0% interest for 12 months for new sign ups. Chase Freedom: This card also offers a $100 bonus for $500 spent in three months for new members. Add to that unlimited 1% cash back on all purchases, and an additional 4% on rotating categories (limited to $1500 spent for the quarter). For the holidays, that bonus applies to Amazon and select department stores. It sets 0% interest for 15 months for new sign ups. Discover IT: This card doesn't have any fancy sign up bonuses, but it does offer 5% rewards on all online shopping, and 1% for all other purchases, which makes it a solid card for holiday shopping if you plan on doing a lot of it from your screen(s). It also starts at 0% interest for 12 months for new cardholders. Chase Sapphire Preferred: Marsden suggests this one for the sign-up bonus. New cardholders get a 40,000-point bonus for spending $3,000 in three months. It gives two points for every dollar spent on travel and restaurants, and then one point per dollar spent on everything else. Perks include 20% off hotels, airfare, car rentals, and cruises, if you book through the Chase Sapphire portal. Note the $95 annual fee after the first year. Barclaycard Arrival World MasterCard: Goldman suggests this one as a way to rack up points for future travel (after knocking off your holiday buying). Two miles per dollar on all purchases, and then a 10% bonus when you use those points for travel. That’s like 2.2% cash back, he says. Travel insurance comes with, and you get a free subscription to TripIt Pro (a mobile travel assistant app), Note the second-year annual fee: $89.With these kinds of perks and benefits, you should be able to go down your list and feel a lot better about the end results. Whatever you do, make certain that you have a plan in place to make those monthly payments on time, so that the boost you feel from these cards aren’t overshadowed by buyer’s regret come April.

The company updated its expected pricing range for its 14 million shares to the range of $13 to $15 per share, with an overallotment option for an additional 2.1 million. The previous expected price range was $11 to $13 per share. At the maximum price, the entire offering is valued up to $241.5 million. The company intends to list its shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NTNX. The underwriters for the offering are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, RBC Capital Markets, Baird, Needham, Oppenheimer, Pacific Crest, Piper Jaffray, Raymond James, Stifel and William Blair. This company provides a leading next-generation enterprise cloud platform that converges traditional silos of server, virtualization and storage into one integrated solution and can also connect to public cloud services. Its software-driven platform delivers the agility, scalability and pay-as-you-grow economics of the public cloud, while addressing enterprise requirements of application mobility, security, data integrity and control. Nutanix has combined advanced web-scale technologies with elegant consumer-grade design to deliver a powerful enterprise cloud platform that elevates IT organizations to focus on the applications and services that power their businesses. Nutanix refers to its platform as “invisible infrastructure” because it provides constant availability and low-touch management, enables application mobility across computing environments and reduces inefficiencies in IT planning. A few of the highlights the company noted in the filing: Average billings growth of 20% on a quarterly basis for the last eight fiscal quarters, which grew from $60.8 million in the three months ended October 31, 2014 to $206.6 million in the three months ended July 31, 2016. Average revenue growth of 17% on a quarterly basis for the last eight fiscal quarters, which grew from $46.1 million in the three months ended October 31, 2014 to $139.8 million in the three months ended July 31, 2016. An increase in deferred revenue of 713% over the last eight fiscal quarters, which grew from $36.5 million as of July 31, 2014 to $296.5 million as of July 31, 2016. The company plans to use the net proceeds from this offering primarily for capital expenditures, as well as for general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and marketing activities, research and development and general and administrative matters.
