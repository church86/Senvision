The Atlanta-based company is working with Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to explore strategic options, including a possible initial public offering, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The company has drawn interest from potential buyers including Vantiv Inc., one of the people said. No final decision has been made and the company could decide to remain independent. Exploring both a sale and an IPO, known as a dual-track process, is common for private equity-owned companies as a way to determine the best exit for an investment. Representatives of Evo, Madison Dearborn, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Vantiv declined to comment. Madison Dearborn took a minority stake in EVO in 2013 to fund international expansion. In 2015, the company held preliminary talks with French computer-services provider Atos SE about being acquired. Atos had looked to combine EVO with payments-services business Worldline SA, in which it owns a majority stake. Evo, founded in 1989, has expanded beyond processing point of sale transactions in shops to include ATM, mail order and telephone services, according to its website. In partnership with Madison Dearborn, the company has entered into agreements with PKO Bank Polski SA and Bank of Ireland while acquiring Citigroup Inc.’s merchant business, Banamex.

Glassman moves easily from talking about energy prices to manufacturing to the presidential election. Just about anything can influence the economy, so he keeps tabs on it all. Sometimes he comes face-to-face with Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's high-profile CEO. "If I see him, I see him in an elevator. And then you have to worry about what [question] he's going to fire at you," Glassman said. But it's hard to picture Glassman caught unprepared, even if they stop at every floor. Glassman said Dimon devours the economic research he receives: "He has a way of taking the way we think about it in economic terms and putting it in his own terms, and probably connects with more people." Glassman was in Buffalo recently for a speaking engagement. With spring training in full swing, he pitched a baseball metaphor about the nation's job recovery: Jim Glassman, economist with JPMorgan Chase (Courtesy JPMorgan Chase) Q: Where you do you sense we are with the economy? A: I think the eighth inning. By that I mean, if you look at official unemployment, it implies we are in the ninth inning, that we're back to full employment. But the problem is, there's a couple of pockets of hidden unemployment that are not really reflected in the unemployment rate. This is what the (Federal Reserve's) been struggling with for a long time. You might think, if we're fully employed, why has the Fed been sitting on the sidelines, and why are they only now slowly moving back? Because the economy just doesn't feel like it's in the ninth inning yet. The populations that I'm focused on that are not really reflected in the official unemployment rate, are all the part timers, the people who have been put on part-time schedules. They want to be full time but they're part time. This is a really unusual thing in this last decade. ... Normally, in good times you have about 4 million people working part time involuntarily. In the recession, that exploded to 9 million people. If you're part time, you're not considered unemployed. The other population is all the young adults that vanished during the recession. ... Three million young people, 20 to 45 years of age, people in their prime working years, just dropped out and gave up looking for jobs. Most of them went back to school for more-specific job skills. ... Now, as we're watching the job market get better, all those people are coming back in again. It's a reminder that if you're trying to figure out what's the true picture in the U.S., you really  should be aware of these two populations of people.  ... I get an estimation more like 6.2 or 6.3 [percent] if I add these two populations. It's all getting better, but it's another way of saying, we're not quite there yet. We probably need another year or two before we can actually claim we're at full employment. And I think that must be on the Fed's mind, because it's going to take them a couple years to get the Fed funds rate back to something more normal, if they go slowly. Q: Why do you think the upstate New York economy tends to grow more slowly? A: In this last round, it might be because you are feeling a little bit of the pain that's been going on in the energy sector. And that's been affecting Canada, and the Canadian dollar dropped in response, so that's always a big issue for people in Buffalo, because there's a lot of cross-border traffic that takes place. The U.S. is more expensive to them. The technology sector on the West Coast, the financial sector in New York City, those are much more volatile industries. People might say, 'Oh why can't we get a piece of that?'  I think it's a blessing. Because yeah, good times are great, but when times are tough, that volatility turns out to be really difficult. The other thing that's going on right now on the coasts, Washington [state], Oregon, California, Florida and New York, they've been getting a lot of outside money coming in to the real estate market. So Chinese into the West Coast, Central American and Brazilian money into Florida.  In New York City, you were getting a lot of European money, until the Euro came down. ... Probably Buffalo is not part of that -- that seems to be driving the coasts more than anything. We've seen as the economy has come back, it's the coastal regions that have come back the most. And that was also where the real estate problems were most severe. Q: How would you gauge the health of U.S. manufacturing? A: The value of what we produce in this country has been pretty steady as a share of the economy. The thing that's going on is, the number of people we employ in manufacturing is drifting down. To economists, that means that innovation is the big disruptor. It's less about Mexico and China and globalization. In fact, we think that globalization is creating jobs. We have seen production shifting around. We are doing more auto production (in Mexico).But I really think the bigger challenge for manufacturers and guys in the industrial economy is about innovation. We're all facing this to some extent. But if you're living in the industrial economy, there aren't as many opportunities popping up in new jobs. We've seen 20 million [manufacturing] jobs go to 12 million. People find jobs, but the jobs they're getting are paying less than they were, and I think that's why there's so much frustration in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. Q: Do you think people have learned lessons about what led to the last recession? A: I'm not sure about that, because we have short memories. But I think the people who did learn a lesson are the people who provide the credit that was financing it. The U.S. is very unique, compared to anybody else in the world. In the U.S., housing is financed by the capital markets. There's a lot of focus on banks, but honestly, it's the capital markets that provide the financing. (A bank) makes you a loan, they take that loan and package it as a security. And then some investor buys that  -- maybe it's the teachers' [pension] fund, maybe it's the Chinese, maybe it's Europeans -- and really financing of the U.S. market is provided when investors buy mortgage-backed securities, which provides the credit. What we learned from the last decade was, when house prices got crazy, investors didn't realize that if it doesn't stay up there and prices come down, people may walk. I had so many outside investors tell me, 'I never realized Americans would walk when they go underwater.' That's the lesson the investor community learned., which makes me think we'll have more discipline next time this occurs. We always repeat mistakes. But I know for sure the next time, if we ever saw a repeat of this, you'll never hear analysts in my community say, 'Don't worry, because we've never seen house prices go down at a national level.' That's what we heard in the last decade. When you heard that sound, what was going on was, the investor community knew that  something was out of line, but they were trying to tell themselves, that was OK because house prices don't go down. Now the history books have evidence that actually did happen. Q: President Trump has criticized free trade agreements. How could his stance affect exporting? A: It's very tricky because there are trade abuses, I'm sure. Clients tell us about this all the time. So I think the administration is right to try to focus on if there are trade abuses if they cut deals. The problem is, part of what is driving the U.S. trade deficit is, we're open to a lot of poor countries. Asia, for example, is 10 percent of our living standard. So we're going to be out of balance for a long time, until their living standard rises. The problem is, if we're too protectionist, if we do things that undermine the development that is taking place at our partners, then we're going to hurt ourselves, as well. ... Our exports are up a couple trillion dollars over the last 10, 15 years. And yes, it's true the U.S. has a trade deficit. But what that really means is that, globalization is taking us three steps forward, but maybe one step back. ... I think the business community is hoping is that what Washington does is stay more focused on trade abuses, but don't get in the way of the development's that taking place, because we help ourselves when we help others.           Click here to see the comments.

Nisha Gopalan JPMorgan made $3.3 billion in revenue from investment banking (including trading and equity capital markets, debt capital markets and M&A) last year, about the same as Deutsche Bank made in 2015 when it ranked No. 1. Photo: Bloomberg Hong Kong: America, one; Europe, nil. In Asia, at least, US financial institutions are climbing up the investment banking league tables while their euro-area counterparts sink. But champagne corks shouldn’t be popping on Wall Street just yet. How long their current reign lasts will depend to a large degree on how long fixed income, currencies and commodities business remains robust. Deutsche Bank AG, weighed down by billions of dollars in fines for money laundering and manipulating interest rates, has slipped from pole position in Asia while JPMorgan Chase & Co., which expanded in FICC and equities, surged from seventh to first place, data from industry researcher Coalition show. The New York-based bank made $3.3 billion in revenue from investment banking (including trading and equity capital markets, debt capital markets and M&A) last year, about the same as Deutsche Bank made in 2015 when it ranked No. 1. In second spot in Asia is Citigroup Inc., followed by Morgan Stanley. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. coasted into sixth. It’s laid off about 30 bankers, most of them in Hong Kong and Singapore, as Chinese banks eat into all lenders’ share of the IPO pie and activity in Southeast Asia slows. Deutsche Bank’s come down shouldn’t be a major surprise considering the company’s litany of problems. Other European financial institutions have scaled back in the region, too. Barclays Plc closed its equities shop in Asia, while post the global financial crisis, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc is almost nowhere to be seen. Standard Chartered Plc has largely exited equities globally. JPMorgan Asia investment banking revenue, FY16 With China clamping down on mainland firms doing deals offshore, 2017 probably won’t be a big year for M&A, or investment banking in general for that matter. But a rebound in markets could spell the return of equities as a significant revenue driver, as was the case in the lead up to June 2015, before stocks in China crashed. That would be a boon for banks with strong equity franchises in the region, like UBS Group AG. It would also benefit Chinese lenders, which don’t have much of a fixed-income presence offshore but have been playing a bigger part in Hong Kong’s IPO market as they help mainland companies sell shares. Although exchange volumes in Asia Pacific are down 10.5% year-to-date, there are some notable bright pockets. Hong Kong is up 13.2%, for example, while year-on-year growth in Malaysia, India and Taiwan also reaches well into the double digits, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. American banks shouldn’t assume their good fortune is bulletproof.

May had delivered her vision two days earlier for pulling Britain out of the European Union's single market. Now the Wall Street banks, fearing Britain was headed for trouble, wanted to hear more about her strategy. Share this story At stake was London's future as a global financial centre. Among those present were Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and James Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley. Blankfein, a former gold trader raised in the Bronx who worked his way up to lead one of the world's most powerful investment banks, was the most direct during the talks, according to two bankers and a government official with knowledge of the meeting. "Lloyd asked where does the financial services industry stand in her list of priorities," according to one senior banking executive briefed on the discussion by his boss. "We contribute a double-digit percentage to Britain's GDP. We're the biggest taxpayer in the country." May gave a reply about the importance of financial services but declined to answer the question directly, the sources said. Some of the bankers left questioning her commitment. May and the banks declined to comment on the meeting. Over the past two decades, Goldman, like many of the other 250 foreign-owned banks in Britain, has consolidated its European operations in London to take advantage of the EU's $16.5 trillion-a-year single market. They are set to lose this wide-open access to a market of 500 million people after May signalled her main priority is to restrict immigration, which can only be achieved by leaving the trading bloc. Read also: What the #Brexit ruling means Senior bankers expected special treatment from the government after Britain voted to leave the EU. They expected ministers to champion their cause, above other industries, to retain unrestricted access to the single market for financial services. It isn't working out that way. A series of other meetings between bankers and government ministers have also ended badly, Reuters has learned. Bankers say May's ministers don't understand the industry and what is at stake, and don't want to hear negative news about Brexit. "We have entered a period of severe danger," said a Wall Street executive who runs the European operations of a global investment bank. "Parts of the government are being way too complacent." May's office, in a statement responding to the findings of this article, said the government didn't "recognise this version of events." The government is engaging intensively with the financial services industry, the statement said. Politicians say the bankers are exaggerating the threat. Some rebalancing of the economy away from financial services – which accounts for about 12 percent of Britain's economic output - will be good in the long run, they say. "It is all just lobbying. They make a brouhaha," said Peter Lilley, a pro-Brexit Conservative politician and former financier, who sits on the parliamentary committee examining Britain's exit from the EU. "They always massively exaggerate." The rift is in marked contrast to what's happening in the United States. There the populist backlash that made Donald Trump president has brought at least four former Goldman Sachs executives into senior positions in the new administration. But in Britain, the nationalist drive that produced Brexit delivered a prime minister determined not to be in thrall to bankers. The result is that banks are preparing to move large numbers of staff from London, and Germany and France are trying to lure jobs to their financial capitals. Some bankers believe the big winner from Brexit will be New York because some business currently carried out in London would naturally revert to U.S. headquarters. HSBC, UBS and Morgan Stanley have decided to move about 1,000 staff each from London in the next two years, according to sources familiar with their plans. This week Goldman Sachs said it would begin moving hundreds of people out of London as part of contingency plans for Britain leaving the EU. Not crying wolf Since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's "Big Bang" financial deregulation triggered a massive expansion of the industry 31 years ago, bankers have relied on being a powerhouse of Britain's economy to find a receptive ear in government. But in the aftermath of the vote to leave the EU, the sector is grappling with a new reality. Last year's vote triggered a change in leadership and tone at the heart of Britain's government. May pledged an industrial revival and to build an economy that works for everyone, not just the elite. Reuters spoke to more than 40 senior bankers from big British and international banks, politicians, government officials and lobbyists to piece together how the relationship between these pillars of Britain's establishment became strained. Those people say there are conflicting opinions about what the long-term results of Brexit will be for the world's fifth largest economy and whether finance should remain the biggest driver of its wealth. Read also: Brexit already having a negative effect in UK The government is making two calculations, these people say. The first is that bank executives are bluffing over moving jobs. The second: The EU is so dependent on London to service its debt that EU negotiators will give UK financial services a special deal to continue to operate unrestricted across the single market. EU officials counter that finance is mobile and business will move to other locations. Britain's finance industry contributed a record 71.4 billion pounds ($88.7 billion) in corporate and employee taxes to the government last year, according to the City of London Corporation. That is an amount equal to Britain's annual spending on primary education, the police, and the army. Put another way, finance contributes almost as much in tax as all taxpayers in Scotland and Wales combined. Nevertheless, May's ministers began telling bankers in the autumn they would not get any special treatment in the Brexit negotiations. The second most powerful executive at one of Britain's biggest banks said he and his colleagues felt wrong-footed. The executive said that he no longer receives phone calls from British cabinet ministers or invitations to Downing Street receptions as he did under previous governments. "With May there is almost no interest or affection. She is keeping us at arm's length," the executive said. "I will probably never meet May." Brexit minister David Davis, who will decide the industry priorities in the upcoming Brexit talks, rammed home the message that the government's relationship with the financial sector was changing in his first few meetings with bankers. Davis, a Eurosceptic from a working class background, bristles at being told what to do by bankers, according to colleagues and people who interact with him. Davis declined to comment. In an early phone conversation, he told one executive that the finance industry had damaged its relationship with the government by saying the economy would suffer from reduced immigration. The EU vote had delivered a clear message that immigration must be curbed, he said. Davis publicly attacked banks in October in parliament. He accused them of "an extraordinary outpouring almost of grief, a 'blame Brexit' festival," and of lying that they were going to fire staff because of Brexit. Davis's aides also warned executives they need to be more positive about the opportunities of Brexit if the government is going to listen to them, two banking sources said. Bank executives complain they feel they can't speak freely. "Everyone is worried about stoking up the Brexiteers, fuelling the flames," said the chairman of one of Britain's biggest insurance companies. A government official said the bankers' portrayal of the relationship doesn't accurately reflect the character of the meetings or the tone of the Davis team's engagement with financial services firms. The official declined to go into specifics. The appointment of Simon Kirby as minister responsible for financial services further raised concerns among some bankers. They doubted that Kirby, who founded a radio station and a chain of nightclubs before going into politics, was suitable to be the main government liaison to the industry, these bankers said. In November, many of the most senior executives and chairmen of Britain's finance companies met him for the first time. Kirby failed to answer basic questions about the government's policy towards financial services, according to people who attended. "It was almost like he didn't know what a bank is or what it does," said one of the people present. Kirby declined to comment. A few weeks ago Kirby was quietly removed from his Brexit role. He will continue to work in the finance ministry, with responsibility for areas including regulation. The Treasury said it wanted a new minister to focus on assessing Brexit's impact on financial services. Masters of the universe Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative lawmaker and financier, says the government is relaxed about bankers' threats because the vote was a rejection of an economic system that benefited the banks. "It's condescension from the clever people, the masters of the universe," he said. "They don't like the fact that they've been overruled by the people who voted for Brexit." He said banks historically don't follow through on their threats. At the turn of the century, some financial sector executives warned the failure to join the euro would lead to a withering in London's role as a hub for business. And after the 2007-09 financial crisis many banks also threatened to move operations overseas. On both occasions, Britain's finance sector expanded. Shanker Singham, a trade expert who has held meetings with the Brexit department, told Reuters the government has also been frustrated with the banks because they exaggerated how much they depended on EU "passporting," a set of regulatory agreements that allowed them to sell services across Europe. Yet earlier this year, the industry quietly ditched its insistence on passporting. Instead, it made a plea for time to adapt to a post-Brexit world after the two-year divorce talks end in March 2019 and proposed an alternative idea, known as "enhanced equivalence." This would give firms from a non-EU country access to the bloc if their home rules are similar. "If you ask your chief trade negotiator, May in this case, to ask for something you can't live without, and it turns out you can live without it, that's very bad negotiating tactics," Singham said. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, dismissed accusations the sector, which largely wanted to stay in the EU, was being alarmist. He reminds people of the ending of a well-known parable. "Crying wolf? When people say that I say, how does the story end? At some point, the wolf does eat the boy," he said. No divine right A decade ago, things were far simpler. Bankers were courted by both main political parties who wanted to spend the tax revenues generated by the sector. One government official working under Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2007 remembers the banks were invited into Downing Street every six months to be asked what the government could do to make their lives easier. Then came the financial crisis. As in the United States, many Britons began to accuse the financial services sector of benefiting more from the nation than it contributes. A minister in the government of former prime minister David Cameron said that the cosy relationship between financial services and British governments appears to be temporarily over under May. "There has been a bit of a revolution, an end to the old world order," he said. Junior finance minister Lucy Neville-Rolfe has sought to calm tensions, telling Reuters that banks will be one of the priorities in the EU divorce talks. "People rightly speak up and express their concerns, and the banks have always been quite fast to do that," she said. "But I think we have a very strong relationship. They know that we are huge supporters." But the banks in Britain are planning for the worst. They are working on contingencies to move staff and business lines from London, assuming the negotiations with the EU end without an adequate trade deal that will give them full access to the single market. A potential problem for Britain is that after Thatcher's deregulation, many financial companies were bought up by U.S. or European rivals. These firms lack national loyalty to Britain. Neil Dwane, a global strategist at Allianz Global Investors, said most of the big decision makers in London, outside of insurance, are American or Swiss. "So what concerns me is who is going to fight thinking as a Brit for London rather than thinking it is easier to take it to New York or easier to go back to Zurich," he said. The risk for London is a gradual leaching away of business and a withering of London's role as Europe's financial capital and the influence it brings. "London doesn't have a divine right to continue being a world leading financial centre," said Mark Boleat, chair of policy at the City of London Corporation. "We shouldn't be complacent about it. It all depends on whether we maintain the right environment."

May had delivered her vision two days earlier for pulling Britain out of the European Union’s single market. Now the Wall Street banks, fearing Britain was headed for trouble, wanted to hear more about her strategy. At stake was London’s future as a global financial center. Among those present were Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and James Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley. Blankfein, a former gold trader raised in the Bronx who worked his way up to lead one of the world’s most powerful investment banks, was the most direct during the talks, according to two bankers and a government official with knowledge of the meeting. “Lloyd asked where does the financial services industry stand in her list of priorities,” according to one senior banking executive briefed on the discussion by his boss. “We contribute a double-digit percentage to Britain’s GDP. We’re the biggest taxpayer in the country.” May gave a reply about the importance of financial services but declined to answer the question directly, the sources said. Some of the bankers left questioning her commitment. May and the banks declined to comment on the meeting. Over the past two decades, Goldman, like many of the other 250 foreign-owned banks in Britain, has consolidated its European operations in London to take advantage of the EU’s $16.5 trillion-a-year single market. They are set to lose this wide-open access to a market of 500 million people after May signaled her main priority is to restrict immigration, which can only be achieved by leaving the trading bloc. Senior bankers expected special treatment from the government after Britain voted to leave the EU. They expected ministers to champion their cause, above other industries, to retain unrestricted access to the single market for financial services. It isn’t working out that way. A series of other meetings between bankers and government ministers have also ended badly, Reuters has learned. Bankers say May’s ministers don’t understand the industry and what is at stake, and don’t want to hear negative news about Brexit. “We have entered a period of severe danger,” said a Wall Street executive who runs the European operations of a global investment bank. “Parts of the government are being way too complacent.” May’s office, in a statement responding to the findings of this article, said the government didn’t “recognize this version of events.” The government is engaging intensively with the financial services industry, the statement said. Politicians say the bankers are exaggerating the threat. Some rebalancing of the economy away from financial services – which accounts for about 12 percent of Britain’s economic output – will be good in the long run, they say. “It is all just lobbying. They make a brouhaha,” said Peter Lilley, a pro-Brexit Conservative politician and former financier, who sits on the parliamentary committee examining Britain’s exit from the EU. “They always massively exaggerate.” The rift is in marked contrast to what’s happening in the United States. There the populist backlash that made Donald Trump president has brought at least four former Goldman Sachs executives into senior positions in the new administration. But in Britain, the nationalist drive that produced Brexit delivered a prime minister determined not to be in thrall to bankers. The result is that banks are preparing to move large numbers of staff from London, and Germany and France are trying to lure jobs to their financial capitals. Some bankers believe the big winner from Brexit will be New York because some business currently carried out in London would naturally revert to U.S. headquarters. HSBC, UBS and Morgan Stanley have decided to move about 1,000 staff each from London in the next two years, according to sources familiar with their plans. This week Goldman Sachs said it would begin moving hundreds of people out of London as part of contingency plans for Britain leaving the EU. Not Crying Wolf Since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s “Big Bang” financial deregulation triggered a massive expansion of the industry 31 years ago, bankers have relied on being a powerhouse of Britain’s economy to find a receptive ear in government. But in the aftermath of the vote to leave the EU, the sector is grappling with a new reality. Last year’s vote triggered a change in leadership and tone at the heart of Britain’s government. May pledged an industrial revival and to build an economy that works for everyone, not just the elite. Reuters spoke to more than 40 senior bankers from big British and international banks, politicians, government officials and lobbyists to piece together how the relationship between these pillars of Britain’s establishment became strained. Those people say there are conflicting opinions about what the long-term results of Brexit will be for the world’s fifth largest economy and whether finance should remain the biggest driver of its wealth. The government is making two calculations, these people say. The first is that bank executives are bluffing over moving jobs. The second: The EU is so dependent on London to service its debt that EU negotiators will give UK financial services a special deal to continue to operate unrestricted across the single market. EU officials counter that finance is mobile and business will move to other locations. Britain’s finance industry contributed a record 71.4 billion pounds ($88.7 billion) in corporate and employee taxes to the government last year, according to the City of London Corporation. That is an amount equal to Britain’s annual spending on primary education, the police, and the army. Put another way, finance contributes almost as much in tax as all taxpayers in Scotland and Wales combined. Nevertheless, May’s ministers began telling bankers in the autumn they would not get any special treatment in the Brexit negotiations. The second most powerful executive at one of Britain’s biggest banks said he and his colleagues felt wrong-footed. The executive said that he no longer receives phone calls from British cabinet ministers or invitations to Downing Street receptions as he did under previous governments. “With May there is almost no interest or affection. She is keeping us at arm’s length,” the executive said. “I will probably never meet May.” Brexit minister David Davis, who will decide the industry priorities in the upcoming Brexit talks, rammed home the message that the government’s relationship with the financial sector was changing in his first few meetings with bankers. Davis, a Eurosceptic from a working class background, bristles at being told what to do by bankers, according to colleagues and people who interact with him. Davis declined to comment. In an early phone conversation, he told one executive that the finance industry had damaged its relationship with the government by saying the economy would suffer from reduced immigration. The EU vote had delivered a clear message that immigration must be curbed, he said. Davis publicly attacked banks in October in parliament. He accused them of “an extraordinary outpouring almost of grief, a ‘blame Brexit’ festival,” and of lying that they were going to fire staff because of Brexit. Davis’s aides also warned executives they need to be more positive about the opportunities of Brexit if the government is going to listen to them, two banking sources said. Bank executives complain they feel they can’t speak freely. “Everyone is worried about stoking up the Brexiteers, fueling the flames,” said the chairman of one of Britain’s biggest insurance companies. A government official said the bankers’ portrayal of the relationship doesn’t accurately reflect the character of the meetings or the tone of the Davis team’s engagement with financial services firms. The official declined to go into specifics. The appointment of Simon Kirby as minister responsible for financial services further raised concerns among some bankers. They doubted that Kirby, who founded a radio station and a chain of nightclubs before going into politics, was suitable to be the main government liaison to the industry, these bankers said. In November, many of the most senior executives and chairmen of Britain’s finance companies met him for the first time. Kirby failed to answer basic questions about the government’s policy towards financial services, according to people who attended. “It was almost like he didn’t know what a bank is or what it does,” said one of the people present. Kirby declined to comment. A few weeks ago Kirby was quietly removed from his Brexit role. He will continue to work in the finance ministry, with responsibility for areas including regulation. The Treasury said it wanted a new minister to focus on assessing Brexit’s impact on financial services. Masters of the Universe Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative lawmaker and financier, says the government is relaxed about bankers’ threats because the vote was a rejection of an economic system that benefited the banks. “It’s condescension from the clever people, the masters of the universe,” he said. “They don’t like the fact that they’ve been overruled by the people who voted for Brexit.” He said banks historically don’t follow through on their threats. At the turn of the century, some financial sector executives warned the failure to join the euro would lead to a withering in London’s role as a hub for business. And after the 2007-09 financial crisis many banks also threatened to move operations overseas. On both occasions, Britain’s finance sector expanded.

Standard & Poor’s views JPM as a beneficiary of a number of growth catalysts, but higher interest rates, along with an improving economy and reduced regulations, are the main drivers in the next several years. JPMorgan stock reported 2016 EPS of $6.19 up from $6 in 2015. S&P projects earnings of $6.47 in 2017 and $7.25 in 2018. Even though JPM has agreed to pay $797.5 million to settle the remaining litigation relative to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and this follows a $1.42 billion payment, the firm is so strong as to absorb the losses. And management was cleared by a judge overseeing the case of any improprieties in the clearing and custodianship of Lehman. Thus S&P rates JPM as a “four-star buy” with a 12-month target of $98 based on 15.1X their earnings estimate. Technically, JPM stock is in minor consolidation following an advance from about $68 in November to a high of almost $94 in February. Near-term support rests within a zone of $83.30 to $87.55 with near-term resistance at the 50-day moving average ($88.45) and then the descending triangle’s 20-day moving average now at $90.83. Note the CBR Buy on Wednesday from my internal indicator, which, when coupled with an oversold MACD, provides a strong technical case for buyers.

May had delivered her vision two days earlier for pulling Britain out of the European Union's single market. Now the Wall Street banks, fearing Britain was headed for trouble, wanted to hear more about her strategy. At stake was London's future as a global financial centre. Among those present were Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and James Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley. Blankfein, a former gold trader raised in the Bronx who worked his way up to lead one of the world's most powerful investment banks, was the most direct during the talks, according to two bankers and a government official with knowledge of the meeting. "Lloyd asked where does the financial services industry stand in her list of priorities," according to one senior banking executive briefed on the discussion by his boss. "We contribute a double-digit percentage to Britain's GDP. We're the biggest taxpayer in the country." May gave a reply about the importance of financial services but declined to answer the question directly, the sources said. Some of the bankers left questioning her commitment. May and the banks declined to comment on the meeting. Over the past two decades, Goldman, like many of the other 250 foreign-owned banks in Britain, has consolidated its European operations in London to take advantage of the EU's $16.5 trillion-a-year single market. They are set to lose this wide-open access to a market of 500 million people after May signalled her main priority is to restrict immigration, which can only be achieved by leaving the trading bloc. Senior bankers expected special treatment from the government after Britain voted to leave the EU. They expected ministers to champion their cause, above other industries, to retain unrestricted access to the single market for financial services. It isn't working out that way. A series of other meetings between bankers and government ministers have also ended badly, Reuters has learned. Bankers say May's ministers don't understand the industry and what is at stake, and don't want to hear negative news about Brexit. "We have entered a period of severe danger," said a Wall Street executive who runs the European operations of a global investment bank. "Parts of the government are being way too complacent." May's office, in a statement responding to the findings of this article, said the government didn't "recognise this version of events." The government is engaging intensively with the financial services industry, the statement said. Politicians say the bankers are exaggerating the threat. Some rebalancing of the economy away from financial services - which accounts for about 12 percent of Britain's economic output - will be good in the long run, they say. "It is all just lobbying. They make a brouhaha," said Peter Lilley, a pro-Brexit Conservative politician and former financier, who sits on the parliamentary committee examining Britain's exit from the EU. "They always massively exaggerate." The rift is in marked contrast to what's happening in the United States. There the populist backlash that made Donald Trump president has brought at least four former Goldman Sachs executives into senior positions in the new administration. But in Britain, the nationalist drive that produced Brexit delivered a prime minister determined not to be in thrall to bankers. The result is that banks are preparing to move large numbers of staff from London, and Germany and France are trying to lure jobs to their financial capitals. Some bankers believe the big winner from Brexit will be New York because some business currently carried out in London would naturally revert to U.S. headquarters. HSBC, UBS and Morgan Stanley have decided to move about 1,000 staff each from London in the next two years, according to sources familiar with their plans. This week Goldman Sachs said it would begin moving hundreds of people out of London as part of contingency plans for Britain leaving the EU. NOT CRYING WOLF Since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's "Big Bang" financial deregulation triggered a massive expansion of the industry 31 years ago, bankers have relied on being a powerhouse of Britain's economy to find a receptive ear in government. But in the aftermath of the vote to leave the EU, the sector is grappling with a new reality. Last year's vote triggered a change in leadership and tone at the heart of Britain's government. May pledged an industrial revival and to build an economy that works for everyone, not just the elite. Reuters spoke to more than 40 senior bankers from big British and international banks, politicians, government officials and lobbyists to piece together how the relationship between these pillars of Britain's establishment became strained. Those people say there are conflicting opinions about what the long-term results of Brexit will be for the world's fifth largest economy and whether finance should remain the biggest driver of its wealth. The government is making two calculations, these people say. The first is that bank executives are bluffing over moving jobs. The second: The EU is so dependent on London to service its debt that EU negotiators will give UK financial services a special deal to continue to operate unrestricted across the single market. EU officials counter that finance is mobile and business will move to other locations. Britain's finance industry contributed a record 71.4 billion pounds ($88.7 billion) in corporate and employee taxes to the government last year, according to the City of London Corporation. That is an amount equal to Britain's annual spending on primary education, the police, and the army. Put another way, finance contributes almost as much in tax as all taxpayers in Scotland and Wales combined. Nevertheless, May's ministers began telling bankers in the autumn they would not get any special treatment in the Brexit negotiations. The second most powerful executive at one of Britain's biggest banks said he and his colleagues felt wrong-footed. The executive said that he no longer receives phone calls from British cabinet ministers or invitations to Downing Street receptions as he did under previous governments. "With May there is almost no interest or affection. She is keeping us at arm's length," the executive said. "I will probably never meet May." Brexit minister David Davis, who will decide the industry priorities in the upcoming Brexit talks, rammed home the message that the government's relationship with the financial sector was changing in his first few meetings with bankers. Davis, a Eurosceptic from a working class background, bristles at being told what to do by bankers, according to colleagues and people who interact with him. Davis declined to comment. In an early phone conversation, he told one executive that the finance industry had damaged its relationship with the government by saying the economy would suffer from reduced immigration. The EU vote had delivered a clear message that immigration must be curbed, he said. Davis publicly attacked banks in October in parliament. He accused them of "an extraordinary outpouring almost of grief, a 'blame Brexit' festival," and of lying that they were going to fire staff because of Brexit. Davis's aides also warned executives they need to be more positive about the opportunities of Brexit if the government is going to listen to them, two banking sources said. Bank executives complain they feel they can't speak freely. "Everyone is worried about stoking up the Brexiteers, fuelling the flames," said the chairman of one of Britain's biggest insurance companies. A government official said the bankers' portrayal of the relationship doesn't accurately reflect the character of the meetings or the tone of the Davis team's engagement with financial services firms. The official declined to go into specifics. The appointment of Simon Kirby as minister responsible for financial services further raised concerns among some bankers. They doubted that Kirby, who founded a radio station and a chain of nightclubs before going into politics, was suitable to be the main government liaison to the industry, these bankers said. In November, many of the most senior executives and chairmen of Britain's finance companies met him for the first time. Kirby failed to answer basic questions about the government's policy towards financial services, according to people who attended. "It was almost like he didn't know what a bank is or what it does," said one of the people present. Kirby declined to comment. A few weeks ago Kirby was quietly removed from his Brexit role. He will continue to work in the finance ministry, with responsibility for areas including regulation. The Treasury said it wanted a new minister to focus on assessing Brexit's impact on financial services. MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative lawmaker and financier, says the government is relaxed about bankers' threats because the vote was a rejection of an economic system that benefited the banks. "It's condescension from the clever people, the masters of the universe," he said. "They don't like the fact that they've been overruled by the people who voted for Brexit." He said banks historically don't follow through on their threats. At the turn of the century, some financial sector executives warned the failure to join the euro would lead to a withering in London's role as a hub for business. And after the 2007-09 financial crisis many banks also threatened to move operations overseas. On both occasions, Britain's finance sector expanded. Shanker Singham, a trade expert who has held meetings with the Brexit department, told Reuters the government has also been frustrated with the banks because they exaggerated how much they depended on EU "passporting," a set of regulatory agreements that allowed them to sell services across Europe. Yet earlier this year, the industry quietly ditched its insistence on passporting. Instead, it made a plea for time to adapt to a post-Brexit world after the two-year divorce talks end in March 2019 and proposed an alternative idea, known as "enhanced equivalence." This would give firms from a non-EU country access to the bloc if their home rules are similar. "If you ask your chief trade negotiator, May in this case, to ask for something you can't live without, and it turns out you can live without it, that's very bad negotiating tactics," Singham said. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, dismissed accusations the sector, which largely wanted to stay in the EU, was being alarmist. He reminds people of the ending of a well-known parable. "Crying wolf? When people say that I say, how does the story end? At some point, the wolf does eat the boy," he said. NO DIVINE RIGHT A decade ago, things were far simpler. Bankers were courted by both main political parties who wanted to spend the tax revenues generated by the sector. One government official working under Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2007 remembers the banks were invited into Downing Street every six months to be asked what the government could do to make their lives easier. Then came the financial crisis. As in the United States, many Britons began to accuse the financial services sector of benefiting more from the nation than it contributes. A minister in the government of former prime minister David Cameron said that the cosy relationship between financial services and British governments appears to be temporarily over under May. "There has been a bit of a revolution, an end to the old world order," he said. Junior finance minister Lucy Neville-Rolfe has sought to calm tensions, telling Reuters that banks will be one of the priorities in the EU divorce talks. "People rightly speak up and express their concerns, and the banks have always been quite fast to do that," she said. "But I think we have a very strong relationship. They know that we are huge supporters." But the banks in Britain are planning for the worst. They are working on contingencies to move staff and business lines from London, assuming the negotiations with the EU end without an adequate trade deal that will give them full access to the single market. A potential problem for Britain is that after Thatcher's deregulation, many financial companies were bought up by U.S. or European rivals. These firms lack national loyalty to Britain. Neil Dwane, a global strategist at Allianz Global Investors, said most of the big decision makers in London, outside of insurance, are American or Swiss. "So what concerns me is who is going to fight thinking as a Brit for London rather than thinking it is easier to take it to New York or easier to go back to Zurich," he said. The risk for London is a gradual leaching away of business and a withering of London's role as Europe's financial capital and the influence it brings. "London doesn't have a divine right to continue being a world leading financial centre," said Mark Boleat, chair of policy at the City of London Corporation. "We shouldn't be complacent about it. It all depends on whether we maintain the right environment."

REUTERS/Toby Melville Banks on notice How banks lost the ear of Britain’s government over Brexit By Andrew MacAskill, Anjuli Davies and Huw Jones Filed March 24, 2017, 10:45 a.m. GMT Banks used to have a cosy relationship with Britain’s government. Now they say they are struggling to be heard as the country prepares to leave the EU. LONDON - One afternoon in mid-January, Prime Minister Theresa May walked into a meeting room in the Swiss resort of Davos to face Wall Street’s most powerful bankers. May had delivered her vision two days earlier for pulling Britain out of the European Union’s single market. Now the Wall Street banks, fearing Britain was headed for trouble, wanted to hear more about her strategy. At stake was London’s future as a global financial centre. Among those present were Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and James Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley. Blankfein, a former gold trader raised in the Bronx who worked his way up to lead one of the world’s most powerful investment banks, was the most direct during the talks, according to two bankers and a government official with knowledge of the meeting. “Lloyd asked where does the financial services industry stand in her list of priorities,” according to one senior banking executive briefed on the discussion by his boss. “We contribute a double-digit percentage to Britain’s GDP. We’re the biggest taxpayer in the country.” Related content Interactive: Banking’s rise as a share of UK economy Europe’s financial lifeline in doubt Banks put ‘hard’ Brexit plans into action May gave a reply about the importance of financial services but declined to answer the question directly, the sources said. Some of the bankers left questioning her commitment. May and the banks declined to comment on the meeting. Over the past two decades, Goldman, like many of the other 250 foreign-owned banks in Britain, has consolidated its European operations in London to take advantage of the EU’s $16.5 trillion-a-year single market. They are set to lose this wide-open access to a market of 500 million people after May signalled her main priority is to restrict immigration, which can only be achieved by leaving the trading bloc.   Senior bankers expected special treatment from the government after Britain voted to leave the EU. They expected ministers to champion their cause, above other industries, to retain unrestricted access to the single market for financial services. It isn’t working out that way. A series of other meetings between bankers and government ministers have also ended badly, Reuters has learned. Bankers say May’s ministers don’t understand the industry and what is at stake, and don’t want to hear negative news about Brexit. “We have entered a period of severe danger,” said a Wall Street executive who runs the European operations of a global investment bank. “Parts of the government are being way too complacent.” QUESTIONS: Goldman Sachs Group Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and other senior bankers met British Prime Minister Theresa May in Davos in January. They wanted to hear more about her Brexit strategy, but got few details. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton “Crying wolf? When people say that, I say: how does the story end? At some point, the wolf does eat the boy.” Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers’ Association May’s office, in a statement responding to the findings of this article, said the government didn’t “recognise this version of events.” The government is engaging intensively with the financial services industry, the statement said. Politicians say the bankers are exaggerating the threat. Some rebalancing of the economy away from financial services – which accounts for about 12 percent of Britain’s economic output - will be good in the long run, they say. “It is all just lobbying. They make a brouhaha,” said Peter Lilley, a pro-Brexit Conservative politician and former financier, who sits on the parliamentary committee examining Britain’s exit from the EU. “They always massively exaggerate.” The rift is in marked contrast to what’s happening in the United States. There the populist backlash that made Donald Trump president has brought at least four former Goldman Sachs executives into senior positions in the new administration. But in Britain, the nationalist drive that produced Brexit delivered a prime minister determined not to be in thrall to bankers. The result is that banks are preparing to move large numbers of staff from London, and Germany and France are trying to lure jobs to their financial capitals. Some bankers believe the big winner from Brexit will be New York because some business currently carried out in London would naturally revert to U.S. headquarters. HSBC, UBS and Morgan Stanley have decided to move about 1,000 staff each from London in the next two years, according to sources familiar with their plans. This week Goldman Sachs said it would begin moving hundreds of people out of London as part of contingency plans for Britain leaving the EU. NOT CRYING WOLF Since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s “Big Bang” financial deregulation triggered a massive expansion of the industry 31 years ago, bankers have relied on being a powerhouse of Britain’s economy to find a receptive ear in government. But in the aftermath of the vote to leave the EU, the sector is grappling with a new reality. Last year’s vote triggered a change in leadership and tone at the heart of Britain’s government. May pledged an industrial revival and to build an economy that works for everyone, not just the elite. Reuters spoke to more than 40 senior bankers from big British and international banks, politicians, government officials and lobbyists to piece together how the relationship between these pillars of Britain’s establishment became strained. Those people say there are conflicting opinions about what the long-term results of Brexit will be for the world’s fifth largest economy and whether finance should remain the biggest driver of its wealth. The government is making two calculations, these people say. The first is that bank executives are bluffing over moving jobs. The second: The EU is so dependent on London to service its debt that EU negotiators will give UK financial services a special deal to continue to operate unrestricted across the single market. EU officials counter that finance is mobile and business will move to other locations. EXIT: Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves a EU Summit in Brussels, December 15, 2016. REUTERS/Yves Herman Britain’s finance industry contributed a record 71.4 billion pounds ($88.7 billion) in corporate and employee taxes to the government last year, according to the City of London Corporation. That is an amount equal to Britain’s annual spending on primary education, the police, and the army. Put another way, finance contributes almost as much in tax as all taxpayers in Scotland and Wales combined. Nevertheless, May’s ministers began telling bankers in the autumn they would not get any special treatment in the Brexit negotiations. The second most powerful executive at one of Britain’s biggest banks said he and his colleagues felt wrong-footed. The executive said that he no longer receives phone calls from British cabinet ministers or invitations to Downing Street receptions as he did under previous governments. “With May there is almost no interest or affection. She is keeping us at arm’s length,” the executive said. “I will probably never meet May.” Brexit minister David Davis, who will decide the industry priorities in the upcoming Brexit talks, rammed home the message that the government’s relationship with the financial sector was changing in his first few meetings with bankers. Davis, a Eurosceptic from a working class background, bristles at being told what to do by bankers, according to colleagues and people who interact with him. Davis declined to comment. In an early phone conversation, he told one executive that the finance industry had damaged its relationship with the government by saying the economy would suffer from reduced immigration. The EU vote had delivered a clear message that immigration must be curbed, he said. Davis publicly attacked banks in October in parliament. He accused them of “an extraordinary outpouring almost of grief, a ‘blame Brexit’ festival,” and of lying that they were going to fire staff because of Brexit. Davis’s aides also warned executives they need to be more positive about the opportunities of Brexit if the government is going to listen to them, two banking sources said. Bank executives complain they feel they can’t speak freely. “Everyone is worried about stoking up the Brexiteers, fuelling the flames,” said the chairman of one of Britain’s biggest insurance companies. A government official said the bankers’ portrayal of the relationship doesn’t accurately reflect the character of the meetings or the tone of the Davis team’s engagement with financial services firms. The official declined to go into specifics. CRITICISM: David Davis, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, pictured here in October 2016, has accused banks of “an extraordinary outpouring almost of grief” over Brexit. REUTERS/Dylan Martinez “London doesn’t have a divine right to continue being a world leading financial centre. We shouldn’t be complacent about it. It all depends on whether we maintain the right environment.” Mark Boleat, chair of policy at the City of London Corporation The appointment of Simon Kirby as minister responsible for financial services further raised concerns among some bankers. They doubted that Kirby, who founded a radio station and a chain of nightclubs before going into politics, was suitable to be the main government liaison to the industry, these bankers said. In November, many of the most senior executives and chairmen of Britain’s finance companies met him for the first time. Kirby failed to answer basic questions about the government’s policy towards financial services, according to people who attended. “It was almost like he didn’t know what a bank is or what it does,” said one of the people present. Kirby declined to comment. A few weeks ago Kirby was quietly removed from his Brexit role. He will continue to work in the finance ministry, with responsibility for areas including regulation. The Treasury said it wanted a new minister to focus on assessing Brexit’s impact on financial services. MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative lawmaker and financier, says the government is relaxed about bankers’ threats because the vote was a rejection of an economic system that benefited the banks. “It’s condescension from the clever people, the masters of the universe,” he said. “They don’t like the fact that they’ve been overruled by the people who voted for Brexit.” He said banks historically don’t follow through on their threats. At the turn of the century, some financial sector executives warned the failure to join the euro would lead to a withering in London’s role as a hub for business. And after the 2007-09 financial crisis many banks also threatened to move operations overseas. On both occasions, Britain’s finance sector expanded. Shanker Singham, a trade expert who has held meetings with the Brexit department, told Reuters the government has also been frustrated with the banks because they exaggerated how much they depended on EU “passporting,” a set of regulatory agreements that allowed them to sell services across Europe. Yet earlier this year, the industry quietly ditched its insistence on passporting. Instead, it made a plea for time to adapt to a post-Brexit world after the two-year divorce talks end in March 2019 and proposed an alternative idea, known as “enhanced equivalence.” This would give firms from a non-EU country access to the bloc if their home rules are similar. “If you ask your chief trade negotiator, May in this case, to ask for something you can’t live without, and it turns out you can live without it, that’s very bad negotiating tactics,” Singham said. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers’ Association, dismissed accusations the sector, which largely wanted to stay in the EU, was being alarmist. He reminds people of the ending of a well-known parable. “Crying wolf? When people say that I say, how does the story end? At some point, the wolf does eat the boy,” he said. NO DIVINE RIGHT A decade ago, things were far simpler. Bankers were courted by both main political parties who wanted to spend the tax revenues generated by the sector. One government official working under Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2007 remembers the banks were invited into Downing Street every six months to be asked what the government could do to make their lives easier. Then came the financial crisis. As in the United States, many Britons began to accuse the financial services sector of benefiting more from the nation than it contributes. A minister in the government of former prime minister David Cameron said that the cosy relationship between financial services and British governments appears to be temporarily over under May. “There has been a bit of a revolution, an end to the old world order,” he said. Junior finance minister Lucy Neville-Rolfe has sought to calm tensions, telling Reuters that banks will be one of the priorities in the EU divorce talks.   “People rightly speak up and express their concerns, and the banks have always been quite fast to do that,” she said. “But I think we have a very strong relationship. They know that we are huge supporters.” But the banks in Britain are planning for the worst. They are working on contingencies to move staff and business lines from London, assuming the negotiations with the EU end without an adequate trade deal that will give them full access to the single market. A potential problem for Britain is that after Thatcher’s deregulation, many financial companies were bought up by U.S. or European rivals. These firms lack national loyalty to Britain. Neil Dwane, a global strategist at Allianz Global Investors, said most of the big decision makers in London, outside of insurance, are American or Swiss. “So what concerns me is who is going to fight thinking as a Brit for London rather than thinking it is easier to take it to New York or easier to go back to Zurich,” he said. The risk for London is a gradual leaching away of business and a withering of London’s role as Europe’s financial capital and the influence it brings. “London doesn’t have a divine right to continue being a world leading financial centre,” said Mark Boleat, chair of policy at the City of London Corporation. “We shouldn’t be complacent about it. It all depends on whether we maintain the right environment.” Additional reporting by William James, Elizabeth Piper, Carolyn Cohn and Simon Jessop GLOOM: Workers walk in the rain at the Canary Wharf business district in London, Britain November 11, 2013. REUTERS/Eddie Keogh Europe’s financial lifeline from London in doubt By John O’Donnell FRANKFURT - For companies in the European Union, London is the chief gateway to finance. Rerouting the financial lines that run through London will be complex, experts say. London dominates wholesale banking in Europe, a 5.8 trillion euro ($6.2 trillion) industry that includes financing for companies from big multinationals to family-owned firms that are the backbone of Germany’s economy. London is also the first port of call for companies, such as Italian lender UniCredit, selling shares or raising debt. This is because many fund managers and asset managers have a base in Britain. The Bank of England estimates that half of the debt and equity issued by EU borrowers involves financial groups in Britain. This could be a London bank organising a sale of European company bonds, for example. And London houses the bulk of Europe’s derivatives market, where car makers buy protection against swings in the U.S. dollar or airlines guard themselves against a spike in the price of oil. More than 7 trillion euros of trading in such instruments is processed in London daily. Experts expect EU firms and banks gradually to reduce their reliance on London. Governments in France and Germany want to establish alternatives to London in Paris and Frankfurt. RIVALRY: Skyline of La Defense business district in Paris that is competing for the banks’ business.. January 13, 2016. REUTERS/Charles Platiau Over time, some of London’s wholesale funding will move to other centres in Europe. Thinktank Bruegel predicts that London’s share of this market will eventually shrink from 90 percent to 60 percent. If mismanaged, however, the migration could raise the cost of funding for European companies, the thinktank said. Bruegel’s Dirk Schoenmaker said that if wholesale funding operations are spread across several locations that could lift costs by between 6 billion and 12 billion euros each year because of the expense of using multiple financial centres. That is equivalent to up to 0.1 percent of the remaining 27 EU countries’ economic output. Shifting the multi-trillion euro derivatives business would be difficult, regulators and bankers said. Some derivatives have a term of many decades. It is unclear, bankers said, what will happen when Britain, where the contracts were drafted, leaves the European Union. They said that the cost of holding such instruments could rise sharply for European banks if a clearing house in London that processes the deal, for example, is not recognised in the European Union. A transition period, after initial exit talks of two years, could win extra time. But many bank executives, speaking privately, have said they are working on the assumption that there will be no transition. EU officials familiar with the bloc’s preparations for negotiations have told Reuters that they too fear a “cliff-edge” departure of Britain from the bloc. They are pinning their hopes on banks moving to the continent in time and believe this will minimize any fallout for their economies. ————— Brexit Britain By Andrew MacAskill, Anjuli Davies and Huw Jones Photo editing: Simon Newman Graphics: Michael Ovaska, Cieran Hughes Design: Catherine Tai Edited by Janet McBride and Richard Woods Follow Reuters Investigates Other Reuters investigations and long-form narratives Thomsonreuters.com Privacy Policy Terms of Use Copyright

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 March 2017 by Military News U.S. Banks Stock Outlook – March 2017 Shutterstock photo President Trump’s policy goals and the Fed’s stance on the interest rate front have prompted a huge rally for U.S. bank stocks since the Nov 8 election. The expectation of softer financial regulations, a big tax reduction, significant infrastructure investment and quicker rate hikes have motivated investors to pour money into bank stocks during this period. Led by mega players like Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), the Zacks categorized Banks-Major Regional industry rallied 26.8% since Trump’s victory versus 10.5% gain of the S&P 500. Also, the Financial Select Sector SPDR fund (XLF), a top bank ETF, gained 17.9% over this period. This solid performance was supported by the industry’s fundamental progress too. Healthy increases in fourth-quarter profits by mega banks boosted investors’ confidence. Particularly, a rising rate environment, which makes loans lucrative for banks, assured investors of banks’ profitability growth in the upcoming quarters. The Fed’s recent rate hike for the third time since the financial crisis and its commitment to raise rates faster (two more times) this year based on a convincing pace of economic growth should help banks get rid of shrinking margins – which has been the key challenge since the crisis. How Long Might the Rally Last? A lot depends on to what extent Trump lives up to his promises. Bank stocks may be hit hard if he doesn’t deliver on certain policy goals. There is absolutely no reason to be pessimistic about the prospect of bank stocks so far since the President has already signed two directives – review of the Dodd-Frank Act and delay in implementing the fiduciary rule. While Dodd-Frank rules have improved safety in the financial industry, it has reduced banks’ flexibility to do business and significantly increased their compliance costs. On the other hand, the fiduciary rule requires advisors to act in the best interest of their clients, not for their companies. Though both the rules have upside from a defensive perspective, they are in no way business friendly for banks. Further, banks’ excess reserve at the Fed could bring them solid revenues, as they may not be restricted from engaging in traditional lending activities under Trump’s policies. The Fed’s actions on expediting rate hike – which is again a function of economic growth based on Trump’s policy alterations – will also play a major role in keeping the optimism on bank stocks alive. Have Major Bank Stocks Gone Out of Reach? While the Banks-Major Regional industry significantly outperformed the broader market over the last six months, there is still a value-oriented path ahead. Looking at the industry’s price-to-book ratio, which is the best multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next, investors might still want to pay more. The industry currently has a trailing 12 month P/B ratio of 1.54 – close to the highest level of 1.61 seen in the last six months. When compared with its own average of 1.47 over that period, any further upside looks unlikely. However, the space actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/B for the S&P 500 is at 3.57 and the median level is 3.38. Overall, while the valuation from a P/B perspective looks stretched when compared with the industry’s own range in the time period, its lower-than-market positioning calls for some more upside in the quarters ahead. The group’s Zacks Industry Rank confirms this view. This 16-company industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #80, which places it at the top 31% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries. Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Zacks Industry Rank for Other Banking Groups Other than the Banks-Major Regional industry, U.S. banks are grouped into five industries at the expanded (aka „X”) level – Banks-Midwest, Banks-West, Banks-Northeast, Banks-Southeast and Banks-Southwest. The level of sensitivity and exposure to different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry. In terms of Zacks Industry Rank, four of these five groups are better positioned than Banks-Major Regional. Of these industries, Banks-Northeast is placed at top 11%, Banks-Midwest at top 12%, Banks-West at top 12%, Banks-Southeast at top 18% and Banks-Southwest at top 43%.           Key Business Trends Lending: Despite easing lending standards a number of times last year, overall loan growth has slowed in the last few months. According the Federal Reserve’s latest data , since Nov 2016, commercial banks have seen the weakest loan growth in five years. While growth in consumer loans remained strong, commercial and industrial credit growth shrank significantly. Perhaps uncertainty over Trump’s policy goals and cheaper ways to borrow are among the factors responsible for this weakness. Investors’ ‚wait and see’ attitude could keep the lending scenario bleak in the coming months. However, wage growth and higher disposable income as a result of improving economy should eventually increase retail and small business lending opportunities. Deposits: Relatively less-levered consumers and businesses along with economic growth and improvement in labor and housing markets have spurred growth in deposits. However, the liquidity coverage ratio requirements that force banks to pay premium on stable funding will increase costs for the deposits. Expenses: U.S. banks are continuously attempting to reduce needless expenses by reorganizing business. Actually, this is how they have been able to deliver decent bottom-line numbers in the past few quarters. Hopefully, the experience will make them smarter in the quarters ahead. Also, the results for the last few quarters show some respite from high legal costs, with the sharp sting of fines and penalties being cured by settlements. While scrutiny on the business model of banks and their targeted M&A deals may prevail and technology cost will keep on increasing, expected softer regulations in the Trump era will reduce compliance costs. How Key Business Segments Should Perform Mortgage Business: An expected higher rate environment and less-concerned lenders over regulatory restrictions will drive demand for refinancing in the quarters to come. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s builder application survey, mortgage applications for new home purchases increased in February on a year-over-year basis. Further, with the strong appetite of lenders and borrowers, commercial and multifamily mortgage loan originations are expected to improve this year. Trading Activity: Trading activity was strong in the fourth quarter. Particularly, fixed-income trading activity soared after the presidential election. In fact, after a prolonged weakness, fixed income, currency and commodity (FCC) trading rebounded in 2016. Uncertainty related to Trump’s policy changes should lead to better trading in the quarters ahead. This will particularly benefit trading-intensive banks like Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley (MS). Investment Banking: Though JPMorgan earned the majority of fees in global investment banking in 2016, overall investment banking business in the U.S. remained weak. However, the rising rate environment could trigger M&A deals, as companies will try to cut deals before the cost of borrowing shoots up. Further, more startups may try to go public. And an increase in M&A and IPOs means more advisory fees for big banks. Early Prediction of Q1 Earnings The S&P 500 stocks in the broader Finance sector, which include all banks, registered a 16.6% year-over-year earnings improvement in fourth-quarter 2016. Banks contributed significantly to the growth with the medium (aka „M”) level industries, Banks & Thrifts and Banks-Major, witnessing earnings growth of 23.7% and 12.5%, respectively. Though it’s too early to predict the results for the current quarter, our Earnings Trends report paints a disappointing picture for banks. While earnings growth for Banks & Thrifts are expected to decline to 14.9% in first-quarter 2017, Banks-Major’s earnings growth will likely subside to just 1%. Bottom Line Against an improving domestic economic backdrop, U.S. banks are taking desperate strategic actions to power their financials. But mushrooming concerns and increasing competition will continue to thwart profitability. However, a favorable rate environment might lend a major support. On the other hand, the Trump presidency may bring better days for banks faster with pro-growth policies and softer regulations.   5 Trades Could Profit „Big-League” from Trump Policies If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington’s changing course.

The public version needs significant upgrades to be able to handle anything like the volume of interactions on the internet today. Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 By Matthew Leising In late February about 200 executives, coders, and developers gathered in the downtown Brooklyn office of JPMorgan Chase & Co. to hear an all-day pitch for a new industry group called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. It's the ghostly sounding name for a so-called blockchain technology similar to the one that made the digital currency bitcoin possible. Its inventor, Vitalik Buterin, released his software to the world in 2015, not long after dropping out of the University of Waterloo, in Canada. Less than two years later, JPMorgan, BP, Microsoft, International Business Machines, and ING are among the companies in the group experimenting with it. Buterin didn't attend the EEA meeting, but he had a video message to deliver. Except the EEA couldn't get the video to play, because the computer hosting it crashed. As the crowd began to stir, a frozen frame of Buterin’s face came on-screen, then he disappeared. After the tech crew scrambled for 30 minutes, they finally got it to work. It's an apt metaphor for a technology that’s come with enormous promises but suffered setbacks almost from its inception. Last year, hackers stole $60 million worth of ether, the digital currency linked to Ethereum. The heist was a huge black eye—chances are, if you've heard about Ethereum, it’s because of the hack. And yet it isn't dead. The reason: Unlike bitcoin, this blockchain isn't really about currency. Its advocates think it could be a universally accessible machine for running businesses. "Ethereum gives you a new way for the computer to interact with the real world and how money moves," says Emin Gun Sirer, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University. “It’s potentially a huge game changer whose value has yet to be tapped." To understand what the excitement is about, it helps to start with bitcoin, because without it, there would be no blockchain. Previous attempts to create digital money that could be sent as easily as email ran into a problem: How do you guarantee that each virtual dollar is unique, so the sender can't spend the same cash more than once? For bitcoin, this is solved with blockchain, which is simply an online ledger book that's distributed on computers around the world. It tracks and verifies every use of bitcoin. To give people an incentive to maintain the blockchain on their machine, it awards a number of new bitcoins to the first computer to verify a transaction. It's like a banking system that runs itself—but its main use is just letting people move currency from point A to point B. Ethereum's ledger does more. It can store fully functioning computer programs called smart contracts: If person A performs job B for company C, it will trigger a payment of D back to A?...?and so on. As with bitcoin, the ether currency is a lure to get people to lend the system their computing power, and you need it to participate in a contract. Think of Ethereum itself as a way for people to make agreements and automate enforcement, all on a distributed network of computers. Once you can create contracts—which in essence are just operating procedures—you can use them to manage almost any kind of enterprise or organization. For example, John Hancock Financial is experimenting with a tailored version of Ethereum to keep track of compliance with know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering regulations in its wealth management unit. Airline industry giant Airbus SE wants to know if its supply chain management can be shifted to a blockchain. Like David Hasselhoff, Ethereum is popular in Germany: Power producer RWE AG and online bank Fidor Bank are investigating ways to integrate it into their businesses. The 2016 ether theft showed that though Ethereum may be powerful, it's still new and prone to mishaps. One of the first things people used ether for was to invest in a kind of decentralized venture capital fund built with an Ethereum smart contract. Investors could vote on how the fund's ether would be used; hackers found a bug in the contract that forced the fund to funnel its ether to them. After much consternation, there was a vote in the Ethereum community, supported by Buterin, to edit the blockchain’s transaction history so it appeared as if the hack had never occurred. Blockchain purists were so enraged at the idea of fiddling with the ledger, they began supporting an alternative form of Ethereum, which they took to calling Ethereum classic. Buterin is unapologetic. "In general, the Ethereum community is on board with the notion that we do not have to do things exactly the way that things are done in other crypto communities," he says. "I did not create Ethereum to let hackers get away with $60 million." This is the stuff of passionate debates on Reddit forums, but it may not matter to corporate users, because many of them don't want to work on the fully public Ethereum blockchain anyway. JPMorgan just released a version of Ethereum known as Quorum. Developers around the world can work with it, but only companies invited to participate will be able to record transactions and contracts on it. The Airbus blockchain would be similarly walled off. These blockchains would run alongside the main version of Ethereum, which anyone can use. "We've built an unstoppable, uncensorable world computer," says Joe Lubin, founder of ConsenSys, a Brooklyn company that develops blockchain applications, speaking of Ethereum. Andrew Keys, head of global business development for the company, still sees the technology as a grass-roots tool for cutting out intermediaries of all kinds—from law firms to online social networks. "Our digital identity is on Facebook, and Mark's getting paid," he says, referring to Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. "Instead of them housing that, we'll have self-sovereign identity with peer-to-peer transactions." In other words, instead of using Facebook to control who can and can’t see their family photos, people could one day set the rules themselves using smart contracts. Ethereum is still a long way from that kind of success in either its public or private forms. The public version needs significant upgrades to be able to handle anything like the volume of interactions on the internet today. Ethereum's leaders, in their response to the hack, offended a substantial part of the blockchain development and programming community, which isn't that big. On the business side, corporations have to be convinced that they won't be giving away trade secrets through their use of a ledger shared with other companies. At the same time, they'll need to keep the technology open enough so that anyone can put their ideas into the same Ethereum ecosystem. "I don't want to build AOL," says Amber Baldet, blockchain program lead for JPMorgan. "I want to build the World Wide Web." The bottom line: Ethereum could present a whole new way to run a business, but there are some serious kinks to work out. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Walking away with no regime for 230 billion pounds ($287 billion) of annual exports to the bloc and the 3.3 million Europeans in the U.K would be “perfectly OK,” says Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Not “frightening” at all, says Brexit czar David Davis. But analysts are painting an entirely different picture of an outcome they view as increasingly plausible: U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May balking at the EU’s demands or giving up on getting the sweeping trade accord she wants. And a collapse in the two-year talks, which May is set to trigger next week, would unleash costs and regulations that stand to damage Britain far more than the EU. “A deal will take a lot more time, goodwill and tact than has been on display from either side,” said Anand Menon, director of The U.K. in a Changing Europe research group, who sees a 50 percent chance of there being no deal on March 29, 2019. “I find it very hard to see how May gets all she wants.” An official in May’s government puts the chance of the talk collapsing at about 30 percent. EU negotiator Michel Barnier this week said the bloc should ready to deal with the “serious consequences” of a breakdown, such as longer queues at borders to how to handle transportation of nuclear materials. Uncharted Territory If May does walk away, then the U.K. would truly be in uncharted territory. Based on interviews and published analysis, here’s a rough map of what might happen should Britain spin out of the EU without a safety net. Even before May delivers an emergency statement to the House of Commons to explain the failure, financial markets would have already priced in the ramifications. Jordan Rochester, a London-based strategist at Nomura International Plc, predicts the pound would slump towards $1.15, extending its post-referendum slump to almost a quarter. The day in 2013 when David Cameron announced his intention to call a referendum sterling was at $1.58. Companies, meantime, would activate plans for the tumble over what they’ve long described as a “cliff edge” of uncertainty. Absent a deal, the U.K. would surrender tariff-free or friction-less trade with the EU’s 440 million consumers and any hope of a transitional phase to adjust. For manufacturers, World Trade Organization tariffs averaging about 5 percent -- and twice that for cars produced by the likes of Ford Motor Co. -- would be immediately imposed on trade with the EU, the market for 44 percent of Britain’s overseas sales. Farmers could face duties of around 40 percent and most industries would suffer higher import costs if Britain imposed its own tariffs on trade from the EU. That would reduce trade by about 30 percent, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Oxford Economics Ltd. estimates gross domestic product would be 3.9 percent smaller by 2030 or 96 billion pounds in inflation-adjusted terms. At ports, border checks would impede commerce further; the likes of BAE Systems Plc to J Sainsbury Plc might struggle to get timely delivery from the continent to keep assembly lines humming and supermarket shelves stacked. Then there’s the City of London -- a global hub of finance and the gateway for capital to and from Europe. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other banks that had hoped to keep servicing the bloc from London would likely accelerate the shift of jobs and operations into the EU or to New York. The consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimated that in a worst-case scenario, 70,000 financial-services jobs would be lost. ‘Day One’ “On day one, JPMorgan has to be able to conduct business with our clients in Europe,” Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg this month. The French or Germans would, without delay, repatriate control of the clearing of euro derivatives and credit-rating companies with bases in London would lose their authority to police continental companies. Xavier Rolet, CEO of London Stock Exchange Group Plc, has said 232,000 jobs could eventually be lost from the U.K. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up No deal would also further punish industries likely to be hamstrung by Brexit. Airlines such as EasyJet Plc might see their access to the continent cut off unless they relocate headquarters or sell more shares to investors in the region to satisfy regulators. The hospitality and agriculture sectors already face a struggle to get the workers they need as do pharmaceutical firms like AstraZeneca Plc, which would also have to deal with the loss of the European Medicines Agency from London. The hardest of Brexits would also risk the imposition of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic and embolden Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s push for a second independence referendum. This week’s terrorist attack on London also underscored the importance of continental security relationships, which could be jeopardized. For May, the threat to walk away is a basic negotiating tactic if the U.K. is to avoid being punished by the EU. “No deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain,” she said in January, adding it would be an “act of calamitous self harm” for Europe to try to retaliate against the nation for its desire to leave. British Bet May’s bullishness reflects the bet that Britain’s Blitz spirit would carry it through. She herself has held out the prospect of slashing corporate taxes to lure businesses and investment. Released of the EU’s constraints, the U.K would also count on free-trade deals from China to the U.S. If the talks do blow up, the most likely detonator is the demand that Britain must pay to leave. The EU’s need to prevent other breakaway efforts requires a cost be imposed on Britain -- a settling of accounts, in the view from Brussels. “We have to calculate scientifically what the British commitments were and then the bill has to be paid,” European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told the BBC Friday. Asked if the bill will be 50 billion pounds, Juncker replied: “It’s around that.” U.K. Trade Secretary Liam Fox has described such a fee as “absurd.” Some in government have questioned its legality; the EU could force the issue before the International Court of Justice. Brexit campaigners back home would also balk at paying too much. Money Talk While May wants to discuss divorce and a new trade deal at the same time, EU officials say they won’t even engage on commerce until the matter of the money is settled. "The EU recognizes it has huge leverage and is ready to use it,” said Gregor Irwin, chief economist at Global Counsel, a consulting firm. "There is a risk of the negotiations unraveling because you’re never quite sure how much it all means to the other side. If you push too far and it turns out they weren’t bluffing you end up with no deal." Even if a bill is paid, things don’t get any easier. While willing to give up membership of the single market for goods and services to regain control of immigration and lawmaking, May wants to win as much trade free of tariffs and bureaucracy as she can. That smacks of “cherry picking” to some in the region and if the EU balks, May could again walk. She will also know the risk of a poor trade deal would leave her prone to attack from the anti-Brexit lobby at home. Talks might ultimately need to break down for progress to be made, according to Oliver Harvey, a strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. In that event, May would call an election aimed at winning a mandate to strike a deal some in her own ruling Conservative Party won’t like. “The U.K. will eventually compromise,” said Harvey. “But this will depend on a weakening economy and market pressure, with a full cliff-edge Brexit likely to be fully priced in at some point in the next two years.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc said on Wednesday they would suspend digital ads on YouTube, joining a list of well-known British brands such as retailer Marks and Spencer Group Plc that are deserting Alphabet Inc’s Google. Google has come under intense scrutiny for ads appearing alongside videos on YouTube carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages. The company vowed an overhaul of its practices and said on Wednesday it has started an extensive review of its advertising policies. Shares of Google parent Alphabet ended down 1.2 per cent, or US$10.15 (RM 44.95) per share, at US$839.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. Control over online ad placement has become a hot-button issue for advertisers, with social networks and news aggregators coming under fire during and after the US presidential election for spreading fake news reports. Advertisers have also sought to avoid having their brands appear beside content that they categorize as hate speech. J&J said yesterday it wanted to ensure that its product advertising did not appear on channels that promote “offensive content.” JPMorgan, the biggest US bank by assets and the biggest issuer of general purpose credit cards, suspended all of its ads from YouTube yesterday, according to spokeswoman Trish Wexler. The bank spends about US$3 billion on marketing each year. YouTube has been a key driver of growth for Google as its traditional business of search advertising matures. Google’s net ad revenue worldwide from YouTube was US$5.58 billion last year, according to New York-based research firm eMarketer. While major brands suspending advertising on YouTube is a public relations pain for Google, the suspensions do not affect Google’s biggest ad product, search. According to eMarketer, Google’s 2017 global ad revenue is projected to be US$73.75 billion, grabbing 62 per cent of the US$99.62-billion search market. Search accounts for 83 per cent of Google’s overall ad revenue. The financial hit is also less certain because digital platforms tend to collect the bulk of their revenue from small-to-medium sized companies who cannot afford to buy on TV. “Digital dependence on the long-tail of advertising clients means that while major advertisers like P&G or agencies like Havas can publicly protest, they do not have the same impact on a Google or a Facebook as they have on a CBS or NBC,” analysts at MoffettNathanson wrote yesterday. “In other words, if a major brand marketer or agency moves money to TV and out of digital, the TV industry will see the benefit whereas the digital industry might not truly feel it.” — Reuters                 MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week China slinging salmon on the Internet lures Norway seafood fund Oil producers call to roll over output cuts beyond June American Air in negotiations to purchase stake in China Southern Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Jack Ma: DFTZ will be a Malaysian-run business China capital controls leave buyers of foreign property in bind (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles AT&T, Verizon join Google ad boycott Google apologises to ad clients for YouTube content fiasco Johnson & Johnson wins trial in talc product liability lawsuits Source: Saudi Aramco taps JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley for IPO, HSBC a contender Facebook tunes trending topics to better deliver news Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Primary sources. Global perspective. advertisement UK Supreme Court rejects JPMorgan executive's wrongful identification claim Thursday 23 March 2017 at 1:34 PM ET by Rachel Gerber ©  WikiMedia (Diliff) [JURIST] The UK Supreme Court [official website] ruled [judgment, PDF] on Wednesday that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) [official website] did not misidentify former JPMorgan official Achilles Macris in its penalty notice in connection with the "London Whale" Scandal. The FCA agreed that a conclusion that Macris was prejudiced would be justified if Macris was in fact identified in the warning and the penalty notices were served on JPMorgan. However, the FCA rejected the claim that Macris was identified. Lord Sumption, writing for the majority, while acknowledging that the meaning of the word "identifies" is not elaborated, stated: "it is clear from the language that it is the reasons contained in the notice which must identify the third party and not some extrinsic source." Sumption added: Once the facts relating to one person or firm under investigation are ascertained or admitted and are found to justify criticism or sanctions, there will often be no proper reasons for withholding that information from the market. Yet there will almost always be people in the know, who will realise when they read the notices which individuals are encompassed by apparently anodyne collective expressions such as "management" or who is likely to have been responsible for particular failings of the firm. ... Even for those who are further from the scene, the internet is a fertile source of information and gossip for those who are willing to go to some trouble to discover his identity.Macris expressed his disappointment [Reuters report] with the decision and stated that the FCA won the case on a mere technicality. Legal commentators pointed out that the decision "will do little to check the perceived tendency on the part of the regulator and firms to reach swift settlements ... at the expense of procedural rights for individuals caught up in regulatory investigations." The "London Whale" scandal [Bloomberg Backgrounder] began in 2012 when a trader, Bruno Iksil, known as the London Whale, caused losses amounting to USD $6.2 billion while at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Macris is just the latest in a long line of litigation on this case. Multiple traders for JPMorgan have been indicted and convicted for hiding trading losses and fraud [Financial Post reports]. Iksil's case was dismissed by JPMorgan but Ikshil has faced no enforcement action [Business Insider UK report].

By Nadja Sayej / The Guardian March 17, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Hare Krishna / Shutterstock This week, President Trump released his “America first” federal budget plan, which intends to completely wipe out the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. It is the first time a president has ever proposed their complete obliteration. It came a day before the opening of the Whitney Biennial – the longest-running survey of American art – casting a gloomy shadow on a group exhibition that explores the topic of funding, or its lack thereof. The 63 artists on view are co-curated by Mia Locks and Christopher Y Lew, who want to mirror this bleak era. “This biennial arrives at a time rife with racial tensions, economic inequities and polarizing politics,” they write in the introductory statement, “inviting us to pause and pose questions in a tumultuous world.” It’s a politically charged show on the state of America but without the predictable satire. Rather, this exhibition feels like a graveyard of the establishment’s broken promises with glimmers of hope from some of its suffering citizens. Part of the Occupy Museums group show. Photograph: Occupy Museums In light of arts funding cuts, the art collective Occupy Museums, which was formed in 2011 alongside Occupy Wall Street, has created a mini group show in the biennial called Debtfair. The works of 30 artists are grouped by the corporations they are in debt to; JPMorgan Chase, Navient and the FirstBank of Puerto Rico. The artworks can be bought for the artist’s monthly debt charge. What about art education, you ask? Puerto Rican artist and activist Chemi Rosado-Seijo took all the desks and chairs from a classroom from the Lower Manhattan Arts Academy and put the class inside the museum. The piece, called Salón Sala Salón, brings the high school art students to the museum for a weekly workshop, showing the importance the creative arts education in a time when its meaning is being diminished. The arts aren’t the only sector suffering funding cuts – the budget proposal wipes out thousands of jobs in health, science and social programs. New York artist Cameron Rowland’s piece Public Money shows one alternative form of funding that could pave the way for the future, social impact bonds. “The purpose is to gain a more intimate understanding of how they work,” he said. “So few people know they exist, let alone how they work, which is something that is crucial at this moment.” While there are no Trump portraits or American flags, there is a Statue of Liberty standing outside in below-zero weather. The performance, called Liberté (Liberty), has a performer holding up an unlit torch. It was created by art group Puppies Puppies, who are selling foam Liberty Island crowns downstairs in the gift shop for $5, debunking the myth that high art has to be expensive (and inaccessible). Even with holdups at airports and the looming Muslim ban, other pieces dig into the refugee crisis, like The Island, a film by Vietnamese artist Tuan Andrew Nguyen. Shot on the Malaysian island of Bidong, a former Vietnam war refugee camp, it mirrors the present refugee crisis at a time when millions of Syrian refugees have fled their homeland. While the small island accommodated 250,000 people from the 1970s to the time it shut down in 1991, America will accept no more than 50,000 refugees this year after screening each one under a microscope. During the presidential campaign, Melania Trump was called out for copying and pasting parts of Michelle Obama’s speech. Here, there is also a plagiarism spat. On Instagram, Toronto artist Maya Ben David claimed that a sculpture in the biennial by Ajay Kurian looks too similar to a character she created called Mary Jane Anthro Plane, which is featured in her video art piece MBD: Origin Story, which was shown in a gallery last year. Kurian’s sculpture, which is part of a series he called Childermass, features a figure with a red wig and a white mask, just like David’s. “The sculpture in the Whitney not only resembles my character with an airplane mask and red hair, but she is wearing layered shirts and sneakers just like in my work,” said Ben David. “I would like an apology from the artist and curators at the Whitney Museum and recognition that the character Mary Jane Anthro Plane is my creation.” An email sent to Kurian’s gallerist was not answered at the time of publishing this story. Raúl de Nieves’s Technicolor stained glass wall. Photograph: Will Ragozzino It feels like many people are being sold short, and it isn’t just Trump’s budget cuts to the arts. While his proposed Mexican-US border wall will cost billions, the current border is a point of inspiration in the show. Mexican artist Raúl de Nieves’s Technicolor stained glass wall reads Hope, while the Postcommodity art collective created a video that follows the rusty metal fence that currently divides Douglas, Arizona, and Agua Prieta, Mexico. “The border continues to mystify the American public during this administration, as it did before Trump entered,” said Postcommodity artist Cristobal Martinez, who refers to their piece as “a metaphor for the imprisonment caused by the polarizing bipartisan discourse”.   Nadja Sayej is a freelance journalist in Berlin covering art and culture.

WALL STREET SHUFFLE - the tyranny of mere wealth, the tyranny of plutocracy (Image by YouTube, Channel: JFWilliam)   Permission   Details   DMCA - Advertisement - By golly, The Donald delivers. Trump and his new blue-ribbon panel of working-class champions have announced a bold new initiative to create millions of American jobs. A spokesman for the panel, Steve Schwarzman, praised Trump as a leader who wants to "do things a lot better in our country, for all Americans." Wait a minute -- Steve Schwarzman? Isn't he a billionaire hedge-fund huckster on Wall Street? Yes -- and holy money bags, there's Jamie Dimon, head of the scandal-ridden bank JPMorgan Chase. - Advertisement - Working-class champions? Hardly. Trump's whole "jobs" panel, it turns out, is made up of Wall Street banksters and corporate powers like Wal-Mart that are notorious for laying off and ripping off workers. Trump-the-candidate fulminated against such moneyed elites, calling them "responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class." But now, in a spectacular flip-flop, he's brought these robbers directly inside his presidency, asking them to be architects of his economic strategy. Worse, he's doing this in the name of helping workers. Hello! To develop policies beneficial to working stiffs, bring in some working stiffs! But there's not a single labor advocate on his policy council, in his cabinet, or anywhere near his White House. Thus, the so-called "job-creation plan" announced by Trump and his corporate cohorts doesn't create any jobs, but calls instead for de-regulating Wall Street. These flim-flammers actually want us rubes to believe that "freeing" banksters to return to casino-style speculation and consumer scams will give them more money to invest in American jobs. - Advertisement - Do they think we have sucker wrappers around our heads? Trump's scheme will let banks make a killing, but it doesn't require them to invest in jobs -- so they won't. There's a name for this: fraud.   - Advertisement - 2   1   View Ratings | Rate It Jim Hightower is an American populist, spreading his message of democratic hope via national radio commentaries, columns, books, his award-winning monthly newsletter (The Hightower Lowdown) and barnstorming tours all across America.

Union bosses are NOT "workers." Washington, as you know is a very aristocratic, closed society. How many middle class Americans are appointed to anything? Until this changes we will continue the to have a status-quo government which goes nowhere but down.

Now, the woman behind that push is taking aim at another industry known for its male-dominated workplace: The financial sector. Natasha Lamb, managing director of Arjuna Capital, which focuses on sustainable and social impact investing, said she had filed proposals at six financial companies urging them to prepare a report addressing their goals at reducing the gender pay gap and including the percentage gap between the pay of men and women. The banks and credit card firms targeted are Citigroup, Wells Fargo, American Express, MasterCard, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. "It makes no sense to hold America's top tech companies to a high standard on gender pay equity and then pretend that banks should be allowed to discount the issue and operate with no transparency," Lamb said in a conference call with reporters. Lamb said she was going after the major banks in part because financial services is such a male-dominated industry. In the proposal, she cited data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows female financial advisers faced a 61.3 percent pay gap in 2014, the widest of occupations reviewed, as well as a 2016 study from the management consultancy Oliver Wyman showing it will take three decades before women reach 30 percent of the industry's executive committees. Other research cited showed links between risks and rewards for investors in companies that have diverse executive teams. Lamb said she has been in dialogue with all the companies in question, but most of the financial firms have been more opposed to her proposal. "We've seen a night and day difference in the tech and financial worlds," Lamb said. All but one of the six companies have come out against the proposal, Lamb said; she has not gotten an answer from MasterCard. Among the nine tech companies she worked with last year, only three formally opposed the resolutions in their proxies, one of which was eBay, where an unusually high number of shareholders voted in favor of the proposal and the company said it would share its analysis publicly. Of course, the tech companies revealed nearly nonexistent percentage gaps when analyzing people working in similar jobs, which may have made them more willing to share the information. Those numbers also overlook the industry's position gap: Men and women may earn roughly the same in the same jobs, but men are more frequently in higher-paying roles in both of these industries. Meanwhile, four of the banks — Wells Fargo, Bank of America, American Express and Citigroup — defended their numbers of female leaders and their pay practices in lengthy sections of their proxy statements. In them, the companies highlighted a range of internal efforts to prevent bias, improve numbers of women and minorities, use third party consultants to check for pay equity, as well as note recognition they've received for diversity and leadership involvement in diversity programs. As a result, Lamb's proposal was described by the companies as unnecessary. In an emailed statement, Citigroup spokesman Mark Costiglio added that "we have had productive discussions with Arjuna Capital on their proposal and look forward to continued engagement on this issue." JPMorgan has not yet released its proxy, and a spokesman declined to comment, though Lamb said she expects the company to oppose the proposal, pending further dialogue. A spokesman from MasterCard, which also hasn't released its proxy, said in an emailed statement that it would be premature to comment on the resolution but that the company "strive[s] to ensure gender pay parity. We regularly examine pay practices and, at our company, both in the U.S. and globally, men and women in the same level earn equal pay for equal performance."

The company expects to price its 28.95 million shares in the range of $18 to $20 per share, with an overallotment option for an additional 4.34 million shares. At the maximum price the entire offering is valued up to $665.78 million. The company intends to list its stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SNDR. The underwriters for the offering are Morgan Stanley, UBS Investment, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Baird and Wolfe Capital Markets. This is a leading transportation and logistics services company that provides a broad portfolio of premier truckload, intermodal and logistics solutions and operating one of the largest for-hire trucking fleets in North America. The firm believes that it has developed a differentiated business model that is difficult to replicate due to its scale, breadth of complementary service offerings and proprietary technology platform. The highly flexible and balanced business combines asset-based truckload services with asset-light intermodal and non-asset logistics offerings, enabling the company to serve its customers’ diverse transportation needs. Since its founding in 1935, management believes that it has become an iconic and trusted brand within the transportation industry by adhering to a culture of safety “first and always” and upholding its responsibility to associates, customers and the communities that we serve. Schneider is the second largest truckload company in North America by revenue, one of the largest intermodal transportation providers in North America by revenue and an industry leader in specialty equipment services and e-commerce fulfillment. In the filing, the company said: Our portfolio consists of approximately 10,500 company and 2,850 owner-operator trucks, 37,900 trailers and 18,100 intermodal containers across North America and approximately 19,300 enterprise associates. We serve a diverse customer base across multiple industries represented by approximately 16,000 customers, including nearly 200 Fortune 500 companies. Each day, we transit over 8.9 million miles, equivalent to circling the globe approximately 360 times. Our logistics business manages nearly 23,000 qualified carrier relationships and, in 2016, managed approximately $2 billion of third-party freight. Schneider intends to use the proceeds from this offering to repay its debt, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes. The company will not receive $230 million in the offering; instead selling shareholders will receive those proceeds.

He was at the group’s next meeting, and in 1989, he chained himself to a balcony at the New York Stock Exchange with a banner reading "Sell Wellcome." Days later, Burroughs Wellcome lowered the price of the AIDS treatment AZT by 20 percent. Jes and Peter Staley Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg Jes Staley, now chief executive of Barclays, remembers that protest -- he was on JPMorgan’s equities desk at the time -- and can chart his own transformation as a banker standing up for gay rights and AIDS research, as well as the influence of his brother. "We talk politics a lot," Jes Staley said Thursday night at the 35th anniversary benefit of the Gay Men’s Health Crisis, which has set its sights on eliminating AIDS. The event, at Highline Stages in Manhattan, brought Peter and Jes together to be honored and to reflect on activism. In interviews, Peter said the era of President Donald Trump calls for different forms of protest than in his ACT UP days, while Jes cited social change as critical to the culture of contemporary banking. At the bar Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg A " Paradise Garage" neon sign, evoking the New York discotheque of the ’70s and ’80s, glowed over the bar as George Michael’s "I Want Your Sex" played. Deep in the crowd, Jes Staley mingled with colleagues from Barclays, including Barbara Byrne, who raised four kids while working in the industry, and Mark Lane, involved with the employee network for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Barbara Byrne, Jes Staley and Mark Lane Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg "This is a rock-star banker of Barclays," Staley said of Byrne, who was a producer of the film "Equity" and helped create the Women in Leadership Index, which tracks the performance of companies with more gender-diverse leadership. "Barbara leads a number of the social change groups in the bank and she’s got a direct line to me whenever she wants it. And she knows it. And she uses it." "Diversity is everything," Byrne said, noting its many forms. "It’s creativity. Finance is an art; it requires creativity." Jes Staley interjected. "You’ll never keep the millennials unless you think like that," he said. "You look at the millennials, they understand diversity in a way we never even imagined 40 years ago. We’ve got to live how they live if we’re going to keep them." Liz Smith and Gary Chryst, choreographer and former dancer Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg The crowd filled in with impeccably dressed guests, millennial and otherwise, including Larry Kramer, who wrote the play "Normal Heart" and is a founder of ACT UP; Edie Windsor and her lawyer Roberta Kaplan, who won a Supreme Court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage; Chelsea Clinton, on hand to accept an award on behalf of her father for his work on AIDS through the Clinton Foundation, especially in Africa; gossip queen Liz Smith; and David France, whose documentary "How to Survive a Plague," also a book, chronicles the ACT UP crusade. Gay Men’s Health Crisis CEO Kelsey Louie with Larry Kramer Photographer: Matthew McDermott for GMHC amanda Peter Staley -- who features prominently in France’s work -- bounced on his feet. He was a little giddy with the news that the House of Representatives had put off a vote on a bill that would dismantle President Barack Obama’s signature health-care law. "We’ll hopefully continue to foil Trump’s centerpiece agenda item," Peter Staley said. "I think we’ve got the upper hand."

Filmmakers Joy Tomchin and Laura Teodosio Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg Traditional electoral politics -- showing up, contacting senators and house members -- had paid off in this case. "I think the activism of the resistance is much less involved with ACT UP tactics," he said. "It doesn’t require people getting arrested. It doesn’t require radical activism. This is very traditional legislative action, and you can do that from any office." At the Barclays table, Bob Gasser and Pratibha Vuppuluri Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg He cited not just the health-care bill, but climate change, abortion rights and financial regulation, a matter he noted his brother had addressed. "When Trump came into office, there were some companies that felt they had to go kiss the ring, he’s going to get rid of all our regulations. I’m proud of Jes for speaking up and saying, we’re doing fine under Dodd-Frank, we’re not looking for lots of candy thrown our way from Trump. What really matters to the financial industry is a robust democratic system." Hudson Valley beet ravioli was being nibbled at when Jes Staley accepted his award, recalling having two young daughters and a brother who was HIV-positive, at a time when that term brought on fear. "I remember a number of people telling my wife, make sure your brother-in-law doesn’t come to your house," Jes Staley said. "My wife and I talked about it a lot. She was resolute that Peter was part of this family. He was always welcome, he was always hugged by our daughters, and he always hugged them." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 24, 2017 3:01pm   Comments Share: Related CHD Wall Street's M&A Chatter From February 15 Earnings Scheduled For February 7, 2017 Related CL The Technician's Playbook: 11 Sector Pair Trades Kraft Heinz Might Have Its Eyes On PepsiCo ETF Monkey Focus: Consumer Staples ETFs (Seeking Alpha) JPMorgan initiated coverage of U.S. beverages and household & personal care products companies Tuesday. The firm said its top picks are the ones offering growth at reasonable price, namely Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE: EL), Newell Brands Inc (NYSE: NWL), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ: MNST) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP). Analyst Andrea Teixeira, however, is Underweight on Coty Inc (NYSE: COTY), given acquisition, integration challenges. The analyst noted that the sectors have been unusually volatile. Key Drivers Of he Industry Increased M&A and activism with two announcements: 3G/Buffett bid for Unilever plc (ADR) (NYSE: UL) as well as Trian's $3.5 billion investment in Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) leading to a sector dislocation, re-rating but also creating GARP opportunities Key categories (laundry, toothpaste, litter) deceleration, decreased mall traffic: Leading to destocking and increased promotional activity at key large boxes, particularly Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) Increased relevance of non-tracked channels: Including e-commerce, specialty retailers, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) limiting the Street's ability to use Nielsen data as a leading indicator into earnings. Potential tax reform favoring U.S.-centric companies. Elaborating on the Overweighted stocks, JPMorgan gave reasons for its preference for each of them. Justification On The Bullish Theses Este Lauder: Continued strong top-line growth, new shelves at Specialty offsetting declines at department stores, high ROE and attractive valuation. Monster Beverage: Additional growth stemming from the use of The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), continued category share gains and U.S. growth boosted by product innovation. Pepsi: Solid growth in snack business, market share gains by non-carbonated beverages and opportunity to improve beverages execution with snacks experience. Newell: White space opportunities, high return on marketing investments, cheap valuation. Worsening Competitive Environment Seen For Neutral-Rated Stocks The firm clarified that it is Neutral on stocks exposed to decelerating and increasingly promotional categories. According to the firm, the competitive environment has worsened for Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: CL), Clorox Co (NYSE: CLX), Kimberly Clark Corp (NYSE: KMB) and Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE: CHD). This is because management teams have been very vocal about falling sales in key categories such as laundry, litter and grooming. Tax Reforms Overestimated JPMorgan sees good entry points for Newell, Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE: STZ) and Becle SAB de CV NPV (OTC: BCCLF) , as it feels tax reforms, though likely to be significant, were being overly estimated. Ratings/Price Targets Becle (Jose Cuervo) — Overweight/ 36 Mexican Peso. Church & Dwight — Neutral/$53. Clorox — Neutral/$136. Coca-Cola — Neutral/$43. Colgate-Palmolive — Neutral/$77. Constellation Brands — Overweight/$183. Coty — Underweight/$16. Estee Lauder — Overweight/$100. Kimberly Clark — Neutral/$139. Molson Coors Brewing Co (NYSE: TAP) — Neutral/$105. Monster Beverages — Overweight/$56. Newell Brands — Overweight/$63. PepsiCo — Overweight/$125. Procter & Gamble — Neutral/$98.

The Akron Market Value Analysis by the Reinvestment Fund this week revealed detailed data on key points across each of Akron's neighborhoods. The report dovetails with the Planning to Grow Akron report released in February. Akron wants to grow from 198,000 residents to 250,000 by 2050: Here's how The information can help Akron, which has limited resources, understand how and where to strategically invest to bring the greatest benefits over the long term, said Akron Director of Planning & Urban Development Jason Segedy. The roughly $80,000 study was paid in part through the J.P. Morgan Chase Foundation. The Reinvestment Fund, which aims to improve the quality of life in low-income neighborhoods, used housing data on sales prices, foreclosures and vacant properties, as well as population and worker statistics. For greater precision, researchers looked at the city in sections one-fifth the size of a census track. Researchers also drove the city several times to understand if the data collected was supported by what actually exists on the ground, said Akron Chief of Staff James Hardy. In Akron, it's possible for housing characteristics to dramatically change from one street to the next, said Colin Weidig, Reinvestment Fund research analyst. "You really want to have as much refined data as possible so you can see where the market's changing," he said. The research identifies areas by market strength using color-coding ranging from: Purple (A & B) indicating the highest home values, occupancies and permitting activity. Yellow (H & I) indicating the lowest home values with the highest levels of foreclosures, vacant homes and subsidized rentals. Areas at a mid-point would be strengthened by city resources or decline without them. Akron can use the data to choose where to deploy stronger code enforcement, make street and sidewalk improvements and work to revitalize neighborhood business districts, Segedy said. "When you start to put all those different pieces together you can make the neighborhood pop out a little more," he said. "Investing that time and effort and some money maybe moves that neighborhood from an E to a D, or a D to a C." Conversely, putting resources into areas before they're ready could waste city resources. Akron plans to offer residential tax abatements With the city poised to launch a city-wide residential tax abatement for new construction and large additions on homes, the research will help guide construction. "You have to tailor the type of house to who you think might buy it, and this report helps us think through that a little more strategically," Segedy said. The researchers also collected data on the city's assets, such as large employers, and natural resources, like Summit Lake. The assets are considered points of strength, especially when they're near distressed areas. "You can build off that and and make investments that help draw that strength into these distressed areas, and build the overall health of market," Weidig said. The Akron Market Value Analysis will also be used in conjunction with the Build in Akron report released by the Greater Ohio Policy Center in February.

The company offered 9 million shares, initially priced at $14 a share, valuing the IPO at $126 million. The stock closed at $15.50 a share, up 10.7 percent from its IPO pricing. “As data continues to expand and change, the ability to leverage this data for actionable insights has become increasingly foundational to modern business success,” the company said in a statement. “Our platform enables organizations to dramatically improve business outcomes and the productivity of their business analysts.” The company, which filed for its IPO last month, rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange as AYX. The company previously said it would sell 9 million shares of stock for $12 to $14 a share. Alteryx, according to regulatory filings, lost some $24 million in 2016. But its revenue has expanded, growing to nearly $86 million in 2016 from roughly $38 million in 2014. Underwriters had a 30-day option to purchase more shares at the IPO price. Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Pacific Crest Securities, William Blair & Co., JMP Securities, Raymond James & Associates, and Cowen and Co. are the underwriters. Alteryx was founded as SRC in 1997 by Dean Stoecker, Olivia Duane Adams and Ned Harding. It changed its name in 2010 to that of its core product. Stoecker remains the company’s president and CEO. Stoecker told CNBC the funds raised in the IPO will go to the “next chapter” at the company, including jumpstarting growth and potentially making acquisitions. The company provides data analytics to more accurately predict how a company initiative would resonate with its customers or to plot new retail locations. Alteryx at the end of 2016 said it had 2,300 customers in more than 50 countries. It employs 424 people and has seven regional offices worldwide, including an office in Silicon Valley. High-profile customers have included Starbucks, Unilever, Dunkin’ Donuts, Amazon and Verizon. Newport Beach-based Veritone Inc. is seeking $15 million in its IPO, according to a SEC filing earlier this month. The startup uses artificial intelligence, or AI, to analyze audio and video data. The filing did not specify how many shares of stock would be issued. The stock will be listed under the symbol “VERI” on the Nasdaq exchange. The stock is being underwritten by Wunderlich Securities Inc. and Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC. The money from the IPO will be used to fund the company’s growth, according to the SEC filing. The company, founded in 2014, signed an agreement last year with Newport Beach-based Acacia Research Corp. for up to $50 million. Acacia licenses patents. Company co-founder Chad Steelberg serves as the company’s chief executive officer and chariman of the board. Co-founder Ryan Steelberg serves as president.
