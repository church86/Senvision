A Yale-educated investment banker was convicted of insider trading charges Wednesday after a jury concluded he gave tips about mergers and acquisitions to his father, enabling over $1 million in illegal profits. Sean Stewart, 35, testified during the two-week Manhattan federal court trial, insisting he had no idea his father was sharing secrets with a broker to make trades ahead of public announcements on five separate deals that he oversaw while working at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Perella Weinberg Partners LP. As the verdict was read, Stewart was stoic, though he turned to look at his mother on a bench behind him. Sentencing was set for Feb. 17 for the Manhattan resident. Stewart's lawyer, Mark Gombiner, said the defense was damaged when Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled that Stewart's father could use the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying. "We have a lot of issues on appeal," he said. In a release, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: "Time and time again, Sean Stewart took his clients' most sensitive corporate secrets and fed them to his father on a silver platter for quick and illegal profits." The father, Robert Stewart, was sentenced to one year of home detention after pleading guilty to an insider trading charge. Prosecutors said evidence, including the timing of pivotal meetings regarding the corporate deals and subsequent trades in securities by the father and communications between the father and son soon afterward, made it obvious the son tipped his father intentionally. The father received about $150,000 while the stock broker got the rest of $1.1 million in profits, though prosecutors say the son benefited when his father used some of proceeds to pay for Stewart's wedding rehearsal dinner and for a wedding photographer. Richard Cunniffe, who executed some of the securities trades for Stewart's father, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and testified at the trial. The effort to show Sean Stewart received something in return for sharing secrets was important after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December 2014 changed the landscape of insider trading law by saying prosecutors needed to show that the person supplying secrets received something of value in return. Stewart's trial was the first to occur in Manhattan since that ruling. Testifying over two days, Stewart insisted he did nothing wrong, though he acknowledged breaking the rules of his employers when he talked openly and casually about secret deals with his family. He said he never told his father the dates that mergers would occur or the size of the deals, though he said he told his father that the timing of one of the deals conflicted with his scheduled spring 2001 wedding date. "I am innocent," Stewart testified. "I never ever gave my father information expecting him to trade." Prosecutors told jurors that Stewart continued to tell his father inside information even after he was confronted by JPMorgan lawyers about stock trades his father made surrounding a merger of companies the son helped arrange in early 2011. They said the father traded based on information he received from his son about four additional mergers afterward. Throughout the trial, defense lawyers blamed the father. Sean Stewart had testified that his father's bad acts "resulted in the loss of my career and reputation." In her closing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah McCallum said Stewart "five times ... handed his father tomorrow's news today."

Subsidized Employment Training Gives a Head Start SAMMinistries and JPMorgan Chase offer SET program to homeless SAMM-Logo-2014-Large   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Job Training * Jp Morgan Chase * SAMMinistries By Industry: * Non-profitSAN ANTONIO - Aug. 17, 2016 - PRLog -- SAMMinistries and JP Morgan Chase have joined forces to help the homeless break the unemployment cycle through the Subsidized Employment Training (SET) Program. In a two-part initiative, SAMMinistries recruits and screens appropriate candidates. Partnering employers then provide a 12-week training period with a consideration of permanent employment after. Through a generous grant from JP Morgan Chase, SAMMinistries reimburses employers for 50% of the trainee's wage during the initial period and oversees the employee's progress. "We provide screened candidates and partial wage reimbursement, so that businesses can spend less time searching and lower their training expenses, while at the same helping someone earn a living wage" said Navarra Williams, SAMMinistries President and CEO. "This program helps everyone succeed." This win-win program is designed to bridge the "skills gap" by training and preparing individuals for employment in the high-demand fields of healthcare, information technology, and manufacturing. These skills offer hope and open the door to living-wage employment, enabling individuals to support their families. Local businesses have a unique opportunity to partner with the non-profit sector—meeting their employment needs while giving back to the community. If your company is interested in this program, please contact Robert Mendoza, Senior Manager of Workforce Development, at 210-321-5663 or rmendoza@samm.org. About SAMMinistries: Overcoming Homelessness San Antonio Metropolitan Ministries, founded in 1983, is an interfaith ministry whose mission is to help the homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless attain self-sufficiency by offering with dignity and compassion, shelter, housing, and services.

At the beginning of this year, bearish views of developing economies were all the rage. As recently as May, shorting (selling securities prior to buying them with the aim of making a profit when their price falls) emerging markets was still one of the most crowded trades, according to a monthly survey published by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Yet over the past several months, especially since the end of June, investors have unwound their bearish bets on emerging markets and poured money into their foreign-exchange, equity and bond markets in search of higher returns amid a collapse in interest rates in many developed nations. The shift in investor sentiment has been dramatic. According to a separate survey published by Bank of America Merrill Lynch last month, fixed-income investors now have a small overweight position in emerging-market currencies. Emerging market equities tipped as new darlings of investment This is not surprising, given that emerging-market foreign exchange has been one of the best-performing asset classes this year, with nearly half the gains occurring since the end of June when Britain voted to leave the European Union. The Brexit vote triggered a further decline in bond yields in advanced economies, with those in Europe and Japan falling deeper into negative territory, increasing the appeal of higher-yielding emerging-market assets. According to JPMorgan, inflows into emerging-market bond funds have “outpaced inflows into risk assets elsewhere”, reaching US$17 billion since the start of July, with last month’s US$13.5 billion in inflows representing the largest monthly inflow since the bank began tracking subscriptions to debt funds in developing economies. Even more remarkably, flows to emerging-market equity funds (which last year suffered huge outflows totalling US$64 billion) this year have now moved into positive territory following six weeks of large inflows, according to JPMorgan. The Brexit vote triggered a further decline in bond yields in advanced economies, increasing the appeal of higher-yielding emerging-market assets Yet it is emerging-market currencies, which last year bore the brunt of the deterioration in sentiment towards developing economies as oil prices continued to fall, that have been the greatest beneficiaries of the other main reason behind the rally in emerging-market assets: the weakness of the US dollar amid expectations that US interest rates are unlikely to rise further this year. On Tuesday, the dollar index fell a further 0.7 per cent, taking its decline over the past month to nearly 3 per cent and causing the yen to flirt with the psychologically important level of 100 yen to the dollar. The weaker dollar is providing support to commodity prices amid renewed hopes among investors of a freeze in production by members of the Opec oil cartel. Oil prices, having fallen sharply last month, have shot up 17.5 per cent this month, easing the strain on the developing world’s vulnerable energy exporters such as Russia and Malaysia. JPMorgan even believes “the worst of the emerging-market fundamental downturn has passed”, with economic growth expected to pick up slightly in the second half of this year, underpinned by a stabilisation in oil prices and loose monetary policy. Still, emerging markets are by no means out of the woods. The rally stems partly from expectations that the Federal Reserve will eschew a “hawkish surprise” by raising rates earlier than expected. Yet on Tuesday, William Dudley, a prominent Fed policymaker, said bond markets were “complacent” about the scope for further rate rises, warning that borrowing costs could increase as early as next month. The fact that markets sold off immediately following his comments shows the degree of uncertainty surrounding the conduct of US monetary policy. Fed admits it triggered emerging markets sell-off but says some countries' policies made them vulnerable On Wednesday, futures markets were assigning a nearly 50 per cent probability to a rate rise by the end of this year, the highest odds since early June. Secondly, a fresh burst of political risk is likely to weigh on market sentiment as the US presidential election campaign enters its final stretch in the run-up to the vote on November 8. While Donald Trump, the populist Republican candidate, is now trailing Hillary Clinton, his Democratic counterpart, in the polls, a Trump victory is still possible. Finally, emerging-market economies are hardly roaring back to life. The Latin American region will contract this year, Russia is still in recession and China’s economy continues to slow as it struggles to rebalance away from investment. Emerging-market bulls should not get carried away.

Business Catholic Health system gets financial breathing room with $1 billion bond sale Michael Englehart Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune President and CEO of Presence Health Michael Englehart at the company's headquarters in downtown Chicago on March 16, 2016. President and CEO of Presence Health Michael Englehart at the company's headquarters in downtown Chicago on March 16, 2016. (Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) Peter Matuszak and Lisa SchenckerContact ReporterChicago Tribune Presence Health has closed on a $1 billion bond sale — the largest deal of its kind in Illinois — in an effort to shore up the Catholic health system's financial fitness following large operating losses last year. The deal provides a big dose of assistance to the Chicago-based, 11-hospital system, enabling it to refinance its debt while it tries to right its operations. Facilitated by the Illinois Finance Authority, the deal is the largest BBB-rated, not-for-profit health care transaction ever sold in this sector of the municipal market, according to JPMorgan Chase, the deal's underwriter. Presence President and CEO Michael Englehart said in a news release the system was excited with how well its bond offering was received. "This was a clear indication that our investors have full confidence that our turnaround plan is working, we have the right executive team in place, we are engaging the right industry experts, and we are carefully reviewing and restructuring our functional processes," Englehart said. Presence declined to make Englehart available for an interview Wednesday. A spokesman, Robert Scarola, would not elaborate on what the health system specifically planned to do to increase revenue and whether it planned additional layoffs. Presence, the largest Illinois-based Catholic health system with hospitals stretching from Evanston to Urbana, has been working on a turnaround after facing a series of challenges in recent years. Catholic health system makes progress in turnaround plan Ameet Sachdev Presence Health's shaky financial condition has taken a slight turn for the better after the Catholic health system reduced its workforce by more than 650 full-time jobs and increased prices in the first half of the year. But it's too early to say whether the Chicago-based company is on the road... Presence Health's shaky financial condition has taken a slight turn for the better after the Catholic health system reduced its workforce by more than 650 full-time jobs and increased prices in the first half of the year. But it's too early to say whether the Chicago-based company is on the road... (Ameet Sachdev) In 2015, Presence lost more than $185 million on operations, compared with a loss of $12.7 million in 2014. Several credit-rating agencies this year downgraded the system's bond rating, which can affect a company's ability to borrow money. Among the debt that will be refinanced is a $528.1 million short-term loan the system got from JPMorgan Chase earlier this year. That loan was intended to buy the system time to restructure its debt. Remaining bonds from Presence's predecessors, Resurrection Health Care and Provena Health, also were refinanced as part of the deal, totaling $223.1 million and $286.8 million, respectively. The refinancing deal is facilitated by conduit bonds that the IFA issues on behalf of qualified non-for-profit organizations. Presence Health pledged operating revenue to repay the bonds, a bill that will total $1.7 billion, including $719.1 million in interest through 2041, according to bond documents. If Presence were to default on its payments, bondholders could seek to recoup their investment only by pursuing the health system's assets. Neither the IFA nor state taxpayers would be responsible for covering the cost, as the authority serves only as a conduit for the financial transaction. Christopher Meister, executive director of the IFA, said the agency was happy to be of help to Presence "in this important transaction for the people of Illinois and the state's community health." Conduit bonds allow not-for-profits to obtain much lower rates through tax-exempt bonds than would be available by taking out traditional bank loans or issuing commercial paper. According to a statement issued by Presence Health after the deal closed, the refunding bonds received an average fixed interest rate of 3.88 percent. Refinancing all of Presence's outstanding debt should give it a measure of financial breathing room. The $1 billion refunding bond includes interest-only payments for several years. Principal repayment begins in 2020. In all, the new bond deal is expected to save the health system $49 million based in current dollars over the life of the loan, according to Presence. "With lower interest expense costs reduced, this gives us greater ability to deliver upon our strategy to improve operations and build on our platform of high quality patient experience," Scarola said in an emailed statement. He said, for example, the system will continue reviewing operations such as clinical documentation. The system has started making progress on its finances. Earlier this year, it reduced its workforce by 650 full-time positions and increased prices. Following those actions, Presence's income from operations improved from a loss of $9 million in January to a profit of $1.1 million in June, according to an unaudited financial statement released last month. Although the focus of the $1 billion loan was to refinance debt, Presence used $117 million of the proceeds to reimburse recent capital investments, according to the bond documents. The capital reimbursement is for routine maintenance activities performed across the system over the past 18 months, Scarola said in a statement. Investors paid premiums totaling $87.2 million in order to secure interest rates on the bonds of 4 percent or 5 percent for most of the maturities. After accounting for the additional money provided upfront, the bonds averaged a yield of 3.88 percent. Combined with funds previously deposited for repayment of the old bonds, $122.2 million in additional funding was added to the $1 billion bond sale. According to the bond disclosures for the deal, a small portion of the short-term loan from JPMorgan Chase may not be refinanced using the bond funds. pmatuszak@chicagotribune.com lschencker@chicagotribune.com Twitter @petermatuszak Twitter @lschencker An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Illinois taxpayers might be obligated to help pay the cost of the debt if Presence defaulted on its payments.

When Chase Pay goes live later this year, Phillips 66 will support mobile payments service through the Chase Pay app at its Phillips 66, Conoco and 76-branded fuel stations and stores. But the real power could come from making a vital connection within the app between payments and promotions, discounts and loyalty.

Roz Edward, Michigan Chronicle Managing Editor Leave a comment Cities of Service will support the City of Detroit, alongside two other cities, in building local capacity and increasing citizen engagement  The City of Detroit will receive $100,000 in grant funding, along with consulting services and other assistance from Cities of Service, to support the installation of a Chief Service Officer. The Chief Service Officer is a senior-level administration staff member who will plan, direct, coordinate, and evaluate the implementation of a comprehensive, citywide service plan that engages citizen volunteers in communities where they can have significant impact. Supported with $450,000 from JPMorgan Chase, Cities of Service is establishing a new cohort of Chief Service Officers in three major US cities, selected through a competitive review process. Detroit is one of the selected cities, along with Miami and Phoenix. The chosen Chief Service Officer for Detroit is Victoria Kovari, who previously served as General Manager for Mayor Mike Duggan’s Department of Neighborhoods. Victoria Kovari will combine her two roles as General Manager and Chief Service Officer in order to strengthen the city’s neighborhoods by engaging citizens. The Chief Service Officer role is instrumental in building the city’s capacity to address its most pressing challenges. The role serves as a champion for citizen volunteers, a voice for the mayor, a partner to city agencies, and a conduit for businesses and community groups. This model has been proven in multiple cities, including in Orlando, where a 2010 Cities of Service Leadership Grant helped the city launch Orlando Cares, which features six volunteer programs developed with community input. Since 2011, these programs have resulted in more than 6,310 youth served, more than 2,200 volunteers engaged, and more than 35 community partnerships. “Chief Service Officers are force multipliers, forging relationships and engaging partners across sectors to help local government address their city’s most pressing problems,” said Cities of Service Executive Director Myung J. Lee. “The support from JPMorgan Chase will enable us to help Detroit, Miami, and Phoenix partner with residents to tackle some of their cities’ major challenges, including hunger, school success, and urban blight.” In Detroit, Kovari will leverage the strength of the Department of Neighborhoods to coordinate all community engagement and volunteering activities in the city, aiming to reduce blight and prevent crime. She will lead the city’s efforts to further engage Detroit’s citizens, including partnering with neighborhood leaders, clergy, youth, educators, and small business owners to determine which volunteering initiatives will have the greatest positive impact on quality of life in the city. “We thank Cities of Service for its commitment to helping Detroit meet its challenges,” Mayor Mike Duggan said. “This grant, made possible with support from JPMorgan Chase, will go a long way to helping our citizens get more engaged, leading to stronger neighborhoods and a more active community.” About Cities of Service Founded in September 2009 in New York City by New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and 16 other mayors from across the nation, Cities of Service is a national nonprofit organization that supports mayors and city chief executives in their efforts to engage local communities and residents, identify challenges, and solve problems together. Today, the Cities of Service coalition is comprised of over 215 cities in the US and UK, representing nearly 55 million people in 45 states, and more than 10 million people in the UK. Cities of Service works with cities to build city-led, citizen-powered initiatives that target specific needs, achieve long-term and measurable outcomes, improve the quality of life for residents, and build stronger cities.

(FB) By Michelle Jones, ValueWalk  |  Aug 17, 2016, 11:04 am EST     Popular Posts: Is Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) and SolarCity Corp (SCTY) a Bankruptcy in the Making? Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will Be a Holiday 2016 Gold Mine Facebook Inc Warning: Slower Growth Means Lower FB Target Price Recent Posts: Facebook Inc Insider Stock Sales Pile Up (FB) Muni Bonds Are a Key to Making America Great Again Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Stock Is a Long-Term Crowd Pleaser View All Posts Facebook Inc (FB) stock pulled back on Monday and Tuesday as investors considered the weight of ad-blocking software and whether it has the potential to take a significant bite out of its ad revenue. The social network is in combat with Adblock Plus in a battle a Princeton assistant professor says it can’t win. Meanwhile analysts consider the various reasons sentiment on Facebook stock isn’t as strong as they think it could be. FB Stock Impacted by Ad Blockers This week the big issue affecting Facebook stock could be ad-blocking software. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) analysts said this week that the social network’s move to beat down ad blockers on its desktop website indicates the size of the impact blockers have on it. Although ads on the desktop sites only generate about 15% of the company’s total ad revenue, Wells Fargo analysts said it appears as if ad blockers are starting to materially impact its results. They pointed to Facebook’s most recent earnings report as evidence but added that the company is among the best-positioned in terms of being able to offset losses caused by ad blockers. The social network said last week that it will change the way ads load on its desktop site so that it will be harder for ad blockers to detect them. However, Adblock Plus, the biggest ad blocker on the market, was quick to respond by making a small tweak to its settings to unravel Facebook’s latest efforts, explains the MIT Technology Review. Princeton Assistant Professor Arvind Narayanan doesn’t believe the social network can win this war. He and undergraduate Grant Storey developed their own experimental ad “highlighter” to demonstrate this. It works as a plugin for Chrome, and when it is installed, Facebook News Feed adds are grayed out and the words “This is an ad” cover them. 7 Tech Stocks That Will Pop 10% or More Current ad blockers examine the HTML code that indicates to a Web browser which parts of a particular page are ads, and Facebook’s first move was simply to remove the HTML clues. However, the ad highlighter works differently by examining the areas of a page that humans can see and blocking posts that have the “Sponsored” tag. The reason this works better than blockers using HTML cues is because the Federal Trade Commission’s transparency rules requires the social network to clearly label ads. Other reasons Facebook Stock Sentiment May Be Muted JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) analyst Doug Anmuth and team also considered some other reasons why investors may not be so keen on Facebook stock right now. They reiterated their “overweight” rating and $170 price target on the stock in a report dated August 16 and outlined the biggest concerns they’ve been hearing from investors about it lately. One has to do with mega cap growth and multiples, but they don’t believe Facebook stock will have similar multiple compression as other mega caps which have compressed by 60% to 80% from peak to trough growth. They expect the social network’s revenue to “decelerate at a measured pace as its ad ecosystem becomes more important & captures a greater share of marketer spend.” Another issue some investors worry about is slowing ad load growth, but they explain that this isn’t surprising because it would have to happen at some point. Also management has been warning about it for some time, and they explain that ad load is becoming less and less important as a growth driver. Engagement also remains a concern due to small sequential declines in daily and monthly active users in some regions, but they say the ratio of daily to monthly active users is still steady at 66%. Also Facebook continues to take about 13% of U.S. mobile Internet minutes, excluding messenger and including tablets. CSCO Stock: Cisco Systems, Inc. Looking for a Breakout This is two times greater than Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram and others combined, Anmuth and team explained. Investors are increasingly concerned about Snapchat, but the JPMorgan team doesn’t see it as much of a threat because they don’t believe it is really impacting engagement or ad revenue. Shares of Facebook are down marginally in morning trading. Many academics claim investing is a “random walk.” We believe this to be only partially true.

In addition, the Company has amended the Maximum Tender Offers to increase the previously announced Aggregate Maximum Repurchase Amount from approximately $535.4 million (which gives effect to the Company’s purchase of certain of the 8.250% notes due 2018, issued by Devon OEI Operating, L.L.C., and the 6.300% notes due 2019, issued by the Company, for total consideration of approximately $664.6 million in the Company’s previously consummated tender offers (the “Any and All Offers”) for such notes) to such aggregate amount necessary to pay the Total Consideration (as defined below) for all of the 2.250% notes due 2018 (the “2018 Notes”) validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Maximum Tender Offers as of the Early Tender Date (as defined below), which Total Consideration is equal to approximately $652.1 million (as amended, the “Aggregate Maximum Repurchase Amount”). All other terms of the Maximum Tender Offers, as previously announced, remain unchanged. The Maximum Tender Offers were made pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase, dated August 4, 2016, and the related letter of transmittal (the “Tender Offer Documents”). The table below sets forth the Total Consideration for the 2018 Notes that will be accepted for purchase.

(b) The Total Consideration was calculated on the basis of pricing for the U.S. Treasury Reference Security as of 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 18, 2016, and is inclusive of the Early Tender Payment set forth in the table above. (c) Issuer: Devon Energy Corporation. (d) Issuer: Devon OEI Operating, L.L.C. (e) Issuer: Devon Financing Company, L.L.C. (f) Notes from such series will not be accepted for purchase by the Company.   The “Total Consideration” listed in the table above for each $1,000 principal amount of the 2018 Notes was determined at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 18, 2016. Only holders of the 2018 Notes who validly tendered and did not validly withdraw such 2018 Notes at or prior to the previously announced early tender date and time of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 17, 2016 (the “Early Tender Date”) are eligible to receive the Total Consideration for such 2018 Notes accepted for purchase. The Company will accept for purchase all of the 2018 Notes that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn. Since the Total Consideration payable with respect to such 2018 Notes will equal the Aggregate Maximum Repurchase Amount, none of the tendered Notes from any other series will be accepted for purchase pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offers. Holders will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on the 2018 Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase from the last interest payment date up to, but not including, the date the Company makes payment for such 2018 Notes, which date is anticipated to be August 19, 2016. The Maximum Tender Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on August 31, 2016, unless extended or earlier terminated. Because the Maximum Tender Offers have been fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Date, holders who tender Notes after the Early Tender Date will not have any of their Notes accepted for purchase. Any Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date, together with all Notes (other than the 2018 Notes) tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date, will be returned to the holders thereof as described in the Tender Offer Documents. Devon Energy will fund the Maximum Tender Offers with the net proceeds from previously completed asset sales and financing transactions. The Maximum Tender Offers are being made to reduce the Company’s outstanding debt, including the debt of its subsidiaries. After giving effect to the purchase by the Company of the Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase in the Maximum Tender Offers, as well as the Company’s previously consummated Any and All Offers, the Company estimates that its total cash interest expense will be reduced by approximately $54 million on an annualized basis.

The strain on UK pensions amid record low gilt yields is a sign that liability calculations should be rethought, according to JP Morgan Asset Management (JPMAM). The Bank of England's decision yesterday to cut interest rates to a new record low and expand its quantitative easing (QE) program pushed the yield on 10-year UK government bonds well below 1%. The assets were already trading at record low yields following the Brexit referendum on June 23. Index-linked gilts, key to liability-driven investment strategies, are trading at negative real yields. Pensions should be looking to other asset classes, in particular physical assets, to meet cashflow needs, argued Sorca Kelly-Scholte, head of pensions advisory and solutions at JPMAM. “Most investors consider losing money to be a key risk, but if pension funds continue to hedge liabilities even as yields turn negative, this effectively equates to losing money with security,” Kelly-Scholte said of index-linked bonds. “It is already happening in real terms. This fundamentally undermines the notion of pre-funding [liabilities], yet that is what we appear to be determined to do.” Kelly-Scholte advocated a broader approach to matching assets and new thinking for liability calculations—but stopped short of proposing a solution. “It throws into question whether we can find a reasonably transparent and objective means of valuing the liabilities that is more consistent with the broader opportunity set,” Kelly-Scholte said. “At the moment we are valuing liabilities based on nominal yields that are pricing in deflation, real yields that are pricing in inflation, and relying on assets that have already priced in growth to repair the resulting deficits.” QE is “unlikely to be unwound any time this decade,” according to Shajahan Alam, head of solution research at AXA Investment Managers' LDI team, exacerbating the shortage of government debt. “Those schemes looking for higher yields before doing some hedging may want to reconsider their [LDI] entry levels, if not abandon them altogether,” Alam added. US public pensions face similar problems: Liabilities are calculated based on return assumptions, which are in many cases far higher than most investors believe is achievable.

(Credit: Mario Tama/Getty Images) NEW YORK — Citigroup agreed to pay $7 billion to settle charges that it packaged bad mortgages during the run-up to the financial crisis. It includes $4 billion in penalties, $2.5 billion in mortgage modifications and other relief to homeowners, and $500 million going to a number of states and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The settlement means Citi will be able to avoid a civil suit by the Justice Department and mirrors similar agreements with JPMorgan Chase and other lenders in recent years. While Citi will take a $3.8 billion hit because of the deal, it can afford it. Last year, the bank earned $14 billion and had $34 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of March 31. Citi is due to report second-quarter earnings before the market opens Monday. What it means for homeowners Some homeowners with Citi mortgages could see the amount of their loans reduced, or could have their interest rates reduced. There will also be financing provided for affordable apartments, which could help to keep rents low. But details of that assistance is not yet known. Citi only agreed to provide that help by the end of 2018. Why Citi agreed to the deal. The bank has been under increasing pressure from regulators. The Federal Reserve gave Citigroup a poor grade in its stress test in March and blocked its plans to return money to shareholders through buying back shares and increasing the dividend. Citi is also under investigation for possible fraud and money laundering in its Mexican unit. All of that has been a drag on its stock. “We believe that this settlement is in the best interests of our shareholders, and allows us to move forward and to focus on the future, not the past,” said Citi CEO Michael Corbat. The amount is far more than the $363 million initial offer from Citi but less than the $12 billion initially sought by Justice, according to a source familiar with the deal. The breakthrough in the talks occurred after Justice Department lawyers notified the bank that they were prepared to file a lawsuit against the bank. Other bank settlements Citi’s agreement is about half the $13 billion JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay last November, and is also smaller than a $9.5 billion settlement that Bank of America reached in March with the regulator of government-controlled mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Bank of America remains in talks with the Justice Department on a separate mortgage settlement with that agency, but government lawyers and the bank remain billions of dollars apart.
