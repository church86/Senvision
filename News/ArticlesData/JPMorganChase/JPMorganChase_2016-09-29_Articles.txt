"The thing that keeps me up at night: I think there is more inflationary pressure in the system than a lot of people really appreciate," the global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management said in an interview with CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Friday. "I think the labor market is tight. I think wages are going to start picking up into the end of the year. And I think that there is a risk that next year we could find ourselves in an inflation environment — it's not hyperinflation — and the Fed finds itself a little bit behind the curve." The Federal Reserve passed on raising interest rates at its September meeting, but indicated it may hike before the end of the year. It hasn't increased rates since its first post-easing hike in December 2015. Colin Anderson | Getty Images Lebovitz said if the central bank tries to start catching up on rate increases at the same time that rising wages are putting downward pressure on corporate margins, it would be a "toxic cocktail" for the market. Inflationary pressure will also put the fixed income market at risk, Lebovitz said. He believes the bull market in fixed income has ended, but the bear market hasn't started yet. "Inflation is going to be the missing link there," Lebovitz noted. That said, there is a lot weighing on the overall market in the next three months, including the presidential election, the Fed meetings and a referendum in Italy. Therefore, Lebovitz advocates investors keep a balanced portfolio that includes stocks and bonds. "I wouldn't be abandoning fixed income yet. I would just be cognizant of some of the risks that are on the horizon."

The sector has taken a hit thanks to low interest rates, pressure from regulators and the scrutiny surrounding Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo. The KBW Nasdaq Bank index is off almost 3 percent in 2016, and financials as a whole are the second-worst performer on the S&P 500. "When I look at the markets globally, the one pocket of value that is left is financials," the global market strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management said in an interview with "Power Lunch." Lebovitz said that for those using valuation as a guide to investing, there are opportunities in the sector. He thinks U.S. names look more attractive than their European counterparts and noted that relative to 2008, globally banks are looking much healthier. Banks may become a dividend play, now that the Federal Reserve has given them clearance to start raising dividends, he added. "I think you might see financials start to catch a bid on the back of this low volatility, high dividend trade that's been in place for the better part of this year," Lebovitz said. However, he cautioned that sometimes stocks are cheap for a reason. "There is a lot of headline risk right now and I think the biggest thing investors need to be cognizant of is the ability for contagion, for sentiment to deteriorate around these names and really push the market lower," he said. — CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

 Deutsche Bank has a 'fundamental business problem' beyond its immediate crisis Bob Bryan Sep. 30, 2016, 10:05 AM 4,868 facebook linkedin twitter email print Eric Thayer/Reuters Deutsche Bank has had a wild two weeks. The German bank reportedly may be on the hook for $14 billion in fines for a settlement with US regulators over bad investment products from the financial crisis era. The steep fine has led to speculation over a government bailout and a possible decrease in exposure by hedge funds, signaling no confidence in the bank. Add all of this up, and Deutsche Bank now has its lowest share price ever and a US market cap smaller than Twitter. According to the Kian Abouhossein, a European bank analyst at JPMorgan, the problems at Deutsche Bank go much deeper than its current conundrum and don't appear to be going away anytime soon. Essentially, said Abouhossein, the bank has been unable to become leaner on the cost side — as many other banks have — at a time when many investment banks are bringing in lower revenues. Here's his assessment (emphasis added):  "Judging from its track record DB seems to have an inability to cut net costs and generate operating leverage independent of management in charge. Even under new CEO John Cryan, who we rate highly, DB has been unable to illustrate cost savings on a net basis so far. The inability to adjust the business model to a declining revenue environment is a major problem for an IB-geared bank and has led to the inability to generate retained earnings and hence capital generation in our view." Going deeper, Abouhossein noted that the tangible book value per share, essentially a measure of the real assets that the bank holds, has dropped 8% between 2012 and 2015 and the bank's average return on equity has been under 4% over the last six years. The firm's own goals for cost savings to counterbalance this declining profitability are also lackluster, according to the JPMorgan analyst. "DBK has reiterated its cost target of €26.5 billion for 2016 which is flat year over year despite clean revenues declining -13% year over year in our estimates," said the note to clients on Friday. "We see this as unambitious as DBK has €0.4 billion year over year decline in comp expense from deferred compensation amortization alone." Put another way, Deutsche has no real plans to decrease costs to offset lower profits even though there are clear ways to do so, which Abouhossein referred to as a "fundamental business problem" for the bank. "We think a bank with €26.5 billion of costs and 101,000 employees plus an estimated 30,000 consultants should be able to show more cost flexibility to generate book value growth," said Abouhossein. As for the current situation, Abouhossein said that he doesn't actually expect Deutsche to settle for the full $14 billion, but more likely will negotiate penalties in the $3 billion to $4 billion range, more in line with other settlements for allegations of similar nature. However, noted Abouhossein, the bank has $9.4 billion in money set aside for litigation and around $5.4 billion is needed for other settlements, so anything above $4 billion would require a capital raise from the bank, which would be dilutive to shares and send the stock lower. So there is some danger now, though not as great as recent price moves and commentary might imply. But without serious underlying changes to the bank, the same problems Deutsche currently faces will continue to bubble up.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    It’s been low-hanging fruit for decades: buy stocks when the leaves start to turn in the Northeast, and get ready to harvest gains. This year the crop looks spoiled. That’s going by forecasts from Wall Street strategists, whose trepidation about everything from election politics to interest rates and valuations has left them in an unusually bearish mood before this year’s holidays. Among 19 surveyed by Bloomberg, the average estimate calls for the S&P 500 Index to end 2016 at 2,171, about 0.6 percent above where the gauge traded by 10 a.m. in New York. Since 1970, the S&P 500’s best quarter has been the fourth, on average, with the trend particularly prominent during the bull market that began in 2009. The benchmark gauge has climbed an average 6.7 percent from Sept. 30 through the end of the year during the 7 1/2-year run, more than twice the increase of the next-best quarter. “You’ve got to have a reason to put money to work, and portfolio managers are sitting on what they have without taking direction,” said Tony Dwyer, co-head of U.S. equity research at Canaccord Genuity Inc. in New York. He has a target of 2,175 for the S&P 500. “You need to get changing fundamentals, some kind of oversold condition or further economic data to get anybody jumping out.” Seldom have strategists been less bullish than they are now. They’ve called for gains in the equity market 82 percent of the time during the past decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yet even amid an 18 percent recovery in the S&P 500 since its low on Feb. 11, strategists have held their target price largely unchanged. That doesn’t mean they’re bereft of optimism. A slew of upbeat revisions in recent weeks pushed their average estimate up from a low of 2,146 in August, and among the four that have made projections for next year, the average target calls for a 7.9 percent rally. Analysts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Bank of Montreal and HSBC Securities USA Inc. raised 2016 expectations in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s decision last week to keep rates lower for longer, but it hasn’t been enough to paint a rosier picture for the market’s last leg of the year. The more bullish outlooks by JPMorgan and HSBC for 2,100 and 2,000, respectively, still fall below the current level of the S&P 500. “We’re fundamentally in a very range-bound market and a little over our skis here, and that makes us vulnerable,” Ben Laidler, global equity strategist at HSBC, said in a phone interview. “Earnings remain very lackluster. All this money you’ve made this year is from multiple expansion, with the market getting more and more expensive.” Both Laidler and JPMorgan’s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of U.S. equity strategy and global quant research, cite elevated stock valuations as a reason for limiting gains through the end of the year. The gap between current and future earnings is the widest since the start of the bull market, with the S&P 500 trading at 20.3 times annual earnings, near the highest since the financial crisis. Corporate profits are expected to contract 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. “While we do not expect significant re-rating in market multiple from here given the aged business cycle and potentially rising rates, the case for considerable de-rating is also not likely given that rates are likely to remain low on an absolute basis,” Lakos-Bujas wrote in a Sept. 23 note to clients. And of course there is the U.S. presidential election. Volatility will likely increase in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 8 vote, according to Lakos-Bujas. Indeed, equity volatility in the November of presidential election years has historically been 22 percent above the average for all months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “The political calendar remains heavy around the world,” said Laidler. “That may be a potential catalyst, but my personal favorite is the business cycle. When I look at the leading indicators there’s nothing out there to tell me the business cycle is getting any better.”   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

Morgan Chase (JPMCC) Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2016-JP3 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates: --$45,932,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$97,274,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$16,726,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$300,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$342,359,000 class A-5 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$49,955,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$970,952,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$56,309,000a class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$118,706,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$56,309,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$50,222,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$105,009,000ab class X-C 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$54,787,000b class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$22,828,000b class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable; --$15,219,000b class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable. a) Notional amount and interest only. b) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A. Fitch does not rate the $47,177,696a class NR. The ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as of Sept. 7, 2016. The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the trust, primary assets of which are 52 loans secured by 62 commercial properties having an aggregate principal balance of $1,217,494,697 as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JP Morgan Chase Bank, National Association, Benefit Street Partners CRE Finance LLC, and Starwood Mortgage Funding VI LLC. Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, including site inspections on 89.4% of the properties by balance, asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool, and cash flow analysis of 81.4% of the pool. KEY RATING DRIVERS Lower Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are lower than those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. The pool's Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.25x and 101.2%, respectively, are better than the YTD 2016 average Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.18x and 106.5%, respectively. Excluding credit-opinion loans, the pool's Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV are 1.20x and 108.1%, respectively. Comparatively, the YTD 2016 average DSCR and LTV of Fitch-rated deals excluding credit-opinion and co-op loans is 1.14x and 110.2%. Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: The largest loan in the pool and the sixth largest loan in the pool, 9 West 57th Street (8.2% of the pool) and Westfield San Francisco Centre (4.9% of the pool), have investment-grade credit opinions. The 9 West 57th Street senior note contributed to the trust has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'AAAsf*' on a stand-alone basis. Westfield San Francisco Centre has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'Asf*' on a stand-alone basis. The two loans have a weighted average Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.60x and 55.5%, respectively. More Diverse Pool by Loan Concentration: The top 10 loans comprise 49.8% of the pool, as compared to the YTD 2016 average of 55.3%. The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) is 356, which is below the YTD 2016 average of 428. However, the resulting sponsor concentration index (SCI) delta compared to the LCI is 30.3%, which is above the YTD 2016 average delta of 16.8%. RATING SENSITIVITIES For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 7.9% below the most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMCC 2016-JP3 certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could occur. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could occur. The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities on page 13. USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 Fitch was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (Form 15E) as prepared by Ernst & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence described in Form 15E focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and it did not have an impact on Fitch's analysis or conclusions. Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

Homegrown banks grab more market share Market share among banks in Chicago is shifting in favor of homegrown lenders as acquisitions fuel their growth. Wintrust Financial's deposits grew 17 percent to $18.9 billion in the year ending June 30, further cementing the Rosemont-based bank's status as fifth-largest deposit holder in Chicago's fragmented banking market, according to data released today by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Market share rose to 4.9 percent from 4.2 percent in 2015 for Wintrust, which has been actively gobbling up small community banks in the market. Meanwhile, Chicago-based MB Financial would have leaped to No. 6 from No. 10 in 2015 if its acquisition of one of the largest privately held local banks, Schaumburg-based American Chartered Bank, were included. That deal closed in late August, too late to be included in the FDIC's annual deposit-share snapshot. But the two banks combined had $13.8 billion in deposits, good for a 3.5 percent share of the market. That's the first time since Bank One (now part of New York-based JPMorgan Chase) and LaSalle Bank (now part of Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America) dominated the local banking scene more than a decade ago that two Chicago-based commercial banks have been so high in the rankings. It demonstrates how locally based lenders have taken advantage of disruption from big-bank dealmaking and the ravages of the financial crisis to grab a bigger share of the market. The top ranks remain unchanged from a year ago. JPMorgan Chase remains the biggest local deposit holder, with $84.5 billion, or 21.7 percent, down slightly from a year before. BMO Harris Bank, the U.S. arm of Toronto-based BMO Financial Group, remains No. 2, with $52.5 billion, or 13.5 percent, up from $47.8 billion, or 12.4 percent, the year before. Bank of America stays No. 3, with $41.4 billion, or 10.6 percent—about the same as last year. The biggest decline among top 10 banks was posted by Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bank, which dropped from the sixth-largest retail bank in Chicago to eighth (or ninth, if MB Financial's American Chartered deal is taken into account). Fifth Third's Chicago-market deposits fell 13 percent to $12.9 billion from $14.9 billion in 2015. Its market share fell to 3.2 percent from 3.9 percent. Sometimes such big year-over-year fluctuations are due to shifting large corporate deposits among different markets for larger banks that have big presences elsewhere. But those changes usually can be seen in main-branch deposits, which often house those corporate deposits. And Fifth Third's deposits dropped even more dramatically—18 percent—after excluding main-branch totals at 222 S. Riverside Plaza, its headquarters here. A Fifth Third spokesman declined to comment today, saying the bank needed time to review the data. Rounding out the rest of the top 10 were Chicago-based Northern Trust at No. 4, Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank at No. 7, Chicago-based PrivateBank & Trust at No. 8 and Citibank at No. 10. Banks continued to prune their branch networks as more customers conduct routine transactions online. The total number of branches in the Chicago metropolitan statistical area fell 4 percent to 2,857 as of June 30, 2015. Meanwhile, total deposits in the market rose just 1 percent to $389 billion from $384 billion, a smaller increase than in recent years, signaling that consumers and businesses aren't hoarding cash as much and are investing more aggressively than in previous years.

 Deutsche Bank has a 'fundamental business problem' beyond its immediate crisis Bob Bryan Sep. 30, 2016, 10:05 AM 4,868 facebook linkedin twitter email print Eric Thayer/Reuters Deutsche Bank has had a wild two weeks. The German bank reportedly may be on the hook for $14 billion in fines for a settlement with US regulators over bad investment products from the financial crisis era. The steep fine has led to speculation over a government bailout and a possible decrease in exposure by hedge funds, signaling no confidence in the bank. Add all of this up, and Deutsche Bank now has its lowest share price ever and a US market cap smaller than Twitter. According to the Kian Abouhossein, a European bank analyst at JPMorgan, the problems at Deutsche Bank go much deeper than its current conundrum and don't appear to be going away anytime soon. Essentially, said Abouhossein, the bank has been unable to become leaner on the cost side — as many other banks have — at a time when many investment banks are bringing in lower revenues. Here's his assessment (emphasis added):  "Judging from its track record DB seems to have an inability to cut net costs and generate operating leverage independent of management in charge. Even under new CEO John Cryan, who we rate highly, DB has been unable to illustrate cost savings on a net basis so far. The inability to adjust the business model to a declining revenue environment is a major problem for an IB-geared bank and has led to the inability to generate retained earnings and hence capital generation in our view." Going deeper, Abouhossein noted that the tangible book value per share, essentially a measure of the real assets that the bank holds, has dropped 8% between 2012 and 2015 and the bank's average return on equity has been under 4% over the last six years. The firm's own goals for cost savings to counterbalance this declining profitability are also lackluster, according to the JPMorgan analyst. "DBK has reiterated its cost target of €26.5 billion for 2016 which is flat year over year despite clean revenues declining -13% year over year in our estimates," said the note to clients on Friday. "We see this as unambitious as DBK has €0.4 billion year over year decline in comp expense from deferred compensation amortization alone." Put another way, Deutsche has no real plans to decrease costs to offset lower profits even though there are clear ways to do so, which Abouhossein referred to as a "fundamental business problem" for the bank. "We think a bank with €26.5 billion of costs and 101,000 employees plus an estimated 30,000 consultants should be able to show more cost flexibility to generate book value growth," said Abouhossein. As for the current situation, Abouhossein said that he doesn't actually expect Deutsche to settle for the full $14 billion, but more likely will negotiate penalties in the $3 billion to $4 billion range, more in line with other settlements for allegations of similar nature. However, noted Abouhossein, the bank has $9.4 billion in money set aside for litigation and around $5.4 billion is needed for other settlements, so anything above $4 billion would require a capital raise from the bank, which would be dilutive to shares and send the stock lower. So there is some danger now, though not as great as recent price moves and commentary might imply. But without serious underlying changes to the bank, the same problems Deutsche currently faces will continue to bubble up.

This year the crop looks spoiled. That's going by forecasts from Wall Street strategists, whose trepidation about everything from election politics to interest rates and valuations has left them in an unusually bearish mood before this year's holidays. Among 19 surveyed by Bloomberg, the average estimate calls for the S&P 500 Index to end 2016 at 2,171, about 1 percent below where the gauge closed on Thursday. Since 1970, the S&P 500's best quarter has been the fourth, on average, with the trend particularly prominent during the bull market that began in 2009. The benchmark gauge has climbed an average 6.7 percent from Sept. 30 through the end of the year during the 7 [1/2]-year run, more than twice the increase of the next-best quarter. "You've got to have a reason to put money to work, and portfolio managers are sitting on what they have without taking direction," said Tony Dwyer, co-head of U.S. equity research at Canaccord Genuity Inc. in New York. He has a target of 2,175 for the S&P 500. "You need to get changing fundamentals, some kind of oversold condition or further economic data to get anybody jumping out." Seldom have strategists been less bullish than they are now. They've called for gains in the equity market 82 percent of the time during the past decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yet even amid an 18 percent recovery in the S&P 500 since its low on Feb. 11, strategists have held their target price largely unchanged. That doesn't mean they're bereft of optimism. A slew of upbeat revisions in recent weeks pushed their average estimate up from a low of 2,146 in August, and among the four that have made projections for next year, the average target calls for an 8.2 percent rally. Analysts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Bank of Montreal and HSBC Securities USA Inc. raised 2016 expectations in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision last week to keep rates lower for longer, but it hasn't been enough to paint a rosier picture for the market's last leg of the year. The more bullish outlooks by JPMorgan and HSBC for 2,100 and 2,000, respectively, still fall below the current level of the S&P 500. "We're fundamentally in a very range-bound market and a little over our skis here, and that makes us vulnerable," Ben Laidler, global equity strategist at HSBC, said in a phone interview. "Earnings remain very lackluster. All this money you've made this year is from multiple expansion, with the market getting more and more expensive." Both Laidler and JPMorgan's Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of U.S. equity strategy and global quant research, cite elevated stock valuations as a reason for limiting gains through the end of the year. The gap between current and future earnings is the widest since the start of the bull market, with the S&P 500 trading at 20.3 times annual earnings, near the highest since the financial crisis. Corporate profits are expected to contract 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. "While we do not expect significant re-rating in market multiple from here given the aged business cycle and potentially rising rates, the case for considerable de-rating is also not likely given that rates are likely to remain low on an absolute basis," Lakos-Bujas wrote in a Sept. 23 note to clients. And of course there is the U.S. presidential election. Volatility will likely increase in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 8 vote, according to Lakos-Bujas. Indeed, equity volatility in the November of presidential election years has historically been 22 percent above the average for all months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. "The political calendar remains heavy around the world," said Laidler. "That may be a potential catalyst, but my personal favorite is the business cycle. When I look at the leading indicators there's nothing out there to tell me the business cycle is getting any better."     Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed.

At 10.21am in Johannesburg, the rand dropped 0.4 percent to 13.9520 per dollar, trimming its quarterly and monthly gain to 5.2 percent. The government’s 10-year rand-denominated bond weakened for a third day, with yields climbing six basis points to 8.73 percent, the highest on a closing basis since September 9. Emerging-market assets declined amid anxiety over the wider implications of Deutsche Bank AG’s capital troubles. “Some rand weakness is justified given the Deutsche Bank-inspired global risk-off environment,” John Cairns, strategist at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in a note. “Emerging markets might have been impacted by the re-weighting in the JPMorgan Global Bond Index. As we understand it, South Africa’s weight will drop 0.45 basis point to 9.7 percent today, implying around $1 billion in outflows.” About 10 hedge funds that do business with Deutsche Bank have reduced their financial exposure to Germany’s largest lender, Bloomberg News reported. The dollar was boosted on Thursday by economic data that strengthened the case for the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, trimming appetite for riskier assets. The rand is still set to be the biggest gainer in September among more than 140 world currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The rand is also outperforming global currencies against the euro and the pound. Foreigners were were net sellers of R1.1 billion ($79 million) of South African bonds on Thursday and sold a net R6.8 billion of shares, offloading local stocks for an eighth day, data from the Johannesburg stock exchange shows.

This year the crop looks spoiled. That’s going by forecasts from Wall Street strategists, whose trepidation about everything from election politics to interest rates and valuations has left them in an unusually bearish mood before this year’s holidays. Among 19 surveyed by Bloomberg, the average estimate calls for the S&P 500 Index to end 2016 at 2,171, about 0.6 percent above where the gauge traded by 10 a.m. in New York. Since 1970, the S&P 500’s best quarter has been the fourth, on average, with the trend particularly prominent during the bull market that began in 2009. The benchmark gauge has climbed an average 6.7 percent from Sept. 30 through the end of the year during the 7 1/2-year run, more than twice the increase of the next-best quarter. “You’ve got to have a reason to put money to work, and portfolio managers are sitting on what they have without taking direction,” said Tony Dwyer, co-head of U.S. equity research at Canaccord Genuity Inc. in New York. He has a target of 2,175 for the S&P 500. “You need to get changing fundamentals, some kind of oversold condition or further economic data to get anybody jumping out.” Seldom have strategists been less bullish than they are now. They’ve called for gains in the equity market 82 percent of the time during the past decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yet even amid an 18 percent recovery in the S&P 500 since its low on Feb. 11, strategists have held their target price largely unchanged. That doesn’t mean they’re bereft of optimism. A slew of upbeat revisions in recent weeks pushed their average estimate up from a low of 2,146 in August, and among the four that have made projections for next year, the average target calls for a 7.9 percent rally. Analysts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Bank of Montreal and HSBC Securities USA Inc. raised 2016 expectations in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s decision last week to keep rates lower for longer, but it hasn’t been enough to paint a rosier picture for the market’s last leg of the year. The more bullish outlooks by JPMorgan and HSBC for 2,100 and 2,000, respectively, still fall below the current level of the S&P 500. “We’re fundamentally in a very range-bound market and a little over our skis here, and that makes us vulnerable,” Ben Laidler, global equity strategist at HSBC, said in a phone interview. “Earnings remain very lackluster. All this money you’ve made this year is from multiple expansion, with the market getting more and more expensive.” Both Laidler and JPMorgan’s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of U.S. equity strategy and global quant research, cite elevated stock valuations as a reason for limiting gains through the end of the year. The gap between current and future earnings is the widest since the start of the bull market, with the S&P 500 trading at 20.3 times annual earnings, near the highest since the financial crisis. Corporate profits are expected to contract 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. “While we do not expect significant re-rating in market multiple from here given the aged business cycle and potentially rising rates, the case for considerable de-rating is also not likely given that rates are likely to remain low on an absolute basis,” Lakos-Bujas wrote in a Sept. 23 note to clients. And of course there is the U.S. presidential election. Volatility will likely increase in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 8 vote, according to Lakos-Bujas. Indeed, equity volatility in the November of presidential election years has historically been 22 percent above the average for all months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “The political calendar remains heavy around the world,” said Laidler. “That may be a potential catalyst, but my personal favorite is the business cycle. When I look at the leading indicators there’s nothing out there to tell me the business cycle is getting any better.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The company will begin to move employees out of the Chase Commerce Solutions office, formerly known as Paymentech Solutions, on Northeastern Boulevard in 2018, and the process could take up to several years, said company spokeswoman Mary Jane Rogers. She called the move "a long-term strategic decision" to consolidate operations to 19 "core, strategic" global hubs. The positions currently housed at the Salem site will be moved to Dallas; Tempe, Arizona; Tampa, Florida; and Wilmington, Delaware.  "After much deliberation and discussion and lots of people involved in orchestrating a decision, a really difficult decision was made to exit the Salem, New Hampshire site," Rogers said. "They're important jobs that will just go to other locations. And they're also complex jobs in many respects, and so moving them will not be as easy as perhaps other kinds of roles would be." The company has been in operation in Salem since 1986; it was acquired by JPMorgan Chase in the 1990s. Town Manager Leon Goodwin said the departure of the business from town is a concern for the community. "Frankly, this is the kind of thing we were trying to avoid when we adopted the innovation district last year, which was our recognition that businesses are consolidating (and) they are having difficulty attracting the type of employees they need," Goodwin said. Salem established the Business Innovation Overlay District in 2016, which allows for a mix of business, commercial, office, residential, institutional and entertainment uses in a campus setting with flexibility — granted through conditional use permits from the Planning Board — from land-use regulations governing density, setbacks, lot sizes, parking requirements and building heights. The district extends from the commercial-industrial district west of Interstate 93 in Salem and between I-93 and North and South Policy streets. The properties must have a minimum of 10 acres. The purpose of creating the district was to attract young employees to town and to create a space where people would want to live and work. "That's what we were trying to avoid, is losing out to parts of the country that have that already," Goodwin said Thursday. Commerce Solutions' chief executive announced the closure to employees at the site in a series of town halls Wednesday, Rogers said. "Once the business decision was made, we wanted to let employees know so they could make plans for themselves and their families," Rogers said. "We don't know the exact timing but we do know the jobs will begin to move in 2018 and it could take several years." The company will work with employees on an individual basis to determine where they will relocate, if they choose to. For those who choose to leave their position, Chase will offer career counseling and other services like resume workshops, as well as a severance package, Rogers said. "For those people who know moving is not an option, we'll provide careering counseling...to support successful transition, whether it's within the company or outside," Rogers said. "It's such an individual, personal decision for employees and their families." Goodwin said he plans to notify the state to "make sure those people" affected "are taken care of." "That's a problem for economic development going forward," Goodwin said of losing businesses to communities with more amenities than Salem, "and I think from my perspective this is a challenge — this is something we might see continue into the future, so we need to do all we can to stem that tide."

Women in Banking: Power, Empathy, and Courage By Tanaya Macheel September 29, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related Q&A with Sallie Krawcheck The Circuit: The 'Daughters of Banking' Community Banker of the Year: Heritage Oaks' Simone Lagomarsino What Bankers Want (and Don't Want) from President Trump 'That's Just Really, Really Bad': Bank CEOs React to Wells Scandal Why Media Representation Matters for Women in Banking Our annual rankings are out! Don't miss this year's lists of the Most Powerful Women in Banking, the Women to Watch and the Most Powerful Women in Finance. BNY Mellon's Karen Peetz was named the Most Powerful Woman in Banking this year, while KeyCorp's Beth Mooney has graduated to Hall of Fame status. JPMorgan Chase's Mary Callahan Erdoes is the Most Powerful Woman in Finance for the fourth year in a row. Bank of the West's Nandita Bakhshi tops the Women to Watch list. She left TD Bank earlier this year to become chief executive of Bank of the West, becoming the fourth woman to head a top-40 bank. The other three are Mooney, Ally Bank's Diane Morais and CIT's Ellen Alemany, who came out of retirement almost a year ago to lead CIT Group and is now No. 2 on the Watch list. Mary Mack sits at No. 3 with a rocky road ahead of her, as she works to rebuild trust with Wells Fargo customers following Wellsgate. There are some newcomers to the honoree lists to read about too, including Mary Ann Scully of Howard Bank in Ellicott City, Md., Teresa Tanner of Fifth Third Bancorp, Rosilyn Houston of BBVA Compass, Karen Glenn of First United Bank and Trust Co. in Kentucky and Claudine Gallagher of BNP Paribas. Hall of Fame American Banker inducted Beth Mooney, chief executive of KeyCorp, into its newly created Hall of Fame for three-peat winners of the Most Powerful Woman In Banking award. Under Mooney's leadership female representation among corporate officers has grown to 25%; Key has one of the most diverse boards of directors in the industry. Mooney's stature was highlighted by Key's $4.1 billion purchase of First Niagara, the industry's second-largest acquisition by deal value since the financial crisis and throughout which the company remained committed to low- and middle-income borrowers and expanding community development lending by $4.5 billion. Mooney likes the idea of the Hall of Fame because it meshes with her philosophy of helping to make way for and elevate future female leaders, but her trailblazing days aren't over. "American Banker names a most powerful banker every year, so in my mind, I'm not out of your game yet," she said. "You should not think of me just as a woman banker. I'm a CEO in our industry whose bank is doing lots of interesting things." Profiles in Courage Empathy Matters: BBVA Compass' chief talent and culture officer, Rosilyn Houston, has spent most of her career in banking. But for a short while in 2004, she left for a brief stint at a Christian organization in Dallas, where she was general manager — a big job in which she oversaw 200 employees. That's when her almost-2-year-old son was diagnosed with leukemia. Following his illness, Houston returned to banking, joining what is now BBVA Compass as a senior vice president, accepting challenge after challenge until she got to her role today. She's responsible not for overseeing typical HR functions — like payroll and benefits — but also transforming the bank's culture. "This is a journey," Houston said. "We started a real intense focus on cultural transformation at the end of last year and we know it's going to take three to five years to get to where we are comfortable." Her empathy is essential to that job, and she's keenly aware that many employees come to work every day with their own personal struggles. Having suffered "a number of life blows" — she battled cancer herself and lost her mother to the illness — "that could have knocked me off course." Creating a workplace that is viewed as compassionate is one of her top priorities. "Part of being an effective leader is being sensitive to what individuals go through day in and day out, not only in the job, but in life." Fear of the Unknown: Some bankers are proud of making it through the financial crisis. Imagine doing that while also contending with a personal crisis. When Karen Glenn, was chief financial officer of First United Bank and Trust in Madisonville, Ky., her 5-year-old son had battled non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and she often worked from his hospital room — just as she had pulled through a separate health crisis, with his twin brother. "The way I looked at it was that my boys needed me to do this," Glenn said of her decision to keep working through Ethan's treatments, instead of taking her extended leave. "This was our life, our livelihood. I had to make it work." That was in late 2009. Six months after her son completed his cancer treatments, she was promoted to president and chief executive of First United. She hesitated at first to accept the job — at the time she lived an hour away from the bank's headquarters and the job required her to move. But since becoming CEO she has substantially improved the bank's performance, posting a record profit last year, and spearheaded its first acquisition. "I came very close to saying 'no' because of the fear of the unknown," Glenn said. It was going to change my life so much." However, "not having a career has never been an option for me," she said. Today the boys are in middle school and thriving. The Ripple Effect: JPMorgan Chase's new general counsel, Stacey Friedman, is a tough financial litigator, the only woman to serve as the general counsel of a systemically important U.S. bank and a fighter for social justice. When she became a partner at the high-powered Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, she opted to take on a more visible role in the push for LGBT rights. At that time, she was one of 30 women, out of 172 partners, and the first to be openly gay. "You realize that it has a ripple effect," she said. (Beth Mooney said something similar at the Most Powerful Women in Banking ceremony last year.) "If people are going to laud you and notice you for it, then you should make sure you use that as a platform for change." Friedman has taken on high-profile pro bono cases in recent years, including one that successfully struck down a ban on gay adoption in Arkansas. Earlier this year, she expanded the pro bono program at JPMorgan, implementing a three- to six-month paid fellowship for attorneys to work on a legal service project. "It's undeniable that all of the things that make all of us up are obstacles or benefits along the way, and I wouldn't look at that fact of my life and assume it was never an obstacle — of course it was," Friedman said of her sexual orientation and gender. And although she has always been surrounded by supportive colleagues, she said, "that isn't the case in every corner of every financial institution or every company." The Power of Storytelling: When it comes to supporting women in banking, Barclays' vice chairman of investment banking, Barbara Byrne, wants to do more than the usual basics (like mentoring). Over the past year she has exercised her storytelling power as a producer on indie film "Equity," a Wall Street thriller that aims to flip viewers' expectations about gender and finance on their heads. The film has all female lead characters, directors, producers and financial backers. One reason "Equity" is so effective is it doesn't sugarcoat the way women treat each other; it puts women in the same cutthroat roles typically reserved for men. "This is not a sisterhood movie," she said. Known today for her outspoken style, she was shy when she took her first job at Lehman Brothers in her 20s, calling herself better suited for a library than an investment bank. "I am a forceful personality, but I did not spring from the womb that way," she said. Harvey Krueger, a longtime executive at Lehman, brought her out of her shell. She recalls a time she prepared a presentation for him to give to the board of a major company. He asked her if she thought he was capable of giving it. She said yes. "So he said, 'Well, why don't you get up there and just pretend you're me?'" Byrne said. She followed that advice over the next few years, developed her own sense of confidence and characteristic style in the process, and now passes the advice on to her employees. Role Call Bank of New York Mellon's president Peetz will retire at the end of the year. She announced her retirement the same day she was honored as American Banker's Most Powerful Woman in Banking for 2016. Peetz was also ranked No. 1 in 2011 and has been ranked among the top five in each of the last eight years. JPMorgan Chase's Thasunda Duckett has been named chief executive officer of consumer banking, as part of one of the bank's periodic management reshufflings. Duckett, one of our 25 Women to Watch this year and last, was previously CEO of the bank's auto finance arm.

Here's how much the top Wall Street banks have earned in fees this year Portia Crowe Sep. 26, 2016, 9:16 AM 17,733 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. JPMorgan has pulled in more fees than any other investment bank this year.Reuters JPMorgan is leading the pack when it comes to Wall Street dealmaking revenues, according to Dealogic's preliminary league tables for the first nine months of the year.  Altogether, global investment banking revenue was down 14% from the same period last year. That is improvement on the first half, where revenues came in 16% lower than the previous years. League tables are a contentious subject on Wall Street. Banks use them when pitching for new business, and a good ranking means serious bragging rights. But the league table-data can also be sliced up to make a bank's performance look better (by narrowing the field very narrowly, for example).   Though they're based on estimates, these tables are the broadest possible and a closely-watched indicator of who is up and who is down.  Here's how the banks stacked up this time around. View As: One Page Slides JPMorgan ranked first for overall investment banking revenues Dealogic JPMorgan has a 8.1% market share and $4.1 billion in total revenues for the year to September 26. It was followed by rival Goldman Sachs, with $3.4 billion and a 6.8% share. Bank of America was in third place, with $3.2 billion. Global investment banking revenue was $50.7 billion for the first nine months of 2015, which was down 14% compared to the same period last year. JPMorgan also ranked first for revenue in debt capital markets Dealogic JPMorgan has made $1.1 billion in revenue in debt capital markets, giving it an 6.9% share. Bank of America followed, with $1.1 billion in fees, and Citi raked in $923 million to place third. Global DCM volumes hit the $5 trillion earlier this month, putting 2016 on track to beat the 2006 full year record high of $6.62 trillion. And in equity capital markets Dealogic JPMorgan had a 8% share in equity capital markets, followed by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Global equity capital markets volumes, at $512.7 billion, was the lowest since 2012.  Goldman Sachs was the winner for M&A revenues Dealogic Goldman Sachs is well ahead of its rivals in M&A with $1.8 billion in revenues, versus JPMorgan's $1.5 billion and Morgan Stanley's $1.3 billion. Global M&A stands $2.5 trillion, down 24% from the same period a year ago.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch scored first place in syndicated loans. Dealogic Bank of America Merrill Lynch pulled in $798 million for arranging syndicated loan deals, versus JPMorgan's $745 million and Credit Suisse's $548 million.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Share Written by Victoria Finkle September 29, 2016 Wells Fargo was supposed to be the nice bank. For years, it’s leaned into a folksy image, presenting itself as a beacon of stability—disinclined to make waves—that avoided the worst of the behaviors that led to the mortgage meltdown. One fawning profile from early 2015 briefly compared the bank’s chief executive, John Stumpf, to Jimmy Stewart, who famously played hometown banker George Bailey in It’s a Wonderful Life. No one will be making that analogy again anytime soon. The news that Wells Fargo employees have for years been opening fake accounts on behalf of customers in order to inflate sales figures has provoked widespread fury. Thousands of employees have been fired for opening more than two million dubious accounts. The bank will also claw back millions of dollars already paid out to Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt, the bank’s former head of retail banking. At last week’s hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, US senator Elizabeth Warren urged Stumpf to resign. Even HBO talk-show host John Oliver is wading into the fray. All of which raises the question: With scandal enveloping the last plausible “good” big bank, will Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and the other industry titans soon face another public reckoning?  Will Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and the other industry titans soon face another public reckoning? It’s easy to understand why the Wells Fargo fiasco has attracted so much public outcry. Compared to the financial crimes that have grabbed headlines over the past several years, the wrongdoing here is pretty straightforward. This isn’t a case of manipulating complicated interest rates, like the Libor issue, or even a problem of a multi-billion-dollar investment gone wrong, as seen in the London Whale debacle. There’s no talk of collateralized debt obligations or the packaging of mortgage-backed securities. Instead, Wells Fargo’s high-pressure sales quotas sent low-paid customer reps scrambling to meet unachievable growth goals. You don’t need training in finance or even a thousand-word “explainer” to understand how the incentives might go sideways on that one. The scandal doesn’t necessarily disabuse Wells Fargo of its Main Street image. The bank does concentrate most of its activity on consumer accounts, mortgages, commercial lending, and the like. But the fake-accounts scheme does show that a focus on bread-and-butter banking alone may not be enough to stem the tide of bad behavior. “If there was any perception before that these guys were flying above the fray, I think that’s been shattered,” said Jason Ware, chief investment officer and chief economist at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City, Utah. To be fair, there had been some troubling signs that Wells wasn’t quite living up to the down-home, aw-shucks image it sought to portray. But investors have historically flocked to the bank due to its reputation and strong earnings. The firm grew to be the world’s largest in terms of market capitalization, worth more than $300 billion at one time. Since news of the problematic accounts broke, stock prices have fallen. Stumpf’s decision to give up $41 million in unvested stock looks unlikely to appease lawmakers. There also seems to be a growing consensus among politicians and regulators that, much as big banks may try to differentiate among themselves, they all require tough oversight and a heavy dose of skepticism.  There’s an adage on the left, popularized by Warren, that “banking should be boring.” “There’s no such thing as a ‘good’ big bank after the financial crisis,” said Robert Jackson Jr., a professor of law at Columbia University. “What we have are big banks that deserve a significant amount of scrutiny in the way that they are run, and Wells Fargo, Citibank, nobody should expect to be exempted from this.” There’s an adage on the left, popularized by Warren, that “banking should be boring.” But even the self-proclaimed boring bank has shown that it will look the other way to meet the go-go expectations of the market. If boring banking isn’t enough to quash wrongdoing, expect lawmakers to demand alternatives—ones that the big banks almost certainly won’t like any better. In a campaign season where both political parties have called for breaking up the big banks, Wells Fargo’s latest misstep is bad for all of the largest institutions. Regulators have already said they’re investigating whether other banks have problems with bogus accounts. And the scandal will undoubtedly spur fresh debates in Washington about the problem of banks that are “too big to manage.” All this may well embolden big bank critics who have called for chopping them up altogether. Whether or not those threats ever come to fruition, the sloppy behavior exhibited by Wells managers has brought banking under even more political fire. For an industry in desperate need of a new public narrative, the downfall of the last “good” big bank simply underscores the stickiness of the same old story.

Annie Korkki, 37, who works for JP Morgan Chase in Denver, and Robin Korkki, 42, a trader from Chicago, reportedly died last Thursday. Facebook 6 Annie (left) and Robin (right) have been found dead at their luxury Seychelles villa after drinking throughout the day on Wednesday Facebook 6 Heartbroken relatives of the girls, seen above on their trip, is searching for answers into what led to their sudden deaths Facebook Maia Luxury Resort & Spa 6 The sisters were found dead inside their luxury resort villa at the Maia Luxury Resort and Spa They were found dead inside their luxury resort villa at the Maia Luxury Resort and Spa a week into their vacation on the popular holiday island. The sisters, who had been on holiday on the tropical island off the coast of Africa since September 15, were found unresponsive and were later pronounced dead at the scene by a doctor. A preliminary examination conducted by police indicated there were no signs of violence or aggression on the women’s bodies, The Seychelles Nation reported. The women had been drinking throughout the day on Wednesday and were helped to their room by resort staff around 8.15pm that night, it’s reported. It was the last time they were seen alive.

Authorities in Seychelles were called to the scene after a butler assigned to the villa arrived to find the sisters unresponsive on the same bed. There was no disturbance in the room, police said. While their bodies did not show any signs of trauma, certain medications were confiscated from the room by police as part of their investigation, authorities said. The Korkki sisters’ stay at the resort was originally set to end on September 22, but they had extended it to September 24. Both sisters had shared photos of their stay in Seychelles on Facebook, with many showing the resort, where an ocean panoramic villa costs upwards of £1,300 per night. In one photo on September 17 appearing to show the beautiful view from their villa, Annie wrote in the comment section calling it ‘the best place ever’. In another, Annie said their trip was ‘indescribable.’ Facebook 6 Annie (above) and her sister had shared photos of their stay in Seychelles on Facebook Facebook Maia Luxury Resort & Spa 6 ‘The best place ever’ ..the Seychelles is located more than 900 miles off Africa’s east coast Facebook 6 Annie (above) and her sister were both described as adventurous women Annie, who lived in Denver, worked at JP Morgan Chase, according to her Facebook page. Her sister Robin lived in Chicago and is the Head of FX and Metals at Allston Trading. Both are described as healthy women and experienced travelers. “The family is in shock,” brother Chris told KMSP. “Everyone is trying to understand and come to terms with what happened.” Their mother Sue and brother Mike, who both live in Colorado, are currently in Seychelles, pressing local and US officials for answers, The Star-Tribune reported. They are also making arrangements to bring the women back home, Chris told the newspaper. He also noted that at this time, his family has limited information on what led to his sisters’ deaths. “At this point, the only details we know are the articles flying around online,” he said. “My mom has been talking with people from the U.S. Embassy. I don’t think they’ve provided her with any information.” The sisters’ bodies are in a mortuary as authorities await autopsy results to determine the cause of death. Local police have been working with the American embassy in Mauritius during their investigation, according to The Seychelles Nation. The Seychelles is located more than 900 miles off Africa’s east coast and is a tourist destination with its beaches, natural reserves, warm weather and coral reefs. The Maia Luxury Resort and Spa is a twelve-acre property on the secluded Anse Louis located on the island of Mahe. The five-star hotel’s 30 suites, ten ocean-front villas and 20 panoramic villas, each offers guests private pools, a 24-hour personal butler and views of the Indian Ocean, according to its website.

The Maximum Tender Offer was made pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase dated September 19, 2016 (the “Offer to Purchase”). As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 30, 2016 (the "Early Tender Date"), as reported by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the tender and information agent for the Maximum Tender Offer, the principal amounts of the Notes listed in the table below had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn.             Security (CUSIP No.) Initial Principal Amount Acceptance Priority Level Principal Amount Tendered 7.875% Notes due October 1, 2029 (023551AF1) $700,000,000 1 $196,004,000 7.300% Notes due August 15, 2031 (023551AJ3) $750,000,000 2 $185,455,000 7.125% Notes due March 15, 2033 (023551AM6) $600,000,000 3 $117,498,000   The applicable total consideration for the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offer will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 3, 2016.

The Maximum Tender Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on October 17, 2016, unless extended or earlier terminated.

Accordingly, previously tendered Notes and Notes tendered after the Withdrawal Deadline may not be withdrawn, subject to applicable law. Hess plans to fund the Maximum Tender Offer with part of the proceeds from the sale of its 4.30% Notes due 2027 and its 5.80% Notes due 2047, which was completed on September 28, 2016. Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co.

U.S. stocks are falling Monday morning and following Asian and European indexes lower. (AP Photo/Richard US stocks are bouncing back Friday morning after a steep loss late the previous day. Strong earnings from Costco are giving consumer stocks a lift. Banks, too, are recovering from a sharp drop as Deutsche Bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Energy companies are also trading higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 117 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 18,260 as of 10:10 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 10 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,161. The Nasdaq composite rose 19 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 5,288. BANKS BOUNCE BACK: Banks made some of the largest gains. The stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon as investors again worried about the health of Deutsche Bank, the largest lender in Germany, following reports that some hedge funds are moving their business out of the bank. Late Thursday CEO John Cryan tried to calm investors. In a letter to Deutsche Bank employees, he said the bank has $241 billion in reserves and is meeting its capital requirements. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed stock rose 71 cents, or 6.2 per cent, to $12.20. Its stock has been pummeled this year and is trading at all-time lows. Among US banks, JPMorgan Chase added 68 cents, or 1 per cent, to $66.33 and Citigroup gained 61 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $46.41. OIL: Benchmark US crude rose 7 cents to $47.90 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international benchmark, remained at $49.81 a barrel in London. Oil prices have surged this week after the nations of Opec, which collectively produce more than third of the world's oil, agreed to a small cut in production in a surprise decision. While the gains for oil prices have slowed, investors were still optimistic that energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Hess jumped 87 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to $53.02 and Spectra Energy rose 67 cents, or 1.6 per cent, to $42.99. Continued below.

BIG SALE: Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.65, or 3.8 per cent, to $153.14 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.37, or 1.6 per cent, to $89.60 and Wal-Mart rose $1.29, or 1.8 per cent, to $72.02. CHIPPING IN: Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors continued to climb on reports the companies might combine. The Wall Street Journal said Qualcomm is in talks to buy its rival, and NXP gained $6.37, or 6.6 per cent, to $102.49 and Qualcomm picked up $1.95, or 2.9 per cent, to $69.40.That followed a bigger move a day ago. COGNIZANT CEO: Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the technology consulting company said President Gordon Coburn resigned. It named Rajeev Mahta, the former head of its IT Services business, as its new president. The stock fell $7.47, or 13.6 per cent, to $47.53. More Economy The Economy Hub Business Videos Business Toolbox More Liam Dann TECH TRIUMPHANT: Major stock indexes set records this quarter, and tech stocks were by far the biggest reason. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 per cent over the last three months, its best result since the end of 2013. Apple surged 18 per cent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Apple is the most valuable publicly-traded company in the world. The second-largest tech company, Microsoft, is up 12 per cent this quarter and Google parent Alphabet leaped 14 per cent. BONDS: Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 1.56 per cent. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 101.21 yen from 101.07 yen. The euro remained at $1.1216. OVERSEAS: Britain's FTSE 100 fell 1.1 per cent while France's CAC 40 sank 1.7 per cent and Germany's DAX lost 1.6 per cent. Japan's Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 per cent and South Korea's Kospi fell 1.2 per cent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index sank 1.9 per cent.

The Maximum Tender Offer was made pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase dated September 19, 2016 (the "Offer to Purchase"). As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 30, 2016 (the "Early Tender Date"), as reported by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the tender and information agent for the Maximum Tender Offer, the principal amounts of the Notes listed in the table below had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn. Security (CUSIP No.) Initial Principal Amount Acceptance Priority Level Principal Amount Tendered 7.875% Notes due October 1, 2029 (023551AF1) $700,000,000 1 $196,004,000 7.300% Notes due August 15, 2031 (023551AJ3) $750,000,000 2 $185,455,000 7.125% Notes due March 15, 2033 (023551AM6) $600,000,000 3 $117,498,000 The applicable total consideration for the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offer will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 3, 2016. Holders of such Notes will be eligible to receive the total consideration for any such Notes, including the applicable early tender payment specified in the Offer to Purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, October 4, 2016, the expected settlement date of the Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date. The Maximum Tender Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on October 17, 2016, unless extended or earlier terminated. Because the Maximum Tender Offer has been fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Date, holders who tender Notes after the Early Tender Date will not have any of their Notes accepted for purchase. Any Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date, together with any Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date but not accepted for purchase by Hess, will be returned to the holders thereof as described in the Offer to Purchase. The withdrawal deadline for the Maximum Tender Offer was 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 30, 2016 (the "Withdrawal Deadline") and has not been extended. Accordingly, previously tendered Notes and Notes tendered after the Withdrawal Deadline may not be withdrawn, subject to applicable law. Hess plans to fund the Maximum Tender Offer with part of the proceeds from the sale of its 4.30% Notes due 2027 and its 5.80% Notes due 2047, which was completed on September 28, 2016. Goldman, Sachs Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley Co. LLC are acting as lead dealer managers for the Maximum Tender Offer and Mizuho Securities USA Inc. and MUFG Securities Americas Inc. are acting as co-dealer managers for the Maximum Tender Offer.

Allhands: Will Arizona lead the maternity leave revolution? Joanna Allhands Joanna Allhands , The Republic | azcentral.com 2:17 p.m. MST September 30, 2016 75 Shares Twelve percent of workers nationwide have access to paid family leave time.  (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Glenda Frantz is the envy of mothers everywhere. The Tempe resident is about to have Baby No. 2, and when she does, she'll have 16 weeks of paid time off to recover and adjust. Bank of America, her employer, just extended its paid leave by four weeks to anyone who's been with the company for more than a year. That's on top of the 10 weeks unpaid time it offers, meaning workers could take half the year off and still come back to a job. The time is available for moms and dads, for birth as well as adoption. And it's flexible -- employees can take the 16 paid weeks all at once or in chunks during the first year of the child's life. That's a sweet benefit (seriously, I'm jealous). And it has big implications for Arizona. When companies compete for workers Bank of America employs 9,500 in the state, making it one of Arizona's largest employers. Wells Fargo, which announced a similar 16-week paid family leave policy last week, employs more than 14,000 in Arizona. Benito Almanza, Bank of America's Arizona president, acknowledges that flexible benefits are a key part of keeping employees for the long haul. "We know that supporting the physical, financial, and emotional wellness of our employees in their personal life also supports them in their work life, so they can be the best at work and at home," he said in an emailed statement. Competition also is undoubtedly a factor. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have offered 16 paid weeks for a while, and JPMorgan Chase announced its 16-week policy in January. We saw the same thing in the tech industry last year: Google, Microsoft and others rushed to offer more generous benefits once Netflix announced a full year of paid family leave. What about the other 88 percent? Glenda Frantz was given 16 weeks paid leave when she gave birth to her second child.  (Photo: handout) The extra paid time will make life a lot easier for Frantz. She plans to use her time all at once, so she can be off when her older son, Cooper, starts kindergarten in the fall. But she loves the flexibility, knowing that she could use the extra time later if the craziness of life with a newborn demanded it. "It's priceless to be able to bond with a new one," she said. "To me, it's as important to have these benefits as pay. They understand we all need work-life balance." So far, though, the rising benefit tide only seems to be lifting boats in skilled industries. Only 12 percent of workers nationwide are offered paid leave through their employers. And many workers in lower-paid jobs can't afford to take the 12 unpaid weeks offered to them under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act. FMLA doesn't even apply to part-time workers or businesses with fewer than 50 workers. That's why some cities and states are stepping in to mandate family leave. San Francisco just approved six weeks of fully paid time off for new parents (California law already allows parents to recoup 55 percent of their pay for six weeks). New York now requires businesses to offer workers partial pay for up to three months off. At least 20 other states are considering legislation or studying the issue. Don't expect an Arizona mandate (yet) Arizona isn't one of them. Gov. Doug Ducey and lawmakers have threatened to take cities' state-shared revenue if they pass their own employment laws. They argue that mandating benefits is bad for business. But what happens if some of the state's biggest players willingly choose to offer these benefits? (Let's not forget that Banner Health, the state's largest employer, offers 12 weeks of paid family leave.) Will their leadership help convince other companies to do the same? Maybe not yet. But eventually, the demographics will. Millennials are a critical part of the workforce. They work long hours, but they value time off as much as pay. And many of them are starting families. They expect the time and financial breathing room to learn how to juggle everything in their lives. A recent survey found that 86 percent of Millennials (workers 18 to 33 years old) would be less likely to quit their job if paid family leave were offered. Google also cut attrition by 50 percent when it extended and paid for family leave. If employers want to keep the young workers they need in jobs, they're going to have to adapt.

(NASDAQ: NTNX) entered the market with a bang. The company priced its 14 million shares at $16, above the expected pricing range of $13 to $15 per share, with an overallotment option for an additional 2.1 million. At this price, entire offering is valued up to $257.6 million. Despite pricing there, the stock actually entered the market at $26.50, a premium of 65.6% above the expected price. The underwriters for the offering are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, RBC Capital Markets, Baird, Needham, Oppenheimer, Pacific Crest, Piper Jaffray, Raymond James, Stifel and William Blair. This company provides a leading next-generation enterprise cloud platform that converges traditional silos of server, virtualization and storage into one integrated solution and can also connect to public cloud services. Its software-driven platform delivers the agility, scalability and pay-as-you-grow economics of the public cloud, while addressing enterprise requirements of application mobility, security, data integrity and control. Nutanix has combined advanced web-scale technologies with elegant consumer-grade design to deliver a powerful enterprise cloud platform that elevates IT organizations to focus on the applications and services that power their businesses. Nutanix refers to its platform as “invisible infrastructure” because it provides constant availability and low-touch management, enables application mobility across computing environments and reduces inefficiencies in IT planning. A few of the highlights the company noted in the filing: Average billings growth of 20% on a quarterly basis for the last eight fiscal quarters, which grew from $60.8 million in the three months ended October 31, 2014 to $206.6 million in the three months ended July 31, 2016. Average revenue growth of 17% on a quarterly basis for the last eight fiscal quarters, which grew from $46.1 million in the three months ended October 31, 2014 to $139.8 million in the three months ended July 31, 2016. An increase in deferred revenue of 713% over the last eight fiscal quarters, which grew from $36.5 million as of July 31, 2014 to $296.5 million as of July 31, 2016. The company plans to use the net proceeds from this offering primarily for capital expenditures, as well as for general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and marketing activities, research and development and general and administrative matters. Shares of Nutanix were trading up more than 91% at $30.66, with a range of $26.10 to $30.70 so far on the day as of noon Eastern. Also over 12 million shares had moved on the day.

Published on Friday, September 30, 2016 by BillMoyers.com Jail Wells Fargo CEO and Chairman John Stumpf! Stumpf's actions were not merely "unethical" — they were criminal. And in the current system, he'll not only get away with it, he'll profit more than handsomely. by Nomi Prins 0 Comments John Stumpf, chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo, testifies before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on Sept. 20, 2016 in Washington, DC. (Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images) Consider this. You’re a mob boss. You run a $1.8 trillion network of businesses across state lines and continents. Many of these are legit, but a select subset of them – not so much. Every so often the illegal components flare up; some Washington commission launches an investigation, someone blows a whistle, people lose their homes, a pack of investors sheds a ton of money and lawsuits fly. You get reprimanded and have to pay lawyers and accountants overtime to deal with the paperwork. You settle on fines with the government — $10 billion worth. Then you keep going with no one the wiser, no wings clipped, no hard time. After all of that — you say you’re sorry, forfeit some money you didn’t even make yet, and (maybe) resign with boatloads more of it. John Stumpf is a crook, plain and simple. This is what we’re dealing with regarding Wells Fargo CEO and Chairman John Stumpf. He could be a really nice guy and wears some lovely tailored attire. (Hell, even Al Capone cared about proper milk expiration date labels.) But he’s also a crook, plain and simple. He’s cheated shareholders and taxpayers and customers, and used a stockpile of FDIC-backed deposits as fodder for illicit activities that have been repeatedly investigated and fined. And he made hundreds of millions of dollars doing it. This is not conjecture, nor sour grapes from the nonmillionaire swath of the population. It’s based on documented facts. But by no means is Wells the only guilty bank on the street, or Stumpf the only “apologetic” CEO. Apologies are cheap, and so is money when it’s a small piece of a much larger pie. Somewhere, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein are sighing in relief that this time it was Stumpf and not one of them, the other two of the three (of the Big Six bank) CEOs left standing since the crisis. These are just some highlights of those nearly $10 billion in total fines Wells agreed to, rather than take matters to court, since 2009. The sheer sum of those fines reveal a recidivist attitude toward ethics, regulations and the law. The associated transgressions were all committed under Stumpf’s leadership. There’s no way a regular citizen committing a fraction of a fraction of anything like these wouldn’t be in jail. Complexity is no excuse for criminal behavior. Nor is calling these practices “abuses” rather than felony fraud for misleading, at the very least, investors and shareholders in a publicly traded mega-company that violates securities laws. Note: In November 2009, Wells agreed to buy back $1.4 billion in auction-rate securities to settle allegations by the California attorney general that the company mislead investors. In February 2012, it was one of five large mortgage servicers that consented to a $25 billion settlement with the federal government and state attorneys general to resolve allegations of loan servicing and foreclosure abuses (in other words, fraud.) New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman later sued Wells Fargo for breaching the terms of that settlement. In July 2012, the US Justice Department announced Wells Fargo would pay $175 million to settle charges of discrimination against African-American and Hispanic borrowers from 2004 to 2009. In January 2013, Wells Fargo was one of 10 major lenders that agreed to pay a total of $8.5 billion to resolve more claims of foreclosure abuses. In April 2016, the Justice Department announced Wells Fargo would pay $1.2 billion to resolve allegations it effectively lied to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, flagging certain residential home mortgage loans as eligible for Federal Housing Administration insurance when they weren’t. The list goes on. “Clawback” For this most recent discovery of fraudulent behavior, creating 2 million fake accounts for which real customers were bilked out of $2.4 million, and after a verbal spanking at the hands of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Stumpf resigned from his Fed advisory post. He has to fork over $41 million in stock awards, part of a “clawback” of the appreciation in the stock value due to manipulating information. If Stumpf was a car thief, it’d be like he stole six cars and had to return one, but would still be allowed to profit from selling the other five. The term “clawback” sounds dramatic, connoting an animal paw grabbing what’s rightly ours, not theirs. It conveys the idea of forcibly parting a crooked CEO from his ill-gotten spoils. But Stumpf’s $41 million “clawback” doesn’t mean very much. Let me be clear. (Yes, I’m channeling Bernie Sanders.) It is money he hasn’t made yet — not cash, or even cars or houses. The clawback refers to a portion of his stock awards that are not vested, meaning not his to liquidate now anyway. His total stock awards are worth $247 million. If Stumpf was a car thief, it’d be like he stole six cars and had to return one, but would still be allowed to profit from selling the other five. Not to mention that he’s not behind bars, nor has he been indicted for theft. Part of the press and his supporters (yes, including you Warren Buffett) feel he’s being unfairly chastised for a little crime that he might not have actually committed himself (don’t most mobsters have hired guns, except when they’re bored or really pissed off?) They cite the “little” fine of $185 million and the casualties of 5,300 low-level employees and the mere $2.4 million “fudge” as small in comparison to all the good Stumpf has done at the helm. But the directive of falsifying 2 million accounts to meet sales targets comes from the top. It filtered down from Stumpf as the leader and culture-bearer of the firm as a way for low-paid workers to keep their jobs. I worked in the lower and upper echelons of Wall Street and international banking for 15 years. Nothing — and I mean nothing — happened at the bottom that wasn’t given a license from the top. Even if Stumpf resigns with a mighty cushy fallback, it would likely be with the understanding that criminal prosecution or associated punishment would be off the table. President Obama’s Department of Justice has failed to indict a single Wall Street CEO, instead copping to nearly $150 billion in fines and settlements for crimes involving nearly every department of the major US banks that got bailed out, while those they screwed over seethed on the sidelines or lost their homes. Our Justice Department is so pathetic, so flippant about the reality of mega financial criminal behavior and suitable punishment that this CEO of the nation’s second-largest bank can stand before the Senate on national television and the vastness of the internet and say he’s sorry. He can use words to the effect of taking responsibility for the actual fraud that people under his supervision were directed to commit, and nothing happens. He gives back some money, and what — maybe — resigns? That’s just the price of doing business — for a long time. He flat-out told the Senate commission, “I accept full responsibility for all unethical sales practices in our retail banking business, and I am fully committed to doing everything possible to fix this issue, strengthen our culture, and take the necessary actions to restore our customers’ trust.” What’s unethical and unlawful is stealing money from other people. Saying you take full responsibility requires you to step down. It means a criminal confession, if a crime has been committed. But unethical? That’s what he’s going with. Not, say, criminal. The bank stole money from people. We’re supposed to be okay with the fact that — this time — the collective heist was only a few million dollars. What about that car thief who stole a ‘98 Chevy from a nearby lot and is doing time? Why is that less okay? Even if he does resign, Stumpf’s exit stash is secured. Even if he were found to have played a role in committing or directing the fraud to which he admitted responsibility before the Senate, he’s coming out way ahead. Let’s say Stumpf was fired. First, he wouldn’t be, because he conveniently happens to be chairman of the board that would have to vote to fire him. But in that fantasy, he would still pocket around $102.7 million on his way out the door toward his gilded retirement. If he retired before the board of directors that he chairs told him to (or decided it was better for him financially to do so), he’d get to keep about another $25.2 million worth of unvested stock and options. On Thursday, he offered a better-crafted dodge before the House Financial Services Committee. Its chairman, Jeb Hensarling (R-TX), asked the first question. Just this year (2015-16), Hensarling’s campaign took in $10,000 from Wells Fargo. As a concession between congressional investigation sessions, Wells Fargo decided to end its product sales goals for retail bank employees by Oct. 1, after previously saying it would make that change Jan. 1. That’s not getting serious. That’s camouflage. The Obama administration, which was supposed to be about change, has been anything but for the cronyism and banking mobsters. These individuals not only have broken the law, but they have left the majority of Americans in the fray of an unprecedented financial crisis. In our justice system, 1 in 5 people is incarcerated for drug offenses, whereas zero big bank CEOs have even been indicted. The majority of youth incarcerated are locked up for non-violent crimes, while their Wall Street counterparts commit multibillion-dollar fraud and walk the streets. Donald Trump wants more deregulation and to bring back Glass-Steagall to break up such big banks, simultaneously, which doesn’t even make any sense. He only mentioned Glass-Steagall once — around the Republican Convention — because someone probably told him it’d be a good way to siphon off a few votes from frustrated Bernie supporters. As for Hillary Clinton, all the bank CEOs are her friends. You don’t indict your friends. Instead, you talk platitudes about how Wall Street should not be allowed to hurt Main Street and have some awesome plan to “fix” it. You change nothing. She won’t bring back Glass-Steagall because her “people” supposedly have a better plan than reducing the size and power of big banks and their Teflon CEOs. Who won the first presidential debate? Well, I can tell you who lost: the American people. Neither candidate was asked what they would do to end the vicious cycle of fraudulent activity among the nation’s largest banks. The candidates could not be more similar in their silence, negligence and complicity about demanding real jail time for crimes committed from atop these mega-banks over and over again. To say nothing is to be guilty in permitting Wall Street mobsters to fire thousands of employees, pocket millions of dollars and keep the economy at risk of further upheaval. Clinton and Trump could demand justice — or at least a modicum of similar treatment for bank CEOs as petty car thieves. Bernie Sanders did. But they didn’t. Wells Fargo has donated to both of their campaigns. Whoever takes up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. will invite those people to extravagant dinners while someone in a sh***y jail in the worst corner of the capital eats the equivalent of rotting bread and tepid water.

The shares closed at 11.57 euros, up 6.4 per cent, the biggest gain since April. Agence France-Presse reported that the lender is nearing a settlement with the DOJ in a probe tied to residential mortgage-backed securities, citing an unidentified person familiar. Spokesmen for the Frankfurt-based lender and the DOJ declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. Deutsche Bank's US-listed shares jumped 14 per cent a day after sinking to a record low. Customers enter a Deutsche Bank branch in Boblingen, Germany. Photo: Krisztian Bocsi Deutsche Bank's stock and debt have been under pressure after the DOJ earlier this month requested $US14 billion to settle an investigation into residential mortgage-backed securities. In a memo to staff earlier on Friday, chief executive officer John Cryan said he is taking DOJ settlements with other banks "as a benchmark", echoing previous remarks that he expects US authorities to scale back their request. "The amount would be very good news, below what consensus expects now," said Jerome Legras, an investor at Axiom Alternative Investments, who holds a short position on the lender. "Deutsche Bank has dropped so much as there is so much speculation circulating - at some point people just want to make a profit on short positions." Related Content Wall St lifts on DB speculation Explainer: How Deutsche Bank skidded off course Analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co wrote in a note to clients earlier this month that a US settlement of $US3 billion to $US3.5 billion would leave the German lender room to settle other legal issues. Any additional $US1 billion in litigation charges would erode capital by 24 basis points. The bank's common equity Tier 1 ratio stood at 10.8 per cent at the end of June. Deutsche Bank has long struggled to adapt to an era of tougher capital requirements and diminished trading revenue. Cryan has already said that the lender may fail to be profitable this year, calling it a peak restructuring year, as he eliminates thousands of jobs and cuts risky assets. Advertisement The shares had been pushed to a fresh record low earlier on Friday after Bloomberg News reported that some hedge fund clients had reduced their financial exposure to the bank. Deutsche Bank has lost about half of its market value this year. Call for swift action Trading volume in Deutsche's debt has more than doubled this week and soared 15-fold in a month as investors rushed to offload the troubled German lender's bonds. Deutsche is much smaller than Wall Street rivals such as JPMorgan and Citigroup. But it has significant trading relationships with all of the world's largest finance houses and the International Monetary Fund this year identified it as a bigger potential risk to the wider financial system than any other global bank. Following the financial crisis, banks are now required to have plans showing how they would respond to a major market shock, with improved controls on liquidity. Regulators also draw up plans on how lenders could be smoothly closed down in the event of impending failure. Italy, whose banks have their own troubles caused by soured loans, called for swift action on Deutsche. "Just like the problem of bad bank loans must be solved within a reasonable time frame, so it should be for Deutsche Bank's problems," Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan told Italian daily La Stampa. Awkward for Berlin With Germany facing elections next year, there is little political appetite for helping a group disliked by many Germans because of its pursuit of investment banking abroad that resulted in billions of euros of penalties for wrongdoing. However, the German government faces a delicate balancing act with a deeper crisis for Deutsche Bank potentially spilling over into its economy. The problems of Deutsche, once Germany's flagship on Wall Street, are awkward for Berlin, which has berated many euro zone peers for economic mismanagement and pushed for countries such as Ireland and Greece to cope with their banking problems alone. Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs meetings of euro zone finance ministers, said on Friday that Deutsche Bank must survive "on its own", without assistance from the German state. German banks have found their profits squeezed by the European Central Bank's ultra-low interest rates and Commerzbank, the country's second largest lender, is cutting almost 10,000 jobs.
