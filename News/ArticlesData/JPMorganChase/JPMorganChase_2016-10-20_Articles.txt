Morgan says there is only one place to be in 2016 by Sarah Butcher 21 October 2016 If you’re not working here, bad luck. http://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/263142/deutsche-banks-chart/ How it is on U.S. rates desks J.P. Morgan’s banking analysts have issued a new note updating their predictions on performance by bank and sector for 2016. There, they suggest there is only one place to be in 2016: fixed income trading at a U.S. bank. All else is dirge. You can see J.P. Morgan’s latest predictions for 2016 by bank and by division below. If J.P. Morgan’s right, only U.S. firms’ fixed income operations and investment banking divisions (IBD) will experience revenue growth this year. European banks are expected to see year-on-year revenue declines in every business area on average – although there should be bright spots in fixed income trading at BNP Paribas at SocGen. How can this be? J.P. Morgan’s analysts point to the more favourable business mix at U.S. firms. U.S. banks are more strongly geared to U.S. rates and credit markets, and these have had some of the highest activity so far this year.

"The homeless are more than just nameless faces on our streets; they're our mothers, our fathers and in some cases our children," Turner said. "Homelessness is a top priority for this administration because it is a top priority for Houstonians throughout the city of Houston. That being said, a transformative shift has a occurred in the way that we as a community respond to homelessness." The city devised a plan last year to build 2,500 permanent housing units that are funding mostly through local and federal government support, Turner said. However, the city is still short $15 million for funding its project. The City of Houston has raised an estimated $7 million dollars, and with JP Morgan Chase's $1 million donation, the city is half way toward its financial goal. "We believe we have a responsibility to help the communities where we work address their social and economic challenges," JP Morgan vice-President of Philanthropy Carolyn Watson said. "Every year, the JP Morgan Chase Foundation awards over $200 million to non-profits around the globe. These non-profits are vitalizing neighborhoods, equipping people to secure better jobs and helping them build financial assets for the future." The city has shifted from managing homelessness to solving it by focusing on providing a permanent housing solution for these individuals, the mayor said. "It is pretty simple. If you are homeless, you are literally, literally without a home. That should be no surprise that housing is the solution to homeless," Turner said. He said the organizations and agencies responsible for working with Houston's homeless have also switched from working in independently to collaborating consistently and embracing shared goals while combining their resources to maximize their impact. The mayor said more than 100 local are organization are working together through The Way Home program, which is Houston's regional and collaborative homeless responsive system. "Everything The Way Home does is geared toward one purpose: transiting the homeless off of our streets and into supportive housing," the mayor said. "Besides housing disabled veterans and those with children, we are strategically focused on housing our most vulnerable homeless individuals." Turner said this includes those with disabilities who have been living on the streets for at least a year.  Over the years, the chronically homeless have accounted for 30 percent of Houston's homeless population while utilizing nearly 70 percent of the city's resources for the demographic. The city estimates over nearly $103 million of taxpayers' dollars are spent providing the chronically homeless with temporary shelter, police response, emergency services, and covering jail and emergency room costs. "It is actually less expensive to house the chronically homeless with supportive services than it is merely to walk by them on the streets of the city of Houston," Turner said. "Housing our homeless is more than a plan or an admiration, it is already being done on a daily basis." Turner said a permanent housing solution will save the taxpayers an average of $28,000 per person which adds up to an estimated $70.6 million each year. Through its current initiative, the city has rescued nearly 7,500 individuals from the street — more than 3,000 of whom were constituted as chronically homeless. "Our goal is to virtually end chronic homeless in the city of Houston," Turner said.

Higher Education Elementary and Primary Education Forum Jim Guidry Commentaries Harris County Houston Mayor's News Conference by Garrett Bryce w/Photos courtesy HTV Thursday, October 20, 2016 Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, in a news conference today, accepted a $1 million grant from JP Morgan Chase for the city's The Way Home program to combat homelessness in the city. The grant will support The Way Home's homeless housing initiative, and JPMorgan Chase is the first corporate donor for the event. The Way Home program has now raised $7 million toward its $15 million goal to finish creating 2,500 units of housing for chronically homeless individuals. News Release Turner stated that more than 100 organizations were collaborating through The Way Home program. “Everything The Way Home does is geared towards one purpose, transitioning the homeless off our streets and into supportive housing,” Turner said. Listen (24:41) Turner noted that by putting homeless in homes can actually save $28,000 for each chronically homeless individual, for a potential total of more than $70 million per year. “In fact, it is actually less expensive to house the chronically homeless with supportive services than it is merely to walk by them on the streets of the city of Houston,” he said. Turner introduced JPMorgan Chase Vice President of Philanthropy Carolyn Watson, who announced the grant, and discussed the JPMorgan Chase's award of more than $200 million to nonprofits around the globe. “These nonprofits are revitalizing neighborhoods, equipping people to secure better jobs, and helping them build financial assets for the future,” Watson said. Watson noted Houston's efforts to decrease homelessness, which has resulted in a 57 percent decrease in overall homelessness over the past five years. “The Way Home is an example of Houston at its best,” Watson said. Central Houston, Inc. President Bob Eury spoke on the plan to build housing units, stating that 2,237 operating or in development, 56 pending financial approval, and 207 remain to be created out of the total 2,500 units. Katrina Van ValkenburghThe Corporation for Supportive Housing, which manages the fund for the program, also spoke during the news conference. Van Valkenburgh thanked Turner, JPMorgan Chase, partners in the program, and the residents of Houston. “Because of each and every one of you, ending homelessness in this community is more than a slogan, it's a reality,” she said. Turner stressed the importance of ending homelessness. “We can go to the moon, we can even travel to Mars, but if we can't take care of those who are traveling right here in this city, we still have missed the mark,” Turner said.

Bank of America dedicated an entire slide of its third-quarter earnings presentation this week to "digital banking trends," while JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo mentioned mobile user trends in their latest earnings reports. Bank of America is "investing a lot of money in making sure they can maintain digital banking trends," said Erik Oja, equity analyst at CFRA Research (formerly S&P), which has a buy recommendation on the stock. The bank is trying to find ways to lower expenses and generate revenue in a world of low interest rates, he said. "I think technological innovation plays into those themes … and they have the resources, much more resources than European banks or community banks," Oja said. "All the major banks are working at this." In the BofA presentation, the bank said digital accounted for 18 percent of total sales. The bank also came out first in tech research firm Forrester's 2016 ranking of U.S. mobile banking functionality and 2015 study on U.S. bank digital sales functionality. "Bank of America would be right to think they are in a good position and they are leading when it comes to offering digital experiences among their traditional competition set," said Peter Wannemacher, senior analyst at Forrester Research, which compiled the studies. "But their traditional competition set is not all that matters." Mobile banking apps increasingly allow customers to conduct basic tasks, such as depositing a check, transferring money between accounts or setting up appointments with banking professionals. But competition has been rising with the growth of nonbank apps such as Venmo, which allows users to send money to each other, or TransferWise, which facilitates international transactions. More than half of American adults believe technology providers are more secure or as secure as banks, according to consumer research of more than 1,000 U.S. adults last December by YouGov and TransferWise. Looking out over the next decade, more than three-fourths of Americans in the study said they would trust a technology company with at least some of their financial services needs. "Any bank that has a huge percentage of its business from retail banking or consumer-facing products, they'll want to have strong digital" products, said Joe Cross, general manager of North America at TransferWise. "It is very easy now for customers to shift between banks," he said. For now, customers appear to be conducting more business digitally with banks such as Bank of America. The second-largest U.S. bank by assets said Monday that digital transfers and bill payments totaled $243 billion in the third quarter, up from $229 billion in the period last year. "What they're seeing is proof that banking is still valuable and important to people," Wannemacher said. "We're not yet 15 years down the road. Serving customers through digital channels … has a positive impact on business outcomes." Bank of America also said digitally made appointments for visits to the financial center jumped to 343,000 from 161,000 last year. "Why are they coming? Usually for a much more important financial transaction to them then handing us a check for deposit, and so it's quality versus quantity and making sure we understand that," CEO Brian Moynihan said on the bank's conference call Monday. JPMorgan said in its third-quarter earnings report that active mobile customers rose 17 percent from the same period last year to 26 million. And in a breakdown of impact to customers from its sales scandal, Wells Fargo said total digital online and mobile secure sessions still rose 13 percent in September from last year. The other major banks have less of a consumer-facing business but digital technology was a topic of their third-quarter conference calls. Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said Tuesday that the firm's technology strategy was focused on client engagement. Last week, the bank launched an online consumer lending business called Marcus. The digitalization of finance has picked up more quickly in Asia, where Citi said it is the largest credit card issuer and 1 in 4 credit cards is now acquired online. Ninety percent of Citi customer transactions in Asia take place outside a branch, the bank said.

Embed from Getty Images   Bloomberg News reports that the bank is in discussions with First Capital Securities, its partner in JPMorgan First Capital Securities, over its minority shareholding, the Chinese firm said in a statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange that didn’t identify any potential buyers. No agreement has been reached, according to the statement. JPMorgan wants to find a new partner for a venture in which it can wield greater control, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified. HSBC, which remained on the sidelines as JPMorgan and rivals like Credit Suisse set up minority-owned entities, last year announced plans for a China securities partnership in which it will hold a controlling stake. “Having a minority stake in a China joint venture is no longer attractive because their role is rather passive and they only have limited participation,” Wong Chi Man, a Hong Kong-based analyst at China Galaxy Securities Co., said by phone. “I wouldn’t be surprised if other foreign firms follow suit.” To access the complete Bloomberg News article hit the link below: JPMorgan Weighs Exiting China Venture as Banks Seek Control Rickmers Investors Seek Bond Payment as Singapore Stresses Rise And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is...

Wall Street banks like JPMorgan hold only minority stakes in such ventures. The resulting lack of control and limited contribution to total revenue have brought banks frustration at a time when domestic competition has become acute. Almost all leading investment banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, UBS Group AG, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG have securities ventures with local firms. Shenzhen-listed broker First Capital, in an exchange filing on Thursday, said it is in talks to buy JPMorgan's 33 percent of JP Morgan First Capital Securities Co. It said no transaction has been finalised and that any purchase remains uncertain. JPMorgan confirmed the content of the filing. "China is a key market for the firm globally and for many of our clients outside China. J.P. Morgan believes in the long term prospects of China and remains fully committed to our China franchise," the U.S. bank said in an emailed statement. Neither JPMorgan nor First Capital gave reasons for the move. Some analysts said the U.S. bank could return to China's securities market with a new partner as the outlook for onshore deals remains attractive. Rival Morgan Stanley launched a securities joint venture with Huaxin Securities in 2011, a year after it sold its 34.3 percent of China International Capital Corp Ltd (CICC) , the country's top investment bank at the time. "It has been a difficult ride (for foreign banks), but we really feel that it's at tipping point in terms of opportunities and the banks have just a lot left on the table," said Benjamin Quinlan, CEO of financial services consultancy Quinlan & Associates. "There is no alternative avenue for foreign players to go in and China is sending a clear signal that it is liberalising and I do think they (foreign banks) will be able to get to a stage where they have effective management control of the entity." China's securities regulator approved the establishment of JPMorgan First Capital Securities Co at the end of 2010. The venture, headquartered in Beijing, offers services such as stock and bond underwriting and merger advisory. It posted net profit of 52 million yuan ($7.72 million) for January-June, versus a loss of 23 million yuan in the same period a year earlier, showed information First Capital filed at the exchange. A stake sale would come as rival HSBC Holdings PLC awaits regulatory approval to launch a majority-owned joint venture, taking advantage of rules favouring Hong Kong-established banks. HSBC would own up to 51 percent of the venture, while the cap for other foreign banks in such ventures is 49 percent. China has been gradually opening up its financial sector, though some foreign banks have called for the pace to increase. Despite the challenges, no other top-tier foreign bank has exited securities joint ventures in China, betting on long-term opportunities in the world's second-largest economy. Foreign banks that have exited since 2007 include BNP Paribas SA, CLSA, Daiwa Securities Group Inc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, showed a Quinlan & Associates report.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files By Sumeet Chatterjee and Julie Zhu | HONG KONG HONG KONG JPMorgan Chase & Co is in talks to sell out of a Chinese securities joint venture with First Capital Securities Co Ltd in what would be the first departure by a top-tier global investment bank from China's securities segment. Wall Street banks like JPMorgan hold only minority stakes in such ventures. The resulting lack of control and limited contribution to total revenue have brought banks frustration at a time when domestic competition has become acute. Almost all leading investment banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, UBS Group AG, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG have securities ventures with local firms. Shenzhen-listed broker First Capital, in an exchange filing on Thursday, said it is in talks to buy JPMorgan's 33 percent of JP Morgan First Capital Securities Co. It said no transaction has been finalised and that any purchase remains uncertain. JPMorgan confirmed the content of the filing. "China is a key market for the firm globally and for many of our clients outside China. J.P. Morgan believes in the long term prospects of China and remains fully committed to our China franchise," the U.S. bank said in an emailed statement. Neither JPMorgan nor First Capital gave reasons for the move. Some analysts said the U.S. bank could return to China's securities market with a new partner as the outlook for onshore deals remains attractive. Rival Morgan Stanley launched a securities joint venture with Huaxin Securities in 2011, a year after it sold its 34.3 percent of China International Capital Corp Ltd (CICC), the country's top investment bank at the time. "It has been a difficult ride (for foreign banks), but we really feel that it's at tipping point in terms of opportunities and the banks have just a lot left on the table," said Benjamin Quinlan, CEO of financial services consultancy Quinlan & Associates. "There is no alternative avenue for foreign players to go in and China is sending a clear signal that it is liberalizing and I do think they (foreign banks) will be able to get to a stage where they have effective management control of the entity." China's securities regulator approved the establishment of JPMorgan First Capital Securities Co at the end of 2010. The venture, headquartered in Beijing, offers services such as stock and bond underwriting and merger advisory. It posted net profit of 52 million yuan ($7.72 million) for January-June, versus a loss of 23 million yuan in the same period a year earlier, showed information First Capital filed at the exchange. A stake sale would come as rival HSBC Holdings PLC awaits regulatory approval to launch a majority-owned joint venture, taking advantage of rules favoring Hong Kong-established banks. HSBC would own up to 51 percent of the venture, while the cap for other foreign banks in such ventures is 49 percent. China has been gradually opening up its financial sector, though some foreign banks have called for the pace to increase. Despite the challenges, no other top-tier foreign bank has exited securities joint ventures in China, betting on long-term opportunities in the world's second-largest economy. Foreign banks that have exited since 2007 include BNP Paribas SA, CLSA, Daiwa Securities Group Inc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, showed a Quinlan & Associates report.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 22 October 2016 | MYT 6:00 AM Argentina's tech sector on the cusp of a boom, but obstacles remain No concerted push: There have been no targeted steps to bolster the sector since Macri's election. — Reuters NEW YORK:  Mauricio Macri's presidential election victory in November was a clear signal to Diego Saez Gil that it was time to move back to Argentina and take his growing "connected luggage" startup with him. By the time Macri took office the following month, Saez Gil was already staffing an office for his Bluesmart baggage company in Buenos Aires' Palermo neighborhood, on the way to hiring 21 software developers, designers and customer support personnel – more than double the staff at its headquarters in New York. "We started thinking about the talent we needed to scale the company, and at the same time we saw the new government," Saez Gil said in a telephone interview. "That was the catalyst to say Argentina seems a really good place to go." As he looks to grow his company, which produces luggage that automatically locks and can be tracked via a smart-phone app, Saez Gil said his home country offers the best mix of startup-friendly cost structure and a highly educated population with engineering skills. And when Macri removed long-standing currency controls, eased reserve and deposit requirements for overseas investors and cut a deal with its foreign creditors, effectively reopening international debt markets, Saez Gil was convinced Argentina would no longer scare off potential investors. Like other tech business leaders interviewed by Reuters, he was also attracted by the potential of the president's now-passed "entrepreneurs' law" allowing businesses to more easily be incorporated. Under pressure to turn around a sagging economy long reliant on commodities like beef and soybeans, Macri is hoping a nascent tech sector can provide a fresh source of growth. Raising investment in the tech sector to 1.5%  of gross domestic product is one of his government's key goals as it looks to boost production and employment. While pleased with the new government's first steps, Saez Gil and other Argentine business owners such as Martin Migoya, co-founder and chief technology officer of services provider Globant, say Argentina still lacks the kind of market liquidity and depth needed to list their shares there. Additionally, the country's size presents a problem. "Argentina is a good market, but it's not big enough to think about a multinational company just serving Argentina," Migoya told Reuters in a phone interview. "So by definition, entrepreneurs in Argentina need to think in a global way. That's not very common and we need to foster that." If Bluesmart eventually goes public, as Saez Gil hopes, the Nasdaq is a more likely venue than Buenos Aires' stock market. Local Argentine investors have a better handle on businesses like mining, agribusiness and utilities than tech, he said. That limited awareness is just one of several obstacles to tech expansion in Argentina. Business owners say that even under Macri's more business-friendly administration there are still many challenges that include stifling taxes and difficulty obtaining financing from banks. Near-shoring Nevertheless, in a development that could help more tech startups, a growing number of multinationals have in recent years outsourced thousands of positions to Latin America's third largest economy. Companies such as JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Accenture and Chevron Corp have shifted research, accounting and call centre jobs in English and Spanish to Argentina. The moves, most of which predate Macri's election win, take advantage of Argentina's relative abundance of bilingual college graduates. They have made it a hub for "near-shoring," in which companies outsource to Latin America rather than to distant locations like India and the Philippines. Chevron, for example, has for about a decade employed staffers in Argentina who provide accounting services and IT support for many of its affiliates in Latin America, the United States and the United Kingdom. JPMorgan last year opened its first Latin America-based global support hub in Argentina, months before Macri's election. The bank, which previously had only an investment banking operation there with around 140 employees, now has about 700 with some 100 in roles like software development, systems analysis and securities processing, the bank's senior country officer, Facundo Gomez Minujin, told Reuters. The outsourcing moves could foster a virtuous cycle creating "a large body of technically savvy and technically trained people," said Sramana Mitra, founder and CEO of One Million by One Million, a global support network that includes Hernan Kazah, co-founder of Argentine online auction house MercadoLibre Inc. Gomez Minujin said JPMorgan plans to hire nearly 400 more tech workers in the next year in similar roles to the initial 100, many of whom will serve US.operations and clients. Overall, Argentina's outsourcing, or "near-shoring" sector boasts 105,000-115,000 full-time equivalent positions (FTEs) in global services, according to industry tracker Everest Group. That makes it the leader in South America and only about 20,000 FTEs behind Latin America tech services leader Mexico. "Despite macroeconomic instability in recent years, Argentina continues to witness new center set-up activity," said Salil Dani, Everest Group's vice president of global sourcing. In the last 24 months, 12 new outsourcing service providers have opened there, matching Mexico and more than doubling the pace in much larger Brazil, Everest data shows, although still well behind India. They are attracted by Argentina's time zone and cheap currency, down more than 75% against the dollar since 2011. But many also rave about its workers' English and engineering skills. "Argentina is the best place in Latin America for setting up shop," said Dileepan Siva, chief revenue officer at digital commerce software provider Moovweb who has a long history working with tech companies like eBay Inc and Twitter Inc. Embracing tech Mentoring and networking groups such as Endeavor, started in Buenos Aires in 1997 by two Americans, have helped connect startups like Bluesmart's Saez Gil with those who own multinational companies, like MercadoLibre chief executive Marcos Galperin. Tech champions MercadoLibre and Globant as well as community listings firm OLX and travel site Despegar – all valued at more than US$1bil (RM4.1bil) – were the stars of the only session Macri led at the recent Argentina Business and Investment Forum organised by his government in Buenos Aires. Macri's embrace of the tech sector is not new. As mayor of Buenos Aires he created a technology district and awarded companies that opened or moved there a 10-year tax break. But there have been no targeted steps to bolster the sector since his election, and the government's most recent budget aims to cut funding for the Ministry of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation by more than 30%. "We're not expecting the effort in technology from Argentina to come entirely from the public sector," Finance Minister Alfonso Prat-Gay recently told Reuters in New York. "It’s about deregulation, opening up the conditions for local and foreign players to be involved. So I think it’s wrong to just look at the budget and conclude that our priorities are not there." —  Reuters You May Be Interested German minister says Facebook should be treated as a media company Microsoft offers EU concessions over its US$26bil LinkedIn bid Nasscom cuts IT services sector growth forecast for FY17 Airbnb, San Francisco must work harder to resolve lawsuit: judge Toms launches Apple Watch wrist bands Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read A ‘Yan’ to be the best Ramdan closes Moto2 European Championship in 14th spot Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told advertisement Latest News China wants fewer, but better, electric car makers US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

(Photo: KHOU) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Mayor Sylvester Turner announced Thursday that JPMorgan Chase & Co. donated $1 million to a program that directly funds new apartments for chronically homeless people. The money will support Houston’s ambitious efforts to end chronic homelessness through The Way Home, the Houston region’s nationally recognized homeless housing initiative. A formerly homeless man, Jay Jeanjaquet, spoke at the event about how the program has helped him get his life back. After two tours in Korea, Jeanjaquet told KHOU medical problems cost him his job. “I kissed the ground when I got back," he said. It wasn’t long before Jeanjaquet's life spiraled out of control. He became suicidal and wore his welcome out with his family. “Rejection from family because of what happened. My situation,” Jeanjacquet explained. He found himself on the streets of Houston, down and out and nowhere to go. “Pretty lonely. It was kind of catastrophic, to be honest with you," Jeanjaquet said. He spent five years in the shadows before help found him. He’s no longer standing on a street corner, but at a podium Thursday, next to Mayor Turner. “I wish I could elaborate on all the people that helped me get here today,” Jeanjaquet said. More than 100 agencies are working with the City of Houston to build housing like the Temenos Place Apartments 2 at 2200 Jefferson, in east downtown Houston, to get people off the street. “It’s not enough to fill potholes in the street if we don’t take opportunity to fill potholes in people’s lives," Turner said. The The Way Home program has transitioned people like Jeanjaquet and more than 8,000 chronically homeless people to permanent homes. “I get up. I exercise. I visit friends. I consider myself retired,” Jeanjaquet said about his new life. It’s more than just a roof over someone’s head. “I have improved. I’m actually going somewhere in my life right now,” he said. According to the City of Houston, The Way Home has raised $7 million toward it’s $15 million goal to finish creating 2,500 units of housing for chronically homeless individuals.

Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. grabbed a bigger share of the market last quarter by forcing hedge funds hungry for financing to send more stock-trading business their way. The three firms booked $5.1 billion from equities in the third quarter, or 76 percent of the total posted by the five largest U.S. investment banks, according to their financial statements. That was the most for the period since 2012. Regulations put in place since the financial crisis help explain why. A new rule intended to make banks safer and avoid government bailouts forced lenders to fund less risky assets with more equity, reducing returns. As a result, some companies left the business and the ones left standing are raising prices. “The firms can now tell their clients that want access to the balance sheet, ‘I have to make sure I get paid enough,’” Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Autonomous Research, said in an interview. That may mean demanding a richer spread on lending, or insisting on “more market share of a customers’ business flow,” he said. Hedge funds, in many cases, are in no position to argue. Average annual returns over the past three years were just 2 percent, spurring investor withdrawals. Under pressure to cut costs, funds are acquiescing to banks’ insistence that they concentrate their business in exchange for the best service available. The trend helped Morgan Stanley hold its No. 1 ranking among prime brokerages for the largest global hedge funds, followed by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, according to a 2016 survey conducted by Global Custodian, which follows the international securities-services industry. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. ranked seventh and 10th, respectively. Spreading Wealth “In environments where clients have limited fees to spread around, they probably want to spread it around to the people they think are the biggest and the best, and we are that,” Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said Wednesday in an interview. Daniel Pinto, head of JPMorgan’s corporate and investment bank, highlighted the firm’s progress in equities and prime brokerage Thursday in a town hall meeting in Manhattan for traders and investment bankers. Amid the industry’s declining stock-trading fees this year, the bank has managed to retain more revenue than competitors, he said. Equity-trading revenue declined at Citigroup and Bank of America enough to cut the total amount earned by the five biggest U.S. investment banks by 4.8 percent to $6.7 billion, compared with the year-earlier quarter. Bank of America, where revenue fell 17 percent, blamed lower volume in cash equities and derivatives. Morgan Stanley, with a 6.4 percent increase, cited derivatives as a source of strength. Bank of America equities head Fabrizio Gallo is still in the process of shifting away from an emphasis on cash equities, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said Thursday during a Bloomberg TV interview. “The heritage of the company was much more of a cash-based equity business, and he’s had to move to a more electronics-based and derivatives-based business,” Moynihan said. Citigroup was challenged despite making equities trading, and hedge fund services specifically, a key focus for growth. The bank has upgraded its technology systems, hired senior managers and earmarked more of its balance sheet for the business. Wallet Share “We’ve made the right investments in people, the right investments in technology, and now it’s up to us to gain as much of our clients’ wallet shares as we can,” Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said on a call with journalists Friday. “When you are the No. 8 or the No. 9 player and the overall market volume, as I’ve said, is down, that means that most clients are going to stay with their No. 1 or No. 2 current providers, and it’s a little more difficult to break in.” The battle among the dealers is a sign of a larger trend, according to Morgan Stanley’s Pruzan. While the CFO didn’t single out Morgan Stanley’s prime brokerage when Moszkowski asked about its contribution on a conference call Wednesday, he acknowledged how pressures are reshaping the industry. “You’re going to see -- just like in many other financial-services products -- the concentration of market share among the top players,” Pruzan said. “That’s what you’re seeing in equities.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(AP/Mark Lennihan) Share Written by Eshe Nelson October 20, 2016 Investment banking is back! After a rocky few years, to say the least, major Wall Street banks are once again making huge amounts of money from bond trading, a traditional cash cow. In the third quarter, revenue from trading in fixed-income securities and similar products was up at least 30% year-over-year at each of the biggest US investment banks. JPMorgan, for example, recorded a 48% increase in bond-trading revenue, to $4.3 billion, in the quarter. But you won’t see the banks celebrating this too much. Instead, bank bosses have taken a self-deprecating tone when discussing their buoyant bond-trading businesses. Mostly, they say the recent jump was flattered by comparisons with weak results in the same period last year. Here is how some of bank execs explained why they just couldn’t help making so much money: Harvey Mitchell Schwartz, CFO of Goldman Sachs “I would say maybe the best way to describe it, it wasn’t so much about tailwinds as it was about not having so many headwinds in the quarter. And of course, it translated nicely for us.” Marianne Lake, CFO of JPMorgan “When you think about the year-over-year comparison, we are a little flattered by last year’s performance, not necessarily more so than our peers, but nevertheless we are.” James Gorman, CEO of Morgan Stanley “It was a better macro environment. There was more volatility post-Brexit. There was more volatility around rates… and the credit markets firmed up. So if you’re in the fixed income business, you were going to have a better quarter. We’re in it and we had a better quarter.” For good measure, Gorman of Morgan Stanley said the thing he was “pleased” about was that the bank’s performance came “with 25% less people.” That may be harsh, but it acknowledges the wrenching restructuring investment banks have undertaken in recent years, mainly by cutting staff and shrinking their balance sheets. Despite their strong results, you can understand why the big banks don’t want to gloat. After their industry imperiled the global economy in 2008, soaking up trillions in taxpayer bailouts in the aftermath, banks aren’t as keen as they once were to highlight their money-making prowess. And so investment bankers—the ones that are left, anyway—are keeping their heads down. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

In an ironic reverse, investment banks are now racing to make it work for them — but cash-strapped European players risk falling behind their Wall Street rivals. Blockchain was developed eight years ago, enabling transactions using the digital currency to be processed and settled on a public network without the need for a third party. Now banks are seeking to apply it to private networks they run, to save costs by reducing settlement times and automating systems that are still paper-based, like in trade finance. About 80 per cent of top global banks will have launched blockchain projects by next year, the World Economic Forum (WEF) said in August, describing the technology as the future “beating heart” of the financial sector. A survey of 200 top global banks by tech firm IBM last month found that 15 per cent will have rolled out commercial blockchain products by the end of 2017. But there is likely to be a transatlantic imbalance in bringing out such products, given the costs involved in developing new technology. While US investment banks moved quickly to restructure and recapitalise after the financial crisis, European players are still struggling with cost-cutting and shoring up their balance sheets. Dozens of patent applications have been filed in total by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America for blockchain-based products, but there is a record of only one being filed by a European bank — Switzerland’s UBS. “The European banks are cost-focused, whereas US banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are likely trying to generate revenue, because they’re in different market conditions,” said Simon Taylor, who was in charge of blockchain product development at Barclays for two years until he left in June to co-found London fintech consultancy 11:FS. “Reading between the lines, that says: ‘we want to profit from this, we want to build the thing’,” he said of American banks. Taylor said that dynamic was playing out not just in terms of the amounts of investment in blockchain projects, but also in how US banks are seeking to develop their own products while European banks are taking a more collaborative and less aggressive approach. No leading bank has publicly said how much it has invested in blockchain. The six global banks approached by Reuters for this story – in the United States and Europe – declined to say how much they had spent. The WEF estimates a total of about US$1.5 billion has been invested in blockchain by all industries, including financial institutions and tech companies. ‘Columbus mission’ The UBS “fintech lab” on the 42nd floor of One Canada Square tower in London’s Canary Wharf financial district does not look much like a bank office. Ideas are scrawled onto walls in pen and Post-It notes adorn a see-through dividing panel. UBS is regarded in the industry as one of the most innovative European banks. It radically restructured its investment banking arm in 2012 – earlier than most of its European competitors – to focus more on wealth management, but it faces the same cost-cutting pressures. “There’s constant pressure to deliver,” said the bank’s blockchain lead Alex Batlin, who is leaving for BNY Mellon — which until recently has not appeared very active in its work on the technology but now seems to be on a spending spree, recently advertising 37 open positions on Blocktribe.com, a website dedicated to blockchain jobs. “I always saw this as a Columbus mission — we go out and look for gold, we don’t know what’s going to happen, but if we do discover something it could be massive and therefore it’s worth investing in,” Batlin said, adding that he was always careful to deliver “shareholder value”. Banks are investing in blockchain in different ways: some invest directly in start-ups or have “incubator” programmes where they work with start-up staff, others — like UBS — have “labs” in which they experiment with the technology. Some take all of these approaches. They are also working together on the technology in consortia in order to come up with common standards and systems, with the most notable of these being New York-based R3, which includes most of the world’s biggest banks. Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain, a San-Francisco-based blockchain start-up that is working with firms like Citi and Nasdaq, said it would be foolish for banks to spend too much at this point, as the technology was still in an experimentation phase. “You could spend tens of millions but you’d probably be doing it wrong if you were spending hundreds of millions right now,” he said. “The nature of new innovation and software development is that you invest incrementally.” In the game In Reuters interviews about tech innovation with banks, blockchain consortia and consultancies, the name of one US investment bank came up more often than any other: Goldman Sachs, which posted a 58 per cent jump in third-quarter profits on Tuesday. The bank, which has a history of developing new platforms internally that it then sells to the marketplace, as well as investing in start-ups, recently filed a patent application for a platform for trading foreign exchange via blockchain. “There are some banks — Goldman Sachs being the epitome of this — that... recognise the future of banking as being more and more a question of technology,” said Charley Cooper, managing director of the R3 blockchain consortium. But while they might be held back by cost pressures, Europe’s lenders are trying to keep up with their US peers on the tech front. Earlier this month when Dutch bank ING announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs, it also said it would invest 800 million euros in its technology platform. As Deutsche Bank’s share price was sliding towards a 30-year low last month on concerns over a fine from the US Department of Justice, it announced that its new “digital factory” would be staffed by 800 specialists by 2018. “We’re advising our clients that they would be frankly foolish not to be experimenting (in blockchain technology),” said Deloitte global financial services industry leader Bob Contri. “If you’re not in the game and if you’re not experimenting then you’re falling behind.” — Reuters                 MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Asia to narrow trade focus as protectionism rises, say analysts Five ways Indians are dodging ‘black money’ crackdown Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Palm oil celebrates centennial, output doubles every 10 years TPP, RCEP, FTAAP: A user’s guide to alphabet soup of trade deals Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Tensions’ likely under President-elect Trump, Obama says Reuters Video: Trump says ‘you will hear some things tomorrow’ MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Related Articles Bitcoin?

The U.S. bank is in talks to sell its stake in JPMorgan First Capital Securities as it seeks to free itself up to get more control in a potential new venture, according to a statement on Thursday and people familiar with the matter. Since UBS Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. established Chinese joint ventures more than a decade ago, foreign banks have struggled to challenge local players. One competitive disadvantage is that Chinese rules limit them to minority stakes, reducing their sway over key decisions. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon’s decision signals that some banks are growing frustrated with the hurdles in China. Mark Schwartz, the Goldman Sachs veteran who oversaw efforts to secure full control of the firm’s local investment-banking venture, is stepping down as Asia-Pacific chairman, according to a memo this week. “Having a minority stake in a China joint venture is no longer attractive because their role is rather passive and they only have limited participation,” Wong Chi Man, a Hong Kong-based analyst at China Galaxy Securities Co., said by phone. “I wouldn’t be surprised if other foreign firms follow suit.” ‘Fully Committed’ JPMorgan’s local partner, First Capital Securities Co., said it was in talks to buy the U.S. firm’s stake. In a separate release, JPMorgan said that it “remains fully committed to our China franchise.” JPMorgan First Capital Securities generated 156 million yuan ($23 million) of revenue in the first half, less than a third of what Citigroup Inc.’s joint venture pulled in, according to reports from their Chinese partners. Globally, JPMorgan had almost $25 billion of revenue in the most recent quarter, Bloomberg-compiled data show. One option JPMorgan is weighing is forming a new joint venture under a framework established in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, the people said. That framework opens the door for overseas banks to achieve greater control of local ventures and pick partners that aren’t in the securities business, they said. Even so, the rules have yet to be finalized, according to the people. HSBC Holdings Plc, which stayed on the sidelines for years as other banks set up minority-owned JVs, is attempting a setup with control. It plans a majority-owned venture in the free-trade zone of Qianhai and is in the process of seeking approval from China’s securities regulator, in what CEO Stuart Gulliver says would be a first for a foreign bank. HSBC’s Asian banking unit is incorporated in Hong Kong, allowing the company to apply for such a venture under the city’s Closer Economic Partnership Agreement with China. Its partner is state-owned Shenzhen Qianhai Financial Holdings Co. Patchy History JPMorgan’s businesses in China include corporate banking and stakes in a fund manager and in a commodities futures joint venture, according to the bank’s China website. It holds a one-third stake in the Beijing-based investment banking joint venture, whose business includes equity and debt underwriting and mergers advisory. While tying up with a local firm is a prerequisite for investment banking in China, collaborations haven’t always worked out. BNP Paribas SA pulled out of a venture with Changjiang Securities Co. in 2007 after disagreeing on strategy, while Morgan Stanley exited from China International Capital Corp. -- the first Sino-foreign brokerage venture -- in 2010. Morgan Stanley opted instead to form a partnership with a Shenzhen-based company. Most foreign-backed joint ventures are minnows in China. JPMorgan First Capital ranked 120th out of China’s 125 securities firms by net income in 2015, according to the Securities Association of China. UBS Securities Co. whose 296 million yuan profit was the biggest among foreign-backed joint ventures, came in at 95th place. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Dylan Martinez/FilesMore By Sumeet Chatterjee and Julie Zhu HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is in talks to sell out of a Chinese securities joint venture with First Capital Securities Co Ltd in what would be the first departure by a top-tier global investment bank from China's securities segment. Wall Street banks like JPMorgan hold only minority stakes in such ventures. The resulting lack of control and limited contribution to total revenue have brought banks frustration at a time when domestic competition has become acute. Almost all leading investment banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, UBS Group AG, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG have securities ventures with local firms. Shenzhen-listed broker First Capital, in an exchange filing on Thursday, said it is in talks to buy JPMorgan's 33 percent of JP Morgan First Capital Securities Co. It said no transaction has been finalised and that any purchase remains uncertain. JPMorgan confirmed the content of the filing. "China is a key market for the firm globally and for many of our clients outside China. J.P. Morgan believes in the long term prospects of China and remains fully committed to our China franchise," the U.S. bank said in an emailed statement. Neither JPMorgan nor First Capital gave reasons for the move. Some analysts said the U.S. bank could return to China's securities market with a new partner as the outlook for onshore deals remains attractive. Rival Morgan Stanley launched a securities joint venture with Huaxin Securities in 2011, a year after it sold its 34.3 percent of China International Capital Corp Ltd (CICC), the country's top investment bank at the time. "It has been a difficult ride (for foreign banks), but we really feel that it's at tipping point in terms of opportunities and the banks have just a lot left on the table," said Benjamin Quinlan, CEO of financial services consultancy Quinlan & Associates. "There is no alternative avenue for foreign players to go in and China is sending a clear signal that it is liberalising and I do think they (foreign banks) will be able to get to a stage where they have effective management control of the entity." China's securities regulator approved the establishment of JPMorgan First Capital Securities Co at the end of 2010. The venture, headquartered in Beijing, offers services such as stock and bond underwriting and merger advisory. It posted net profit of 52 million yuan ($7.72 million) for January-June, versus a loss of 23 million yuan in the same period a year earlier, showed information First Capital filed at the exchange. A stake sale would come as rival HSBC Holdings PLC awaits regulatory approval to launch a majority-owned joint venture, taking advantage of rules favouring Hong Kong-established banks. HSBC would own up to 51 percent of the venture, while the cap for other foreign banks in such ventures is 49 percent. China has been gradually opening up its financial sector, though some foreign banks have called for the pace to increase. Despite the challenges, no other top-tier foreign bank has exited securities joint ventures in China, betting on long-term opportunities in the world's second-largest economy. Foreign banks that have exited since 2007 include BNP Paribas SA, CLSA, Daiwa Securities Group Inc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, showed a Quinlan & Associates report.

Earlier this month when Dutch bank ING announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs, it also said it would invest 800 million euros in its technology platform. As Deutsche Bank's share price was sliding towards a 30-year low last month on concerns over a fine from the U.S. Department of Justice, it announced that its new "digital factory" would be staffed by 800 specialists by 2018. "We're advising our clients that they would be frankly foolish not to be experimenting (in blockchain technology)," said Deloitte global financial services industry leader Bob Contri.

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo By Jemima Kelly and Anjuli Davies | LONDON LONDON The blockchain technology behind bitcoin was designed to do away with banks. In an ironic reverse, investment banks are now racing to make it work for them - but cash-strapped European players risk falling behind their Wall Street rivals. Blockchain was developed eight years ago, enabling transactions using the digital currency to be processed and settled on a public network without the need for a third party. Now banks are seeking to apply it to private networks they run, to save costs by reducing settlement times and automating systems that are still paper-based, like in trade finance. About 80 percent of top global banks will have launched blockchain projects by next year, the World Economic Forum (WEF) said in August, describing the technology as the future "beating heart" of the financial sector. A survey of 200 top global banks by tech firm IBM last month found that 15 percent will have rolled out commercial blockchain products by the end of 2017. But there is likely to be a transatlantic imbalance in bringing out such products, given the costs involved in developing new technology. While U.S. investment banks moved quickly to restructure and recapitalise after the financial crisis, European players are still struggling with cost-cutting and shoring up their balance sheets. Dozens of patent applications have been filed in total by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America for blockchain-based products, but there is a record of only one being filed by a European bank - Switzerland's UBS. "The European banks are cost-focused, whereas U.S. banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are likely trying to generate revenue, because they're in different market conditions," said Simon Taylor, who was in charge of blockchain product development at Barclays for two years until he left in June to co-found London fintech consultancy 11:FS. "Reading between the lines, that says: 'we want to profit from this, we want to build the thing,'" he said of American banks. Taylor said that dynamic was playing out not just in terms of the amounts of investment in blockchain projects, but also in how U.S. banks are seeking to develop their own products while European banks are taking a more collaborative and less aggressive approach. No leading bank has publicly said how much it has invested in blockchain. The six global banks approached by Reuters for this story - in the United States and Europe - declined to say how much they had spent. The WEF estimates a total of about $1.5 billion has been invested in blockchain by all industries, including financial institutions and tech companies. 'COLUMBUS MISSION' The UBS "fintech lab" on the 42nd floor of One Canada Square tower in London's Canary Wharf financial district does not look much like a bank office. Ideas are scrawled onto walls in pen and Post-It notes adorn a see-through dividing panel. UBS is regarded in the industry as one of the most innovative European banks. It radically restructured its investment banking arm in 2012 - earlier than most of its European competitors - to focus more on wealth management, but it faces the same cost-cutting pressures. "There's constant pressure to deliver," said the bank's blockchain lead Alex Batlin, who is leaving for BNY Mellon - which until recently has not appeared very active in its work on the technology but now seems to be on a spending spree, recently advertising 37 open positions on Blocktribe.com, a website dedicated to blockchain jobs. "I always saw this as a Columbus mission – we go out and look for gold, we don't know what's going to happen, but if we do discover something it could be massive and therefore it's worth investing in," Batlin said, adding that he was always careful to deliver "shareholder value". Banks are investing in blockchain in different ways: some invest directly in start-ups or have "incubator" programmes where they work with start-up staff, others - like UBS - have "labs" in which they experiment with the technology. Some take all of these approaches. They are also working together on the technology in consortia in order to come up with common standards and systems, with the most notable of these being New York-based R3, which includes most of the world's biggest banks. Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain, a San-Francisco-based blockchain start-up that is working with firms like Citi and Nasdaq, said it would be foolish for banks to spend too much at this point, as the technology was still in an experimentation phase. "You could spend tens of millions but you'd probably be doing it wrong if you were spending hundreds of millions right now," he said. "The nature of new innovation and software development is that you invest incrementally." IN THE GAME In Reuters interviews about tech innovation with banks, blockchain consortia and consultancies, the name of one U.S. investment bank came up more often than any other: Goldman Sachs, which posted a 58 percent jump in third-quarter profits on Tuesday. The bank, which has a history of developing new platforms internally that it then sells to the marketplace, as well as investing in start-ups, recently filed a patent application for a platform for trading foreign exchange via blockchain. "There are some banks – Goldman Sachs being the epitome of this – that ... recognise the future of banking as being more and more a question of technology," said Charley Cooper, managing director of the R3 blockchain consortium. But while they might be held back by cost pressures, Europe's lenders are trying to keep up with their U.S. peers on the tech front. Earlier this month when Dutch bank ING announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs, it also said it would invest 800 million euros in its technology platform.

The New York-based bank is in talks to sell its minority stake in JPMorgan First Capital Securities to its local partner, First Capital Securities Co., according to a statement from the Chinese firm on Thursday. No agreement has been reached, according to the statement. JPMorgan wants to find a new partner for a venture in which it can wield greater control, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified. HSBC Holdings Plc, which remained on the sidelines as JPMorgan and rivals like Credit Suisse Group AG set up minority-owned entities, last year announced plans for a China securities partnership in which it will hold a controlling stake. “Having a minority stake in a China joint venture is no longer attractive because their role is rather passive and they only have limited participation,” Wong Chi Man, a Hong Kong-based analyst at China Galaxy Securities Co., said by phone. “I wouldn’t be surprised if other foreign firms follow suit.” Underwriting, M&A JPMorgan set up the joint venture with First Capital in 2010 after having lagged behind rivals including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in forming tie-ups. It holds a one-third stake in the company, whose business includes equity and debt underwriting and mergers advice. The venture posted net income of 51.7 million yuan ($7.7 million) in the first half of 2016, compared with a loss of 23 million yuan a year earlier. It ranks 53rd among underwriters of share sales in China this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Deutsche Bank AG’s local partnership is ranked 10th, the highest among foreign-backed ventures, according to the data. “JPMorgan believes in the long-term prospects of China and remains fully committed to our China franchise,” the bank said in an e-mailed statement confirming the announcement by First Capital. “We have a long-term strategic vision for our business in the country and continue to evaluate our options to strengthen our position in China in order to better serve our clients.” HSBC, Goldman HSBC is still waiting for regulatory approval to take a majority share in its planned partnership in the free-trade zone of Qianhai, and it’s unlikely to be operational this year, the U.K. bank’s China CEO Helen Wong said this month. HSBC Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver has said it would be the first securities venture in China mostly owned by a foreign bank. Goldman Sachs has also been seeking more control of its securities partnership in the country. Mark Schwartz, who is stepping down as the firm’s Asia-Pacific chairman, had a long-term goal of securing permission to take full ownership of the investment-banking venture his firm formed with Beijing Gao Hua Securities Co. in 2004, according to people familiar with the matter. “JPMorgan’s move makes sense to me because foreign banks have a lot more options than before,” said China Galaxy’s Wong. “They can go to different free-trade zones like the ones in Shanghai and Qianhai if they aren’t happy with their current shareholding.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 1:30 PM, October 20, 2016 Updated: 4:30 PM, October 20, 2016 HONG KONG - JPMorgan Chase & Co is in talks to sell out of a Chinese securities joint venture with First Capital Securities Co Ltd in what would be the first departure by a top-tier global investment bank from China's securities segment. Wall Street banks like JPMorgan hold only minority stakes in such ventures. The resulting lack of control and limited contribution to total revenue have brought banks frustration at a time when domestic competition has become acute. Almost all leading investment banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, UBS Group AG, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG have securities ventures with local firms. Shenzhen-listed broker First Capital, in an exchange filing on Thursday, said it is in talks to buy JPMorgan's 33 percent of JP Morgan First Capital Securities Co. It said no transaction has been finalised and that any purchase remains uncertain. JPMorgan confirmed the content of the filing. "China is a key market for the firm globally and for many of our clients outside China. J.P. Morgan believes in the long term prospects of China and remains fully committed to our China franchise," the U.S. bank said in an emailed statement. Neither JPMorgan nor First Capital gave reasons for the move. Some analysts said the U.S. bank could return to China's securities market with a new partner as the outlook for onshore deals remains attractive. Rival Morgan Stanley launched a securities joint venture with Huaxin Securities in 2011, a year after it sold its 34.3 percent of China International Capital Corp Ltd (CICC), the country's top investment bank at the time. "It has been a difficult ride (for foreign banks), but we really feel that it's at tipping point in terms of opportunities and the banks have just a lot left on the table," said Benjamin Quinlan, CEO of financial services consultancy Quinlan & Associates. "There is no alternative avenue for foreign players to go in and China is sending a clear signal that it is liberalizing and I do think they (foreign banks) will be able to get to a stage where they have effective management control of the entity." China's securities regulator approved the establishment of JPMorgan First Capital Securities Co at the end of 2010. The venture, headquartered in Beijing, offers services such as stock and bond underwriting and merger advisory. It posted net profit of 52 million yuan ($7.72 million) for January-June, versus a loss of 23 million yuan in the same period a year earlier, showed information First Capital filed at the exchange. A stake sale would come as rival HSBC Holdings PLC awaits regulatory approval to launch a majority-owned joint venture, taking advantage of rules favoring Hong Kong-established banks. HSBC would own up to 51 percent of the venture, while the cap for other foreign banks in such ventures is 49 percent. China has been gradually opening up its financial sector, though some foreign banks have called for the pace to increase. Despite the challenges, no other top-tier foreign bank has exited securities joint ventures in China, betting on long-term opportunities in the world's second-largest economy. Foreign banks that have exited since 2007 include BNP Paribas SA, CLSA, Daiwa Securities Group Inc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, showed a Quinlan & Associates report.

RUIZ DE GAUNANUEVA YORK Actualizado: 21/10/201619:11 horas 0comentarios Suscríbete La compra de Time Warner espoleará aún más el desarrollo de AT&T, que se ha acelerado en los últimos meses hasta permitirle entrar en verano en el club de las mayores empresas de la Bolsa, tras adelantar el banco Wells Fargo. Aunque JPMorgan ha rebasado ahora a AT&T, su impulso en los últimos meses refleja para los analistas la voluntad de crecer de la operadora y su apuesta por la diversificación. AT&T lleva tiempo analizando oportunidades de compra y también se llegó a plantear la adquisición de Yahoo!, el grupo de Internet que pasará finalmente a manos de su competidor Verizon. Aunque sus acciones han bajado hoy un 3% en Wall Street ante el reto que puede suponer digerir Time Warner, la trayectoria bursátil de AT&T acumula una subida de más del 15% en un año. La compañía que dirige Randall Stephenson vale más de 230.000 millones de dólares, cifra que se verá incrementada con creces si, finalmente, logra cerrar la compra de Time Warner. Para entonces, la nueva AT&T tendrá asegurado su puesto en el 'top ten' del mercado.

This imminent future is what both financial services and tech companies will discuss at the fifth annual Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas next week. The reinvention of such a complex and highly regulated industry for the modern mobile and digital era requires cooperation between incumbents and upstarts alike. More than 10,000 attendees, including Wall Street bank executives and CEOs of Silicon Valley start-ups, are expected to attend. The conference will feature keynote speakers from established companies like Bank of America, Visa, First Data, Facebook, Alphabet's Google, PayPal, Square and Wal-Mart, as well as start-ups like Stripe, Pinterest and Poynt. Attendees will also hear from regulators and trade associations, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Chamber of Digital Commerce. The event has unveiled cutting-edge tech before. Last year alone, JPMorgan Chase announced mobile payments service Chase Pay, Nasdaq launched a private blockchain-powered trading platform called Linq, Citibank unveiled a cardless eye-scanning ATM, Amazon announced customers could "Pay with Amazon" in partner mobile apps and Samsung added new U.S. banking partners to Samsung Pay. Big topics will include payments and account security, reaching people who are currently "unbanked" and the transformative potential of blockchain technology. Blockchain Major financial services firms — from American Express to Goldman Sachs — are playing an increasingly important role in financing blockchain and bitcoin start-ups, CB Insights found. Blockchain is the technology that underlies bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It's a public ledger of all transactions through a distributed database which maintains a continuously growing list of records or "blocks." Each block contains a time stamp and link to a previous block, securing the system from tampering and revision. "The area is going to make a very big impact [on financial services]," said David Blumberg, founder and managing partner of Blumberg Capital. Blockchain technology will significantly reduce the cost of buying a home, getting a mortgage or transferring currency, said Blumberg. Reaching the unbanked Many fintech firms are trying to give banking and credit services to individuals with no credit history, and to businesses considered too risky to get loans from bigger banks. The need is real. Seven percent of U.S. households did not have a bank account in 2015, according to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. study released Thursday. Start-up Bee provides bank accounts, debit cards and financial services all through a mobile app for people who may have never had a bank account. Its strategy is to set up on street corners and register people on the spot. "A lot of fintech is now focused on helping individuals level the playing field so they can take advantage of services wealthy people or businesses have had for decades," said Blumberg, who is invested in Bee. Security Data breaches in the financial services industry have cost banks billion of dollars. The Target data breach — where as many as 40 million credit and debit cards were stolen — cost banks more than $200 million, according to the Consumer Bankers Association and the Credit Union National Association. Start-ups play a big role in helping financial institutions protect their assets, said Blumberg. Deep Instinct, a start-up whose customers include central banks and law enforcement agencies, uses a form of artificial intelligence called deep learning to identify and react to new threats as they appear. New technology is also making it easier to verify that someone logging into an account is who they say they are at the outset — and throughout the transaction. This is designed to address so-called man-in-the-middle attacks in which criminals grab a user's credentials once they are already logged into an account. BioCatch, a Money 20/20 sponsor, helps banks continuously verify a person's identity, using more than 500 different factors that add up to a unique user profile. They include personally identifiable characteristics such as the way you move your mouse, or hold your phone. Pass your device to another person midtransaction, and you may be prompted to recheck your identity, since the bank will recognize a difference in the way the phone is held. Some of the likely highlights of the conference will be an on-stage interview by CNBC's Kayla Tausche of Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and a keynote address from Kor Adana, writer and tech producer of USA Network's program "Mr Robot."

People lost faith in the financial system while many others saw the hit as new investing opportunity after the ” Too big to fail ” companies found a way out of the crisis . Tracking the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLF ) which represents one of the largest portions of the S&P 500 as it consists of the banks , insurance, real estate investment trust, capital markets, consumer finance, financial services and mortgage finance representing the most largest and recognizable financial institutions in the world such as JPMorgan , Wells Fargo , Bank of America , Citigroup , Goldman Sachs , American International Group , Chubb Limited and Warren Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway. After the the sharp drop in the 2008 financial crisis , an influx of government regulation and restructuring took place, which made the financial sector over the last five years considerably stronger as it rebounded giving investors an annual average return of 10.55% . Focusing on the top 5 holding Companies of XLF you notice that BRK , JPM , WFC are leading the recovery as their stock price already overtook the 2007 peaks while BAC and C keeps struggling like many other financial companies which didn’t even surpass 30 % of the decline. Shifting to the current 2016 performance of these companies we notice that only BRK & JPM are positive for the year while WFC is deeply in red with -14% . However The surprise came from Comerica ( CMA ) which is another large financial holding company that only represent 0.27% of XLF , the bank is up +18% and looking to add more gains in the coming months . With Q3 earnings coming out this week for most of the financial sector top companies , the overall performance could change rapidly but the bigger picture will remain the same so don’t worry as investing opportunities will always come out at the right time . We are always seekingthe right side of the market that’s why we at EWF use Elliott Wave in a different way combining it with market correlation, cycles, sequence of swings and distribution . Before buying or selling we search for the strongest & weakest instruments to find the right sequence that could provide a trading opportunities , that’s why Comerica & Wells Fergo stocks represent the best exemple if you are looking to invest in the financial sector. In my next articles, I’ll be covering the technical outlook for these 2 companies showing how to join the strong rally of CMA or how to profit during the decline of WFC by short selling its stock but maybe you are just a Warren buffet fan and you decide to go for the strong Berkshire Hathaway as it owns 10% of Wells Fergo .

PHOTO: AFP Oct 21, 2016 10:28 AM [SINGAPORE] Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's decision to greet his hosts in China by saying "goodbye" to the US looks set to come with a hefty financial price tag. As Mr Duterte's war on drugs drew criticism from the US and European Union, foreign-currency notes issued by the Philippines handed investors a three-month loss of 2.3 per cent, the worst among developing nations, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co indexes. That means the government and corporate issuers will pay more when adding to their US$42 billion pile of such bonds. Jens Nystedt, a New York-based portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley's asset arm, which oversees about US$406 billion, sees room for a 50 basis point widening in sovereign yield premiums. "Recent public statements have made some analysts worry about unpredictability of the new leadership," he said. "The new administration remains popular at home and pragmatic on the economic front. That said, we will follow closely local business sentiment to see whether the rhetoric has any impact on local dynamics and the country's ability to attract foreign direct investments." Morgan Stanley Investment, Amundi Asset Management and Natixis Asset Management say they've been underweight Philippine bonds and prefer Indonesia. The spread on Philippine sovereign bonds over Treasuries has widened to 108 basis points from a low of 78 basis points in April. China offers a spread of 155, even though it is rated five levels higher than the Philippines by S&P Global Ratings, and Indonesia 227. Mr Duterte, who met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing this week to mend relations strained over territorial disputes, wants to build on his nation's US$19 billion in exports shipped in 2015 to China, its biggest trading partner. He raised a middle finger when cursing the EU last month for criticism of his drug war, in which police data shows more than 3,000 suspects have been killed. He told an investment forum in Beijing on Thursday that he announced "separation from the US, both military" and economic, after saying Wednesday night "it's time to say goodbye". Mr Duterte, whose term started June 30, said he was mulling plans to require US visitors to the Philippines to obtain a visa and he might go to Russian President Vladimir Putin and tell him "there's three of us against the world". On Thursday, State Department spokesman John Kirby described the US as "baffled" by Mr Duterte's rhetoric. "That creates another round of uncertainty in the financial markets," said Joey Cuyegkeng, a senior economist in Manila at ING Groep NV. "I don't know whether it's posturing to further the relationship with China or it's part of his anti-US rhetoric." The peso fell 0.3 per cent as of 9:30am Manila time on Friday. The currency dropped to the weakest in seven years this month and US$298 million fled the nation's bonds in August. Mr Duterte needs funding as he plans to boost 2017 government spending 12 per cent, widening the deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product from an estimated 2.7 per cent this year. The current-account surplus may slide to US$3 billion next year from US$5.8 billion this year due to rising imports, the central bank said in September. Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said aid from Chinese partners would include a US$3 billion credit facility from Bank of China Ltd. Pacts on transport infrastructure, financing from Export-Import Bank were among those forged as China committed to support development in the Philippines. "Philippine bonds exhibit a very low spread versus US Treasuries, meaning their spread doesn't offer much protection," said Brigitte Le Bris, head of emerging-market debt and currencies in Paris at Natixis Asset Management, which oversees US$365 billion. "Mr Duterte's comments about the US, about the EU were very badly perceived by the market." Demand for the nation's US dollar bonds from local banks has played a key role in limiting the yield spread blowout as they invest money remitted by Filipinos working overseas. The sovereign spread is a benchmark for company yield premiums. Among the largest corporate issues are the US$1.2 billion debt due 2024 of state-owned Power Sector Assets & Liabilities Management Corp, and the US$750 million and US$516 million notes due 2023 of conglomerates JG Summit Holdings Corp and San Miguel Corp. "I have to see what will happen with the politics," said London-based Sergei Strigo, head of emerging-market debt management at Amundi, which oversees US$1.1 trillion. "Obviously, we're monitoring the situation but for this time we still prefer Indonesia on a relative-value basis."

White Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf, one of the CEOs of Berkshire Hathaway's big four investments, sat down with CNBC over the weekend at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, to talk about Warren Buffett, the folksy billionaire next door, in an interview airing on May 4, 2015. CNBC / NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Share Share Tweet Share Email Print Comment advertisement Big banks are making their shareholders happy, but ordinary Americans just don't trust them anymore, and that cynicism is weakening institutional trust across the board. Even with the shadow of a $185 million settlement hanging over one of its biggest players, the top banks had a good quarter: Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and even scandal-plagued Wells Fargo all beat analyst expectations when they announced their quarterly earnings last week. Chase, in particular, did much better than expected, as did Bank of America, which reported earnings Monday morning. Customers are less excited than investors, though. According to YouGov BrandIndex, which measures consumer perception, the banking sector actually had been rebuilding its reputation since customer sentiment plummeted during the recession, but the Wells Fargo scandal is changing people's views. Downward drag "You can see that banks in general have stayed pretty negative for much of the period from 2008 to 2014. As we've come out of the recession, people are feeling less negative," said YouGov BrandIndex CEO Ted Marzilli. "For Wells Fargo specifically, that brand has seen very large decreases in consumer perception. That's dragging down the whole sector," he said. Wells Fargo said the number of checking accounts opened fell by 25 percent, and the number of credit card openings dropped by 20 percent in September, compared with a year ago. "This is a scandal that touches at the heart of the relationship with customers," said Luigi Zingales, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. "It is really an image of breaching some fundamental trust that undermines not only the relationship with Wells Fargo, but the relationship with the financial institutions at large," he said. Related: After Wells Fargo Settlement, Questions About the Scandal Emerge Much of the focus has been on cross-selling and the aggressive pursuit of account-opening goals that boosted numbers at the expense of customers. In the aftermath of the settlement, Wells Fargo said it would stop the practice and place more emphasis on customer service. JPMorgan also touched on the topic of cross-selling, with CFO Marianne Lake saying that the bank had looked into the practice and found some issues, although she said they weren't "systemic." Some consumer advocates say the problem of prizing profits over people in big-bank culture goes deeper than sales tactics. "The Wells Fargo scandal confirmed to consumers that banks are more fixated on making money than helping their customers build wealth," Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director for U.S. PIRG, said via email. Loyalty on the wane Research about the consumer banking sector shows that loyalty and trust are scarce commodities. An Accenture survey found that only 30 percent of bank customers say they're loyal to their bank, and about a quarter were shopping around for another institution. A Gallup poll conducted in June, before the Wells Fargo scandal broke, found that Americans' trust in banks plunged 22 percentage points from 10 years earlier. While nearly half of respondents said before the recession that they trust banks, just over one in four say the same now. The lack of trust does seem to vary based on the type and size of the financial institution: A survey by the Chicago Booth/Kellogg School Financial Trust Index found that a majority of people trust credit unions and local banks, but the numbers are far lower for national banks and banks in which the government has a stake. "The impression that the national banks are not treating customers well is something that's been going on for a long time," said Zingales, one of the Index's creators. Related: Labor Department Will Probe Wells Fargo A report by the Brunswick Group blamed public mistrust in financial institutions for a more pervasive suspiciousness. "This view is exacerbated by a global perception that banks are part of an establishment that has ignored and hindered everyone except for those in the top 1 percent. This can be seen in the Brexit vote, as well as in the U.S. election," the report observed. In the U.S., this has implications beyond Wall Street, Zingales said. Conspiracy theories are thriving in this election cycle, and populist sentiment has been rising in voters of all political affiliations. "The mistrust they are developing in business is spilling over — now they don't trust anything," he said. Martha C.

Monday, November 21, 2016 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  European banks risk lagging Wall Street in blockchain race October 21, 2016, Friday LONDON: The blockchain technology behind bitcoin was designed to do away with banks. In an ironic reverse, investment banks are now racing to make it work for them – but cash-strapped European players risk falling behind their Wall Street rivals. Blockchain was developed eight years ago, enabling transactions using the digital currency to be processed and settled on a public network without the need for a third party. Now banks are seeking to apply it to private networks they run, to save costs by reducing settlement times and automating systems that are still paper-based, like in trade finance. About 80 per cent of top global banks will have launched blockchain projects by next year, the World Economic Forum (WEF) said in August, describing the technology as the future ‘beating heart’ of the financial sector. A survey of 200 top global banks by tech firm IBM last month found that 15 per cent will have rolled out commercial blockchain products by the end of 2017. But there is likely to be a transatlantic imbalance in bringing out such products, given the costs involved in developing new technology. While US investment banks moved quickly to restructure and recapitalise after the financial crisis, European players are still struggling with cost-cutting and shoring up their balance sheets. Dozens of patent applications have been filed in total by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America for blockchain-based products, but there is a record of only one being filed by a European bank – Switzerland’s UBS. “The European banks are cost-focused, whereas US banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are likely trying to generate revenue, because they’re in different market conditions,” said Simon Taylor, who was in charge of blockchain product development at Barclays for two years until he left in June to co-found London fintech consultancy 11:FS. “Reading between the lines, that says: ‘we want to profit from this, we want to build the thing,’” he said of American banks. Taylor said that dynamic was playing out not just in terms of the amounts of investment in blockchain projects, but also in how US banks are seeking to develop their own products while European banks are taking a more collaborative and less aggressive approach. No leading bank has publicly said how much it has invested in blockchain. The six global banks approached by Reuters for this story – in the United States and Europe – declined to say how much they had spent. The WEF estimates a total of about US$1.5 billion has been invested in blockchain by all industries, including financial institutions and tech companies. The UBS ‘fintech lab’ on the 42nd floor of One Canada Square tower in London’s Canary Wharf financial district does not look much like a bank office. Ideas are scrawled onto walls in pen and Post-It notes adorn a see-through dividing panel. UBS is regarded in the industry as one of the most innovative European banks. It radically restructured its investment banking arm in 2012 – earlier than most of its European competitors – to focus more on wealth management, but it faces the same cost-cutting pressures. “There’s constant pressure to deliver,” said the bank’s blockchain lead Alex Batlin, who is leaving for BNY Mellon – which until recently has not appeared very active in its work on the technology but now seems to be on a spending spree, recently advertising 37 open positions on Blocktribe.com, a website dedicated to blockchain jobs. “I always saw this as a Columbus mission – we go out and look for gold, we don’t know what’s going to happen, but if we do discover something it could be massive and therefore it’s worth investing in,” Batlin said, adding that he was always careful to deliver “shareholder value”.  — Reuters What do you think of this story?

 Trivago is planning to go public by Thanksgiving Portia Crowe Oct. 20, 2016, 5:57 PM 8,367 facebook linkedin twitter email print YouTube/trivago Trivago, the online hotel reservation company backed by Expedia, is expected to list its shares in New York by the end of November, according to people familiar with the matter. Expedia, which owns a majority stake in Trivago, has hired JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley to run the flotation, which will take place on the Nasdaq. Analysts have valued the business at $5 billion. The deal size wasn't immediately clear, but one person said that Trivago had initially told bankers it was interested in raising as much as $1 billion. That would make it the largest tech IPO in the US this year, and — to this person — is a stretch.  Expedia said in July that it would explore an IPO of Trivago, with an aim to list the shares by the end of the year.  "An IPO would allow investors to value Trivago as a separate standalone company," Expedia's CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said at the time. "Expedia does not plan to sell any of our shares in an IPO, and there are no guarantees that an IPO will ultimately be pursued or be successful." Expedia said in July that Trivago had generated $200 million in revenue in the second quarter, and more than $660 million on a trailing 12-month basis. That means it was able to file its S-1 document under the Jumpstart our Business Startups (or JOBS) Act, which allows small companies with less than $1 billion in annual revenue to file for IPOs privately with the SEC. Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi attends the Allen & Co Media Conference in Sun Valley. Thomson Reuters Once the offering document is public, the company has to wait three weeks before the share sale can proceed. Trivago could make its filing public as soon as next week in order to list by Thanksgiving.  Of course, an IPO in late November would be dependent on investor appetite for new shares following the US presidential election. The flotation could be derailed by a volatile market. The listing would mark another step toward the tech IPO market's comeback. Deal activity all but stopped last year as investor sentiment soured, and has been slow to pick up in 2016.  The largest tech IPO to date was by Japanese messaging app Line, which listed in Tokyo and New York in July and raised $1.24 billion, about two-thirds of which was in the US. Expedia declined to comment. Reuters previously reported that the company has hired banks for the deal.

(AMZN) Stock’s “Trump Threat” Is Overblown Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Hit Another Bump in the Road Recent Posts: Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Is a Buy if You Can Stomach the Volatility The PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL) Stock Growth Story Is Just Beginning Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is as Big a Buy as Ever View All Posts Shares in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) continued to drift higher since it posted better-than-expected third-quarter results, which puts BAC stock on course to break even for the year. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr It will be a heck of a resilient performance if BAC can end the year with gains. Shares were down nearly 30% around the time the market suffered a late-June selloff. With BAC showing progress in everything from trading to loans to cost cuts, sentiment is finally at its back. Take a look at BAC’s price-to-book ratio, which has been climbing for more than three months. It’s up to 0.68 from a midsummer low of 0.55. True, a PB below one on a bank stock indicates investors have questions about the bank’s risk profile. But at least the trend suggests that BofA is starting to get the benefit of the market’s doubt. A greater sense of optimism can be seen in BAC stock’s relative performance since the June tumble. Shares are up 35% since then. That smokes the money-center bank competition: JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) gained just 6% over the same span. Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) is up 28%. Naturally Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) is negative. 16 Best Stocks to Buy Under President Hillary Clinton At last it’s starting to dawn on the market that there is value to be had in Bank of America stock. The firm is making strong progress on the top and bottom lines and has more cost cuts to go. At the same time, shares look cheap. The bank’s price-to-book made sense in wake of the financial crisis, but BofA is well past that now. Plenty of Risk for BAC Stock Every investment comes with risk and Bank of America has plenty. On the big stage, the firm is highly levered to the health of the domestic economy. For the most part that’s been a source of good news. Although, low oil prices give BAC trouble with its loans to the energy industry, the total exposure is quite low. More importantly, unemployment is low, while hiring and wages are up. Consumer confidence and the housing market are generally positive too. Other risks, as pointed out by analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, include the depth of the management bench and future federal stress tests. But of course a prolonged period of low interest rates is the biggest knock against banks. Remember that even if the Federal Reserve’s lifts rates as expected in December, that only applies to the short part of the yield curve. Beyond that, the market remains in control. As long as low inflation expectations and a generalized fear of risk persist, you can bet that rates will remain under pressure. Lastly, there’s been some hand-wringing over the Department of Labor’s contentious fiduciary rule. BAC said it will minimally impact revenue, with the caveat that it was still “too soon to tell.” Just keep in mind that, KBW notes, the Department of Labor rule would impact less than 10% of the bank’s $2 trillion of client assets. American Express Company (AXP) Stock Climbs Higher on Earnings Beat It could take a long time before the market starts valuing BAC more on the future than its past. That doesn’t mean the value isn’t there. As of this writing, Dan Burrows did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Sulzberger will take over the newspaper company that has struggled to reinvent itself. New York Times Co.’s heir apparent is inheriting a newspaper company that’s struggling to transform itself. His cross-town rival is getting more support from Wall Street as it faces the same challenges. Times Co. shares are down 14% this year—while the Wall Street Journal owner’s stock has risen slightly—as investors question whether the Times’ new global strategy can offset the exodus of advertisers. Last quarter, the loss of print advertising accelerated, while digital ad revenue slumped for the second period in a row. The Journal has had its own struggles, but its parent News Corp. has other divisions to rely on. The Times sold off its other units in recent years, putting all its eggs in one basket: journalism. Arthur Gregg Sulzberger, 36, whose promotion to deputy publisher on Wednesday positions him to become the Times’ next publisher and chairman, will eventually take over a company that looks very different from the one that his father, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., has led for two decades. Gone are the website About.com, other newspapers like the Boston Globe and an investment in the Discovery Times cable channel. “The New York Times sold everything that’s not nailed down to pay down their debt, so they have as long a runway as possible to deliver a digital business,” said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “While the company has clearly established a vibrant digital business, the jury is still out on whether that can offset the declining print business.” The Times’ strategy stands in contrast to the one employed by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., which owns the Wall Street Journal, but is diversifying to be less exposed to the newspaper industry’s struggles. The company, spun off from 21st Century Fox in 2013, has found growth in its digital real estate unit, where sales rose 21% last quarter. It also owns book publisher Harper Collins, newspapers in the U.K. and a pay-TV company in Australia. It recently got into the British radio business as well. News Corp. shares were up 2.2% this year through Wednesday even though the flagship newspaper has struggled like the Times. The more diverse revenue base has made shareholders more forgiving. Of four analysts who cover Times Co., none recommends buying the stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Six out of 12 advise buying News Corp. shares. “Because they are investing in non-newspaper businesses, and specifically in digital businesses, there’s more diversity,” said Alexia Quadrani, a media analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. who has a “hold” rating on the stock. “It gives investors hope.” Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with News Corp. in providing financial news and services. Cutting costs Both newspapers are taking measures to cut costs and reshape themselves to contend with the industry’s threats. In May, the Times offered buyouts to newsroom staffers and employees in its business departments, without ruling out the possibility of firings. News Corp.’s Dow Jones division told the union at the Wall Street Journal it’s preparing to restructure and may eliminate some jobs, the newspaper reported this week. In a memo Wednesday, William Lewis, chief executive officer of Dow Jones, said he was starting a review of the Journal’s operations. “These are challenging times,” Lewis said. “I thank you in advance for your patience and understanding as we set about the difficult task of continuing to build our digital future while responding to the decline in traditional advertising.” The rest of the newspaper industry isn’t doing much better. Publishers are merging and slashing costs to buy time while figuring out how to make more money online. A fortunate few newspapers have been bought by billionaires—like the Washington Post’s Jeff Bezos—who are willing to give the newsroom time and resources to try new things. As readers get more of their news online, newspaper advertising is expected to shrink to $5 billion by 2019 from a peak of $49 billion in 2005, according to the ad agency Magna Global. The Times has outlined its own strategy for adapting to the shifting landscape. It plans to rely more on readers paying for its journalism and double its digital revenue in the next four years. A big part of that effort will involve spending $50 million to expand its audience around the world. Last week, for instance, the Times unveiled a new, redesigned international edition, in print and online, to attract paid readers outside the U.S. 'Amazing success' Quadrani said the Times has had “amazing success” with its online subscription business, which has more than 1.4 million customers. The Wall Street Journal recently topped 1 million digital-only subscribers. The Times and Journal “are the only two newspapers in this country that have created viable and vibrant digital platforms,” Sweeney said. Few understand the Times’ challenges better than the younger Sulzberger, who has been responsible for leading a team focused on the newsroom’s digital transformation. He led the task force that two years ago wrote its “Innovation Report,” which detailed how the newspaper needed to adapt to new competition from digital media companies such as BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post. A new report on how the Times will prepare for the future is now under way. “He has a strong technological background,” Sweeney said of Sulzberger. “It’s a new generation of family ownership that understands the opportunity of the digital world.” The Times, like Murdoch’s News Corp. and many other media companies, has two classes of voting shares that insulate the controlling family from Wall Street pressure. Thanks to its 11% stake in the company, the Sulzberger family, including a trust, receives about $2.8 million a year in dividends, based on company filings. The Times suspended the dividend in 2009 as it coped with the increasing damage the internet was inflicting on print advertising. A 4-cent a share quarterly payout was restored in late 2013. “Many newspaper families have sold out because they recognized the newspaper business can no longer support dividends and equity value,” Sweeney said. “But the Sulzberger family really believes that the New York Times plays a role in society and has global value.” Bloomberg LPNew York Times Co.News Corp.Rupert MurdochWall StreetInternationalTechnologyReal EstateNew YorkThe Wall Street JournalDataInvestment Get Crain's Digital NY Alert Sign up for our FREE weekly Digital NY email newsletter.

The stock is leading the S&P 500 with a 10 percent gain. American Express beat earnings estimates by $0.23, $1.20 vs $0.97 consensus estimate. A major key for the American Express' solid quarter was that planned expense saves were realized faster than expected, which in turn boosted 2016 EPS guidance. Increasing competition from JPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE: JPM) remains American Express' biggest threat. "We believe rewards competition continues to e one of the biggest risks to AXP, especially after JP Morgan's wildly successful launch of the Chase Sapphire Reserve card," Barclays said in a note. American Express is working to improve its Platinum cards value, which could weigh on rewards expenses in 2017. "Given the compelling value Chase gives cardholders for spend on travel and dining, we are concerned that AXP will struggle to sustain its share of high spend transactors," Barclays added. Barclays maintains an Equal-Weight rating on American Express with a $63.00 price target.

The National Credit Union Administration said the contingency fees represented 23.2 percent of the $4.3 billion the agency recovered in settlements with banks over their sale of faulty securities to five credit unions that later failed. The announcement marked the first time the NCUA had revealed the lawsuits' costs. NCUA Board Chairman Rick Metsger said the agency previously withheld disclosing its fee arrangements to protect its litigation position and ensure maximum returns. "Without this fee arrangement, which shifted most of the risk of these legal actions to outside counsel, there would have been no legal investigation of potential claims, no litigation, and no legal recoveries," Metsger said. The payouts came after settlements with banks, including Morgan Stanley, (MS.N) Bank of America Corp,(BAC.N) JPMorgan Chase & CO (JPM.N) and Barclays Plc(BARC.L). Most recently, last month the NCUA announced a $1.1 billion deal with Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc(RBS.L). The payouts went to two law firms, Korein Tillery LLC and Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel PLLC, which pursued lawsuits against the banks. Neither firm immediately responded to a request for comment on Thursday. The sum was more than double what another regulator that pursued a similar set of lawsuits against many of the same banks last year said it paid while obtaining an even larger amount of recoveries. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which has acted as conservator for mortgage funders Fannie Mae (FNMA.PK) and Freddie Mac FMCC (FMCC.PK) since their government takeover in 2008, in September 2015 disclosed paying two other law firms $406.7 million. The sum, which reflected around 2 percent of the $18.7 billion it obtained through settlements and judgments against 16 banks, has likely grown since then amid ongoing litigation by FHFA against RBS. The FHFA had no immediate comment on Thursday.
