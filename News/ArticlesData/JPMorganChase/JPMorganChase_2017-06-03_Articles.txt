Besides economics, trade and education, “there should be a consistent political and defence dialogue about the world”, not just about the South China Sea, but also issues from North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme to the Middle East peace process, he said. “We all have a common interest in getting these things right, and you’re not going to get them right if you don’t talk about it,” Dimon said during an interview in Hong Kong with the South China Morning Post. The US and China had been conducting half-yearly meetings called the strategic economic dialogue since 2006 during the administrations of George W. Bush and former Chinese president Hu Jintao. Headed by treasury and finance ministry officials in both countries, five such dialogues were held between 2006 and 2008. During the Barack Obama administration and the years under Hu and his successor Xi Jinping, the strategic economic dialogue was expanded to give the US State Department a greater role and renamed the strategic and economic dialogue. Trump, who came to occupy the White House with no prior experience in public office and governing, has surrounded himself with military men, business leaders and Wall Street executives for advice and counsel, in addition to the family members who form his inner circle. Several of them make up the business advisory council, led by Blackstone Group’s chief executive Stephen Schwarzman and comprising Dimon, PepsiCo’s chief executive Indra Nooyi and General Motors chief executive Mary Barra. Things have not gone well with Trump’s new administration, leading to three business advisers quitting since February. Uber Technologies co-founder Travis Kalanick was first to resign after he faced blowback from Uber drivers and riders over Trump’s executive order on immigration. Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk and Walt Disney’s chief executive Bob Iger both quit their advisory roles this week after Trump announced he would pull the US from the Paris climate accord. Dimon himself does not agree with everything that Trump says or does and “absolutely disagreed” with Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris pact. “I don’t know anyone who agrees with everything that a president or prime minister says,” Dimon said. The key was to “engage each other and have more open dialogue”, he said. Head of the largest US bank since 2004, Dimon, 61, has spent his career making deals all over the world, with years in Asia and China. Some of the experience may offer alternatives to the new president and help him ditch his campaign rhetoric for the art of governance. China was not a currency manipulator although the country had engaged in trade practices that were not entirely free or fair, Dimon said, citing cybersecurity, intellectual property, tariffs and the non-fulfilment of World Trade Organisation obligations. “I think the Chinese know that, and I don’t think they deny that. But it’s not about yelling and screaming and pointing fingers, it’s about sitting down, having a constructive dialogue”, and recognising that “what might have been fair 15 years ago may not be fair today”, he said. The country was also making efforts and progress towards becoming a market economy, he said. What matters to American businesses, including the ones headed by Trump’s corporate advisers, is the WTO’s principle of reciprocal right to markets, particularly one with the size of China’s 1.3 billion people. “I don’t think many people among the US business community operating in China were particularly concerned about whether China was manipulating the yuan,” said Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis, Greater China and North Asia, at Control Risks. “They are more concerned about reciprocity.” China’s banking regulator in March loosened the licensing requirement on foreign banks, part of the process of liberalising the financial industry, a move that is lauded by the man whose bank reports US$700 million in revenue from China. “One day as China opens, I want to own 100 per cent of our activities in China, not 49 per cent, and do anything,” he said. “I honestly believe that 49 per cent ownership could be a structural issue.” An open market would help China improve the efficiency of state enterprises and nip corruption in the country, he said, adding that his bank could play an important part in helping to improve corporate disclosure and enhance corporate standards of Chinese companies. Dimon, who got an earful from investors during JPMorgan’s shareholders’ meeting three weeks ago for his advisory role in the Trump circle, said he would continue to offer his counsel. “I am a patriot, I want to help the president to do a better job,” he said. The president is the pilot of a plane, and “if you’re in an air plane, you’d better be rooting for that pilot”.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File PhotoMore By David Shepardson and Susan Heavey WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several major U.S. companies, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and IBM Corp (IBM.N), on Friday said their CEOs will remain in an influential presidential advisory group despite objecting to President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. Citing the need to stay engaged with the administration, business leaders said they would remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies. Trump, a Republican, on Thursday said he would pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) CEO Robert Iger reacted by leaving White House advisory councils after Trump's move. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Asked about CEOs' criticism of the U.S. withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets. Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, added he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council. A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the largest U.S. retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council. McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was "disappointed in today's news about the Paris Agreement. We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions." IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord. "IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration – as we do with governments around the world," a company spokeswoman said. Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said. Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), criticized Trump's decision. The company acknowledged Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group. "I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said in a statement. PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table." 'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL' Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N). General Electric Co (GE.N) CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump's manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added: "Industry must now lead and not depend on government." Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people." Boeing Co (BA.N) Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said. Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost U.S. economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for U.S. goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. Read More "If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption." The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders. Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment." "If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP (BX.N). Blackrock Inc (BLK.N) Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors Co (GM.N) said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's (F.N) new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group. In February, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies.

General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump's manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added: "Industry must now lead and not depend on government." Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people." Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said. Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost US economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for US goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. "If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption." The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders. Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment." "If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP. Blackrock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group. In February, Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies.

A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the largest U.S. retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council.

We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions." IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord.

Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said. Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co, criticized Trump's decision. The company acknowledged Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group. "I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said in a statement. PepsiCo Inc Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table." 'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL' Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Goldman Sachs. General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump's manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added: "Industry must now lead and not depend on government." Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people." Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said. Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost U.S. economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for U.S. goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. "If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption." The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders. Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment." "If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP. Blackrock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group. In February, Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies.

Citing the need to stay engaged with the administration, business leaders said they would remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies. Trump, a Republican, on Thursday said he would pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger reacted by leaving White House advisory councils after Trump's move. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President's Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Asked about CEOs' criticism of the U.S. withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets. Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, added he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council. A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the largest U.S. retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council. McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was "disappointed in today's news about the Paris Agreement. We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions." IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord. "IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration - as we do with governments around the world," a company spokeswoman said.

The sales, if any, would be made in „at the market” equity offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act.

Since the Reserve Bank of Australia’s last policy decision on May 2, market bets on an interest-rate cut by the end of this year have doubled. While that chance is still only about 20 percent, swaps traders see Australia as one of just two developed economies where cuts are possible in the coming year after data during May pointed to anemic growth in the first quarter. Philip Lowe Photographer: Brendon Thorne/Bloomberg For now, a mixed picture means Governor Philip Lowe will likely hold the benchmark rate at a record-low 1.5 percent on Tuesday. While reports since the RBA’s last meeting show strong employment gains and a surprise rebound in retail sales, construction has been soft and wage growth stagnant. Signs of a cooling housing market could also give the central bank leeway to ease down the track, after prices dropped in May for the first time in 18 months. “I’ve got high conviction in our view that rates will go lower,” said Sally Auld, chief economist for Australia at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Sydney, who expects a rate cut next quarter. “We see risks that growth and inflation will probably disappoint relative to the RBA’s forecast.” The doves are still very much a minority. More than half of 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the cash rate to be on hold until at least the middle of next year, with six predicting a hike by then; Auld is among just five forecasting a cut. No economists expect any change on Tuesday. There are two factors likely to keep the RBA on hold this month, Auld said. First, it’s awaiting more evidence of how lending curbs are impacting the hot east-coast property markets. Prices in the country’s five biggest cities fell 1.1 percent in May, according to a CoreLogic report last week, including a 1.3 percent drop in Sydney.

Secondly, uncertainty surrounds the temporary effects of Cyclone Debbie, which knocked out mine-to-port rail lines in the North Queensland coal fields for several weeks in April, meaning exports are likely to take a significant hit. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up The past two weeks have also seen sluggish readings of GDP components. Ahead of first-quarter data due Wednesday,  some economists are suggesting a contraction for the three months. That followed a 0.7 percent drop in construction and a modest 0.3 percent rise in business spending in the period. National Australia Bank Ltd. last week even flagged the possibility of a technical recession in the second quarter. The RBA also has an eye on weak consumption. Retail sales grew just 0.1 percent in the first quarter, while some well-known clothing stores, including Herringbone and Topshop Australia, have gone into administration. On a brighter note, sales rebounded 1 percent in April, though that was partly put down to post-cyclone restocking. Despite the better-than-expected monthly result, “the underlying trend remains soft with spending constrained by weak wages growth and elevated underemployment," Kristina Clifton, an economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a note. With limited scope to ease policy further, the central bank may be hoping that a ramp up in public spending on infrastructure will help drive growth in the years ahead. In its annual budget in May, the government announced A$75 billion ($56 billion) of investment in projects over the next decade after repeated calls from the RBA and economists for such spending. But the past month’s biggest stimulus was neither the central bank’s or the government’s doing. The Aussie dollar fell 1.3 percent against the U.S. dollar in May as the price of iron ore -- the nation’s biggest export -- continued its decline. “I’m sure they’re particularly happy with the currency here at 74 cents and would prefer to leave it that way,” said Annette Beacher, head of Asia-Pacific research at TD Securities in Singapore. “I think net-net everything is sufficiently mixed for the RBA to sit back.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The U.S. economy is expected to expand at a 3.4 percent annualized pace in the second quarter based on a weaker-than-expected report on domestic payrolls in May, the Atlanta Federal Reserve's latest GDP Now forecast model showed. The latest second-quarter gross domestic product estimate was slower than the previous reading of 4.0 percent calculated on Thursday, the Atlanta Fed said. The apparent downgrade came just after U.S. job growth slowed in May and employment gains in the prior two months were not as strong as previously reported, suggesting the labor market was losing momentum despite the unemployment rate falling to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent. Nonfarm payrolls increased 138,000 last month as the manufacturing, government and retail sectors lost jobs, the Labor Department said on Friday. The economy created 66,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in March and April. Last month's job gains could still be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. "While the message was a little muddied today, the evidence generally suggests the labor market is cyclically tightening, and the Fed will need to continue to lean against that," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. "We still believe it is very likely that the Fed will hike later this month. Perhaps more in question is the signal coming out of that meeting regarding subsequent hikes." Details of the employment report were weak. Though the unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to its lowest level since May 2001, that was because 429,000 people dropped out of the labor force. The survey of households from which the unemployment rate is derived also showed a drop in employment. The jobless rate has declined five-tenths of a percentage point this year. Average hourly earnings rose 4 cents or 0.2 percent in May after a similar gain in April, leaving the year-on-year increase in wages at 2.5 percent. Job growth has decelerated from the 181,000 monthly average over the past 12 months as the labor market nears full employment. There is growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find qualified workers. Economists also believe that companies might be holding off hiring amid worries political scandals engulfing President Donald Trump could imperil his economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. "Political uncertainty in Washington is another factor holding back the job market," said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo. "The probability that any of the Trump stimulus would become reality has decreased significantly in recent weeks." Economists had forecast payrolls increasing 185,000 last month and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.4 percent. The Fed raised interest rates in March. A Reuters survey of banks that do business directly with the Fed, conducted after the employment report, showed all 18 primary dealers polled expected the U.S. central bank to raise rates this month. Ten forecast further monetary policy tightening in September and only six saw a rate hike in December. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 7 Time Management Secrets From Exceptionally Successful CEOs How can you manage your time more effectively? Here are seven ways from CEOs of successful companies. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Jun 4, 2017 at 9:43AM The Rolling Stones had it wrong. Time isn't on our side. Every person, regardless of age or occupation, battles the clock. For many of us, there simply doesn't seem to be enough time in each day to accomplish what we need to do. But some manage time more effectively than others. The CEOs of General Electric (NYSE:GE), PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP), Square (NYSE:SQ) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), VMWare (NYSE:VMW), the Asset Management division of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), LinkedIn (now part of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) have at least two things in common. They're all executives of well-known companies with products used by millions. And they all have unique ways of managing their time. Here are seven time management secrets from these exceptionally successful CEOs. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Start early in the morning Jeff Immelt has been with General Electric since 1982, and took the reins from previous CEO Jack Welch in 2001. Immelt has a tough job running one of the largest conglomerates with operations spanning the world. One way he squeezes the most out of every day is by starting early: Immelt is up at 5:30 each morning. In 2005, he told Fortune magazine that "there are 24 hours in a day, and you can use all of them." 2. Find a balance between short-term and long-term Indra Nooyi joined PepsiCo in 1994 and was named the CEO of the multinational food and beverage company in 2006. Like GE's Jeff Immelt, Nooyi is also an early bird. She wakes up around 4 a.m. and is usually at work by 7 a.m. One of Nooyi's approaches to managing PepsiCo can also be applied to personal time management: Balance your short-term objectives with your long-term goals. You need to look at the things that pay off in the short run, and balance your time on those items with others that have longer-term returns. 3. Give each day a theme Jack Dorsey really has to be smart at managing his time. He's the CEO and co-founder of social-media company Twitter and payment-processing specialist Square. How does Dorsey run two major companies simultaneously? One way he does it is by giving each day a theme. Dorsey focuses on a different primary area each day of the week. For example, Mondays might be for general management functions, while Tuesdays could be focused on product development, and so on. 4. Color-code your schedule Pat Gelsinger became CEO of VMWare in 2012 after a successful career serving in executive roles with several other technology companies. He told the Wall Street Journal in 2014 that he color-codes every minute of his day on his schedule. Different colors are used for different activities, such as turquoise for meetings with customers and yellow for strategy review. Gelsinger has an intern later analyze how his use of time compares with studies that have been done on executive time management. Image source: Getty Images. 5. Own your calendar While Jamie Dimon is CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Mary Callahan Erdoes is the highly successful CEO of the company's asset-management business. As the leader of one of the largest asset-management companies in the world, Erdoes finds time is crucial. She told CNBC that "calendar management is the single biggest thing" in managing time. Erdoes said that you have to be "maniacally focused on owning your calendar, on having the lists of what you need from other people and what other people need from you." She stated that if you don't own your calendar, it will wind up owning you. 6. Carve out time to think LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner led the professional social-network company to sell out to Microsoft last year. However, Weiner still serves as CEO of LinkedIn. And he's probably still applying the time-management tip he gave to The Wall Street Journal five years ago: "carving out time to think." Weiner's advice was to not be constantly reacting to things, instead focusing some time on proactive, strategic thinking. 7. Always focus on your business Warren Buffett said recently that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is "the most remarkable businessperson of our age." That's high praise coming from one of the most successful businesspeople of the last century. Bezos employs several methods for managing his time effectively. One of the most important is to always focus on the business: Bezos brainstorms ideas for Amazon during his commute to work, and on airplanes. In his view, every moment of the day can be productive.

With market bets hovering near 90 per cent and Federal Reserve officials continuing to point to solid economic momentum, policy makers seem certain to vote to increase rates for the second time this year at their June 13-14 meeting. The debate has already begun to intensify about whether the Fed will then pause or hike rates again before the end of the calendar year. Fed officials have tipped the potential for three or even four hikes in all this year but they'll have to contend with still somewhat messy data. On the weekend, the US Labor Department said the economy there added 138,000 jobs last month, well below forecasts of 185,000; April's initial 211,000 additions were pared to 174,000, March's 79,000 to 50,000, suggesting the labour market is losing some momentum. Wage growth also disappointed, remaining stuck at an annual rate of 2.5 per cent. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Over the weekend, policy hawk Patrick Harker, president of the Fed bank in Philadelphia, affirmed his bullish view for rates: "I still see three hikes of 25 basis points each as appropriate for 2017." Photo: Andrew Harrer But the unemployment rate dipped to 4.3 per cent last month – the lowest since 2001 – from 4.4 per cent in April and 4.5 per cent in March. Since January, the unemployment rate has declined by 0.5 percentage point, and the number of unemployed has decreased by 774,000. "While the message was a little muddied, the evidence generally suggests the labour market is cyclically tightening, and the Fed will need to continue to lean against that," JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli said. Advertisement "We still believe it is very likely that the Fed will hike later this month. Perhaps more in question is the signal coming out of that meeting regarding subsequent hikes." Goldman Sachs on Friday pushed back its forecast for a third rate increase this year to December from September, while market pricing suggests less than an even chance of another rate rise by the end of the year, and investors are now pricing in less than one further rate hike in 2018. That's increasingly at odds with Fed projections of three rate hikes in both 2017 and 2018. Increasing yields Not all economists are as gloomy as market pricing suggests. "With survey evidence suggesting that it [the jobless rate] will fall below 4 per cent in the next few months, and wage growth likely to pick up before long, we expect the Fed to raise rates steadily over the next year and a half," said Capital Economics' Oliver Jones, in making a bullish case. That should lead the yield on 10-year US Treasury notes higher, Mr Jones said. He's forecasting the 10-year yield will rise to 3.5 per cent by the end of 2018. It's an aggressive bet. On Friday, the 10-year yield slid 5 basis points to 2.16 per cent, near a seven-month low. The 10-year yield reached as high as 2.64 per cent in mid-March as investors positioned for an acceleration in economic growth. But President Donald Trump's political troubles undercut that optimism, belting bonds. In contrast, US stocks have managed to extend their rally since Trump's election, shifting from the Trump reflation trade to buoyant first-quarter earnings – it hasn't hurt that the biggest technology stocks including Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook, have surged. Over the weekend Apple's market capitalisation topped the $US800 billion mark. Amazon last week cleared the $US1000 a share mark. Investors tolerance for risk seems undaunted. "Year to date equity performance remains very concentrated, with FANG [Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google] and technology representing 65 per cent of YTD gains," Fundstrat's Thomas Lee and associates said in a June 2 report. "In other words, unless an investor owned FANG [and its cousins] this year, they would be underperforming." On Friday in New York, Wall Street's three key benchmarks each set fresh record highs, helping ASX futures rise 10 points or 0.2 per cent. The S&P/ASX 200 added 50 points or 0.9 per cent on Friday. This week and next investors will be in pre-Fed decision mode and Fed policymakers will fall silent. 'I still see three hikes' Over the weekend though, policy hawk Patrick Harker, president of the Fed bank in Philadelphia, affirmed his bullish view for rates. "Based on the strength of the economy, I still see three hikes of 25 basis points each as appropriate for 2017," he said in remarks for a speech. While he saw "little slack left in the labour market", Mr Harker forecast the jobless rate could fall as low as 4.2 per cent in the year ahead. "In the very near future, we're not going to need to create jobs at the intense pace we've been experiencing over the past few years," Mr Harker said. "The 100,000-jobs-a-month rate is going to be more than sufficient to keep up with population growth. That's more or less the rate we'll need in a normal, healthy economy." As for inflation, Mr Harker also is bullish on it, despite a setback in April. "My forecast remains that we should reach our inflation goal around the end of the year," he said. Key to the Fed reaching its inflation target are higher wages about which he's optimistic. "I estimate wage growth of between 2.5 and 3 per cent this year," Mr Harker said. "This is a very good sign; it's one of the things that's been missing as the recovery has unfolded." Late last week, San Francisco Fed boss John Williams said he still saw three hikes this year, potentially four if the economy gets an unexpected boost. Fed governor Lael Brainard last week offered a more dovish take, citing her wariness about the improving labour market and slowing inflation.

The bulls are back in charge after a second weekly advance pushed the S&P 500 Index to a fresh record. But look a little more closely and the signs of unease in the stock market are hard to ignore. It’s visible in fund flows, where investors are rotating from U.S. stocks to the rest of the world at the fastest pace in two years. And short sellers are getting aggressive, raising bearish bets in three of the past four months. U.S. stocks climbed this week, led by by phone companies and materials producers. The S&P 500 increased 1 percent to 2,438.91 and Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 percent to 21,204.58. While the gains built on the previous week’s breakout, neither index is more than 2 percent above the all-time highs reached on March 1. In other words, benchmark indexes are at records, but they also haven’t advanced much since March, one of the longer periods of stasis since Donald Trump’s election. For all their resilience, equity investors remain anxious about an economy that has recently given uneven evidence of its vigor just as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates. After Friday’s employment report, three-month U.S. jobs growth is now the lowest since 2012. Housing demand weakened more than expected in April, and while manufacturing gauges remain firm, a series of reports on inflation continue to show corporate pricing power is muted. “It is a warning that, as with asset prices, the key question is not the level you are at, but the prospects for growth from here,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds in New York. “Investors should consider whether overseas economies with greater growth potential may provide better equity market returns.” Meanwhile, investors in exchange-traded funds turned net sellers of U.S. stocks in May for the first time in a year, with withdrawals approaching $2 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They added $22 billion to equity funds that invest in markets from Europe to Asia. The divergence in flows, the widest since April 2015, marked a turnaround from last year, when almost $10 went for American equities for every one that went elsewhere. Even as stocks vaulted to new highs, bears aren’t deterred. Short interest as a proportion of total shares outstanding has expanded since January, rising by 0.3 percentage point to 3.9 percent. Never before has an equity advance as big as this year’s occurred simultaneously with more short sales, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg that goes back to 2008. Spotty demand for American stocks coincided with hiccups in economic data. Rather than picking up pace as expected by many at the start of the year, Citigroup’s Economic Surprise Index for the U.S., which measures the difference between actual releases and economist expectations, peaked in March and has since fallen to the lowest level since February 2016. By contrast, similar gauges for the rest of the world have fared better as Brazil and Russia emerged from recessions while the populist political tide receded in Europe. Since the global financial crisis, the U.S. had dominated equity gains worldwide, with rallies underpinned by easier monetary policy and a steady recovery. Now that growth is poised to accelerate from Europe to Japan, American assets are losing some of their appeal. In Bank of America Corp.’s latest survey of money managers, 82 percent called the U.S. the most expensive market. While the S&P 500 is up 8.9 percent this year, it’s poised to trail the MSCI World ex-U.S. Index for the first time since 2009. The dollar is heading for the worst annual decline in a decade after losing about 6 percent of its value against a basket of currencies. Even within the U.S. market itself, the preference for overseas exposure is evident. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket tracking shares with the highest leverage to international growth has risen 17 percent this year, compared with 6 percent for a similar gauge for domestic-focused companies. “The dollar weakness and non-U.S. economic strength is being replayed all over the world,” said Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust in New York. “Rarely have times been better for U.S. firms with global exposure. The auspicious omens are plain to see.” READ MORE ON » stocksstock marketSharesS&Pmonetary policyMarketJPMorgan Funds Comments Add Your Comments NEXT STORY Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You Get a Quote Browse CompaniesABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ|123456789 Browse Mutual FundsABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ The Economic Times Live Market News Portfolio Mobile Live TV Newsletter Commodities Speed QnA Blogs Alerts RSS Other Times Group news sitesTimes of India|इकनॉमिक टाइम्स ઈકોનોમિક ટાઈમ્સ|Mumbai Mirror Times Now|Indiatimes नवभारत टाइम्स|महाराष्ट्र टाइम्स ವಿಜಯ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ|Lifehacker Gizmodo|Eisamay|IGN India NavGujarat Samay Living and entertainmentTimescity|iDiva|Zoom| Luxpresso|Gaana|Happytrips| Cricbuzz|Get Smartapp Networkingitimes|MensXP.com Hot on the WebICC Champions Trophy Live Score|Narendra Modi in Russia Top 10 mutual funds|RERA Xiaomi Redmi 4 Review|BSE Sensex Gold rate today Servicesads2book|Gadgetsnow|Free Business Listings Simplymarry|Astrospeak|Timesjobs|Magicbricks|Zigwheels|Timesdeal| dineout|Filmipop|Remit2india|Gaana|Greetzap|Techradar|Alivear| Google Play | Manage Notifications About us/Advertise with us/Terms of Use & Grievance Redressal/Privacy Policy/Feedback/Sitemap/Code of Ethics//Disclaimer Copyright © 2017 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

With market bets hovering near 90 per cent and Federal Reserve officials continuing to point to solid economic momentum, policy makers seem certain to vote to increase rates for the second time this year at their June 13-14 meeting. The debate has already begun to intensify about whether the Fed will then pause or hike rates again before the end of the calendar year. Fed officials have tipped the potential for three or even four hikes in all this year but they'll have to contend with still somewhat messy data. On the weekend, the US Labor Department said the economy there added 138,000 jobs last month, well below forecasts of 185,000; April's initial 211,000 additions were pared to 174,000, March's 79,000 to 50,000, suggesting the labour market is losing some momentum. Wage growth also disappointed, remaining stuck at an annual rate of 2.5 per cent. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Over the weekend, policy hawk Patrick Harker, president of the Fed bank in Philadelphia, affirmed his bullish view for rates: "I still see three hikes of 25 basis points each as appropriate for 2017." Photo: Andrew Harrer But the unemployment rate dipped to 4.3 per cent last month – the lowest since 2001 – from 4.4 per cent in April and 4.5 per cent in March. Since January, the unemployment rate has declined by 0.5 percentage point, and the number of unemployed has decreased by 774,000. "While the message was a little muddied, the evidence generally suggests the labour market is cyclically tightening, and the Fed will need to continue to lean against that," JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli said. Advertisement "We still believe it is very likely that the Fed will hike later this month. Perhaps more in question is the signal coming out of that meeting regarding subsequent hikes." Goldman Sachs on Friday pushed back its forecast for a third rate increase this year to December from September, while market pricing suggests less than an even chance of another rate rise by the end of the year, and investors are now pricing in less than one further rate hike in 2018. That's increasingly at odds with Fed projections of three rate hikes in both 2017 and 2018. Increasing yields Not all economists are as gloomy as market pricing suggests. "With survey evidence suggesting that it [the jobless rate] will fall below 4 per cent in the next few months, and wage growth likely to pick up before long, we expect the Fed to raise rates steadily over the next year and a half," said Capital Economics' Oliver Jones, in making a bullish case. That should lead the yield on 10-year US Treasury notes higher, Mr Jones said. He's forecasting the 10-year yield will rise to 3.5 per cent by the end of 2018. It's an aggressive bet. On Friday, the 10-year yield slid 5 basis points to 2.16 per cent, near a seven-month low. The 10-year yield reached as high as 2.64 per cent in mid-March as investors positioned for an acceleration in economic growth. But President Donald Trump's political troubles undercut that optimism, belting bonds. In contrast, US stocks have managed to extend their rally since Trump's election, shifting from the Trump reflation trade to buoyant first-quarter earnings – it hasn't hurt that the biggest technology stocks including Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook, have surged. Over the weekend Apple's market capitalisation topped the $US800 billion mark. Amazon last week cleared the $US1000 a share mark. Investors tolerance for risk seems undaunted. "Year to date equity performance remains very concentrated, with FANG [Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google] and technology representing 65 per cent of YTD gains," Fundstrat's Thomas Lee and associates said in a June 2 report. "In other words, unless an investor owned FANG [and its cousins] this year, they would be underperforming." On Friday in New York, Wall Street's three key benchmarks each set fresh record highs, helping ASX futures rise 10 points or 0.2 per cent. The S&P/ASX 200 added 50 points or 0.9 per cent on Friday. This week and next investors will be in pre-Fed decision mode and Fed policymakers will fall silent. 'I still see three hikes' Over the weekend though, policy hawk Patrick Harker, president of the Fed bank in Philadelphia, affirmed his bullish view for rates. "Based on the strength of the economy, I still see three hikes of 25 basis points each as appropriate for 2017," he said in remarks for a speech. While he saw "little slack left in the labour market", Mr Harker forecast the jobless rate could fall as low as 4.2 per cent in the year ahead. "In the very near future, we're not going to need to create jobs at the intense pace we've been experiencing over the past few years," Mr Harker said. "The 100,000-jobs-a-month rate is going to be more than sufficient to keep up with population growth. That's more or less the rate we'll need in a normal, healthy economy." As for inflation, Mr Harker also is bullish on it, despite a setback in April. "My forecast remains that we should reach our inflation goal around the end of the year," he said. Key to the Fed reaching its inflation target are higher wages about which he's optimistic. "I estimate wage growth of between 2.5 and 3 per cent this year," Mr Harker said. "This is a very good sign; it's one of the things that's been missing as the recovery has unfolded." Late last week, San Francisco Fed boss John Williams said he still saw three hikes this year, potentially four if the economy gets an unexpected boost. Fed governor Lael Brainard last week offered a more dovish take, citing her wariness about the improving labour market and slowing inflation.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo By David Shepardson (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said on Thursday they would leave White House advisory councils after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Trump decided to pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement designed to fight climate change despite entreaties from U.S. allies and corporate leaders in an action that fulfilled a major campaign pledge. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post. He is a member of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, and Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Musk said on Wednesday that he had done "all I can" to convince Trump to stay in the accord, and threatened to leave the presidential advisory councils if Trump announced a U.S. exit from the accord. Iger wrote on Twitter that "as a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal." He is leaving the business advisory group. Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration's immigration policies. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The group is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP and includes Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo Inc and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co . Late on Thursday, BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said he would continue to serve on Trump's CEO Forum, despite reservations about the White House decision to withdraw from the Paris accord. "I accepted the invitation to serve on the President's CEO Forum because I believe I can contribute to the policy dialogue in Washington and serve as a voice for investors," Fink said in a statement. "I am a strong believer that our industry needs to have a voice with governments around the world," said Fink, whose company is the world's largest asset manager, with $5.4 trillion under management. "I do not agree with all of the president's policies and decisions, including today's announcement to exit the U.S. from the Paris Agreement which I believe is a critical step forward in addressing climate change." Asked about Musk's resignation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox News that "anybody who read the agreement and understood it would realize that this was not really about climate, this was about U.S. money going to other countries and it didn’t solve the climate problem." Musk has met with Trump several times and spoken with him about the long-term goal of his company SpaceX for flights to Mars carrying humans. The White House is planning to a hold a meeting with technology leaders on June 19, an administration spokesman said Wednesday. General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra would remain on the presidential advisory panel, adding that her participation "provides GM a seat at an important table to contribute to a constructive dialogue about key policy issues." In 2013, GM signed a declaration joining other major companies arguing that responding to climate change was good business. The automaker said on Thursday that despite the withdrawal it "will not waver from our commitment to the environment." It was unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join Trump's panel. Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said on Thursday the No.2 U.S. automaker believes "climate change is real, and remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities."

Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase criticized the latest decision of the US president, although he ruled out stepping down from his role as adviser, unlike others, in an interview published Saturday by the South China Morning Post. I dont know anyone who agrees with everything that a president or prime minister says, said Dimon, adding it was important to commit towards a more open dialogue. Dimons statement came after Tesla co-founder Elon Musk and Disneys chief executive Bob Iger announced they were stepping down as advisers to Trump over his decision to pull the US out of the Paris agreement on climate. I am a patriot, I want to help the president to do a better job, Dimon said. During the interview, he also spoke about other issues such as relations with China and said that Beijing and Washington should resume the process for regular bilateral dialogue on economy, security and defense. Besides economy, trade and education, Dimon stressed on the need for consistent political and defense dialogue about the world, not only the South China Sea, but also North Koreas nuclear program and peace in the Middle East.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

From left are, Trump, UAW president Dennis Williams, Ford CEO Mark Fields, and EPA administrator Scott Pruitt. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Photo Credit: AP advertisement | advertise on newsday Several news outlets have reported about the tremendous access chief executives have to the Trump administration. According to many of the accounts, corporate titans are exercising a moderating influence on President Donald Trump — a counterweight, presumably, to the nationalist agenda of Steve Bannon and other administration hard-liners. But this analysis misses the mark. CEOs are not headed to the White House for the good of anything beyond their companies’ bottom lines. And, in many cases, they have positioned their companies to benefit from Trump’s agenda. In short, the Trump agenda is not being softened by billionaires. It is designed for billionaires.

Dobie: Now, California takes the lead Trump’s budget and tax proposals offer the most obvious signs. His budget proposal would eviscerate the nation’s social safety net, including more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and public benefits. Don't miss outSign up for The PointCartoonDavies' latest cartoon: Climate clownsCommentSubmit your letter Meanwhile, Trump’s sweeping tax cuts would benefit billionaires and large corporations first and foremost. And, the gutting of environmental and financial regulations would pad the pockets of the ultra-wealthy. Score one for the billionaires. The same is true for health care. The American Health Care Act, or TrumpCare, that passed the House would strip 23 million Americans of their health insurance and simultaneously would give billions in tax breaks to the nation’s highest earners. advertisement | advertise on newsday The pattern holds when it comes to proposals to attack immigrant communities and criminalize people of color. When you examine which companies and corporate leaders are cozying up to Trump, you’ll see that many are positioned to benefit from his agenda. Take JPMorgan Chase. Since the election, the company contributed $500,000 to Trump’s inaugural committee, and chief executive Jamie Dimon accepted a seat on Trump’s business advisory council. Some say Dimon is a moderating influence on Trump — arguing, for instance, against labeling China a currency manipulator and potentially sparking a trade war. But Dimon recently declared that Trump’s economic platform is “the right agenda.” And responding to angry shareholders about his support for Trump, Dimon said he was a “patriot” for working with the administration. OpinionNational cartoon roundup Dimon’s company also stands to benefit from Trump’s anti-immigrant dragnet. As Trump pursues a mass deportation strategy that will rely upon rapid expansions in private immigrant detention centers, JPMorgan Chase is financing the very private prison companies, such as the Geo Group and CoreCivic, most eager to meet that demand. In short, the company has a financial interest in the companies that Trump is relying on to implement his anti-immigrant agenda. Tweets from @sguzik/newsday-editorial-board That’s why a new national campaign has labeled JPMorgan Chase, as well as eight other companies, the “Corporate Backers of Hate.” While many of their leaders pursue a close relationship with the Trump administration, these companies stand to profit from the administration’s policies. Members of Congress who have stood with Trump have felt the wrath of angry constituents at town halls, or faced forceful protest when they refused to hear from voters in their districts. Major companies standing with Trump’s agenda are now starting to feel this same citizen anger, and their CEOs and corporate board members would be foolish to ignore the reputational risk. When citizens and consumers see corporate leaders cozying up to a president advancing a hateful agenda, or when we see companies positioned to benefit from such an odious platform, we are not fooled into thinking that these companies are acting to moderate an extremist. Instead, we know that they are thinking first and foremost of their own bottom lines, regardless of the damage being inflicted on our communities.

Labour market appears to be losing momentum despite unemployment rate falling to 16-year low WASHINGTON, June 3:   US job growth slowed in May and employment gains in the prior two months were not as strong as previously reported, suggesting the labour market was losing momentum despite the unemployment rate falling to a 16-year low of 4.3 per cent. Non-farm payrolls increased 138,000 last month as the manufacturing, government and retail sectors lost jobs, the Labor Department said on Friday. The economy created 66,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in March and April. Last month's job gains could still be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. “While the message was a little muddied today, the evidence generally suggests the labor market is cyclically tightening, and the Fed will need to continue to lean against that,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “We still believe it is very likely that the Fed will hike later this month. Perhaps more in question is the signal coming out of that meeting regarding subsequent hikes.” Details of the employment report were weak. Though the unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to its lowest level since May 2001, that was because 429,000 people dropped out of the labour force. Average hourly earnings The survey of households from which the unemployment rate is derived also showed a drop in employment. The jobless rate has declined five-tenths of a percentage point this year. Average hourly earnings rose four cents or 0.2 percent in May after a similar gain in April, leaving the year-on-year increase in wages at 2.5 percent. Job growth has decelerated from the 181,000 monthly average over the past 12 months as the labour market nears full employment. There is growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find qualified workers. Economists also believe that companies might be holding off hiring amid worries political scandals engulfing President Donald Trump could imperil his economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. “Political uncertainty in Washington is another factor holding back the job market,” said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo. “The probability that any of the Trump stimulus would become reality has decreased significantly in recent weeks.” Economists had forecast payrolls increasing 185,000 last month and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.4 percent. The Fed raised interest rates in March. A Reuters survey of banks that do business directly with the Fed, conducted after the employment report, showed all 18 primary dealers polled expected the U.S. central bank to raise rates this month. Ten forecast further monetary policy tightening in September and only six saw a rate hike in December. The dollar hit a seven-month low against a basket of currencies on the diminishing rate hike prospects in the second half of the year. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell to nearly seven-month lows, and short-dated yields touched their lowest in more than two weeks. U.S. stocks closed at new highs. Shrinking labour market The modest payrolls gain could temper expectations of a sharp acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter after gross domestic product increased at a tepid 1.2 percent annualized rate at the start of the year. While consumer spending picked up in April, a second report on Friday showed the trade deficit widening 5.2 percent to $47.6 billion. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increasing at a 3.4 percent pace in the second quarter. There was some good news in the employment report. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.4 percent, the lowest since November 2007. As a result, the spread between the jobless rate and this broad unemployment gauge, considered a better measure of labor market slack, was the smallest since early 2008. But the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent. The volatile 16-24 age group accounted for much of the drop in the participation rate last month, suggesting a rebound is likely. Manufacturing employment fell by 1,000 jobs last month as payrolls in the automobile sector dropped 1,500 amid declining sales. Ford Motor Co said last month it planned to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives. Construction payrolls rose 11,000 last month after decreasing by 1,000 jobs in April. Retail employment fell 6,100, declining for a fourth straight month, with department stores shedding 3,700 jobs. Department store chains like J.C. Penney Co Inc, Macy's Inc and Abercrombie & Fitch are struggling against stiff competition from online retailers led by Amazon . Nonstore retailers, including online merchants, hired 2,900 workers last month. Government employment decreased 9,000 last month, with state and local governments accounting for all the decrease.

Trump decided to pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement designed to fight climate change despite entreaties from U.S. allies and corporate leaders in an action that fulfilled a major campaign pledge. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post. He is a member of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, and Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week Musk said on Wednesday that he had done "all I can" to convince Trump to stay in the accord, and threatened to leave the presidential advisory councils if Trump announced a U.S. exit from the accord. Iger wrote on Twitter that "as a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal." He is leaving the business advisory group. Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration's immigration policies. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The group is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP and includes Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo Inc and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co . Late on Thursday, BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said he would continue to serve on Trump's CEO Forum, despite reservations about the White House decision to withdraw from the Paris accord. "I accepted the invitation to serve on the President's CEO Forum because I believe I can contribute to the policy dialogue in Washington and serve as a voice for investors," Fink said in a statement. "I am a strong believer that our industry needs to have a voice with governments around the world," said Fink, whose company is the world's largest asset manager, with $5.4 trillion under management. "I do not agree with all of the president's policies and decisions, including today's announcement to exit the U.S. from the Paris Agreement which I believe is a critical step forward in addressing climate change." Asked about Musk's resignation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox News that "anybody who read the agreement and understood it would realize that this was not really about climate, this was about U.S. money going to other countries and it didn’t solve the climate problem." Musk has met with Trump several times and spoken with him about the long-term goal of his company SpaceX for flights to Mars carrying humans. The White House is planning to a hold a meeting with technology leaders on June 19, an administration spokesman said Wednesday. General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra would remain on the presidential advisory panel, adding that her participation "provides GM a seat at an important table to contribute to a constructive dialogue about key policy issues." In 2013, GM signed a declaration joining other major companies arguing that responding to climate change was good business. The automaker said on Thursday that despite the withdrawal it "will not waver from our commitment to the environment." It was unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join Trump's panel. Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said on Thursday the No.2 U.S. automaker believes "climate change is real, and remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities."

But look a little more closely and the signs of unease in the stock market are hard to ignore. It’s visible in fund flows, where investors are rotating from US stocks to the rest of the world at the fastest pace in two years. And short sellers are getting aggressive, raising bearish bets in three of the past four months. US stocks climbed this week, led by by phone companies and materials producers. The S&P 500 increased 1 per cent to 2,438.91 and Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent to 21,204.58. While the gains built on the previous week’s breakout, neither index is more than 2 per cent above the all-time highs reached on March 1. In other words, benchmark indexes are at records, but they also haven’t advanced much since March, one of the longer periods of stasis since Donald Trump’s election. For all their resilience, equity investors remain anxious about an economy that has recently given uneven evidence of its vigor just as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates.  After yesterday’s employment report, three-month US jobs growth is now the lowest since 2012. Housing demand weakened more than expected in April, and while manufacturing gauges remain firm, a series of reports on inflation continue to show corporate pricing power is muted. “It is a warning that, as with asset prices, the key question is not the level you are at, but the prospects for growth from here,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds in New York. “Investors should consider whether overseas economies with greater growth potential may provide better equity market returns.” Meanwhile, investors in exchange-traded funds turned net sellers of US stocks in May for the first time in a year, with withdrawals approaching US$2 billion (RM8.5 billion), data compiled by Bloomberg show. They added US$22 billion to equity funds that invest in markets from Europe to Asia. The divergence in flows, the widest since April 2015, marked a turnaround from last year, when almost US$10 went for American equities for every one that went elsewhere. Even as stocks vaulted to new highs, bears aren’t deterred.  Short interest as a proportion of total shares outstanding has expanded since January, rising by 0.3 percentage point to 3.9 per cent. Never before has an equity advance as big as this year’s occurred simultaneously with more short sales, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg that goes back to 2008. Spotty demand for American stocks coincided with hiccups in economic data. Rather than picking up pace as expected by many at the start of the year, Citigroup’s Economic Surprise Index for the US, which measures the difference between actual releases and economist expectations, peaked in March and has since fallen to the lowest level since February 2016. By contrast, similar gauges for the rest of the world have fared better as Brazil and Russia emerged from recessions while the populist political tide receded in Europe. Since the global financial crisis, the US had dominated equity gains worldwide, with rallies underpinned by easier monetary policy and a steady recovery. Now that growth is poised to accelerate from Europe to Japan, American assets are losing some of their appeal. In Bank of America Corp’s latest survey of money managers, 82 per cent called the US the most expensive market. While the S&P 500 is up 8.9 per cent this year, it’s poised to trail the MSCI World ex-US Index for the first time since 2009. The dollar is heading for the worst annual decline in a decade after losing about 6 per cent of its value against a basket of currencies. Even within the US market itself, the preference for overseas exposure is evident. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket tracking shares with the highest leverage to international growth has risen 17 per cent this year, compared with 6 per cent for a similar gauge for domestic-focused companies. “The dollar weakness and non-US economic strength is being replayed all over the world,” said Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at US Trust in New York. “Rarely have times been better for US firms with global exposure. The auspicious omens are plain to see.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Malaysia Airlines close to deal for more widebody Airbus planes Pound falls after London terror attacks raise political tensions Ringgit opens higher against US dollar PBOC has economy's back even as it squeezes leverage from market Oil subdued as rising US output undermines Opec effort to cut supply Ringgit likely to trade higher versus US dollar next week RHB-AmBank to take No. 1 spot in asset management, insurance, broking Petronas Q1 2017 pre-tax profit more than doubles to RM15.5b British pound in thrall to election projections as market jitters rise Bursa to be firmer next week Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Tech leads Wall Street higher; jobs data falls short Dow, S&P little changed as job growth slows in May Wall Street higher as strong private jobs data boosts confidence Wall Street opens slightly lower as investors digest data Global stocks meander in holiday-hit trading; pound rises Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

Continuing their long record of support for equality, major employers Citibanamex, Accenture, Google, Kellogg and Mastercard have already committed to participate in the Mexico-focused survey and report. The survey was announced at an event on May 23 hosted by Citibanamex and comes during a time of significant progress in LGBTQ workplace inclusion around the globe. In the coming months, Mexico-based HRC Equidad MX will collect responses to the survey, which will run parallel to HRC's annual Corporate Equality Index (CEI) survey (http://www.hrc.org/campaigns/corporate-equality-index), and release the results during the Fall of 2017. The forthcoming report will evaluate major Mexican business and multinational companies on three core pillars of LGBT inclusion: o Adoption of nondiscrimination policies; o Creation of employee resource groups or diversity and inclusion councils; o Engagement in public activities to support LGBT inclusion. Highly rated employers will receive a designation similar to the 'Best Places to Work' certification offered through the CEI. 'Businesses around the world continue to lead for LGBT equality,' said Mary Beth Maxwell, HRC's Vice President for Programs, Research and Training. 'From the companies taking the Equidad MX survey on inclusion to the HRC Global Business Coalition raising the bar, private sector partners around the world are sending a clear message that equality and inclusion are good for business.' 'Having these five important companies support this effort by the Human Rights Campaign represents a significant step in raising awareness of workplace equality among Mexican companies,' said Deena Fidas, Director of HRC's Workplace Equality Program. 'Mexico is a great commercial and social partner for the United States, and replicating the work we have done with companies over the past 15 years in the U.S. through our Corporate Equality Index will be a watershed moment for Mexican and multinational companies operating here.' 'Citibanamex is an institution committed to giving the best of Mexico and the best in the world to our clients and employees. This commitment goes hand in hand with respect and job inclusion of the LGBT population,' said Liliana Iñigo, Citibanamex's LGBT Ambassador for Latin America and Citibanamex's Executive Director of Marketing. 'We establish a culture that promotes integrity and confidence so that our collaborators can enhance their talent, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Participating in the HRC Equidad MX certification shows the conviction we have to build the best working environment for the LGBT population in Mexico and in our Financial Group.' 'Accenture is an inclusive company that promotes an environment of trust and motivates each one of its members to be authentic. We are proud to be a multinational firm that works every day to provide a fair work environment, regardless of the sexual orientation or gender identity of the people. With this, we formally declare our commitment to continue working towards the LGBT inclusion supported by the HRC Equity MX certification,' said Jorge Torres, Accenture's Chief Technology Officer. 'Google's mission is to organize information and make it accessible and useful for everyone. In this sense, our search for diversity is a natural extension of this mission as we seek to increase access to opportunities, breaking down barriers and empowering people through technology,' said Delfina Grossi, Google Marketing Solutions Manager and Diversity Ambassador for Google Mexico. 'Kellogg seeks to foster a culture of inclusion for all its employees and generate a work environment in which people are appreciated and can be authentic,' said Guillermo González Guerra, Director of Human Resources at Kellogg Latin America. 'Through its K-Pride & Allies program, the company works to become the employer of choice for the LGBT community by promoting equity, solidarity and respect. Getting the HRC Equidad MX badge will be a very important step in this regard.' 'Mastercard is proud to participate in HRC's Global Business Coalition and to promote inclusive and diverse corporate culture with different actions that reinforce our commitment with our most important capital, the human and in the community in which we work,' said Brenda Hernandez, Director of Human Resources for Mastercard Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. Accenture, Google and Mastercard are members of HRC's Global Business Coalition (http://www.hrc.org/resources/global-business-coalition), a cohort of global employers publicly committed to inclusion everywhere they do business. Through its Corporate Equality Index (http://www.hrc.org/campaigns/corporate-equality-index), the HRC Foundation has established a roadmap for the adoption of LGBTQ-inclusive policies, benefits and practices across major corporations. Last year, for the second year in a row, HRC launched its international CEI in Mexico City along with the U.S. Embassy in Mexico, The Dow Chemical Company, J.P. Morgan Chase, and the Mexican state-owned petroleum company, PEMEX. In conjunction with the launch of the 2017 CEI, HRC Equidad MX released a Spanish-language toolkit for workplaces in Mexico and around Latin America. The guide provides predominantly Spanish-language workplaces with a resource to help train and equip employees to build LGBT-inclusive environments. HRC Equidad MX: Global Workplace Equality Program, which launched last year, works to increase awareness about the importance of LGBTQ diversity and inclusion in Mexico's workplaces by developing consulting and education models for Mexican companies and organizations. It also utilizes HRC's tools and relationships to engage interested companies in aligning their corporate policies on LGBTQ inclusion to international standards.

The Human Rights Campaign Foundation is the educational arm of America's largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people. HRC envisions a world where LGBTQ people are embraced as full members of society at home, at work, and in every community.

(Luis Robayo/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) By Editorial Board By Editorial Board June 4 at 7:21 PM Follow postopinions AT THE firm’s highest levels, Goldman Sachs personnel are not indifferent to important ethical and public policy concerns, whether that necessarily helps or hurts the Wall Street bank’s bottom line. We know this because chief executive Lloyd Blankfein took to Twitter for the first time ever to repudiate President Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris accord on climate change. “Today’s decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.’s leadership position in the world,” Mr. Blankfein declared. Previously, he had gone public in opposition to the president’s proposed ban on travel to the United States from certain Muslim-majority nations. What, then, are we to make of Goldman Sachs fund managers’ recent secondary-market purchase, at a steep discount, of $2.8 billion worth of bonds issued by the state-owned oil company of Venezuela; that is to say, the same government that guns down pro-democracy protesters on a near-daily basis and otherwise subjects its people to vast corruption and economic privation? Well, the first thing to be said is that the transaction was a really sweet deal for Goldman and its clients. The firm paid only $865 million for the securities, a near-70 percent markdown from face value reflective of Venezuela’s parlous finances. Of course, Goldman’s fund will be entitled to $2.8 billion in 2022, when the bonds mature, and meanwhile gets 19 percent annual interest, a cool $756 million. The second thing to say, though, is what a terrible deal this is for the people of Venezuela, since on the other end of the transaction, ultimately, stands the Venezuelan central bank — which held the bonds and sold them to Goldman via a little-known intermediary. The cash Caracas reaped will help President Nicolás Maduro survive the (very) short-term, or even remain in power long enough to pay back Goldman in 2022, necessarily by imposing more brutal austerity on his people. Yes, the opposition might be in power by then; leaders pledged to stiff Goldman if it is. But the firm would probably break even under any scenario short of total debt repudiation, which would not be in a future democracy’s own interest. No wonder former Venezuelan planning minister Ricardo Hausmann, now teaching at Harvard University, calls them “hunger bonds.” To be sure, Goldman was trying to keep pace in the emerging market bond market — to meet such standards as the JPMorgan Chase Emerging Market Bond Index, of which Venezuela’s official debt is a highly remunerative component. But that simply shows Wall Street as a whole needs to rethink dealing in this utterly illegitimate regime’s obligations the same way it deals in, say, democratic Chile’s, or even the debt of more responsible undemocratic countries. Even among the world’s odious regimes, Venezuela is a special case; Mr. Hausmann has suggested the financial community could collectively curb incentives to do deals such as Goldman’s by removing Venezuelan bonds from market indexes. If Goldman Sachs and the rest of Wall Street really want a reputation for social responsibility, they will eagerly seek alternatives to business as usual with Caracas.

More videos The unknown recession Australia may have enjoyed more than 25 years without a recession, but as Peter Martin explains, it's been a close run thing. Since the Reserve Bank of Australia's last policy decision on May 2, market bets on an interest-rate cut by the end of this year have doubled. While that chance is still only less than 20 per cent, swaps traders late on Friday saw the nation as the only developed economy where cuts are possible in the coming year after data during May pointed to anaemic growth in the first quarter. Related Content Uncertain waters ahead for the Australian economy The one thing treasurers must not do For now, a mixed picture means governor Philip Lowe will likely hold the benchmark rate at a record-low 1.5 per cent on Tuesday. While reports since the RBA's last meeting show strong employment gains and a surprise rebound in retail sales, construction has been soft and wage growth stagnant. Advertisement Signs of a cooling housing market could also give the central bank leeway to ease down the track, after prices dropped in May for the first time in 18 months. "I've got high conviction in our view that rates will go lower," said Sally Auld, chief economist for Australia at JPMorgan Chase, who expects a rate cut next quarter. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link For now, a mixed picture means governor Philip Lowe will likely hold the benchmark rate at a record-low 1.5 per cent on Tuesday.  Photo: Bloomberg "We see risks that growth and inflation will probably disappoint relative to the RBA's forecast." The doves are still very much a minority. More than half of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the cash rate to be on hold until at least the middle of next year, with six predicting a hike by then; Ms Auld is among just five forecasting a cut. No economists expect any change on Tuesday. There are two factors likely to keep the RBA on hold this month, Ms Auld said. First, it's awaiting more evidence of how lending curbs are impacting the hot east-coast property markets. Prices in the country's five biggest cities fell 1.1 per cent in May, according to a CoreLogic report last week, including a 1.3 per cent drop in Sydney. Second, uncertainty surrounds the temporary effects of Cyclone Debbie, which knocked out mine-to-port rail lines in the north Queensland coal fields for several weeks in April, meaning exports are likely to take a significant hit. The past two weeks have also seen sluggish readings of GDP components. Ahead of first-quarter data due on Wednesday, some economists are suggesting a contraction for the three months. That followed a 0.7 per cent drop in construction and a modest 0.3 per cent rise in business spending in the period. National Australia Bank last week even flagged the possibility of a technical recession in the second quarter. The RBA also has an eye on weak consumption. Retail sales grew just 0.1 per cent in the first quarter, while some well-known clothing stores, including Herringbone and Topshop Australia, have gone into administration. On a brighter note, sales rebounded 1 per cent in April, though that was partly put down to post-cyclone restocking. Despite the better than expected monthly result, "the underlying trend remains soft with spending constrained by weak wages growth and elevated underemployment", Kristina Clifton, an economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a note. With limited scope to ease policy further, the central bank may be hoping that a ramp-up in public spending on infrastructure will help drive growth in the years ahead. In its annual budget in May, the government announced $75 billion of investment in projects over the next decade after repeated calls from the RBA and economists for such spending. But the past month's biggest stimulus was neither the central bank's or the government's doing. The Aussie dollar has fallen almost 2 per cent against the US dollar since the RBA's last meeting as the price of iron ore - the nation's biggest export - continued its decline. "I'm sure they're particularly happy with the currency here at 74 US cents and would prefer to leave it that way," said Annette Beacher, head of Asia-Pacific research at TD Securities in Singapore. "I think net-net everything is sufficiently mixed for the RBA to sit back."

Analysts say British Prime Minister Theresa May needs to win a large majority at the June 8 poll, to give her clout at formal Brexit talks set to begin later this month. But opinion polls show a much tighter contest than expected - and the impact of the London attacks remains to be seen. "Markets have been fairly buoyant in recent weeks, but activity is still patchy," KGI Securities (Singapore) trading strategist Nicholas Teo told The Straits Times. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up "People are still looking for the next catalyst - especially with earnings season more or less over - and this is likely to come from outside Singapore, he said, pointing to the election, adding that the next interest rate hike in the United States continues to be closely watched. US data out on Friday showed that jobs growth slowed in May. This could keep a cap on sentiment, though Wall Street shrugged off the weak result to rise 0.29 per cent last Friday. Still, Mr Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York, told Reuters: "While the message was a little muddied (on Friday), the evidence generally suggests the labour market is cyclically tightening, and the Fed will need to continue to lean against that." Japan will release first-quarter gross domestic product figures on Thursday, and China will put out data on trade balance and inflation for May on Friday. Last week, the Straits Times Index chalked up a gain of 20.59 points, or 0.64 per cent, after climbing 4.05 points, or 0.13 per cent, to 3,240.01 on Friday, albeit on sluggish volumes. One market highlight was news that OCBC Bank and Great Eastern have received proposals from several parties on their combined stakes in United Engineers and WBL Corporation. Property group United Engineers rose 2.5 per cent, or seven cents, to $2.83 last Friday, while Perennial Real Estate Holdings, which confirmed its interest in United Engineers, advanced 1.1 per cent, or one cent, to 91 cents. With reporting season at its end, CIMB analyst Lim Siew Khee said that the worst could be over for corporates here, after two years of earnings contraction. The brokerage is seeing decent upgrades on forward earnings for the first time since the second quarter of 2014 on the stocks it covers, and expects more such upgrades ahead. These will come mainly from the banks, on lower credit costs with the exodus of small-cap oil and gas names; the manufacturing sector, if volume growth is sustained by global demand; as well as consumer stocks, led by sales recovery, said Ms Lim.

Photo: Juan Medina/Reuters The chairman of Banco Popular has told his executives that the struggling Spanish lender was solvent and urged them to remain calm and confident, while a source said he would hold a routine meeting with the European Central Bank next week. Popular's shares fell almost 40 per cent in the past three days on concern it would not find a buyer or raise new capital to fix its balance sheet, which is weighed down with €37 billion of non-performing real estate assets. One of Europe's top bank watchdogs warned European Union officials that Popular might need to be wound down if it failed to find a buyer, an EU official told Reuters this week. "Banco Popular remains solvent and has positive equity," chairman Emilio Saracho wrote to his executives in a letter sent on Friday, seeking to reassure them despite what he called the "difficult situation." The letter, first published by Expansion newspaper, was confirmed by a bank spokeswoman who read the content to Reuters. Saracho would meet ECB officials on Tuesday, a source familiar with the meeting told Reuters, adding that the appointment was part of the ECB's routine supervisory responsibilities and was scheduled "some time ago". Popular and the ECB declined to comment on the meeting. Saracho, hired in February in a leadership reshuffle, said in his letter that Popular would continue to seek new capital or a sale to fix its non-performing real estate assets that are the highest among Spanish banks. "Our clients and shareholders are the most important for us. For that reason we must relay them a message of calm and confidence that we are trying as hard as possible to overcome this situation," Saracho, a former JP Morgan executive, wrote. Elke Koenig, who chairs the EU's Single Resolution Board (SRB), a body that resolves struggling banks, had issued an "early warning", according to the EU official. The SRB said at the time it could not confirm the story. Spain's government said on Friday it was not worried about Popular and would await the outcome of the sale process, which the bank says it could extend past a June 10 offer deadline. The economy minister, Luis de Guindos, has said he does not expect a state bailout given Popular's capital levels were still above regulatory requirements set out by the ECB. Spain's biggest bank Santander and state-owned lender Bankia are seen as the most likely buyers for any acquisition. A capital increase, which analysts say would need to raise at least €3 billion, faces resistance from shareholders who fear greater dilution. « Jet Aviation opens operation in Malta Shipping movements » Advert See our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Friday pushed back its forecast for a third rate increase this year to December from September. Trading in futures contracts shows odds of a September increase have dropped to just one in four, and investors are now pricing in less than one rate hike in 2018 for the first time since the eve of the U.S. elections in November. More from Bloomberg.com: Trump’s Paris Exit Leaves Him Isolated From C-Suites to Capitals Fed officials speaking on Friday expressed no disappointment with the payrolls gain of 138,000 last month, which was below economists’ expectations. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker called it a “good number,” while Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said “if we are not at full employment, we are moving closer.” “I’d be very surprised if they didn’t hike in June, given all the signals that they have sent,” said Jonathan Wright, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. While he still expects two more interest-rate increases this year, the probability has increased that the Federal Open Market Committee will move only in June, he said. More from Bloomberg.com: Trump to Exit Climate Pact as Allies Deride Call for Do-Over The Labor Department report showed the jobless rate fell to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, which is below the level the FOMC estimates to be full employment. Monthly payroll gains are averaging 162,000 this year, a step down from the 2016 pace of 187,000. Average hourly earnings rose 2.5 percent from a year earlier, indicating a tightening labor market hasn’t brought an acceleration in wages. The FOMC, last raised rates in March and at the time projected two additional increases this year and three in 2018. Those quarterly forecasts will be updated this month. “The Fed has little credibility,” said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist with Jefferies LLC in New York. Investors expect “the Fed to again back away from raising rates at minimal provocation. That is the legacy of the FOMC rate hikes underachieving relative to FOMC projections for so many years.” More from Bloomberg.com: Puerto Rico’s Exodus Is Speeding the Island’s Economic Collapse If Yellen decides to push forward in September, the FOMC may be forced to engage in a “public campaign” of fairly explicit signals for a rate hike similar to what occurred in March, he said. The Fed’s Beige Book on Wednesday cited a variety of anecdotes of worker shortages and isolated pay raises across the central bank’s 12 districts. There was a manufacturer in the Chicago region raising pay 10 percent to attract workers. In the Atlanta district, construction work was delayed because of an inability to fill positions. In the Cleveland area, a transportation firm gave drivers a raise amounting to 7.5 percent to retain them. Yet overall, there’s no sign the tightening labor market is lifting inflation, which has been under the Fed’s 2 percent target for every month but one for the last five years. The Fed’s preferred measure of prices, excluding food and energy, rose just 1.5 percent in April from a year earlier. The data point to an “unbelievably weak response” of wage growth to the jobless rate, said Anthony Chan, chief economist with JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Chase Private Client unit and a former Fed economist. He reduced his forecast for rate increases in 2018 to two from three. Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday warned that the softening inflation could cause her to reassess the outlook for policy if it persists. “There’s no sign wages are accelerating,” said Stuart Hoffman, senior economic adviser at PNC Financial Services Group Inc. in Pittsburgh. “Unless we see some pickup in the summer months, not just in the job numbers but also in wages and inflation, there’s less-than-even odds that the Fed will go in September.” More from Bloomberg.com Wal-Mart Asks Employees to Deliver Packages on Their Way Home Trump Takes Battle Over Travel Ban to Nation’s Highest Court Denmark Is Killing Tesla (and Other Electric Cars) Read Skepticism Mounts for Fed Rate Hikes Post-June as Data Soften on bloomberg.com Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

Ogg 24/7 Wall St. June 3, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Investors have to be thrilled that the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 are all trading at all-time highs. The bull market is well over eight years old, and the market indexes have risen exponentially since the lows in 2009. Some investors have started feeling confused or puzzled about the relentless strength, particularly after investors find myriad reasons to keep buying stocks after every sell-off. With valuations so high, and as many investors are trained to be cautious in the summer, some investors are looking for new ideas and safety as they still seek positive returns. ALSO READ: 8 Big Tech Stocks Outperforming Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and NVIDIA in 2017 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each day of the week to find new investing and trading ideas for its readers. This ends up being hundreds of analyst calls to parse each week. It turns out that some of these analyst reports covering stocks to buy are in the largest companies. Four analyst calls stood out from the rest of those calls during the week of June 2, 2017. Some of them are in blue chip stocks and others in companies that are becoming large enough they could be blue chips. Consensus analyst price target data are the mean of the Thomson Reuters sell-side research service. Additional color and commentary has been added on most of these daily analyst calls. Here are the four top analyst calls in major stocks from this past week. ALSO READ: 15 Companies Bracing for Big ASCO Reactions BP PLC (BP) was reiterated as Buy with a $41 price target at Argus on June 1. The prior closing price was $36.15, but BP's American depositary shares were trading down 0.9% at $35.91 at the end of Friday's session. They have a 52-week trading range of $30.66 to $38.68, and the consensus price target is $37.84. While Argus lowered its 2017 earnings per share (EPS) target to $2.08 from $2.35 on lower margin projections for the BP refining business, the firm continues to expect higher crude oil and natural gas prices, along with additional cost cuts, to help. Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO) had a huge move at the end of the week, rising more than 8% to $254.53 on earnings and shooting down any major Toshiba acquisition. Broadcom was reiterated as a Top Pick at RBC Capital Markets, and the firm raised its price target to $260 from $250 ahead of the report. Then came a dozen price target hikes afterward, but the biggest of them were at JPMorgan and Susquehanna, each raising its target to $300. Broadcom shares were at $239.82 earlier in the week, and the new 52-week trading range is $142.27 to $253.76. Its consensus target price was listed as $252.26 ahead of earnings, but that number will be much higher after the adjusted targets get factored in. Broadcom has also now entered the more than $100 billion market cap stock club. ALSO READ: 7 Speculative Biotech and Pharma Stocks That Could Still Double (or More) General Electric Co. (GE) was maintained as Outperform at Credit Suisse on May 31, and the firm has a sum-of-parts valuation of $33 per share. Credit Suisse took issue with a Deutsche Bank view, as the firm thinks that GE is not a broken company, even if the conglomerate might be somewhat misunderstood. The analyst call noted that GE's sell-off has created an attractive entry point and the bear points, particularly around would-be risks that GE's dividend may be cut, have been overstated. GE closed at $27.38 ahead of the call, and its shares were trading up at $27.88 as last week came to an end. GE has a 52-week range of $27.10 to $33.00 and a consensus target price that is still up at $32.14. 3M Co. (MMM) was reiterated as Buy and the price target was raised to $234 from $219 by Jefferies on June 1. The share price was $204.47 ahead of the call, but they were up above $207 at all-time highs Friday afternoon. The Jefferies call and the latest share price are both ahead of the consensus price target of $196.21, and the stock has a 52-week range of $163.85 to $207.30. Jefferies noted that both the OECD LEIs and its preferred proxy for industrial momentum suggest tailwinds for 3M's operations. Valuations, it is often said, are stretched, but the firm feels that as long as the OECD LEIs continue to improve then 3M shares can continue to outperform.

The project, known internally as “next best action,” shows how one of the world’s biggest brokerages aims to upgrade its workforce while a growing number of firms roll out fully automated platforms called robo-advisers. The thinking is that humans with algorithmic assistants will be a better solution for wealthy families than mere software allocating assets for the masses. At Morgan Stanley, algorithms will send employees multiple-choice recommendations based on things like market changes and events in a client’s life, according to Jeff McMillan, chief analytics and data officer for the bank’s wealth-management division. Phone, email and website interactions will be cataloged so machine-learning programs can track and improve their suggestions over time to generate more business with customers, he said. “We’re desperately trying to pattern you and your behavior to delight you with something you may not have even been asking for, but based on what you have been doing, that you might find of value,” McMillan said in an interview. “We’re not trying to sell you, we’re trying to find the things you want and need.” Faced with competition from cheaper automated wealth-management services and higher expectations set by pioneering firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., traditional brokerages are starting to chart out their digital future. It turns out that the best hope human advisers have against robots is to harness the same technologies that threaten their disruption: algorithms combined with big data and machine learning. The idea is that advisers, who typically build relationships with hundreds of clients over decades, face an overwhelming amount of information about markets and the lives of their wealthy wards. New York-based Morgan Stanley is seeking to give humans an edge by prodding them to engage at just the right moments. “Technology can help them understand what’s happening in their book of business and what’s happening with their clients, whether it be considering a mortgage, to dealing with the death of a parent, to buying IBM,” McMillan said. “We take all of that and score them on the benefit that will accrue to the client and the likelihood they will transact.” Morgan Stanley will pilot the program with 500 advisers in July and expects to roll it out to all of them by year-end. Additional high-tech tools are coming: McMillan and others are working on an artificial intelligence assistant — think Siri for brokers — that can answer questions by sifting the firm’s mountain of research. (The bank produces 80,000 research reports a year.) The brokerage also is automating paper-heavy processes like wire transfers and creating a digital repository of client documents, such as wills and tax returns. Established advisers tend to be older, so Morgan Stanley is hiring associates to train those who need help. The technology means that for the first time in decades, the balance of power between financial advisers and their employers may shift. For years, top advisers could command multimillion-dollar bonuses by jumping to a competitor. That slowed to a crawl this year because of regulatory changes, and now the technological push will further the trend, according to Kendra Thompson, a managing director at Accenture Plc. Backed by a firm’s algorithms, “advisers are going to be part of a value proposition, rather than the service conduit for the industry,” Thompson said. “The cutting of the bonus check, it’s nearly over.” robo-advisers are projected to manage $6.5 trillion by 2025, about 5% of global wealth $7 trillion.(로봇 고문은 2025년까지 약 5조달러를 관리할 것으로 예상하는데, 이는 전 세계 재산의 약 5퍼센트를 차지한다.) 블룸버그 Morgan Stanley isn’t swearing off robo-advisers, either. It plans to release one in coming months, along with rivals Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase. The technology was pioneered by startups Wealthfront Inc. and Betterment and went mainstream at discount brokers Charles Schwab Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc. Robos could have $6.5 trillion under management by 2025, from about $100 billion in 2016, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. An in-house robo-adviser and a learning machine that acquaints itself with rich clients might alarm advisers who plan to keep working for decades. McMillan is adamant that the flesh-and-blood broker will be needed for years to come because the wealthy have complicated financial planning needs that are best met by human experts. “When I talk to financial advisers, they’re always like, ‘Is this going to put me out of business?’” he said. “That’s always the big elephant in the room. I can tell you factually that we are a long ways away from that.”   1만6,000명 브로커 머신러닝 위해 협업 휴 손 Morgan Stanley provides a new launch service as well as a robo advisor service. Capture the picture (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-05-31/morgan-stanley-brokers-to-get-algorithmic-help-video). 모건스탠리는 신규 서비스와 함께 로보어드바이져 서비스도 제공한다. 사진은 관련 영상(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-05-31/morgan-stanley-brokers-to-get-algorithmic-help-video)캡처. 블룸버그 사이보그라고 볼 수 있겠다. 모건 스탠리는 이번에 1만6,000명의 금융설계사에 머신러닝을 조합한 서비스를 런칭한다. 알고리즘을 통해 거래를 추천하고 고객의 생일을 챙기는 것과 같은 반복적인 업무를 돕는다. 회사내부에서 Next Best Action으로 불리는 이 프로젝트는 세계최대규모의 브로커리지 회사가 어떻게 자신들의 서비스를 향상시키려는 지 보여준다. 경쟁사들이 100% 자동화된 로보어드바이저 서비스를 런칭할 때 시점에 색다른 접근법이라 할 수 있다. 모건스탠리는 알고리즘이 모든 업무를 알아서 수행하는 것보다 인간과 기계의 협업이 더 경쟁력 있다고 판단한 것이다. 수석 애널리틱스 데이터 책임자 제프 맥밀란에 따르면 알고리즘이 시장변화, 고객의 현재 상황에 기반해 몇가지 거래 옵션들을 추천하게 된다. 계속되는 고객과의 소통을 통해 계속해서 고객의 요구상황을 파악해 더 좋은 서비스를 만들어간다. 더 저렴한 자동화 서비스들이 등장하고 머신러닝 서비스를 선도한 아마존이나 우버와 같은 회사들이 고객의 기대치를 높여놓은 상황에서, 전통적인 브로커리지 회사들도 자신들의 디지털 미래를 설계하고 있다.  로보어드바이저에 위협을 느끼고 있는 금융설계사들은 시장에서 경쟁력을 높이기 위해 같은 머신러닝 알고리즘과의 협업을 선택했다. 모건스탠리는 추가적으로 금융설계사들을 위한 비서 프로그램도 내놓을 예정이다. 금융설계사들을 위한 Siri 인 셈이다. 이 프로그램은 회사 내부 리서치 자료를 검색해 설계사들의 질문에 답해준다.  그렇다고 모건스탠리가 로보어드바이져 서비스에 손을 뗀 것은 아니다. 뱅크오브아메리카, 웰스파고 그리고 제이피모건 체이스 등 라이벌 회사들을 이어 몇달 내로 서비스를 제공할 예정이다. 이 테크놀로지는 웰스프론트, 베터먼트 가 선도했고 그 뒤 찰스스왑, 뱅가드와 같은 대규모 브로커들이 채택했다. 모건스탠리에 따르면 로보어드바이저 운용자금은 2025년까지  6.5 조 달러까지 성장할 것으로 보인다.     (번역: 이동근)    <저작권자 © 울산매일, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지>  저작권 문의 블룸버그 다른기사 보기 페이스북 이메일 입력.편집 :   2017-06-04 20:01   노옥진 기자 icon오늘의 인기기사 케이블·종편 휘젓는 유시민, '마리텔'서 토론 비법 공개 이번엔 정유라다… 'SNL코리아' 김민교, 쩐유라로 변신 ‘순환 휴업’ 카드 만지작…‘무급 휴직’ 우려도 솔솔 現重 일감 절대 부족…인력 남아돈다 “이 중요한 사실을 왜 청와대만 몰랐나” 묻는 언론들 미 국방장관 연설 듣는 한민구 국방부 장관 케이블·종편 휘젓는 유시민, '마리텔'서 토론 비법 공개 댓글 (200자평) 0개 전체보기 200자까지 쓰실 수 있습니다. 등록 ※ 비속어와 인신공격성 글 등은 바로 삭제됩니다. 특히, 근거 없는 글로 타인의 명예를 훼손하면 민·형사상 처벌을 받을 수 있습니다.

If you want to quickly build a blended portfolio at a low price, it’s hard to do better than ETFs. Closed-end funds (CEFs), by contrast, are virtually an afterthought, and that’s too bad. Because in many cases – including the three high-yield dynamos I want to show you today – they’re a superior source of quality and raw total-return performance. What is a closed-end fund exactly? Funnily, it sounds almost like an ETF – it’s a big, pooled investment in numerous securities (stocks, bonds, preferred shares or other assets) that trades on an exchange. However, while ETFs can add or subtract shares based on demand, a CEF goes public with a fixed number of shares, which occasionally results in the fund trading at a discount or a premium to the net asset value of its investments. Another critical difference that can lead to vastly dominant returns is CEFs’ ability to use leverage, borrowing money to generate additional value. That’s why it’s possible to see closed-end funds that hold stocks with middling dividends churn out explosive yields in the high single digits. Why do CEFs sit in the background? Because they tend to be actively managed, which means their expenses are often much higher than what you see in the ETF space. However, while low fees are a key to ETFs’ success, sometimes you get what you pay for – for better and for worse. Today, I’m going to highlight three closed-end funds that not only offer high-single-digit yields of up to 9.6%, but also outclass their popular exchange-traded counterparts. Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred Income Fund (PFD) Type: Preferred stocks Yield: 6.9% Compare To: iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF (PFF, 5.3%) Preferred stocks are one of the market’s best sources of income. These so-called stock-bond “hybrids” deliver elements of each, trading on an exchange just like common stock for easier accessibility, but also offering a stable fixed payment just like a bond. While they don’t come with the voting rights that common shares do, nor do they appreciate the same way, investors are compensated via outstanding yields of around 6% to 7%! BlackRock (BLK) is king of the ETF hill when it comes to preferred stocks, with its iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF (PFF) boasting nearly $18 billion in assets under management! But I’d like to point you toward the Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred Income Fund (PFD) instead. The PFD is like many other preferred-stock funds in that the lion’s share of its holdings are financial-company preferreds. This fund is 53% weighed in the preferreds of companies such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), while another 23% belong to insurers such as Metlife (MET). At less than $300 million in assets, the PFD doesn’t hold a candle to PFF. But believe it or not, it has actually been around far longer (inception 1991 vs. 2007 for PFF), and it offers 160 extra basis points in yield. While the ride isn’t as smooth as the PFF thanks to its financial leverage, over the long haul, it has proven a far more lucrative investment. You just have to be willing to hold on, and it does pay to buy on dips. Flaherty & Crumrine’s PFD Crushes the Competition Nuveen Short Duration Credit Opportunities Fund (JSD) Type: Senior Loans Yield: 7% Compare To: SPDR Blackstone/GSO Senior Loan ETF (SRLN, 5%) Senior loans are a much lesser-traveled area of the stock market, but also an excellent source of yield. These loans are first in line when it comes to debt service, and the “senior” moniker has to do with the fact that they’re secured by assets via a top-priority senior lien. They’re also difficult to invest in because they’re not listed on exchanges – funds like the Nuveen Short Duration Credit Opportunities Fund (JSD) and the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Short Term High Yield Bond ETF (SRLN) are among the only practical ways you and I can get exposure. The JSD is about 83% invested in the senior loans of companies including Albertson’s and IntelSat (I), though it also includes about 12% corporate bond exposure, with small positions in cash and even common stocks. (SLRN is a 90/8/2 senior/bond/cash split.) Most important to investors is that JSD is able to squeeze nearly 2 percentage points in extra yield by looking for bargains in slightly lower-credit loans and bonds than SRLN, as well as leverage in the fund. Moreover, JSD tamps down on risk by focusing on short-duration issues. Despite this shorter duration, Nuveen’s product has outperformed SPDR’s fund since the latter’s inception in 2013. While the difference is only a few percentage points, it’s important to note that it comes amid one of the more difficult periods for the JSD. When Nuveen’s JSD Builds a Head of Steam, Watch Out! MFS High Income Municipal Trust (CXE) Type: Municipal Bond Yield: 5.8% (9.6% tax equivalent yield for the highest tax bracket) Compare To: SPDR Nuveen S&P High Yield Municipal Bond ETF (HYMB, 3.8%, 6.3% tax-equivalent) I love municipal bonds because of their sneaky high yields thanks to the tax-exempt nature of their income. Remember: Municipal bonds – so, debt from entities such as states, counties and cities – are exempt from federal taxes, and if you live within that entity, you also can be exempt from state and local taxes, too. Closed-end funds are a popular way to invest in the muni space, and the MFS High Income Municipal Trust (CXE) is one of the premier offerings in that group. The CXE holds 786 municipal bonds, mostly of longer maturities (80% of its bonds are 15 years or longer), with its strongest state concentrations coming in California, Texas and Illinois (8%-plus each). Like the other funds on this list, CXE compares well to exchange-traded counterparts like the SPDR Nuveen S&P High Yield Municipal Bond ETF (HYMB) – it’s just a bit more volatile thanks to the fund’s use of leverage.

Popular’s shares fell almost 40 percent in the past three days on concern it would not find a buyer or raise new capital to fix its balance sheet, which is weighed down with 37 billion euros (31.80 billion pounds) of non-performing real estate assets. One of Europe’s top bank watchdogs warned European Union officials that Popular might need to be wound down if it failed to find a buyer, an EU official told Reuters this week. “Banco Popular remains solvent and has positive equity,” Chairman Emilio Saracho wrote to his executives in a letter sent on Friday, seeking to reassure them despite what he called the “difficult situation.” The letter, first published by Expansion newspaper, was confirmed by a bank spokeswoman who read the content to Reuters. Saracho would meet ECB officials on Tuesday, a source familiar with the meeting told Reuters, adding that the appointment was part of the ECB’s routine supervisory responsibilities and was scheduled “some time ago”. Popular and the ECB declined to comment on the meeting. Saracho, hired in February in a leadership reshuffle, said in his letter that Popular would continue to seek new capital or a sale to fix its non-performing real estate assets that are the highest among Spanish banks. “Our clients and shareholders are the most important for us. For that reason we must relay them a message of calm and confidence that we are trying as hard as possible to overcome this situation,” Saracho, a former JP Morgan executive, wrote. Elke Koenig, who chairs the EU’s Single Resolution Board (SRB), a body that resolves struggling banks, had issued an “early warning”, according to the EU official. The SRB said at the time it could not confirm the story. Spain’s government said on Friday it was not worried about Popular and would await the outcome of the sale process, which the bank says it could extend past a June 10 offer deadline. The economy minister, Luis de Guindos, has said he does not expect a state bailout given Popular’s capital levels were still above regulatory requirements set out by the ECB. Spain’s biggest bank Santander <SAN.MC> and state-owned lender Bankia <BKIA.MC> are seen as the most likely buyers for any acquisition. A capital increase, which analysts say would need to raise at least 3 billion euros, faces resistance from shareholders who fear greater dilution. Popular shares have fallen 75 percent over the past year, making them the worst performers on the European STOXX banking index <.SX7P>.

Mr Iger wrote on Twitter that "as a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal". He joins Tesla chief executive Elon Musk who earlier tweeted: “Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world". Technology companies have been among the most vocal to oppose some of Mr Trump’s controversial policies and in February Uber CEO Travis Kalanick quit the council after the administration implemented a travel ban on people from seven majority Muslim countries. The council, created by Mr Trump in December, is designed to assist the administration when making decisions on policy. Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of Blackstone Group, leads it. Other members include PepsiCo chief Indra Nooyi and Jamie Dimon, the CEO of Wall Street giant JPMorgan. Overnight Mr Trump cast the Paris agreements as a global conspiracy that damaged his country’s economic prospects, but said the US may attempt to re-join the pact if he can secure a better deal. He had made pulling out of the pact – which has been signed by almost 200 nations – a cornerstone of his presidential campaign and said that by withdrawing he was underscoring his promise to put American workers first. Jeff Immelt, the chief executive of the conglomerate General Electric, tweeted: "Disappointed with today’s decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government." Former US President Barack Obama, German chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron also condemned Mr Trump’s move. Theresa May expressed regret over the withdrawal in a personal phone call with the US President.

International equity is now ahead of U.S. equity in total ETF flows year-to-date — $75 billion versus $68.5 billion Many investors still have a "pause" button on putting more money into U.S. stocks. 39 percent of America's affluent said they will avoid investing in the next month. Eric Rosenbaum | @erprose Saturday, 3 Jun 2017 | 12:00 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Are the markets moving higher despite fading expectations for Trump's policy agenda?    Thursday, 1 Jun 2017 | 6:44 AM ET | 01:26 It was a good week for the U.S. stock market — at least compared to recent weeks. Even after the "soft" Friday jobs report, the market kept grinding higher, especially big growth stocks, which in the past week saw their biggest inflow in the past four months, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. Talk of the beleaguered Trump Trade has even been replaced by talk, among some, of a Trump Trade restart. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its first record close since March 1 on Thursday, according to CNBC data. The Dow, S&P 500, NASDAQ, and NASDAQ-100 all closed at record highs on Friday. The small-cap stock Russell 2000 index saw its best daily performance in two months this week. Financials were the best-performing sector on Thursday, with the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) turning in its best day in more than a month. But ... ... Before turning in a great day on Thursday, financial had given up all their gains for the year as of Wednesday. And the millionaire investor confidence survey conducted by Spectrem Group showed its biggest ever month-over-month drop in May as 39 percent of America's affluent said they will avoid investing in the next month. Lucas Jackson | Reuters A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Before investors take their finger off the Trump Trade pause button, it's worth taking a look at the biggest trading moves made by investors in May, based on ETF flows data from XTF.com and FactSet. The "animal spirits" argument for the U.S. economy isn't in full force, but there's also a risk that the "animal spirits" that moved from the S&P 500 to overseas stocks are just the latest performance-chasing. 1. International stock bets find more outlets.  While it's an established trend to see international and emerging markets ETFs near the top in flows for equity funds this year, they were the top two ETFs in May, with iShares MSCI EAFE Index ETF (EFA) — roughly $4 billion in May flows — and the iShares Core Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) — roughly $2 billion in May flows — No. 1 and No. 2 , respectively. "European economic growth is gaining momentum and political risks have receded. Hopes of reforms and faster economic growth in emerging markets have improved their outlook significantly," said Neena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research. What's notable is the trend becoming more popular through more targeted bets, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. The No. 6 and No. 7 ETFs for new flows in May were the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF (VGK) and iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF (EZU). "The more targeted bets is a sign of confidence," Rosenbluth said. And there was a ripple effect from the Macron win in France. Performance-chasing in overseas ETFs? ETF 1-month return YTD return EFA 3.79 15.17 IEMG 2.76 18.45 EZU 5.09 19.94 SPY 1.96 9.35 XTF.com International equity is now ahead of U.S. equity in total ETF flows year-to-date — $75 billion versus $68.5 billion, according to FactSet. In May, U.S. equity ETFs had net flows of $1.5 billion, versus $23 billion for international equity. "It has as much to do with investors seeking diversification as the U.S. market being near or at record levels," Rosenbluth said. U.S. investors tend to maintain far greater exposure to the U.S. stock market than international equities. 2. The international investing trend has gotten big in bonds.  International fixed-income ETFs had greater new flows from investors in May than U.S. equities, at $2.25 billion, according to FactSet. Emerging markets debt was the story, again — it was the 18th straight week of inflows to emerging market debt, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data covering the broader universe of fund managers. show chapters Focus on EM equities and bonds, but take a nuanced approach: Portfolio manager    Friday, 26 May 2017 | 3:05 AM ET | 03:18 The iShares JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond ETF (EMB) took in $824 million, topped only by two core U.S. bond ETFs in flows for the month. Marc Faber, author of the "Gloom, Boom & Doom Report" — or Dr. Doom as he is known to market junkies — told CNBC this week that overseas markets have "way outperformed the U.S." this year, and he believes it will continue. He is favoring European and EM corporate bonds and Treasuries. 3. A big bet on a boring U.S. bond fund shows investor caution. The iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) was No. 2 overall in flows among all ETFs for May, not just bond ETFs, at $2.2 billion, after the iShares MSCI EAFE. U.S. fixed income ETFs had net flows five times the size of U.S. equity flows in May. On Friday, after the soft jobs report, CNBC's Jim Cramer said the bond market had been signalling this employment outcome. Yield on the 10-year Treasury hits its 2017 low on Friday. One of the biggest high-yield bond ETFs was one of the biggest losers among all ETFs in May. The iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) saw outflows of near $1.4 billion, shifting its year-to-date flows from being positive to negative overall. Mishra said the real surprise was that junk bonds, usually highly correlated with oil prices, continued to rally and attract inflows even as the energy sector was the worst performer. "Inflows out of junk bonds and into investment grade bonds suggest that investors are reducing the U.S. credit risk in their portfolios," Mishra said. 4. Investors are still betting broadly on U.S. stocks, but waiting for a new catalyst. Among the Sectors SPDRs —the best market proxy for sector rotation strategies — Consumer Staples (XLP), Consumer Discretionary (XLY), Utilities (XLU), and Industrials (XLI) all saw fresh all-time highs this week, with the Health Care SPDR (XLV) hitting its highest level since 2015. Even the Retail SPDR (XRT) had its best day of 2017. But in May, instead of a mix of winning and losing sectors, it was a month of little interest in U.S. stock sector bets. Only Consumer Discretionary took in any notable flows — $258 million. The Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) saw outflows of $761 million; followed by Technology (XLK), with outflows of $526 million; Consumer Staples, with outflows of $283 million; and Utilities (XLU), with outflows of $249 million. "It's notable that only XLY [Consumer Discretionary] of the 10 sectors saw [real] inflows. Investors are not using these products as tactically as they have historically," Rosenbluth said. "There's usually net inflows to a handful of sectors, a rotation, and it appears as if investors are going more diversified with their approach in U.S. equities." Some of XLY's top holdings have done well in the past month after better-than-expected earnings. It has more than a 15 percent allocation to Amazon, up more than 6 percent, along with some other top portfolio stocks — Comcast (6.5 percent), McDonald's (8.8 percent) and Starbucks (6.5 percent). Mishra said the ongoing political drama in Washington may lead investors to favor larger companies with higher overseas revenue exposure, and these companies have been significantly outperforming smaller, domestically focused companies this year. "Investors have just been cautious about U.S. stocks. ... Investors are just waiting for a new catalyst," Mishra said.

Ogg June 3, 2017 8:55 am EDT Print Email Tweet Investors have to be thrilled that the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 are all trading at all-time highs. The bull market is well over eight years old, and the market indexes have risen exponentially since the lows in 2009. Some investors have started feeling confused or puzzled about the relentless strength, particularly after investors find myriad reasons to keep buying stocks after every sell-off. With valuations so high, and as many investors are trained to be cautious in the summer, some investors are looking for new ideas and safety as they still seek positive returns. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each day of the week to find new investing and trading ideas for its readers. This ends up being hundreds of analyst calls to parse each week. It turns out that some of these analyst reports covering stocks to buy are in the largest companies. Four analyst calls stood out from the rest of those calls during the week of June 2, 2017. Some of them are in blue chip stocks and others in companies that are becoming large enough they could be blue chips. Consensus analyst price target data are the mean of the Thomson Reuters sell-side research service. Additional color and commentary has been added on most of these daily analyst calls. Here are the four top analyst calls in major stocks from this past week. BP PLC (NYSE: BP) was reiterated as Buy with a $41 price target at Argus on June 1. The prior closing price was $36.15, but BP’s American depositary shares were trading down 0.9% at $35.91 at the end of Friday’s session. They have a 52-week trading range of $30.66 to $38.68, and the consensus price target is $37.84. While Argus lowered its 2017 earnings per share (EPS) target to $2.08 from $2.35 on lower margin projections for the BP refining business, the firm continues to expect higher crude oil and natural gas prices, along with additional cost cuts, to help. Broadcom Ltd. (NASDAQ: AVGO) had a huge move at the end of the week, rising more than 8% to $254.53 on earnings and shooting down any major Toshiba acquisition. Broadcom was reiterated as a Top Pick at RBC Capital Markets, and the firm raised its price target to $260 from $250 ahead of the report. Then came a dozen price target hikes afterward, but the biggest of them were at JPMorgan and Susquehanna, each raising its target to $300. Broadcom shares were at $239.82 earlier in the week, and the new 52-week trading range is $142.27 to $253.76. Its consensus target price was listed as $252.26 ahead of earnings, but that number will be much higher after the adjusted targets get factored in. Broadcom has also now entered the more than $100 billion market cap stock club. General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) was maintained as Outperform at Credit Suisse on May 31, and the firm has a sum-of-parts valuation of $33 per share. Credit Suisse took issue with a Deutsche Bank view, as the firm thinks that GE is not a broken company, even if the conglomerate might be somewhat misunderstood. The analyst call noted that GE’s sell-off has created an attractive entry point and the bear points, particularly around would-be risks that GE’s dividend may be cut, have been overstated. GE closed at $27.38 ahead of the call, and its shares were trading up at $27.88 as last week came to an end. GE has a 52-week range of $27.10 to $33.00 and a consensus target price that is still up at $32.14. 3M Co. (NYSE: MMM) was reiterated as Buy and the price target was raised to $234 from $219 by Jefferies on June 1. The share price was $204.47 ahead of the call, but they were up above $207 at all-time highs Friday afternoon. The Jefferies call and the latest share price are both ahead of the consensus price target of $196.21, and the stock has a 52-week range of $163.85 to $207.30. Jefferies noted that both the OECD LEIs and its preferred proxy for industrial momentum suggest tailwinds for 3M’s operations. Valuations, it is often said, are stretched, but the firm feels that as long as the OECD LEIs continue to improve then 3M shares can continue to outperform.

Popular's shares fell almost 40 percent in the past three days on concern it would not find a buyer or raise new capital to fix its balance sheet, which is weighed down with 37 billion euros ($41 billion) of non-performing real estate assets. One of Europe's top bank watchdogs warned European Union officials that Popular might need to be wound down if it failed to find a buyer, an EU official told Reuters this week. "Banco Popular remains solvent and has positive equity," Chairman Emilio Saracho wrote to his executives in a letter sent on Friday, seeking to reassure them despite what he called the "difficult situation." The letter, first published by Expansion newspaper, was confirmed by a bank spokeswoman who read the content to Reuters. Saracho would meet ECB officials on Tuesday, a source familiar with the meeting told Reuters, adding that the appointment was part of the ECB's routine supervisory responsibilities and was scheduled "some time ago". Popular and the ECB declined to comment on the meeting. Saracho, hired in February in a leadership reshuffle, said in his letter that Popular would continue to seek new capital or a sale to fix its non-performing real estate assets that are the highest among Spanish banks. "Our clients and shareholders are the most important for us. For that reason we must relay them a message of calm and confidence that we are trying as hard as possible to overcome this situation," Saracho, a former JP Morgan executive, wrote. Elke Koenig, who chairs the EU's Single Resolution Board (SRB), a body that resolves struggling banks, had issued an "early warning", according to the EU official. The SRB said at the time it could not confirm the story. Spain's government said on Friday it was not worried about Popular and would await the outcome of the sale process, which the bank says it could extend past a June 10 offer deadline. The economy minister, Luis de Guindos, has said he does not expect a state bailout given Popular's capital levels were still above regulatory requirements set out by the ECB. Spain's biggest bank Santander and state-owned lender Bankia are seen as the most likely buyers for any acquisition. A capital increase, which analysts say would need to raise at least 3 billion euros, faces resistance from shareholders who fear greater dilution. Popular shares have fallen 75 percent over the past year, making them the worst performers on the European STOXX banking index. This week's slip made Popular the smallest company by valuation on Spain's blue-chip Ibex index.

Yet six weeks on, all sorts of doubts have set in. Strategists, traders and bank salespeople fell over themselves on April 18 to argue the election would strengthen May’s hand over hardline Euro-sceptics in her own party and, more generally, remove election risk from imminent talks with Brussels on Britain’s departure from the European Union. Even if she fell short, they said, a weaker majority might also force her to pay more heed to other views in parliament that are softer on issues of immigration and access to the EU’s lucrative single market. The pound surged almost 4 per cent in three weeks, topping $1.30 (Dh4.77) for the first time in six months and prompting banks and the big asset managers who dominate financial markets to cash in profits made betting against sterling since last June. But in the past 10 days of conflicting opinion polls, that boost has evaporated and investors now face Brexit talks, and all the difficult headlines they will bring, with sterling again looking vulnerable. In trade-weighted terms, the pound is back where it was on April 9. “Would I want a big bet on how the election’s going to go? Bluntly, no, because there’s so much volatility around the polling,” said Mike Amey, head of sterling portfolios at giant bond investor PIMCO. “We don’t have a big position on the currency, we think that sterling and bonds are on the richer side. [But] it doesn’t seem like an obvious period, with sterling where it is, to run a very big position one way or the other.” History Some wonder why the pound hasn’t fallen more. Sterling has a history of weakening in the run-in to closely fought elections as well as one of falling when the Conservatives’ poll ratings are worsening. Foreign exchange traders in London have always preferred the prospect of a right-leaning government that keeps a lid on public spending and taxation of their bonuses. Yet sterling’s falls of the past fortnight pale in comparison with others since last June. One reason is that this is no ordinary election. The market has got used to May’s plan for Britain’s divorce from Europe, but for financial investors it is still the wrong one — the same “hard Brexit” blueprint that had them selling the pound aggressively last September and October. “Alternative scenarios look worse short-term, but better further out,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note to clients this week. “With a smaller majority for the Conservatives than today or a Labour-led government, we would assume a more negative initial reaction to greater political instability, but a softer Brexit, higher spending and stronger medium-term growth prospects than in our base case.” Others, notably the world’s second biggest currency trader JPMorgan, took a similar line this week. Another element is the growing familiarity of investors with big political risks over the past two years and the extent to which most have tended to avoid positioning heavily for one result or another ahead of major events. Progressive coalition Donald Trump’s election last November, like the Brexit referendum before it, taught investors to keep their money off the table until the results were in. “I could see a scenario like the US election, when the market tried to sell the dollar [after Trump won] and then began to think about the actual policies and we then saw a rally that lasted weeks,” says Lee Hardman, a strategist with giant Japanese financial group MUFG. “A progressive coalition could lead ultimately to a stronger pound. If there was a left-leaning coalition of Labour and Lib Dems (Liberal Democrats), obviously the Brexit strategy would be ripped up.” So if there are bets against the pound, for now they have been taken where they are cheapest — in the options market. The one-month sterling-dollar risk reversal — a measure of the balance of bets for more falls of the currency in the next month over those for more gains — hit its most negative since early February on Wednesday. Analysts from Canadian bank RBC calculate that the market currently prices in a Conservative majority of 85 seats, down from an earlier peak of 160. “The longer-term implications of the election are more ambiguous, but sterling’s preference for a larger expected Conservative majority is clear in the short term and the risk is that both fall further,” the bank’s head of G10 FX strategy Adam Cole said in research sent to clients on Friday.

Popular's shares fell almost 40 percent in the past three days on concern it would not find a buyer or raise new capital to fix its balance sheet, which is weighed down with 37 billion euros ($41 billion) of non-performing real estate assets. One of Europe's top bank watchdogs warned European Union officials that Popular might need to be wound down if it failed to find a buyer, an EU official told Reuters this week. "Banco Popular remains solvent and has positive equity," Chairman Emilio Saracho wrote to his executives in a letter sent on Friday, seeking to reassure them despite what he called the "difficult situation." The letter, first published by Expansion newspaper, was confirmed by a bank spokeswoman who read the content to Reuters. Saracho would meet ECB officials on Tuesday, a source familiar with the meeting told Reuters, adding that the appointment was part of the ECB's routine supervisory responsibilities and was scheduled "some time ago". Popular and the ECB declined to comment on the meeting. Saracho, hired in February in a leadership reshuffle, said in his letter that Popular would continue to seek new capital or a sale to fix its non-performing real estate assets that are the highest among Spanish banks. "Our clients and shareholders are the most important for us. For that reason we must relay them a message of calm and confidence that we are trying as hard as possible to overcome this situation," Saracho, a former JP Morgan executive, wrote. Elke Koenig, who chairs the EU's Single Resolution Board (SRB), a body that resolves struggling banks, had issued an "early warning", according to the EU official. The SRB said at the time it could not confirm the story. Spain's government said on Friday it was not worried about Popular and would await the outcome of the sale process, which the bank says it could extend past a June 10 offer deadline. The economy minister, Luis de Guindos, has said he does not expect a state bailout given Popular's capital levels were still above regulatory requirements set out by the ECB. Spain's biggest bank Santander and state-owned lender Bankia are seen as the most likely buyers for any acquisition. A capital increase, which analysts say would need to raise at least 3 billion euros, faces resistance from shareholders who fear greater dilution. Popular shares have fallen 75 percent over the past year, making them the worst performers on the European STOXX banking index. This week's slip made Popular the smallest company by valuation on Spain's blue-chip Ibex index.

Coren Obsession "America First" June 03, 2017 Not everyone is applauding. (Joshua Roberts / Reuters) Share Written by Michael J. Coren Obsession "America First" June 03, 2017 US President Donald’s Trump’s decision to dump the Paris Climate Accord on June 1 sent executives and politicians in the US scrambling to map out a response. Many took the occasion to voice their displeasure with the President, or confirm their commitment to the environment. The members of his Strategic and Policy Forum are in a particularly tricky spot. Remaining as one of his hand-picked business advisors could be viewed by some customers and investors as tacit agreement with the administration’s policies. Leaving essentially shuts you out of the White House decision-making process. Here’s who is staying and who is going, so far. Out Elon Musk, Chairman and CEO, SpaceX and Tesla Musk justified his participation in the council as a chance to lobby Trump to take action on climate and renewable energy. Judging by the June 1 announcement, it wasn’t enough. Musk was the last Silicon Valley technology executive on the Strategic and Policy Forum after Uber CEO Travis Kalanick left earlier this year. Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 Bob Iger, chairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company Soon after Musk’s announcement, Iger followed suit. As a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal. — Robert Iger (@RobertIger) June 1, 2017 The decision could have real business ramifications for Iger—Trump fans pledged to #BoycottDisney on Twitter. Travis Kalanick, CEO and co-founder, Uber Technologies (Quit already). Kalanick used Trump’s Paris announcement to remind everyone he had already left, and that yes, he does care about climate change. I stepped down from the Presidential biz council on Feb 2. Uber cares abt climate change https://t.co/cHMbE2yIpv https://t.co/Spyznv0KoC — travis kalanick (@travisk) June 2, 2017 Kalanick quit Feb. 2, after the president’s immigration executive order that was dubbed a “Muslim ban,” under heavy pressure from Uber customers. “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,” he said at the time, according to The Guardian. IN A few CEOs said they were sticking with the Trump administration. Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co “I absolutely disagree with the Administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people’s lives and protect our environment.”—statement via a spokesperson. Toby Cosgrove, CEO, Cleveland Clinic “There has been no change. He remains on the advisory group at this time.”—Cleveland Clinic spokesperson Mary Barra, chairman and CEO, General Motors “Mary Barra’s participation on the President’s Strategy and Policy Forum provides GM a seat at an important table to contribute to a constructive dialogue about key policy issues. The Forum continues to provide an opportunity to work with the administration and other corporate leaders on policies that support a strong and competitive economy and automotive industry.”—General Motors spokesperson Rich Lesser, CEO, Boston Consulting Group “Our participation in the forum provides an opportunity and a responsibility to engage directly with the President on critical issues important to the United States and our world. We believe that it is very important that the administration receives a range of views and robustly developed perspectives. We currently expect that Rich will continue to be involved as an external advisor through the Forum.”—Published statement on Trump’s decision. Stephen A. Schwarzman, co-founder and CEO, Blackstone Schwarzman will remain, said one person briefed on his plans. No comment A few side-stepped the issue. Adebayo “Bayo” Ogunlesi, chairman and managing partner, Global Infrastructure Partners “No comment.”—Global Infrastructure Partners spokesperson Indra Nooyi, Chairman and CEO, PepsiCo “The Paris Agreement was designed as a framework to help protect our planet while also spurring innovation and economic growth in participating countries. While we are disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table. PepsiCo’s longstanding commitment to addressing climate change will not change. We have a science-based goal to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain by at least 20% by 2030, and we will continue taking action to deliver on this goal.”—PepsiCo spokesperson No response Quartz has reached out to these executives and will update with any response. Jack Welch, former chairman and CEO at General Electric Paul Atkins, CEO (former SEC commissioner), Patomak Global Partners Mark Weinberger, global chairman and CEO, EY Kevin Warsh, visiting fellow and former board member at the Federal Reserve, Hoover Institute Ginni Rometty, president, and CEO, IBM Doug McMillon, president and CEO, Wal-Mart Larry Fink, chairman and CEO, BlackRock Jim McNerney, former Boeing chairman, president and CEO Daniel Yergin, vice chairman, IHS Markit Most Popular Open-minded people have a different visual perception of reality Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Wall Street continued its lament of President Trump’s exit of the Paris climate agreement Friday — with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein taking to Twitter again. “Leadership helps” the US, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein wrote in a bizarre, emoji-heavy tweet, fretting that America might lose its profile on the world stage. “Our language is dominant; $ global; [world] talent comes. Bad if lost. Consider w/ making policy on enviro, trade, defense, etc.” It was only the second time Blankfein has ever tweeted, despite opening the account in June 2011. His first-ever tweet on Thursday griped that Trump’s Paris move was a “setback” for the US. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said Friday he disagreed with the president, “but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people’s lives and protect our environment.” Leadership helps 🇺🇸Our language is dominant; $ global; 🌎talent comes.

Go to Search More news The reinvention of global banking: withstanding challenges, seizing opportunities Business & Economy ► SPIEF-2017 June 03, 5:29 UTC+3 Share 1 pages in this article KEY CONCLUSIONS: Global banking has recovered from financial crises “We are almost through the healing process after ten years of almost semi-permanent crisis. The financial sector is much stronger,” said Lionel Barber, Editor, The Financial Times. Russia’s socio-economic development strategy is about to bring positive changes “Today, the president instructed to set up economic development programmes for the upcoming period <…> addressing issues on the economy, the legal system and the investment climate,” said Andrey Kostin, President, Chairman of the Management Board, Member of the Supervisory Council, Member of the Strategy and Corporate Governance Committee, VTB Bank. CHALLENGES: Significant investment needed to introduce innovative technologies “The lack of major investments, the failure to shift the banking business towards the customer needs, the absence of digital banking make the banks lag behind,” said Andrey Kostin. Increased cyber crime risks coming from new technologies “<…> It is around all compliance issues, it is also going to be around data protection, because we are in the world where we innovate. We are able to use data, but at the same time, there is a requirement for more [cyber] security,” said Frederic Oudea, President, European Banking Federation; Chief Executive Officer, Société Générale.   Tougher regulatory requirements “We are much more worried about the regulatory issues <…> it will take us several years to digest today’s changes in the global regulatory field,” said Andrei Kostin. “This rapid change will to some extent be hindered by regulators <…> They do not quite understand how to handle new technologies <…> That creates additional risks for national financial systems,” added Andrei Kostin. Brexit hampering the banking business “As the European bank, we have ahead Brexit and its potential consequences, it is an important element,” said Frederic Oudea.   “What we are going to do with it? We will have to move some people. It will be bankers, traders, sales people, compliance lawyers,” said Daniel Pinto, Chief Executive Officer, Corporate and Investment Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co.   Shadow banking “We are looking at shadow banking in China, the debt is extraordinarily high, of course, savings are high too <...>. So far there has been no hard landing in China, the Chinese authorities have been very, very clear that they would do anything to avoid <...> but you still going to look at that,” said Lionel Barber. Low rates in the EU “You know we suffer in Europe from very low rates and even negative rates, so with the macroeconomic environment it is going to take some time,” said Frederic Oudea. SOLUTIONS: Extensive adoption and use of innovative IT solutions “There is a massive need for using technologies not just for interacting with the customers but also to really ensure straightforward processes <...> you need digitalisation,” said Hans-Paul Buerkner, Chairman, The Boston Consulting Group. “[There was a discussion about] blockchain [and they tried to understand what it means] to have maybe once a virtual digital currency for central banks,” said Philipp Roesler, Member of the Managing Board, World Economic Forum. Sanctions as an enabler of internal growth of the Russian banking system “We took a serious look at ourselves and saw huge reserves, and the ways to increase our margins, first of all <...> we understood that we do have opportunities to earn more and to use the earnings to capitalise the bank,” said Andrey Kostin. Lower compliance costs “[One of the potential advantages of modifying some of the regulations is] reducing the cost of compliance. Right now, there are some regulations in the US where we have to file reports with 3 or 4 different US regulatory agencies. If that could be streamlined so that we would have to do it only once, it would be very helpful,” said James С. Cowles, Chief Executive Officer Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Citigroup Inc. {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Top News June 05, 7:48 Arab countries severing diplomatic relations with Qatar June 05, 7:48 June 04, 17:34 In connection with terrorist acts in London police arrest 12 people June 04, 17:34 June 05, 3:49 Putin recalls Kennedy’s assassination to compare with Russia’s alleged interference June 05, 3:49 June 04, 14:09 Death toll from London terrorist attacks rises to seven June 04, 14:09 In other media Реклама Photo 12 The 2017 World Car of the Year and its rivals at the New York Auto Show 15 How Russians conquered the Arctic in vintage photos 13 Futuristic supercars at the Geneva Motor Show Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Gas agreement signed by Russia, Ukraine and the EU Altai gas pipeline Economical sanctions against Russia Most read Now Today This week 1 Putin says US should modify electoral system 2 Arab countries severing diplomatic relations with Qatar 3 Putin emphasizes that Sweden's entry to NATO would jeopardize ties with Moscow 4 Russian submarines to be equipped with Kalibr missiles by 2025 5 Legalization of cryptocurrencies to simplify startups financing - Ethereum 6 Russia’s economic policy no longer depends on oil prices - Economic Development Minister 7 Russia’s ‘soldier of the future’ combat gear excels foreign rivals by armor protection 1 Putin asked Bill Clinton to consider option Russia might join NATO 2 Russia’s economic policy no longer depends on oil prices - Economic Development Minister 3 More than 380 agreements were signed at SPIEF-2017 for 2 trillion rubles ($35.32 bln) 4 Putin recalls Kennedy’s assassination to compare with Russia’s alleged interference 5 Trump following London attacks calls for stopping being politically correct 6 Russian submarines to be equipped with Kalibr missiles by 2025 7 Six people died in terrorist acts in London - police 1 Moscow concerned over US threats against Syria’s armed forces 2 Russia’s cutting-edge fighter jet to enter service this year 3 Moscow mayor says Monday's hurricane 'unprecedented' 4 Russian cruise missiles hit terrorist targets near Palmyra 5 Putin asked Bill Clinton to consider option Russia might join NATO 6 Russian anti-submarine destroyer enters English Channel 7 Putin jokes about climate change, US hegemony at St. Petersburg forum TOP STORIES CONFLICT IN SYRIA RUSSIA'S DEFENSE INDUSTRY OIL& GAS INDUSTRY SPACE PROGRAMS Реклама News Russian Politics & Diplomacy World Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

Vestnik Kavkaza IN RUSSIAN Twitter Facebook Rss YouTube GoogleMedia Instagram Possible outcome of SCO expansion Americans at St. Petersburg Forum Great wall of Turkey Vestnik Kavkaza News Analysis Interviews Articles World press review Photo gallery Video Radio Persons AnalysisRussiaWorldPolitics Americans at St. Petersburg Forum Jun 4 - 6:00 pm Voice of America Vladimir Putin and Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of International Affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce For three years after Crimea held referendum to return to Russia, Washington officials quietly cautioned major U.S. firms about attending the annual St. Petersburg forum, where investors mingle with President Vladimir Putin and his lieutenants. This year, the first forum since Donald Trump became U.S. president, such cautions were not issued, according to four people familiar with preparations for U.S. companies to attend. As Voice of America writes in an article "This Year, No US Pressure to Avoid Russia’s Davos", Washington’s policy toward Russia is essentially unchanged under Trump, with the United States committed to maintaining sanctions on Moscow unless it complies with international demands about Ukraine. But its approach this year to the St. Petersburg event — often described as Russia’s version of the Davos forum in Switzerland — reveals a change in tone, according to some people who follow U.S.-Russia trade relations. Daniel Russell, the head of the U.S.-Russia business council, when asked if U.S. companies were feeling less pressure from the administration to stay away, said: “I think that’s right. “Some of the companies, particularly in 2015, received calls from the U.S. government not to attend and I think that attitude has certainly changed,” he said. The change in tone fits with promises Trump made during his election campaign to pursue friendlier ties with Russia. Any sign of warming toward the Kremlin is highly sensitive for the White House, since Congress and the FBI are conducting inquiries into whether members of the Trump team had improper contacts with Russian officials before Trump’s inauguration. Trump has denied doing anything wrong. Asked about contacts with companies planning to attend the forum, a State Department spokesperson said: “We have an open dialogue with the business community, and ultimately companies are free to make their own decisions, in line with applicable laws and regulations.” U.S. ambassador to Russia John Tefft was at the forum, though he did not have a speaking slot. No U.S. ambassador attended in 2014, 2015 or 2016. A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Moscow said his attendance was a routine part of his ambassadorial duties. Major U.S. companies who sent senior executives, including oil major Exxon, Boeing, Chevron and JPMorgan, were represented at a similar level to last year, but several delegates at the forum said they estimated the U.S. presence to be numerically bigger than in previous years. “We see a much larger number of people from the U.S., Canada,” said Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, a state body that works with foreign investors. “There is a better understanding (among foreign investors) that sanctions really did not work, the Russian economy continues to grow, Russia represents an attractive market and people should work with Russia,” he told Reuters. Russian economy growing Several U.S. delegates said that, politics aside, they were drawn to the forum by the fact the Russian economy had returned to growth after a slowdown. The forum is a prestige project for Putin, a native of St. Petersburg. Foreign executives typically use their presence to signal to the Kremlin their enthusiasm for investing in Russia. In 2014, when the Ukraine crisis first started, U.S. Cabinet officials including Secretary of State John Kerry made personal calls to chief executives of U.S. firms asking them not to attend, said a former U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The next year, senior U.S. officials below Cabinet level were charged with persuading American executives not to attend, and in 2016, U.S. officials brought up the issue in a low-level manner, the former official said. The account of those conversations was confirmed by a second former official who served in the administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama. The guidance in later years was not necessarily to stay away, but that executives who did attend should keep their presence low-key, said several other people familiar with the discussions. Ian Colebourne, who is CEO for Deloitte in the Commonwealth of Independent States and sits on the U.S.-Russia business council, said he was aware of officials giving guidance to executives in previous years, but added: “I haven’t heard anything this year.” Green light? The lack of contact from the U.S. government this year is being interpreted among business executives as meaning: “You can go,” said one of the two sources. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce did not receive any guidance from the administration about whether or not to participate in the event, a source with the Chamber said. Still, some companies that did attend exercised caution, keeping a low profile. The head of U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil, Darren Woods, did not join the table of panelists at the main oil session of the forum.

This year, the first forum since Donald Trump became U.S. president, such cautions were not issued, according to four people familiar with preparations for U.S. companies to attend. Washington's policy toward Russia is essentially unchanged under Trump, with the United States committed to maintaining sanctions on Moscow unless it complies with international demands about Ukraine. But its approach this year to the St Petersburg event - often described as Russia's version of the Davos forum in Switzerland - reveals a change in tone, according to some people who follow U.S.-Russia trade relations. Daniel Russell, the head of the U.S.-Russia business council, when asked if U.S. companies were feeling less pressure from the administration to stay away, said: "I think that's right. "Some of the companies, particularly in 2015, received calls from the U.S. government not to attend and I think that attitude has certainly changed." The change in tone fits with promises Trump made during his election campaign to pursue friendlier ties with Russia. Any sign of warming toward the Kremlin is highly sensitive for the White House, since Congress and the FBI are conducting inquiries into whether members of the Trump team had improper contacts with Russian officials before Trump's inauguration. Trump has denied doing anything wrong. Asked about contacts with companies planning to attend the forum, a State Department spokesperson said: "We have an open dialogue with the business community, and ultimately companies are free to make their own decisions, in line with applicable laws and regulations." The forum in St Petersburg was in its second day on Friday and there were signs of a more substantial U.S. presence than in previous years since the March 2014 annexation of Crimea. U.S. AMBASSADOR U.S. ambassador to Russia John Tefft was at the forum, though he did not have a speaking slot. No U.S. ambassador attended in 2014, 2015 or 2016. A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Moscow said his attendance was a routine part of his ambassadorial duties. Major U.S. companies who sent senior executives - including oil major Exxon, Boeing, Chevron and JPMorgan - were represented at a similar level to last year, but several delegates at the forum said they estimated the U.S. presence to be numerically bigger than in previous years. "We see a much larger number of people from the U.S., Canada," said Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, a state body that works with foreign investors. "There is a better understanding (among foreign investors) that sanctions really did not work, the Russian economy continues to grow, Russia represents an attractive market and people should work with Russia," he told Reuters. Several U.S. delegates said that, politics aside, they were drawn to the forum by the fact the Russian economy had returned to growth after a slowdown. The forum is a prestige project for Putin, a native of St Petersburg. Foreign executives typically use their presence to signal to the Kremlin their enthusiasm for investing in Russia. In 2014, when the Ukraine crisis first started, U.S. cabinet officials including Secretary of State John Kerry made personal calls to chief executives of U.S. firms asking them not to attend, said a former U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The next year, senior U.S. officials below cabinet level were charged with persuading American executives not to attend, and in 2016, U.S. officials brought up the issue in a low-level manner, the former official said. The account of those conversations was confirmed by a second former official who served in the administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama. The guidance in later years was not necessarily to stay away, but that executives who did attend should keep their presence low-key, said several other people familiar with the discussions. Read More Ian Colebourne, who is CEO for Deloitte in the Commonwealth of Independent States and sits on the U.S.-Russia business council, said he was aware of officials giving guidance to executives in previous years, but added: "I haven't heard anything this year." Two other sources familiar with the preparations for U.S. companies to attend also said there had been no guidance before this year's forum, in contrast to previous years. GREEN LIGHT? The lack of contact from the U.S. government this year is being interpreted among business executives as meaning: “You can go,” said one of the two sources. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce did not receive any guidance from the administration about whether or not to participate in the event, a source with the Chamber said. Still, some companies that did attend exercised caution, keeping a low profile. The head of U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil, Darren Woods, did not join the table of panelists at the main oil session of the forum. It was chaired by the head of Kremlin oil major Rosneft, Igor Sechin, who is on the U.S. sanctions list. Like his predecessor as Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson, now Trump's Secretary of State, Woods made only brief remarks from the floor in a discussion about the energy industry. Woods declined to answer questions from Reuters. An Exxon representative said company policy was not to comment on the travel arrangements of its executives. Among other U.S. companies at the forum, JPMorgan Chase & Co., sent Daniel Pinto, Chief Executive Officer of its corporate and investment business, while Boeing sent Bertrand-Marc Allen, president of its international arm. U.S. oil major Chevron sent its vice president for business development, Jay Pryor. He was also at the forum last year.

"That would suggest they are not feeling that kind of pressure," to curb their presence, he said.

Home News World Business leaders abandon Trump's advisory panel after Paris accord withdrawal The Obama administration had committed the U.S. to reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025 under the agreement. 3 June 2017, 4:51pm Print Version The US has announced its withdrawal from the Paris accord which commits its signatories to holding the increase in the global average temperature to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and strive to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels Two leading US businessmen have withdrawn from US president Donald Trump's business advisory panel after Trump pressed on with his plans to pull out of the Paris climate accord. Tesla's Elon Musk tweeted “Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.” Disney's Robert Igor also quit the council on the same day. “As a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal.” The Paris accord commits its signatories  to holding the increase in the global average temperature to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and strive to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The deal requires countries to set their own targets for reducing emissions by 2020 and the Obama administration had committed the U.S. to reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025. The agreement also established a $100 billion fund to help vulnerable countries deal with the effects of climate change. Musk and Igor had formed part of a business advisory panel that Trump had set up shortly after being elected to office in a bid to show how his administration would “draw on private sector expertise” to reinvigorate the US. The departures of big business in the form of Igor and Musk have been described as a disaster for the president, undermining Trump's claim to have an economic reason for the US abandoning the most ambitious climate change agreement in history. Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, who although not on Trump’s business panel condemned the move in a Tweet on Thursday, which read: "Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world.” The two defections and Blankfein’s message leave a lot of other people on Trump’s high-powered business council in a very awkward position, given their own – and their companies’ – views on Paris and climate change. Other members of Trump's business team are also at odds with his policies. Jamie Dimon, chairman, president and CEO of JPMorgan Chase warned of “negative trade implications if the United States exits from the Paris agreement,” while Trump's right-hand man in the group, Stephen Schwarzman – co-founder, chairman and CEO of Blackstone investment group, had blogged about the urgency of combating climate change in the past.   Share on Facebook Share on Twitter World Four Arab countries cut ties with Qatar Election 2017 Who has made it to Parliament?

Ian Colebourne, who is CEO for Deloitte in the Commonwealth of Independent States and sits on the U.S.-Russia business council, said he was aware of officials giving guidance to executives in previous years, but added: "I haven't heard anything this year." Two other sources familiar with the preparations for U.S. companies to attend also said there had been no guidance before this year's forum, in contrast to previous years. GREEN LIGHT? The lack of contact from the U.S. government this year is being interpreted among business executives as meaning: "You can go," said one of the two sources. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce did not receive any guidance from the administration about whether or not to participate in the event, a source with the Chamber said. Still, some companies that did attend exercised caution, keeping a low profile. The head of U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil, Darren Woods, did not join the table of panelists at the main oil session of the forum. It was chaired by the head of Kremlin oil major Rosneft, Igor Sechin, who is on the U.S. sanctions list. Like his predecessor as Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson, now Trump's Secretary of State, Woods made only brief remarks from the floor in a discussion about the energy industry.

An Exxon representative said company policy was not to comment on the travel arrangements of its executives. Among other U.S. companies at the forum, JPMorgan Chase & Co., sent Daniel Pinto, Chief Executive Officer of its corporate and investment business, while Boeing sent Bertrand-Marc Allen, president of its international arm. U.S. oil major Chevron sent its vice president for business development, Jay Pryor. He was also at the forum last year. A company representative did not reply to questions about any guidance from the administration. "Let's say the seniority of some of the teams is more senior this year, certainly compared to some prior years and that's a positive sign," Deloitte's Colebourne said of the U.S corporate presence. Robert Dudley, chief executive of BP, a British company with substantial business in the United States, said his impression was that this year there were more representatives of U.S. companies at the forum than previously. "That would suggest they are not feeling that kind of pressure," to curb their presence, he said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Friday pushed back its forecast for a third rate increase this year to December from September. Trading in futures contracts shows odds of a September increase have dropped to just one in four, and investors are now pricing in less than one rate hike in 2018 for the first time since the eve of the U.S. elections in November. Fed officials speaking on Friday expressed no disappointment with the payrolls gain of 138,000 last month, which was below economists’ expectations. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker called it a “good number,” while Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said “if we are not at full employment, we are moving closer.” “I’d be very surprised if they didn’t hike in June, given all the signals that they have sent,” said Jonathan Wright, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. While he still expects two more interest-rate increases this year, the probability has increased that the Federal Open Market Committee will move only in June, he said. The Labor Department report showed the jobless rate fell to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, which is below the level the FOMC estimates to be full employment. Monthly payroll gains are averaging 162,000 this year, a step down from the 2016 pace of 187,000. Average hourly earnings rose 2.5 percent from a year earlier, indicating a tightening labor market hasn’t brought an acceleration in wages. The FOMC, last raised rates in March and at the time projected two additional increases this year and three in 2018. Those quarterly forecasts will be updated this month. “The Fed has little credibility,” said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist with Jefferies LLC in New York. Investors expect “the Fed to again back away from raising rates at minimal provocation. That is the legacy of the FOMC rate hikes underachieving relative to FOMC projections for so many years.” If Yellen decides to push forward in September, the FOMC may be forced to engage in a “public campaign” of fairly explicit signals for a rate hike similar to what occurred in March, he said.

Sign Up The Fed’s Beige Book on Wednesday cited a variety of anecdotes of worker shortages and isolated pay raises across the central bank’s 12 districts. There was a manufacturer in the Chicago region raising pay 10 percent to attract workers. In the Atlanta district, construction work was delayed because of an inability to fill positions. In the Cleveland area, a transportation firm gave drivers a raise amounting to 7.5 percent to retain them. Yet overall, there’s no sign the tightening labor market is lifting inflation, which has been under the Fed’s 2 percent target for every month but one for the last five years. The Fed’s preferred measure of prices, excluding food and energy, rose just 1.5 percent in April from a year earlier. The data point to an “unbelievably weak response” of wage growth to the jobless rate, said Anthony Chan, chief economist with JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Chase Private Client unit and a former Fed economist. He reduced his forecast for rate increases in 2018 to two from three. Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday warned that the softening inflation could cause her to reassess the outlook for policy if it persists. “There’s no sign wages are accelerating,” said Stuart Hoffman, senior economic adviser at PNC Financial Services Group Inc. in Pittsburgh. “Unless we see some pickup in the summer months, not just in the job numbers but also in wages and inflation, there’s less-than-even odds that the Fed will go in September.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

About us Our staff Contacts Home Business Health Science Tech World Government to sell off a 25% stake in AIB June 3, 2017 Paul Smedley Leave a comment The Irish government launched its long-awaited initial public offering of state-owned AIB on Tuesday, offering a 25 percent stake in what is set to be one of Europe’s largest bank listings since the 2008 financial crisis. Analysts say it could raise around 3 billion euros, based on the bank’s book value of 11.3 billion euros at the end of a year ago and the fact that it has continued to generate capital and resumed dividend payments since. Following the publication of an approved prospectus in connection with the IPO, members of the public in Ireland and the United Kingdom may apply to purchase shares in the IPO, through what is called an intermediary offer, through participating intermediaries subject to certain conditions. Dublin owns a 99.9-percent stake in the bank after rescuing it with nearly 21 billion euros ($23 billion) of taxpayers’ cash seven years ago. “Once the 25% hits the market, we’ll have a fully liquid stock, so you’d expect more normalised share-price movements over time”. “Today’s decision is a significant step in the continued normalization of the state’s involvement in Ireland’s banking system”. AIB management have said they have received “huge interest in the Irish story” from investors in recent months, pitching the bank as a rare stock market play focused nearly exclusively on the European Union’s fastest growing economy. Bernard Byrne, chief executive of AIB, added: “Our strategy is clear”. Noonan had indicated that the 8 June UK election would not cause any delays. The sale will also represent the government’s biggest test of investor appetite for its banks. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), Davy Stockbrokers and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) are global coordinators, while Citigroup (C.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Goodbody Stockbrokers, JPMorgan (JPM.N) and UBS (UBSG.S) are bookrunners on the IPO. Dublin’s inability to finance the rescues of Anglo Irish, AIB and other smaller lenders ultimately forced it into €67.5bn bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.

Follow The Daily Beast on Twitter Like The Daily Beast on Facebook Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast DRIP DRIP DRIP Hackers Vow to Release Apparent Trove of U.A.E. Ambassador’s Emails The hackers are offering a sample of alleged messages they claim demonstrate “how a small rich country/company used lobbyists to hurt American interests and those of it allies.” Kevin Poulsen 06.02.17 4:45 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast A hacker group calling itself “GlobalLeaks” has begun distributing hacked emails stolen from the inbox of Yousef Al Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates’ ambassador to the United States and a man credited for cementing America’s close alliance with the U.A.E. in the war on ISIS. The hackers reached out to The Daily Beast in email this week to offer a sample of the messages they claimed demonstrated “how a small rich country/company used lobbyists to hurt American interests and those of it allies.” The leaks, they said, “reveal how million of dollars were used to hurt reputation of American allies and cause policy change.” The leakers said they plan to publish the material themselves on Saturday. The sample is comprised of 55 pages of documents that appear to have been printed out and recaptured by a digital camera. The leakers claimed the documents had been provided to them by a paid whistleblower embedded in a Washington, D.C., lobbyist group, though it’s clear from even a cursory examination that they were printed out from Al Otaiba’s Hotmail account. The earliest message in the sample dates to 2014, and the most recent is from last month. Embassy spokeswoman Lamiyae Jbari confirmed that the Hotmail address in the emails belongs to Al Otaiba, and said The Daily Beast’s phone call was the first the embassy had heard of the account being hacked and the contents leaked. “I’m sure you’re not the only one who received it,” she added. The identity of the “GlobalLeaks” hackers—who have no relation to the open source whistleblowing project by the same name—is uncertain. They contacted The Daily Beast from a free account at a Russian email provider, and the subject line of their emails read “DC Leaks- The Lobbyist Edition Part 1”—a reference to the DC Leaks website established one year ago this month to publish stolen emails belonging to several prominent U.S. officials, including former Secretary of State Colin Powell. According to a U.S. intelligence assessment, DC Leaks was a false front set up by the Russian government as part of the same influence operation that targeted Hillary Clinton in the election. This new hack comes just as Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged for the first time that Russian hackers may have interfered with the U.S. election, though Putin claimed that such intruders would have been self-guided “patriotic” hackers with no connection to the Kremlin. “Hackers are free people, just like artists who wake up in the morning in a good mood and start painting,” Putin said. The Russian government is not known to target the U.A.E. in the way it goes after the U.S. and Europe. But last year security experts at ThreatConnect and Fidelis Cybersecurity picked up a possible early warning of a cyber attack on the U.A.E.’s foreign affairs department. The security experts found indications that the same hackers who hit the Democratic National Committee had registered a web address—mofa-uae[.]com—that could only have been meant to spoof the Emirates’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Al Otaiba is a recognizable figure in D.C.’s diplomatic circles, who has been called “the most charming man in Washington,” so the full tranche of emails in the hackers’ possession is sure to include friendly exchanges between the ambassador and a raft of movers and shakers inside the Beltway. The excerpts provided to The Daily Beast include several emails between Al Otaiba and former Obama Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who’s now a principal at RiceHadleyGates, an influential Washington consulting firm that counts companies like ExxonMobil as clients. “I want to advise you that I will be in Abu Dhabi later this month in connection with the JP Morgan Chase International Advisory Board meeting there,” Gates apparently wrote in an October 2015 email. “I know this is short notice (I just received the full schedule), but I would like to see my friend the crown prince while I’m there.” Whatever the leak is meant to accomplish—a distraction, perhaps, from weightier issues involving President Donald Trump and Russia—its contents fall short of the explosive revelations hinted at in the cover letter. Beyond the Gates emails, they include notes from an symposium on Islamic extremism, a proposed agenda for an upcoming meeting with the hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies, and a note on the U.A.E.’s move to impose a tax on sugary soft drinks.
