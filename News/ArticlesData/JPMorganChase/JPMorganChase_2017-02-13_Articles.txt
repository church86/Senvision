ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here Of late, the flow of wisdom from top central bankers to the less privileged ones has come down to a trickle. But there is an exception – the subject of cyber security. Reserve Bank of India deputy governor SS Mundra has addressed three conferences in as many months. But the message is more worrying than comforting. His lament was that while the threats for over 1.4-billion bank accounts are on the rise, the banks are hardly doing much to protect their customers. Leave alone taking precautionary measures, they don’t even do the mandatory reporting bit to the regulator on time. Also Read: Bad bank is not a bad idea after all In March 2011, when hackers infiltrated RSA - one of the world’s top computer security companies - the message was loud and clear that if a security company gets broken into, it could happen to anyone. A few years later, its chief Amit Yoran shocked the security world when he announced that “the cyber-security industry was fundamentally broken and warned that it was only going to get worse.” A cyber-attack in the summer of 2014 on the world’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, rattled the industry when accounts of 76 million households and 7 million businesses were compromised. Its CEO Jamie Dimon wrote, “It is going to be a continual and likely never ending battle to stay ahead of it — and, unfortunately, not every battle will be won.” JPMorgan admitted to the breach and now invests nearly $600 million a year to prevent it. The $1.5-trillion Indian Banking industry in the last 6 months has reluctantly reported that a dozen banks were hit by malware, which included compromising 3.2 million card details. “The situation is very scary if banks don’t strengthen their cyber security, there is no doubt in my mind that all banks will be attacked,” says Kiran Shetty, India chief executive of SWIFT, a global financial messaging company. “I absolutely believe that cyber threat is going to evolve and it is going to become more intense than ever before.” So far, the attacks have been few and far between and most of them were minor breaches that did not threaten the industry or even the particular institution. But it could really bring down institutions as it recently happened with the Bangladesh central bank where operations came to a grinding halt. “Cyber-attacks in worst case situations can bring down the entire bank, it can deface their entire website, severely prohibit them from carrying on with their normal functions,” says Reshmi Khurana, managing director, global risk consultancy firm Kroll. The state of affairs in Indian banks does not give confidence. RBI has appointed a standing committee to redraw cyber security preparedness. “We have observed that in many cases, the banks react to cyber incidents in a knee jerk and ad hoc manner which at times has a potential to jeopardise future investigations,” RBI deputy governor SS Mundra said recently. “The world has learnt that in dealing with cyber-attacks, awareness and sharing of information play an important role. We often observe that this key premise is ignored.” While the regulator mandates reporting of cyber-attacks within 2-6 hours of detection, banks usually skip it. The official numbers also don’t reflect the true story. Top 51 banks in India have lost Rs 485 crore between April 2013 and Nov 2016 and 56 per cent of the money lost is due to Net banking thefts and card cloning incidents, finmin data shows. There are at least 15 ransomware attacks per hour in and one in three Indians falls prey to it. “Today India does not have a central repository to detect red flags early on and understand the modus operandi of cyber-attacks,” says Mukul Shrivastava, partner, fraud investigation & dispute services, EY India. “In many cases, organisations which have been previously attacked may mask it and move on, as compared to the western world where there is a reporting mechanism for cyber- attacks.” It is a double-edged sword for banks where digital transactions have soared since high value currency were scrapped while their infrastructure remained as unsafe as before. “As we go down the push towards digital, the counter point is security,” says Uday Kotak, executive vice-chairman, Kotak Bank. “There is risk with some digital initiatives, so be paranoid and believe that it is changing the world. It’s like belief in God. But make sure it’s the right God. Don’t say there is no God. Just in case there is one, you will be out of business. So better be paranoid.” Prevention requires investments, especially in technology. Globally, banks set aside 12-15 per cent of the annual tech spend for cyber security, while in India, most big banks do not even spend a couple of million dollars on IT, leave alone cyber security. “Before demonetisation, Indian banks had only 6-7 per cent transactions happening digitally versus the US, where over 80 per cent transactions are technologically enabled,” says Saket Modi, CEO, Lucideus Tech. “It simply means that the focus of the banks has not been on getting digitally enabled and, hence, it did not make commercial sense for the boards of large banks to sanction large budgets for cyber security.” Gartner, a global technology consultant, has predicted that IT spends by domestic banks and securities firms are expected to grow nearly 10 per cent to $8.9 billion in 2017. But despite the expected increase in IT spends, it’s quite possible that the adversaries will be able to outgun banks. “The probability of you being let down by your bank (even if they spend millions of dollars on security) is very real, thanks to the known unknowns in cyberspace. To err once is human, to err twice is lazy,” says Modi of Lucideus. The world of cyber security is like testing unchartered waters. RBI has warned banks that prevention is better than cure and banks will do well to secure themselves from a threat that has the potential to bring down a financial institution. “A chilling statement by an IT expert is ‘we have all been hacked, the only question is whether you know it or you don’t.’ While the statement may be alarmist, it is an antidote to complacency,” said former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan. “We will be living in interesting times. Whether it is a blessing or a curse is up to us.” Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Jury selection was set to begin in Manhattan federal court in the case of Yuri Lebedev, whom authorities call the architect of bitcoin exchange Coin.mx's platform, and Trevon Gross, a pastor and ex-chairman of a now-defunct credit union. But U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan delayed jury selection until Tuesday after prosecutors said they had secured a new witness. The witness, Philip Burgess, was represented by the law firm of one of Gross' lawyers in an unrelated tax case in which he was sentenced in 2010 to eight months in prison. Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Noble said Burgess, while "reporting another potential fraud" to prosecutors on Wednesday, revealed he had incriminating information stemming from his time as a potential investor in the credit union Gross headed. But after spending the day discussing how to resolve the conflict of Gross and Burgess sharing the same law firm, Nathan ruled prosecutors could not call their eve-of-trial new witness. "It is my conclusion that we will proceed tomorrow and the government may not call Mr. Burgess," she said. Gross, 52, and Lebedev, 39, are among nine people who have been charged following an investigation connected to a breach JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 that exposed over 83 million accounts. While Gross and Lebedev were not accused of hacking, they came under scrutiny in connection with Coin.mx, which authorities said was operated by Florida resident Anthony Murgio and owned by an Israeli behind the JPMorgan breach, Gery Shalon. Shalon has pleaded not guilty to charges that he orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million people's information. Prosecutors said Coin.mx operated through a front called "Collectables Club" to trick financial institutions into believing it was a memorabilia club while it converted, with no license, millions of dollars into bitcoin. To further evade scrutiny, in 2014, Murgio, with Lebedev's help, tried to take over Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, which was linked to HOPE Cathedral. To do so, they and others paid $150,000 in bribes via the church to Gross, its pastor, in exchange for facilitating Murgio's takeover and arranging for Lebedev and others to be put on the credit union's board, prosecutors said. Federal regulators took the credit union into conservatorship in 2015. Murgio pleaded guilty in January.

Trump recently complained that "many friends of mine who have nice businesses" can't get loans because of the regulations in Dodd-Frank. "The banks just won't let them borrow," the president said. The White House argues this lack of business lending is precisely why the 2010 Wall Street reform law needs to be rolled back. But a closer look at lending statistics suggests that this dramatic rhetoric about banks not lending doesn't match up with reality. In fact, banks are lending a ton to businesses these days. Commercial and industrial loans from commercial banks are an all-time high of $2.1 trillion last November, according to the Federal Reserve. Business lending did take a hit during the 2008 Wall Street meltdown. However, lending bottomed out after the Great Recession ended and bank loans to businesses have nearly doubled from the low. That means banks ramped up lending even after former President Obama signed Dodd-Frank into law in July 2010 in hopes of staving off another financial crash. For instance, in 2012 just as key elements of Dodd-Frank were being phased, commercial and industrial loans jumped by 12%, according to the Fed. Lending was up another 7% in 2013 and 12% in 2014. Darrell Duffie, a finance professor at Stanford University, said Trump's lending claim "is too broad." "U.S. banks have been providing large amounts of credit to businesses, much more than their European counterparts," he said. Related: Tough federal bank regulator calls it quits Overall, 79% of small businesses that applied for a bank loan were approved for at least some financing, according to a 2015 Fed survey of small businesses. Big banks would love regulatory relief. But that's not necessarily because they find it difficult to lend. "Loan growth remains robust," Marianne Lake, JPMorgan Chase's chief financial officer, said during the bank's conference call last month. JPMorgan (JPM) bragged about how it ended 2016 with record loan balances of $189 billion in its commercial bank. That's up an impressive 14% from the end of 2015. One analyst, Kenneth Usdin from Jefferies, even complimented JPMorgan during the call on "another great year of double-digit loan growth." Bank of America (BAC) also seems to be navigating the Dodd-Frank world pretty okay, when it comes to loans. BofA CEO Brian Moynihan said last month that commercial business loan growth "kicked up" during the fourth quarter as mid-size business borrowing was "strong." Even Wells Fargo, which has been grappling with a scandal that's hurt its reputation, is lending more. Wells Fargo's (WFC) commercial loan book increased by 11% in the fourth quarter to nearly $507 billion. Barney Frank, one of Dodd-Frank's authors, recently told CNNMoney there's "no evidence" to support Trump's claim that the law is killing lending. "If we had inflicted a disaster on the American financial system, it would have shown up," Frank said. Related: Wall Street has a powerful seat at Trump's table Still, critics argue that Dodd-Frank made banks too risk-averse, hurting less-proven young companies. "The only businesses that can obtain loans are those that can prove they don't actually need the loan," Harvey Pitt, who served as SEC commissioner under former President George W. Bush, told CNNMoney. These early-stage companies aren't able to reliably turn to banks for loans because regulations have raised lending standards, Pitt said. "Dodd-Frank has made it much harder for those businesses that are the true generators of economic growth to raise capital," he said. To Pitt's point, the Fed small business survey shows that 50% of bank loan applicants faced a financing shortfall, meaning they received a smaller loan than they requested. Smaller businesses were dramatically more likely to run into loan roadblocks than larger ones. Still, it only makes sense that banks would become more conservative after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And unproven businesses have been able to turn to alternative sources of capital like venture capital and peer-to-peer lending. None of this is to say that Dodd-Frank is perfect. Even Frank admits that community and midsize banks have been hurt by increased legal and compliance costs. It's just tough to argue that Dodd-Frank has made it impossible to get a loan. "I understand that may be a popular thing to say, but I don't think there's any evidence," James Pethokoukis, a columnist at the American Enterprise Institute, told CNBC.

That's up an impressive 14% from the end of 201 Wells Fargo, which has been grappling with a scandal that's hurt its reputation, is lending more. Wells Fargo's commercial loan book increased by 11% in the fourth quarter to nearly $507 billion. By Matt Egan NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- President Trump has bashed Dodd-Frank as a loan-killing "disaster" that's crushing the economy. Trump recently complained that "many friends of mine who have nice businesses" can't get loans because of the regulations in Dodd-Frank. "The banks just won't let them borrow," the president said. The White House argues this lack of business lending is precisely why the 2010 Wall Street reform law needs to be rolled back. But a closer look at lending statistics suggests that this dramatic rhetoric about banks not lending doesn't match up with reality. In fact, banks are lending a ton to businesses these days. Commercial and industrial loans from commercial banks are an all-time high of $2.1 trillion last November, according to the Federal Reserve. Business lending did take a hit during the 2008 Wall Street meltdown. However, lending bottomed out after the Great Recession ended and bank loans to businesses have nearly doubled from the low. That means banks ramped up lending even after former President Obama signed Dodd-Frank into law in July 2010 in hopes of staving off another financial crash. For instance, in 2012 just as key elements of Dodd-Frank were being phased, commercial and industrial loans jumped by 12%, according to the Fed. Lending was up another 7% in 2013 and 12% in 2014. Darrell Duffie, a finance professor at Stanford University, said Trump's lending claim "is too broad." "U.S. banks have been providing large amounts of credit to businesses, much more than their European counterparts," he said. Overall, 79% of small businesses that applied for a bank loan were approved for at least some financing, according to a 2015 Fed survey of small businesses. Big banks would love regulatory relief. But that's not necessarily because they find it difficult to lend. "Loan growth remains robust," Marianne Lake, JPMorgan Chase's chief financial officer, said during the bank's conference call last month. JPMorgan bragged about how it ended 2016 with record loan balances of $189 billion in its commercial bank. That's up an impressive 14% from the end of 2015. One analyst, Kenneth Usdin from Jefferies, even complimented JPMorgan during the call on "another great year of double-digit loan growth." Bank of America also seems to be navigating the Dodd-Frank world pretty okay, when it comes to loans. BofA CEO Brian Moynihan said last month that commercial business loan growth "kicked up" during the fourth quarter as mid-size business borrowing was "strong." Even Wells Fargo, which has been grappling with a scandal that's hurt its reputation, is lending more. Wells Fargo's commercial loan book increased by 11% in the fourth quarter to nearly $507 billion. Barney Frank, one of Dodd-Frank's authors, recently told CNNMoney there's "no evidence" to support Trump's claim that the law is killing lending. "If we had inflicted a disaster on the American financial system, it would have shown up," Frank said. Still, critics argue that Dodd-Frank made banks too risk-averse, hurting less-proven young companies. "The only businesses that can obtain loans are those that can prove they don't actually need the loan," Harvey Pitt, who served as SEC commissioner under former President George W. Bush, told CNNMoney. These early-stage companies aren't able to reliably turn to banks for loans because regulations have raised lending standards, Pitt said. "Dodd-Frank has made it much harder for those businesses that are the true generators of economic growth to raise capital," he said. To Pitt's point, the Fed small business survey shows that 50% of bank loan applicants faced a financing shortfall, meaning they received a smaller loan than they requested. Smaller businesses were dramatically more likely to run into loan roadblocks than larger ones. Still, it only makes sense that banks would become more conservative after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

By: Reuters | New York | Published:February 13, 2017 5:14 pm JPMorgan & Co. (Source: Reuters) A Florida software engineer and a New Jersey pastor are expected on Monday to face trial in a case stemming from an investigation into a bitcoin exchange and a data breach at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Jury selection is set to begin in Manhattan federal court in the case of Yuri Lebedev, who authorities call the architect of bitcoin exchange Coin.mx’s electronic platform, and Trevon Gross, a pastor and ex-chairman of a now-defunct credit union. Watch what else is in the news Prosecutors contend Lebedev schemed to deceive financial institutions into processing transactions for the unlicensed Coin.mx. They say he also participated in bribing Gross to gain control over the credit union to facilitate the virtual currency business. Both men have pleaded not guilty. Eric Creizman, Lebedev’s lawyer, said he was “looking forward to his day in court.” Gross’ attorneys did not respond to requests for comment. They are among nine people who have faced charges following an investigation connected to a breach JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 that exposed more than 83 million accounts. Gross, 52, and Lebedev, 39, were not accused of hacking. But they came under scrutiny in connection with Coin.mx, which authorities said was operated by Anthony Murgio, who attended Florida State University with Lebedev, and was owned by an Israeli behind the JPMorgan breach, Gery Shalon. Prosecutors say Shalon, together with Maryland-born Joshua Samuel Aaron, orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million peoples’ information. Prosecutors said they carried out the cyber crimes to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with promotional emails. Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein have pleaded not guilty.

Jury selection is set to begin in Manhattan federal court in the case of Yuri Lebedev, who authorities call the architect of bitcoin exchange Coin.mx's electronic platform, and Trevon Gross, a pastor and ex-chairman of a now-defunct credit union. Prosecutors contend Lebedev schemed to deceive financial institutions into processing transactions for the unlicensed Coin.mx. They say he also participated in bribing Gross to gain control over the credit union to facilitate the virtual currency business. Both men have pleaded not guilty. Eric Creizman, Lebedev's lawyer, said he was "looking forward to his day in court." Gross' attorneys did not respond to requests for comment. They are among nine people who have faced charges following an investigation connected to a breach JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 that exposed more than 83 million accounts. Gross, 52, and Lebedev, 39, were not accused of hacking. But they came under scrutiny in connection with Coin.mx, which authorities said was operated by Anthony Murgio, who attended Florida State University with Lebedev, and was owned by an Israeli behind the JPMorgan breach, Gery Shalon. Prosecutors say Shalon, together with Maryland-born Joshua Samuel Aaron, orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million peoples' information. Prosecutors said they carried out the cyber crimes to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with promotional emails. Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors said Coin.mx operated through a front called "Collectables Club" to trick financial institutions into believing it was a memorabilia club while it converted, with no license, millions of dollars into bitcoin. To further evade scrutiny, in 2014, Murgio, with Lebedev's help, tried to take over Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, which was linked to HOPE Cathedral. To do so, they and others paid $150,000 in bribes via the church to Gross, its pastor, in exchange for facilitating Murgio's takeover and arranging for Lebedev and others to be put on the credit union's board, prosecutors said. Gross' lawyers deny he was lining his pockets with what they call a church donation and say Collectables Club victimized the board. Federal regulators took the credit union into conservatorship in 2015. Murgio pleaded guilty in January.

Banks understand, and are grabbing on to that trend. Customers who do not want to fumble around in their wallet for their ATM card — or who have misplaced it for the umpteenth time — will soon be able to unlock cash dispensers’ coffers by using their phone. JPMorgan Chase, which has more ATMs in the United States — 18,000 — than any other bank, has activated this technology on a few hundred machines in four test cities, including Miami and San Francisco. Six thousand more are upgraded and ready to go. Bank of America and Wells Fargo plan to introduce cardless options to all their machines by the end of the year. And while swiping an ATM card may not exactly seem onerous, bankers think going card-free will be a hit with consumers. “It’s about having the choice,” said Jonathan Velline, Wells Fargo’s head of ATM and branch banking. “If you’ve lost your card or left home without your wallet, chances are you still have your smartphone in your hand.” But of course, any new financial technology brings with it new security holes. For decades banks have battled “skimming,” in which criminals sabotage ATMs to steal the information off a card and use it to clear out people’s accounts. The replacement of magnetic stripe cards with chip cards significantly reduced that problem, but mobile access brings in new worries. One Chase customer recently had $2,900 stolen from her account through the bank’s new cardless system — which she had never used. A thief got her online banking user name and password, installed Chase’s mobile app on his or her phone, and used it to withdraw cash. Unlike most cardless systems, Chase’s does not require customers to enter their four-digit PIN at the cash machine. Chase refunded the customer’s lost money and immediately made security changes. “We’ve put safeguards in place to protect our customers,” said Michael Fusco, a Chase spokesman. The bank’s system still does not require PINs, but Chase is confident it can detect and prevent similar attacks, he said. Other banks have fared better, and say their fraud rates on mobile ATM transactions are significantly lower than those for traditional card-swipe withdrawals. Wintrust Financial, which operates community banks in Illinois and Wisconsin, added cardless access to all its 250 cash machines nearly three years ago. Thanks to multiple layers of security, there has been no fraud so far, said Thomas P Ormseth, a senior vice president at the bank. (“Knock on wood,” he added.) How the mobile systems work varies from bank to bank — and sometimes, even within one bank. Most of the major banks are using a technology called near-field communications (known as NFC), which enables devices to exchange information wirelessly over short distances. Modern smartphones usually contain an NFC chip, which is used for many mobile payment systems, including Apple Pay and Android Pay. At Bank of America, customers with compatible phones and a digital wallet app can tap their phone on the cash machine’s wireless pad to authenticate their identity. From there, customers enter their personal identification numbers and carry out transactions in the usual way. Wells Fargo is also testing NFC and adding the hardware it requires to all of its cash machines. But in the meantime, it has a simpler approach: one-time access codes. Customers can log in to Wells Fargo’s mobile app and request one, which is good for 30 minutes. At the 900 Wells Fargo ATMs that are set up to accept the codes so far, the customer types in the code and then their PIN to withdraw cash. Mobile ATM transactions are usually at least a little bit faster than traditional ones, banks say — sometimes significantly so. Wintrust’s system, which lets customers set up their withdrawal in advance on their phone and simply scan a QR (quick response) code when they get to the machine to get their cash, cut its average transaction time to about 10 seconds from 45, Ormseth said. Around 17% of the bank’s customers have used the technology at least once. Some banks have gone further and let custo­mers ditch even their phones. With biometrics, a unique body part is enough to unlock cash. At Banco Bradesco, one of Brazil’s largest banks, customers can gain access to an ATM by tapping their palm on a scanner, which reads the pattern of their veins. (The system handled more than 700 million transactions without any reported fraud, according to Fujitsu, which built the technology.) Banks in Japan, India and elsewhere have used fingerprints for authentication. Problematic innovation Citibank experimented two years ago with an iris-scanning ATM, showing off a prototype at a trade show. The reaction was everything the bank had hoped for: “People’s jaws dropped,” said Mark Gilder, Citibank’s director of ATM distribution in the US. “They thought it was magical. You just had to look at the machine, and money would come out.” Then reality set in. A compromised bank card can be reissued. If a hacker figures out how to imitate someone’s eyeball — which has been done in laboratory settings — it cannot be replaced. For that and other reasons, Citibank shelved its iris scanner, for now. It is also taking a wait-and-see approach to cardless ATMs. “We want to be ready when people no longer carry cards and leave their wallets at home, but that timeline is developing more slowly than perhaps we thought it would a few years ago,” Gilder said. This year, though, could be a tipping point. About 2.5% of the 425,000 ATMs in the country are set up for cardless access, according to an estimate from Crone Consulting, which researches the payments industry. By the fall, it expects that number to rise to 25%. As with mobile wallets, technical hurdles may hamper customer enthusiasm. People will generally need to install their bank’s mobile app on their phone, and each major bank is setting up access for only its own customers. So, for example, a Chase customer will not be able to pop into a Bank of America branch and withdraw money using a mobile phone. That is likely to change eventually. In the early days of ATMs, networks were independent and isolated; now customers take it for granted that their cards will work at nearly any machine. The biggest opportunity in cardless access will come as it expands to financial services beyond traditional bank accounts, said Richard Crone of Crone Consulting. Even if mobile wallets finally take off and phones replace debit and credit cards, there are still times — even for millennials — when only old-fashioned cash will do.   Tweet Go to Top Videos Beauty in the Sky: Aero India begins...

The bank behemoth may have finally broken out of its long consolidation phase. Following its post-election rally from the $17.00 area, the rally stalled at the $23.50 area. In fact, until today the issue had been in a trading range from $21.95 to $23.55 since December 7. During that time period, the issue made multiple highs in the $23.50 area. After ending Monday's session at $23.40, the issue didn't have far to travel to clear the former high for the move at $23.55 and embark on its ascent to $24.00. At this time, the current high stands at $23.97. Bank of American hasn't traded in the $24.00 handle since November 2008, when it peaked at $24.62 that month and would bottom out three months later at $2.52 during the financial crisis.

Industry Voice Industry Voice: Sentiment does not reflect strong healthcare sector fundamentals Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   0 Comments New products, strong finances and robust growth were the main talking points at JP Morgan's recent healthcare conference in San Francisco. There were positive signals regarding the fundraising climate, as well as the strength of innovation within the sector. Reporting season for 2016 is now getting under way and most companies should meet expectations. Good funding levels in the biotech sector, combined with low va­luations and potentially favourable tax changes in the US, are expected to give takeover activity a big boost. The recently announced acquisition of Ariad Pharma by Takeda and the Actelion takeover by Johnson & Johnson mark the beginning of this trend. Actelion has long been one of BB Biotech's core investments.

Oncology remains the largest therapeutic area covered by BB Biotech's portfolio.

Goshen College campus newspaper Home News Features Arts Perspectives Sports Funnies Contact Students urge GC divestment from Chase By Record February 10, 2017 0 Comment News Naomi Gross and Hannah Yoder, both seniors, wrote* a petition on Jan. 31 to the Goshen College community which stated their demand for the institution to divest its accounts in J.P. Morgan Chase, the banking company which has given its support to the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. That day was also the day in which North Dakota senators recommended an easement passed on to them by the Army Corps of Engineers suggesting they allow the drilling under Lake Oahe and the Missouri River, both on top of lands held by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s land. The petition reminded students of President Brenneman’s recent message to students, ensuring them of Goshen College’s commitment to social justice in these times of political upheaval. “This easement would finish the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, and have disastrous implications for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and everyone in the country due to the large potential environmental destruction that will occur,” said Gross. “The fight at Standing Rock is twofold: a fight for indigenous self-determination and a fight for the water and the environment.” In accordance with that call to social justice, students, professors and alumni alike have signed the petition supporting the seniors’ demands for divestment. Nearly 200 signatures have been acquired, attracting the attention of the administration. Since then, the easement has been passed, allowing the continued drilling without proper environmental impacts studies. Gross, Yoder, Laura Miller, Sarah Hofkamp, Chelsea Risser and Naomi Salvador, all seniors, met with several members of the administration on Feb. 2,* to discuss possible plans for Goshen’s divestment. Glenn Gilbert, sustainability coordinator, Deanna Risser, interim vice president for finance and Ken Newbold, provost and executive vice president were the administrators present in that meeting. Miller, Gross, and Hofkamp have drafted a  tentative statement of intent for the college, which reads:* “Open Letter: Divest Goshen College from Chase Bank Recently President Brenneman issued a campus-wide email declaring his and the institution’s commitment to social justice. On January 31, ND Senators Hoeven and Cramer issued statements suggesting that the Department of Army has recommended that the Army Corps of Engineers grant Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) the necessary easement to drill under Lake Oahe and the Missouri River on Standing Rock Sioux Tribe land. The granting of this easement would be a clear violation under federal law, which declares that no easements can be granted before existing Environmental Impact Statements are complete. The granting of the easement could come at any moment. Therefore, we, as Goshen College students, demand that Goshen College divest all institutional funds from Chase Bank, a financial sponsor of DAPL, and make a corresponding public statement explaining their withdrawal from Chase and declaring their opposition to construction of DAPL. We demand that this statement be directly released to Goshen College, the City, State Senators, Chase Bank, and the Army Corps of Engineers.” “It’s not just about the Pipeline,” said Gross. “It’s worth noting that Chase is invested in many other unethical corporations and industries, including private prisons (GEO Group and CoreCivic, the two largest private corrections companies in the US) and the military industrial complex.” Through Chase, which is the college’s primary bank, Goshen conducts day-to-day operations and holds $24 million in debt through the bank. Because the college has many small accounts, the process is timely and costly, ultimately preventing the divestment in one swift action.* “Because most of us involved are seniors, we need to recruit people who will be invested in this process for years to come,” said Miller. “We need students who care about the issue, as well as students with some business knowledge.” In this sense, the college would work through the divestment alongside the students. Many of the students involved in this process have already left campus, a decision made after the easement was passed, to travel to Standing Rock in solidarity with those who continue to protest at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. Gross, Yoder, Risser, Salvador and Deeksha Pagar, a junior, all left by car on the night of Feb. 7 to protest for the foreseeable future. “We encourage other people to come as well,” said Gross. “Just make sure you are organized and ready when you come.” For those who are interested in becoming a part of this process and conversation, email Laura Miller at lemiller@goshen.edu. *A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the two students released the statement. It also incorrectly stated that the meeting was held on Feb. 6. It also incorrectly implied that tentative plans were laid out for the coming years. Tagged News Written by Record No comments yet.

JP Morgan Asset Management has acquired Infinis' 19 operating wind projects and one site still under construction The portfolio comprises 19 projects totalling 343MW of generating capacity, with a further 66MW project under construction and due online by the end of February.  The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017. The sell-off will remove all of Infinis's generating portfolio, said Terra Firma, which owns the developer.  It continues to own a portfolio of 14 onshore wind projects currently in the development stage, which Terra Firma said it would "look to sell in due course". "We are delighted to acquire the onshore operational wind interests of Infinis's UK wind portfolio from Terra Firma. The acquisition continues our investment momentum in renewables, complementing the existing investment base, and increases our renewables energy production capacity to over 3.2GW," said JP Morgan Asset Management chief investment officer of the infrastructure investments group, Matthew LeBlanc.  The deal follows the sale of Infinis's landfill gas assets in December 2016 to 3i Infrastructure. Terra Firma acquired Infinis in 2003 as part of a larger takeover. Shares in the developer were floated in 2014, but it was taken private by Terra Firma again in 2015 following the UK government's decision to end the exemption of renewable energy sources from the climate change levy (CCL).  Infinis called for a judicial review in to the change in tax exemption, claiming it gave operators far too little warning, but lost the case in the High Court in February 2016 and was dismissed in a Court of Appeal hearing in November 2016.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 14 February 2017 | MYT 5:45 PM New witness delays trial over bitcoin exchange tied to JPMorgan hack Delayed trial: A US District Judge delayed jury selection until Feb 14 after prosecutors said they had secured a new witness. — Reuters NEW YORK: The trial of two men was delayed on Feb 13 in a case stemming from a probe into a Bitcoin exchange and a data breach at JPMorgan Chase & Co after prosecutors revealed a new witness. Jury selection was set to begin in Manhattan federal court in the case of Yuri Lebedev, whom authorities call the architect of Bitcoin exchange Coin.mx's platform, and Trevon Gross, a pastor and ex-chairman of a now-defunct credit union. But US District Judge Alison Nathan delayed jury selection until Feb 14 after prosecutors said they had secured a new witness. The witness, Philip Burgess, was represented by the law firm of one of Gross' lawyers in an unrelated tax case in which he was sentenced in 2010 to eight months in prison. Assistant US Attorney Daniel Noble said Burgess, while "reporting another potential fraud" to prosecutors on Feb 8, revealed he had incriminating information stemming from his time as a potential investor in the credit union Gross headed. But after spending the day discussing how to resolve the conflict of Gross and Burgess sharing the same law firm, Nathan ruled prosecutors could not call their eve-of-trial new witness. "It is my conclusion that we will proceed tomorrow and the government may not call Mr. Burgess," she said. Gross, 52, and Lebedev, 39, are among nine people who have been charged following an investigation connected to a breach JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 that exposed over 83 million accounts. While Gross and Lebedev were not accused of hacking, they came under scrutiny in connection with Coin.mx, which authorities said was operated by Florida resident Anthony Murgio and owned by an Israeli behind the JPMorgan breach, Gery Shalon.Shalon has pleaded not guilty to charges that he orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million people's information. Prosecutors said Coin.mx operated through a front called "Collectables Club" to trick financial institutions into believing it was a memorabilia club while it converted, with no license, millions of dollars into bitcoin. To further evade scrutiny, in 2014, Murgio, with Lebedev's help, tried to take over Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, which was linked to HOPE Cathedral. To do so, they and others paid US$150,000 (RM666,225) in bribes via the church to Gross, its pastor, in exchange for facilitating Murgio's takeover and arranging for Lebedev and others to be put on the credit union's board, prosecutors said.

The state-owned company, also known as Nama Holding, will raise the funds through a combination of loans and bond sales, said the people, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. Nama will use the funds to finance its projects, they said. Oman, the biggest Middle East oil producer that’s not a member of Opec, is increasing borrowing as the government seeks to finance a budget deficit caused by low oil prices. The country plans to raise as much as $2 billion through bond sales this year and OMR600 million from local debt, an official at Oman’s central bank said in December. JPMorgan declined to comment, while Bank Muscat didn’t respond to requests for comment. The government appointed banks including JPMorgan, HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered Plc to help manage the sale of international bonds and a local currency sukuk, people with knowledge of the offering said in January. Nama holds the government’s stake in nine local electricity companies, according to its website. One of its units Oman Electricity Transmission Co. raised $1 billion in 2015 in a bond sale that was also managed by JPMorgan and Bank Muscat. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Cards The New York Times By STACY COWLEY 2 days ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL 27 things you probably didn't know about Netflix The most expensive trailer parks in the US © Minh Uong/The New York Times Wallets can be lost, stolen or forgotten, but most people today wouldn’t be caught dead without their phones. Quotes in the article Wintrust Financial Corp WTFC ▲ 75.46 +0.43 +0.57% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 135.51 +0.49 +0.36% Fujitsu Ltd FJTSY ▲ 28.66 +0.14 +0.49% Wells Fargo & Co WFC ▲ 58.55 +0.57 +0.98% Banks understand, and are grabbing on to that trend. Customers who don’t want to fumble around in their wallet for their A.T.M. card — or who have misplaced it for the umpteenth time — will soon be able to unlock cash dispensers’ coffers by using their phone. JPMorgan Chase, which has more A.T.M.s in the United States — 18,000 — than any other bank, has activated this technology on a few hundred machines in four test cities, including Miami and San Francisco. Six thousand more are already upgraded and ready to go. Bank of America and Wells Fargo plan to introduce cardless options to all their machines by the end of the year. And while swiping an A.T.M. card may not exactly seem onerous, bankers think going card-free will be a hit with consumers. “It’s about having the choice,” said Jonathan Velline, Wells Fargo’s head of A.T.M. and branch banking. “If you’ve lost your card or left home without your wallet, chances are you still have your smartphone in your hand.” But of course, any new financial technology brings with it new security holes. For decades banks have battled “skimming,” in which criminals sabotage A.T.M.s to steal the information off a card and use it to clear out people’s accounts. The replacement of magnetic stripe cards with chip cards significantly reduced that problem, but mobile access brings in new worries. One Chase customer recently had $2,900 stolen from her account through the bank’s new cardless system — which she had never used. A thief got her online banking user name and password, installed Chase’s mobile app on his or her phone, and used it to withdraw cash. Unlike most cardless systems, Chase’s does not require customers to enter their four-digit PIN at the cash machine. Chase refunded the customer’s lost money and immediately made security changes. “We’ve put safeguards in place to protect our customers,” said Michael Fusco, a Chase spokesman. The bank’s system still does not require PINs, but Chase is confident it can now detect and prevent similar attacks, he said. Other banks have fared better, and say their fraud rates on mobile A.T.M. transactions are significantly lower than those for traditional card-swipe withdrawals. Wintrust Financial, which operates community banks in Illinois and Wisconsin, added cardless access to all its 250 cash machines nearly three years ago. Thanks to multiple layers of security, there has been no fraud so far, said Thomas P. Ormseth, a senior vice president at the bank. (“Knock on wood,” he added.) How the mobile systems work varies from bank to bank — and sometimes, even within one bank. © James Estrin/The New York Times Banks are introducing cardless options to their A.T.M.s. Customers may enjoy the convenience, but the technology also opens some security holes. Most of the major banks are using a technology called near-field communications (known as “N.F.C.”), which enables devices to exchange information wirelessly over short distances. Modern smartphones usually contain an N.F.C. chip, which is used for many mobile payment systems, including Apple Pay and Android Pay. At Bank of America, customers with compatible phones and a digital wallet app can tap their phone on the cash machine’s wireless pad to authenticate their identity. From there, customers enter their personal identification numbers and carry out transactions in the usual way. Wells Fargo is also testing N.F.C. and adding the hardware it requires to all of its cash machines. But in the meantime, it has a simpler approach: one-time access codes. Customers can log in to Wells Fargo’s mobile app and request one, which is good for 30 minutes. At the 900 Wells Fargo A.T.M.s that are set up to accept the codes so far, the customer types in the code and then their P.I.N. to withdraw cash. Mobile A.T.M. transactions are usually at least a little bit faster than traditional ones, banks say — sometimes significantly so. Wintrust’s system, which lets customers set up their withdrawal in advance on their phone and simply scan a QR (Quick Response) code when they get to the machine to get their cash, cut its average transaction time from about 45 seconds to 10, Mr. Ormseth said. Around 17 percent of the bank’s customers have used the technology at least once. Some banks have gone further and let customers ditch even their phones. With biometrics, a unique body part is enough to unlock cash. At Banco Bradesco, one of Brazil’s largest banks, customers can access an A.T.M. by tapping their palm on a scanner, which reads the pattern of their veins. (The system handled more than 700 million transactions without any reported fraud, according to Fujitsu, which built the technology.) Banks in Japan, India and elsewhere have used fingerprints for authentication. Citibank experimented two years ago with an iris-scanning A.T.M., showing off a prototype at a trade show. The reaction was everything the bank had hoped for: “People’s jaws dropped,” said Mark Gilder, Citibank’s director of A.T.M. distribution in the United States. “They thought it was magical. You just had to look at the machine, and money would come out.” Then reality set in. A compromised bank card can be reissued. If a hacker figures out how to imitate someone’s eyeball — which has been done in laboratory settings — it can’t be replaced. For that and other reasons, Citibank shelved its iris scanner, for now. It is also taking a wait-and-see approach to cardless A.T.M.s. “We want to be ready when people no longer carry cards and leave their wallets at home, but that timeline is developing more slowly than perhaps we thought it would a few years ago,” Mr. Gilder said. This year, though, could be a tipping point. About 2.5 percent of the 425,000 A.T.M.s in the country are currently set up for cardless access, according to an estimate from Crone Consulting, which researches the payments industry. By the fall, it expects that number to rise to 25 percent. As with mobile wallets, technical hurdles may hamper customer enthusiasm. People will generally need to install their bank’s mobile app on their phone, and each major bank is setting up access for only its own customers. So, for example, a Chase customer will not be able to pop into a Bank of America branch and withdraw money using a mobile phone. That is likely to change eventually. In the early days of A.T.M.s, networks were independent and isolated; now, customers take it for granted that their cards will work at nearly any machine. The biggest opportunity in cardless access will come as it expands to financial services beyond traditional bank accounts, said Richard Crone of Crone Consulting. “Think of things that don’t have cards issued against them, like money market accounts or Venmo,” he said. “Unlocking cash access to those accounts would be a really big deal.” Venmo, the digital payment system of choice for many millennials, is owned by PayPal. Giving PayPal and Venmo customers direct access to their money through A.T.M.s is not currently in the works, but it “isn’t something I would rule out,” said Chris Gardner, the product head for PayPal’s mobile wallet software. Even if mobile wallets finally take off and phones replace debit and credit cards, there are still times — even for millennials — when only old-fashioned cash will do.

So, for example, a Chase customer will not be able to pop into a Bank of America branch and withdraw money using a mobile phone. That is likely to change eventually. In the early days of ATMs, networks were independent and isolated; now customers take it for granted that their cards will work at nearly any machine. The biggest opportunity in cardless access will come as it expands to financial services beyond traditional bank accounts, said Richard Crone of Crone Consulting. “Think of things that don’t have cards issued against them, like money market accounts or Venmo,” he said. “Unlocking cash access to those accounts would be a really big deal.” Venmo, the digital payment system of choice for many millennials, is owned by PayPal. Giving PayPal and Venmo customers direct access to their money through ATMs is not in the works, but it “isn’t something I would rule out,” said Chris Gardner, product head for PayPal’s mobile wallet software. Even if mobile wallets finally take off and phones replace debit and credit cards, there are still times — even for millennials — when only old-fashioned cash will do.

The two men were arrested in Florida on August 4, 2015. REUTERS/File Photos By Nate Raymond NEW YORK (Reuters) - The trial of two men was delayed on Monday in a case stemming from a probe into a bitcoin exchange and a data breach at JPMorgan Chase & Co after prosecutors revealed a new witness. Jury selection was set to begin in Manhattan federal court in the case of Yuri Lebedev, whom authorities call the architect of bitcoin exchange Coin.mx's platform, and Trevon Gross, a pastor and ex-chairman of a now-defunct credit union. But U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan delayed jury selection until Tuesday after prosecutors said they had secured a new witness. The witness, Philip Burgess, was represented by the law firm of one of Gross' lawyers in an unrelated tax case in which he was sentenced in 2010 to eight months in prison. Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Noble said Burgess, while "reporting another potential fraud" to prosecutors on Wednesday, revealed he had incriminating information stemming from his time as a potential investor in the credit union Gross headed. But after spending the day discussing how to resolve the conflict of Gross and Burgess sharing the same law firm, Nathan ruled prosecutors could not call their eve-of-trial new witness. "It is my conclusion that we will proceed tomorrow and the government may not call Mr. Burgess," she said. Gross, 52, and Lebedev, 39, are among nine people who have been charged following an investigation connected to a breach JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 that exposed over 83 million accounts. While Gross and Lebedev were not accused of hacking, they came under scrutiny in connection with Coin.mx, which authorities said was operated by Florida resident Anthony Murgio and owned by an Israeli behind the JPMorgan breach, Gery Shalon.Shalon has pleaded not guilty to charges that he orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million people's information. Prosecutors said Coin.mx operated through a front called "Collectables Club" to trick financial institutions into believing it was a memorabilia club while it converted, with no license, millions of dollars into bitcoin. To further evade scrutiny, in 2014, Murgio, with Lebedev's help, tried to take over Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, which was linked to HOPE Cathedral. To do so, they and others paid $150,000 in bribes via the church to Gross, its pastor, in exchange for facilitating Murgio's takeover and arranging for Lebedev and others to be put on the credit union's board, prosecutors said. Federal regulators took the credit union into conservatorship in 2015. Murgio pleaded guilty in January.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 February 2017 by Military News MedEquities Realty Trust Amends Credit Facility With Lower Borrowing Costs, Extended Maturity And $125 Million Term Loan NASHVILLE, Tenn., Feb. 13, 2017 — MedEquities Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: MRT) announced it has closed on a new $425 million secured credit facility.  The amended and restated credit agreement provides for a $300 million secured revolving credit facility and a $125 million secured term loan. The amended credit facility replaced a $300 million secured revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in November 2017. Amounts outstanding under the amended credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin between 1.75% and 3.00%, depending on the Company’s leverage, for both the revolving credit facility and the term loan. The revolving credit facility matures in February 2021, with one 12-month extension option, and has an accordion feature that allows the total borrowing capacity under the credit facility to be increased to up to $700 million, including the ability to add and fund a second term loan. Both the accordion and the extension options are subject to certain conditions.  The term loan matures in February 2022. The Company has also entered into interest rate swap agreements on the full notional amount of the term loan.  The Company’s forecasted all-in interest rate under the term loan is currently 3.59% and is comprised of the fixed 1.84% swap rate plus the margin under the credit facility. The new facility includes the ability to convert to an unsecured basis once minimum asset and borrowing base targets are achieved as well as certain other conditions. Jeff Walraven, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of MedEquities, noted, “The new revolving credit facility and term loan provide substantial flexibility to our capital structure with significantly longer maturities, lower revolver borrowing costs, reduced exposure to fluctuations in short term interest rates and additional capacity to execute our acquisition plans.” At closing of the amended and restated credit agreement, the Company borrowed $31.5 million under the secured revolving credit facility and $125 million under the secured term loan to repay, in full, all outstanding amounts due under the prior facility. Based on the current borrowing base assets, the Company had approximately $101 million of available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility. KeyBanc Capital Markets, JPMorgan Chase Bank and CitiGroup Global Markets served as co-lead arrangers and co-bookrunners. JPMorgan Chase Bank and CitiBank served as co-syndication agents. Capital One served as documentation agent. KeyBank National Association served as administrative agent. Other banks in the syndicate included Fifth Third Bank, Citizens Bank, Raymond James Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Cadence Bank, Hancock Whitney Bank, Pinnacle Bank, CapStar Bank and Renasant Bank.

 What you need to know on Wall Street right now Business Insider Feb. 13, 2017, 1:19 PM 1,731 facebook linkedin twitter email print Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Welcome to Finance Insider, Business Insider's summary of the top stories of the past 24 hours. It seems that markets are starting to get nervous about the policies of Donald Trump. Here are the headlines:  Trump's trade-war mongering is starting to rattle Wall Street Some of the biggest US companies have their eyes on one of Trump's policy promises Trump can't take all the credit for the Trump rally IMF head: Trump is good for US economy for now, but trouble looms Trump's 1990 Playboy interview perfectly lays out his view of the world A paying Mar-A-Lago member took photos of Trump being briefed on North Korea — and posted them to Facebook In Wall Street news, JPMorgan's head of global equity capital markets, Liz Myers, can name a bunch of reasons 2017 could see a strong rebound in initial-public-offering activity around the world. Here is what's on Myers' mind. The hyper-acquisitive multinational pharmaceutical company Allergan is buying the fat-reduction biopharmaceutical company Zeltiq Aesthetics for $2.5 billion. The deal makes for a $45 million payday for two Wall Street boutiques. Business Insider published an op-ed from Tom Naratil, president for the Americas at UBS, on the importance of investing in America. A director at the world's biggest investor spelled out why investors are pouring into one of the riskiest markets And there are two questions Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen won't be able to dodge on Capitol Hill this week, according to Business Insider's Pedro da Costa.  There's a bunch of corporate news today. Here are the highlights: Ford CEO reveals a major fear about self-driving cars How Amazon’s payments service could solve its biggest weakness against PayPal Sears' explosive rally is confounding Wall Street Apple tops all-time closing high after UBS says it's undervalued There's no question that the Tesla Model 3 will launch on schedule in 2017 The owner of Burger King and Tim Hortons beats as costs fall In tech news, this is what secretive billion-dollar startup Magic Leap has been working on. Lastly, staying close to home could be the smartest financial decision millennials make. Here are the top Wall Street headlines from the past 24 hour Dan Loeb made a nearly $1 billion bet on Wall Street - Dan Loeb went big on Wall Street. A February 10 regulatory filing shows that Loeb's Third Point took large positions in JPMorgan and Bank of America and, to a lesser extent, Goldman Sachs — investing nearly $1 billion in total in the banks' shares during the fourth quarter of 2016. Top exec at the world's largest hedge fund says to understand its unique culture, look to a basketball game - With $150 billion in assets under management, Bridgewater Associates isn't just the world's largest hedge fund. It's also a company with a quirky and intense culture unique to any industry. The future of the Hamptons is uncertain as prices plummet and luxury buyers head north - The Hamptons have long been a weekend playground for New York City's wealthiest and most fashionable. But thanks to a softening real-estate market and the growing appeal of more affordable destinations, that could be about to change. Luxury shoppers have a completely new attitude, and it's killing traditional retail - As evidence that high-end retail has lost its footing continues to mount — from companies pivoting out of luxury to a crisis in the Swiss watch market — there is at least one bright spot to be found: pre-owned. Doomsday prepper supply companies saw a huge sales surge after Trump's election - If a natural disaster, terrorist attack, or other unforeseen apocalypse hits the US, doomsday preppers will be ready. They've already been stockpiling food, buying water filters, and hatching escape plans — in some cases for years. BLACKROCK: China is the key to global reflation - We believe that China is key to the global reflation story playing out for longer. Our new China GPS economic indicator helps explain why. PRESENTING: Where the two leading French presidential candidates stand on the major issues - As we edge closer to the unpredictable French presidential election, it's worth taking a look at what the current favorites stand for — and how the markets are feeling about it.

 JPMorgan's head IPO banker on what to expect in 2017 Portia Crowe Feb. 13, 2017, 9:11 AM 5,539 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan JPMorgan's head of global equity capital markets, Liz Myers, can name a bunch of reasons 2017 could see a strong rebound in initial-public-offering activity around the world. Myers, whose team topped league tables for equity capital markets revenue in 2016 as well as IPO volume share in 2016 and year-to-date, did just that in an interview with Business Insider earlier this month. "We're seeing quite a sentiment reversal in the IPO market this year, particularly in the US, where January marked the best start to the year since 2014," Myers said. While 2016 saw fewer than 100 IPOs in the US, she said a typical year would see as many as twice that number. She expects to see a more active market in 2017. "Both issuers and investors are approaching the market more constructively this year," she said. "Combined with a pro-growth backdrop, we expect to see a notable increase in IPO volumes this year." Twelve deals have priced in the US in 2017. Myers walked through numerous sectors, from industrials to financials to tech, and laid out her expectations. She also said we could expect to see more cross-border activity this year, with foreign companies choosing to list in the US. Here is what's on Myers' mind. A strong start Of the companies that did go public in 2016, more than 70% are trading up right now, Myers said. That's up from 52% around this time last year. "This aftermarket momentum reinforces positive investor sentiment toward the 2017 IPO class," she said. "Follow-on offerings also tend to increase in number and size when valuations trend positively post-IPO." For private-equity or venture-capitalist backers, that offers the chance to sell down their stakes. Also, of the nine deals that priced last month, two priced above their ranges and two priced at the top of their ranges. There were no IPOs in January of last year to compare with, but two of the six IPOs to price in the whole first quarter of 2016 were below range, Myers said. Healthcare, industrials, and tech Though only nine deals priced in January, the breadth of sectors they fell under was a positive sign, Myers said. Those include energy, industrials, healthcare, and special acquisition companies, or Spacs. Industrials are seeing a tailwind as markets anticipate accelerated growth and infrastructure stimulus spending, she said. Exploration-and-production companies in particular are seeing enthusiasm, especially oil-field services companies. That's because, as oil prices rise, exploration-and-production companies begin to drill again, which means revenues start to increase because they once again have customers. Andrew Burton/Getty Images (Several oil-field services companies are making the most of the rotation out of other industries and into energy by filing under a special Securities and Exchange Commission rule, 144A, which is an exemption from the typical SEC registration requirements that allows companies to sell shares more quickly.) In technology, Myers said she expected to see a continuation of activity in software and internet. She also expects to see healthcare deals as areas like cancer therapy continue to be well-received. While last year saw a broad mix across sectors as well, the biggest difference Myers expects to see this year is more activity in financials — in both banking and insurance. 'A more hospitable landscape' In terms of the broader economic backdrop, Myers laid out three reasons for the current bullishness in the markets: infrastructure spending, broader fiscal stimulus, and deregulation. One offset might be the impact of rising interest rates, which are generally viewed by the market as more of a headwind but which will at least benefit the financial sector. "Financial-sector issuers are seeing meaningful valuation uplifts from the expectation of better margins in a higher rate environment," Myers said. Brexit supporters. Thomson Reuters Another important factor: This year is unlikely to be punctuated by any significant political catalysts as last year was. "The uncertainties around Brexit and the US election slowed new issuance momentum in certain months in 2016," Myers said. While the markets rebounded quickly from the Brexit vote in the UK, and US President Donald Trump's election has been followed by a strong market run, it was the period leading up to those two events that saw IPOs getting put on hold, Myers said. Even rumors and poll numbers suggesting the possibility of a Brexit outcome in the weeks leading up to that June vote were enough for European issuers to sit on the sidelines. "This year we see a more hospitable landscape with the absence of such catalysts and a constructive, pro-growth economic backdrop," she said. Investor interest Investor sentiment has been strong this year, Myers said, from both mutual funds and hedge funds. They are not weighed down by concerns about performance at the beginning of the year the way they are near the end of the year. Most active managers did not meet their benchmark indexes in 2016 and so at the end of the year were hesitant to take any risk on a higher-volatility asset class like the IPO market. "Early in the year, investors tend to be more open-minded about new deals and can have more flexibility to take on risk," she said. Jose Cuervo priced its initial public offering in Mexico last week. A contestant on the Barrel Roll during the CuervoGames on June 18, 2011 in Tampa, FL. But she said a variety of factors, not just investor demand, would be driving the IPO market in 2017. In financials, for example, it's valuation. "It has become more logical to monetize holdings or raise primary capital in the sector when valuations are trending back to normalized or historical levels," she said. In industrials, she said, "Investors are looking for ways to increase exposure to companies that could benefit from an infrastructure spending lift." And in technology, she said, it's both supply and demand. Certainly, the continued demand for software and internet is helping encourage issuers to come forward. But issuers who have formerly raised capital in the private markets are now able to do so at attractive valuations in the public markets, too. One area to watch Myers covers IPOs around the world, and one market where her team has been active is Latin America. "We have seen six equity offerings price in Latin America this year raising just over $3 billion," she said. "To put the year in context — the last two years we saw $11 billion and $10 billion respectively raised — so this amounts to approximately one-third of the proceeds raised in each of the last two years." JPMorgan was on four of those deals. 4 of 5 LATAM IPOs in 2017 priced so far this week, including the largest debut $CUERVO, raising $786m pic.twitter.com/DeLfRFjAm5 — Dealogic (@Dealogic) February 10, 2017 Jose Cuervo and the cement company Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua priced their IPOs last week, listing on the Mexican stock exchange. JPMorgan was global coordinator for both companies. Jose Cuervo's $908 million deal is the largest in Mexico since October 2013, according to Ipreo Capital Markets. In Brazil, JPMorgan was a bookrunner for the healthcare company Instituto Hermes Pardini, which also priced in February. "There's heightened enthusiasm around emerging markets this year," Myers said.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 13 February 2017 Six things that may spoil global sugar surplus They include the return of El Nino and the policies of Trump LONDON: Counting on next season’s return to surplus to buy your sugar cheap? You may want to hedge your bets. While most analysts forecast supplies will exceed demand in the 2017-2018 season that starts in October for most countries, stockpiles will remain at historically low levels, “affording little latitude for under-performance in the major sugar producing countries,” according to Sean Diffley, head of sugar and ethanol at Tropical Research Services, which advises hedge funds. With more than eight months to go, a lot could still go wrong to wipe out the 1 million to 3 million tonne surplus range forecast by analysts including TRS, F.O. Licht GmbH and Kingsman SA, a unit of S&P Global Platts. From the return of El Nino to the continuation of Indian imports and even the policies of US President Donald Trump, here are six key concerns that participants at the Dubai Sugar Conference say could spoil the bearish party. El Nino Less than a year after the end of one of the strongest El Ninos on record, bringing dry weather and havoc to crops in Asia, meteorologists are already forecasting its return. Climate models suggest neutral conditions or El Nino are the most likely scenarios for the southern hemisphere winter-spring period, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said last month. The odds that the weather pattern would form by the end of the year are now 50%, up from a previous rating of 36%, the US Climate Prediction Centre said. “The models are suggesting that El Nino may resurface in the second half of 2017,” said Tracey Allen, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co in London. “There are wide expectations that Asian sugar production will normalise this year and that’s really very much dependent on the monsoon. That’s also a pivotal point for sugar production and potentially the transition to a more neutral to surplus balance going forward in the 2017-18 season.” Indian rebound Bears are counting on the rebound of production in Asia. But the scale of the recovery in India is still uncertain, said Gareth Forber, head of sugar research at LMC International. That’s because water scarcity last summer in the state of Maharashtra has limited plantings of cane that will be harvested 18 months later. “Secondly, water is still a problem in Karnataka so production may not rebound in this part of the country,” he said. Another factor that may trump the bears could be Indian imports. The South Asian nation may continue to bring in sugar in the 2017-2018 season to help replenish tight stockpiles, said Tom Secretan, an analyst at London-based commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd. Talking of Trump Traders attending the conference fear that Mexico may end up with a lot more sugar than expected. That’s because President Trump is seeking a review of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which allows Mexican sugar to flow into the US. Higher Mexican supply, a delay in Indian imports and a faster pace of harvesting in Central America already mean that trade flows will have been roughly in balance in the first three months of the year, according to TRS estimates. “Trade relations between Mexico and the US continue to deteriorate, raising the probability of a greater quantity of surplus Mexico sugar coming to the world market earlier,” Diffley said. Counting on EU Traders are counting on a rebound in European Union production as a system of quotas end on Sept 30. Kingsman sees output rising 14% to 19.3 million tonnes. Suedzucker AG, the bloc’s largest producer, said in an interview at the end of last year that production could reach as much as 20 million tonnes. While prices that rallied 28% in New York last year, the most since 2009, bring every incentive for growers to boost sowings, beets that will be planted for next season aren’t even on the ground yet. China imports Chinese imports could surprise to the upside, said Jonathan Drake, chief operating officer of RCMA Commodities Asia Pte Ltd and former head of sugar at Cargill Inc. The nation already surprised traders last year, bringing in 3.7 million tonne of white sugar, he said. “Everyone underestimated China last year,” Drake said. “It’s hugely profitableto import into China.” Brazilian real Lastly in Brazil, the currency in the world’s largest producer is getting stronger, potentially reducing the incentive for millers to sell, and raising the price level at which they favour ethanol over sugar production. The real gained 22% last year, the most since 2009, and has advanced another 4.4% this year. “My view is that we could very well see a similar sugar mix in 2017-2018 but that’s based on expected strength in crude oil prices, and the potential for domestic gasoline prices to continue to rise in line with world market prices,” JPMorgan’s Allen said. “The strength in the real more recently is also a very interesting factor going forward because most anticipated a slightly weaker foreign-exchange rate than where we are today.” — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Bearish , sugar , cheap , surplus Related Stories Related Stories Double whammy for F&B companies Tencent drags Hang Seng down Rabobank: Asian F&B margins at risk due to higher sugar prices Sugar producer MSM's net profit down on raw materials Sugar producer MSM’s profit hit by higher costs, weaker currency You May Be Interested Petronas stocks weigh on KLCI early Thursday Affin Hwang sees Heineken Malaysia maintaining dominant market position Bank of England testing palm and coconut oils to make new bank notes after protests for using animal-fat Malaysian palm oil price rebounds from near three-month low on positive export data Trading ideas: Heineken, Boustead, Gas Malaysia, RCE Capital, DNex, ECS ICT Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Others Also Read Najib: New KL ATCC will enable improved air traffic control facilities Genting Highlands to house country‘s second Premium Outlet Multiracial crowd embraces Lunar New Year spirit Property Related advertisement Latest News Bank Negara to work closely with Cabinet on forex losses DBS profit slumps to two-year low on oil and gas bad debts Maybank Indonesia posts record earnings in FY16 Food prices soaring in drought-hit East Africa Logistics expected to make up 8-10% of Vietnam's GDP by 2025 Most Viewed in Business Consortium appointed to oversee KL-Singapore High Speed Rail DRB-Hicom pulls out of large scale PV plant job in Tanjung Malim Property market to remain subdued up to 18 months Aeon Big embarks on new business strategy Malaysia's economy records 4.5% growth in Q4 of 2016 Food prices soaring in drought-hit East Africa Auto firms to submit final proposals to Proton I-Bhd records stronger FY16 earnings, unbilled sales of RM578m Sime IPOs this year?

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Levin Report The Chair of the Federal Reserve Just Fact-Shamed Donald Trump Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Levin Report The Chair of the Federal Reserve Just Fact-Shamed Donald Trump Janet Yellen reveals the president has no idea what he’s talking about when it comes to Dodd-Frank. by Bess LevinFebruary 14, 2017 4:53 pm Email Facebook Twitter Janet Yellen, who doesn’t have time for this amateur-hour presidency. By Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images. When it comes to the economy, it’s becoming uncomfortably apparent that in many cases, self-described “incredible” businessman Donald Trump either has no idea what he’s talking about or he’s lying. Last week, we learned that he called erstwhile national security adviser Mike Flynn at 3 A.M. with questions about how the dollar works. Over the weekend, it was National Economic Council director Gary Cohn who had to explain that the administration’s big infrastructure plan will actually cost money. Today’s revelation comes courtesy of Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, whose testimony before Congress might as well have simply been “Donald Trump is full of sh*t.” Per CNBC: During testimony before Congress, the central bank leader was asked if businesses have access to capital. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts asked Yellen specifically about remarks from Trump alleging that banks are not lending because of financial reforms adopted after the 2008 financial crisis. Yellen said commercial and industrial lending specifically surged after the crisis, rising 75 percent since 2010, the year Dodd-Frank was passed. “They’re lending,” Yellen said in response to an earlier question from Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat. “Their price-to-book ratios are substantially higher than the ratio of banks headquartered in other areas, and they're gaining market share, and they remain quite profitable.” Yellen also told Brown, “Lending has expanded overall by the banking system, and also to small businesses,“ and, in response to a question about how U.S. banks are doing relative to their competitors abroad, she said, “U.S. banks are generally considered quite strong relative to their counterparts. They've built up quite a bit of capital, partly as a result of our insistence that they do so.” That insistence, of course, came via Dodd-Frank, which Trump recently knee-capped by way of an executive order. Dodd-Frank, Trump explained on the morning that he signed the order, had imposed onerous requirements on his “friends”, he said, preventing them from borrowing the money they need for their “nice businesses.” He knew this, he said, because JPMorgan C.E.O. Jamie Dimon had told him so. Yellen, you may recall, was subject to claims by Trump during his campaign that she was in cahoots with Barack Obama to create a “false stock market” to make the president look good. So it’s certainly conceivable that today’s fact-checking exercise won’t be well-received. If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, click here to subscribe. Goldman Sachs gently tells 100 investment bankers that maybe investment banking isn’t for them Within the financial services industry, there exists a very small subset of people who would sign up for the crushing hours, abusive colleagues, and often tedious work even if they weren’t being paid gobs of money. They just love it that much! Everyone else, though, mostly does it for the money. And when that money largely comes from bonuses (as opposed to base pay), having your boss write down a number, slide it across the table, and see that it says zero has got to hurt. Sadly, 100 Goldman Sachs employees know what we’re talking about. Per Bloomberg: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. didn’t pay 2016 bonuses to about 100 bankers who advise on takeovers and underwrite securities offerings, signaling to a bigger crowd of underperformers that they’re probably better off elsewhere, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The move is more draconian than in past years, when many dealmakers who failed to impress their bosses still got something, said the people who asked not to be identified discussing the firm’s compensation practices. The number of employees denied a bonus in recent weeks is higher than a year ago--eliminating what’s typically a major component of their pay. For bankers and traders at a well-capitalized and profitable firm, getting no bonus is a dreaded scarlet letter--usually a strong hint that they’re no longer wanted and should start hunting for another job. Around the industry, it’s known as getting “blanked,” or receiving a “goose egg,” a “bagel,” or a “doughnut.” In happier news, for everyone else at the firm, the bank’s stock hit a record high today. Banks consider slapping a hazard label on the Trump Administration You know that guy in the White House who is prone to flashes of anger in which he violates decades of diplomatic protocol, lashes out at world leaders (including longtime allies), and crosses 100-foot high ethical lines when it comes to his children and businesses? Oh, and who also wreaks havoc with things like hastily signed executive orders barring thousands of people from entering the country? And whose inner circle, on top of that, may just be collapsing? All that is starting to worry banks just a bit: U.S. and U.K. banks are considering adding to their risk disclosures or beefing up particular sections in their annual reports due later this month, according to people familiar with the drafting of the documents. They’d likely cite the incoming new administration as a potential source of heightened uncertainty, but stop short of mentioning Trump by name, they said. Although banks stand to benefit from higher interest rates and Trump’s pledge to relax rules, heightened volatility could affect trading, and a slowdown in global commerce may curtail dealmaking as the president turns his attention to trade policies with China and Mexico. Bank stocks have been on a bull run in recent weeks, but some money managers say investors have ignored emerging political risks. Credit Suisse looks on the bright side The Swiss financial services giant reported a fourth-quarter loss of 2.35 billion francs ($2.34 billion) today and said it plans to lighten its load by 6,500 employees by the end of the year. But it’s super excited about having paid the U.S. government $5.3 billion for an investigation into the bank's sale of toxic mortgage securities during the financial crisis. C.E.O. Tidjane Thiam told Bloomberg TV that the settlement was “a game-changer for us [because] it leaves us in a more comfortable position to look today at our capital planning.” Companies now worrying if they’re doing enough for white men Welcome to Donald Trump’s America, wherein white men are apparently getting the short end of the stick in the workplace: Executives say they are looking critically at how they go about their work, “hearing from white men the same way you’d hear from a woman or someone who’s L.G.B.T.,” especially if they feel they’re missing out on career development or other workplace opportunities, says Janese Murray, vice president of diversity and inclusion at energy giant Exelon Corp.

U.S. and U.K. banks are considering adding to their risk disclosures or beefing up particular sections in their annual reports due later this month, according to people familiar with the drafting of the documents. They’d likely cite the incoming new administration as a potential source of heightened uncertainty, but stop short of mention Trump by name, they said. Although banks stand to benefit from higher interest rates and Trump’s pledge to relax rules, heightened volatility could affect trading and a slowdown in global commerce may curtail deal-making as the president turns his attention to trade policies with China and Mexico. Bank stocks have been on a bull run in recent weeks, but some money managers say investors have ignored emerging political risks. Warnings that the new U.S. administration may be disruptive “would most likely have to be included, given the potential ramifications,” said Rob Smith, a partner in risk consulting at KPMG in London. “I would be very surprised if a particular institution called out Trump. Rather, they will explain the impacts in broader terms about U.S. regulatory reassessments. He presents a risk, but there are also opportunities.” <a href="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=1&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> <img src="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1&pid=0&position=1" height="60" width="468" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </a> Political risks The new disclosures could go further than banks’ warnings when Barack Obama took office. Back then, with Obama vowing to “crack down on the culture of greed and scheming” that caused the financial crisis, firms worried about stiffer financial rules. JPMorgan Chase & Co., for example, told shareholders in 2009 that the administration had signaled a “comprehensive plan for regulatory reform.” Bank of America Corp. said it faced “legislative and regulatory initiatives, both enacted and proposed, that may significantly impact” its business. It mentioned a new law overhauling credit-card rules. Senior executives at multiple major U.K. lenders have held internal discussions about highlighting potential disruption in annual reports, which are released next week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. Warnings about measures to restrict travel and curb global trade, as well as the capacity for market volatility, will probably be included as part of risk disclosures, the people added. While banks flag potential risks ranging from health pandemics to terrorist attacks in financial results, they have included more specific concerns in recent years arising from political events. U.K. lenders have previously cautioned about fallout from Britain’s exit from the European Union and the 2014 vote on Scottish independence. The decision on how to phrase the disclosures “is going to be very politically charged,” said Chris Wheeler, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. “They may have some comments on interest rates, inflation and taxation, but they’re not going to point the finger at Trump directly.” Companies across all industries have been grappling with what Trump’s policies and behavior will mean for their prospects. Trump has promised tax cuts and stimulative infrastructure spending, while also attacking individual companies on Twitter for anything from their outsourcing practices to not carrying his daughter’s fashion label. ‘Highly uncertain’ “Trump just keeps on being volatile,” said Sandy Chen, an analyst at Cenkos Securities PLC in London. “It’s hard to get a clear view on whether he’ll be positive or negative for banks, but it’s highly uncertain what banks can say right now, which I don’t think Mr. Market finds all that reassuring.” Some of Trump’s policies could prove a boon for the financial industry. The president is moving to unravel the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act put in place to prevent another financial crisis that includes a ban on proprietary trading, while expectations for rising interest rates have also bolstered major lenders. Global banking regulations may also diverge as the United States seeks to halt negotiations to develop international rules for bank capital standards known as Basel III. More broadly, many measures of corporate and investor sentiment are up. Executives used the word “optimistic” on a record 51 percent of earnings calls this quarter. The S&P 500 is heading for its fourth consecutive monthly gain since the election. Yet, the president may erect trade barriers that would slow global trade and hurt international lenders. HSBC Holdings PLC CEO Stuart Gulliver has warned a trade war between the U.S. and China “would clearly be negative for us.” Keywords Donald Trump, risk adjustment, risk to banks, relax rules, heightened volatility, trade war Print Email Comment Tweet Comments No comments on this story | Please log in to comment by clicking here Please log in or register to add your comment Related Stories banking Galvin slams Trump’s 'fiduciary rule' order (Feb. 14, 2017) immigration Trump administration to argue U.S. faces peril without ban (Feb. 7, 2017) investing Vanguard warns of Trump 'sugar high' as markets ignore risks (Feb. 3, 2017) Popular Most Read 1.

In a clarifying point during Senate questioning on Tuesday, Yellen said her monetary policy panel doesn’t need to wait for the Trump’s administration’s plans on fiscal stimulus to hike rates. “We are not basing our judgments about current interest rates on speculation” about fiscal policy, Yellen told Nevada Republican Senator Dean Heller. She added that the economy’s “solid progress” is what is “driving our policy decisions.” It’s a subtle but important switch from a year ago, when the Federal Open Market Committee started with a plan for four rate hikes, and was already worrying by March about the state of the global economy. In the end, they hiked a single time, in December. Watch Part of Yellen’s Testimony to Senate Committee The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up The committee’s conviction about its plans for three hikes this year boils down to a shifting sense that upside risks this year look as potent as downside risks, if not more. Business sentiment indicators are up, and that could lead to stronger investment. The committee in December forecast that labor markets would slightly overshoot their estimate of full employment, which could put some momentum behind inflation. “You really have to turn over a lot of stones to find that shadow slack in labor markets,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, who said the Fed chair’s comments were consistent with a rate hike in the first half of this year. “For her, it is really about inflation risks” as the unemployment rate heads lower, Feroli said. Yellen also said that the committee “in the coming months” will provide further guidance on how it plans to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. “I would anticipate a balance sheet that’s substantially smaller than at the current time,” she said in response to a question. U.S. Treasury securities sold off on her testimony, raising the yield on the government 10-year note to 2.48 percent from 2.43 percent the previous day. Probabilities for a March rate increase moved back above 30 percent. Yellen’s semiannual report on monetary policy is her first since Trump became president. During the hearing, Yellen addressed a question about her future, saying she has no plans to leave before her current term as Fed chair expires in a year. New Administration Speaking separately at the White House press briefing when asked about the administration’s view of Yellen, newly installed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he looks forward to meeting with her to continue the tradition of regular discourse between the Treasury and the Fed. Yellen reiterated that falling behind on inflation could do more harm to the economy and possibly cut short the expansion. The Fed’s preferred inflation benchmark, the personal consumption expenditures price index, has been below the central bank’s 2 percent target since April 2012. It finished with a gain of 1.6 percent last year. “Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession,” she added. Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets LLC in New York, said Yellen’s view was “that things are looking pretty good from the labor market perspective.” “She’s had plenty of opportunity to back away from three hikes this year, and she did not,” he said.

Janet Yellen doesn't believe that should happen. Point by point, the Federal Reserve chief on Tuesday debunked the core arguments used by the White House to push for rolling back the 2010 Wall Street reform law. Trump has bashed Dodd-Frank as a "disaster" that has choked off bank loans. The president even said "many friends of mine who have nice businesses" can't get loans due to strangling regulations. Asked during Tuesday's U.S. Senate hearing if there's any truth to claims that banks aren't lending, Yellen said an "extremely low number" of small businesses complained of access to credit as their main problem. The Fed chief quickly rattled off numbers from a National Federation of Independent Businesses survey showing that just 4% of respondents are unable to get the loans they need. "We have seen healthy growth in actual lending in the economy," Yellen said, noting that bank commercial and industrial lending has exceeded its 2008 peak. Republicans have argued that Dodd-Frank has made U.S. banks less competitive against their global peers. Related: Banks are lending a ton, despite what Trump says But Yellen said U.S. banks are "quite profitable" and considered "quite strong relative to their counterparts." She credited the fact that American banks quickly built up capital, "as a result of our insistence they do so, following the financial crisis." "I see well-capitalized banks that are regarded as safe, sound and strong," Yellen said, adding this gives them a "competitive advantage." Investors seem to see it that way too. Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), two of the symbols of American financial might, were on track to close at all-time highs on Tuesday. Goldman hasn't closed at an all-time high since 2007. The White House has said that Dodd-Frank failed to address the Too Big To Fail problem exposed by the 2008 meltdown. But Yellen believes the system is in fact safer and more resilient than a decade ago. She cited the banks' doubling of high-quality capital known as Tier 1 capital. "I believe the financial system is much more resilient than it was," she said. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that Yellen's responses to questions about financial regulation show that Trump and White House officials are "wrong about every major reason they've given to tear up Dodd-Frank." Warren argued that Trump and his top economic official Gary Cohn, a former president at Goldman Sachs, want to return to the kind of lax regulation that led to the 2008 meltdown. "We cannot afford to go down this road again," she said. Related: Wall Street has a powerful seat at Trump's table During the campaign, Trump criticized Yellen, saying she should be "ashamed of herself." While Trump now has three vacancies to fill at the Federal Reserve, Yellen doesn't plan to step down before her term expires in February 2018. To be sure, Yellen didn't argue that Dodd-Frank is perfect as is. Like others, the Fed chief emphasized the importance of cutting the legal and compliance costs that Dodd-Frank has placed on community banks. "We're very well aware of the burden they face and are looking for every way we can find to mitigate those burdens," she said. For instance, Yellen suggested Congress should exempt community banks from the Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from making big bets with their own money. Yellen also said she agrees with the principles laid out by Trump's recent executive order on how the U.S. financial system should be regulated. Trump ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to use those broad principles to "consult" with regulators about changes that should be made to existing law. "I look forward to working with the treasury secretary" and other regulators on this review, Yellen said. But based on her comments on Tuesday, Yellen and Trump officials are likely to disagree about precisely what to do next.

Point by point, the Federal Reserve chief on Tuesday debunked the core arguments used by the White House to push for rolling back the 2010 Wall Street reform law. Trump has bashed Dodd-Frank as a "disaster" that has choked off bank loans. The president even said "many friends of mine who have nice businesses" can't get loans due to strangling regulations. Asked during Tuesday's U.S. Senate hearing if there's any truth to claims that banks aren't lending, Yellen said an "extremely low number" of small businesses complained of access to credit as their main problem. The Fed chief quickly rattled off numbers from a National Federation of Independent Businesses survey showing that just 4% of respondents are unable to get the loans they need. "We have seen healthy growth in actual lending in the economy," Yellen said, noting that bank commercial and industrial lending has exceeded its 2008 peak. Republicans have argued that Dodd-Frank has made U.S. banks less competitive against their global peers. But Yellen said U.S. banks are "quite profitable" and considered "quite strong relative to their counterparts." She credited the fact that American banks quickly built up capital, "as a result of our insistence they do so, following the financial crisis." "I see well-capitalized banks that are regarded as safe, sound and strong," Yellen said, adding this gives them a "competitive advantage." Investors seem to see it that way too. Shares of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, two of the symbols of American financial might, were on track to close at all-time highs on Tuesday. Goldman hasn't closed at an all-time high since 2007. The White House has said that Dodd-Frank failed to address the Too Big To Fail problem exposed by the 2008 meltdown. But Yellen believes the system is in fact safer and more resilient than a decade ago. She cited the banks' doubling of high-quality capital known as Tier 1 capital. "I believe the financial system is much more resilient than it was," she said. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that Yellen's responses to questions about financial regulation show that Trump and White House officials are "wrong about every major reason they've given to tear up Dodd-Frank." Warren argued that Trump and his top economic official Gary Cohn, a former president at Goldman Sachs, want to return to the kind of lax regulation that led to the 2008 meltdown. "We cannot afford to go down this road again," she said. During the campaign, Trump criticized Yellen, saying she should be "ashamed of herself." While Trump now has three vacancies to fill at the Federal Reserve, Yellen doesn't plan to step down before her term expires in February 2018. To be sure, Yellen didn't argue that Dodd-Frank is perfect as is. Like others, the Fed chief emphasized the importance of cutting the legal and compliance costs that Dodd-Frank has placed on community banks. "We're very well aware of the burden they face and are looking for every way we can find to mitigate those burdens," she said. For instance, Yellen suggested Congress should exempt community banks from the Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from making big bets with their own money. Yellen also said she agrees with the principles laid out by Trump's recent executive order on how the U.S. financial system should be regulated. Trump ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to use those broad principles to "consult" with regulators about changes that should be made to existing law. "I look forward to working with the treasury secretary" and other regulators on this review, Yellen said. But based on her comments on Tuesday, Yellen and Trump officials are likely to disagree about precisely what to do next. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Cruz was released by the New York Giants on Monday. The good news is that he's been careful about his money since the start of his career. He may not be heading into retirement any time soon, but the wide receiver has been planning for it so that he won't end up broke, the way other players do. It all started with his first NFL paycheck in 2010. "Oh man. I remember holding it up into the light and making sure it was real. Kind of hiding it like is everybody else seeing this?" Cruz said. "It was definitely a moment where I knew things were different and where I had to take care of this and make sure I make this forever and ever and ever and not just short-term." Cruz's first NFL contract was with the Giants -- it was for three years and was worth $1.215 million. In 2013, he signed a five-year contract worth $43 million. His release by the Giants Monday came ahead of a $1 million roster bonus he was supposed to get on March 11. Early on, he was advised by New York Giants' staffer Charles Way to keep track of his money. "He was like, 'Man, make sure you understand what your money is doing and understand what's happening with your money. Don't just give it to some accountant and just let him do whatever he wants with it.'" Related: Inside the world of women's tackle football As part of his effort to be financially secure once his days playing -- and dancing -- are over, Cruz teamed up with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which manages his money. Cruz has been a partner with the bank for five years now. "They teach me to be conscious of how I spend my money and to plan for the long term, not just what I see in front me," he said. "That's sometimes easier said than done." The biggest thing he's learned? "Save as much as you can." "What you do with your finances, everything is calculated. You have to make concise and precise moves with your money and not be careless with it and I think football is the same way," Cruz said. "You have to understand what you're doing [in] practice so that when game time comes, you know what you're doing and you're just playing as opposed to just reacting." Cruz said he thinks many retired players get into financial trouble because they aren't informed. "They weren't knowledgeable about what their money was doing," he said. "[Things] can add up and next thing you know, you're in debt and you're in the hole and you have to struggle a little bit and live paycheck to paycheck." Related: Millionaire NBA player isn't only guy living with his parents When Cruz eventually does leave the NFL, he wants to work with kids and teach them about financial literacy and saving. After attending the White House Science Fair in 2012, he launched the Victor Cruz Foundation to help expose inner-city students to STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and math. "Once I attended the White House Science Fair, it just kind of hit me," he said. The program started at the Boys and Girls Club in Paterson, New Jersey, where he went as a kid, and Cruz hopes it will expand. President Obama's administration started the White House Science Fair in 2010. It's unclear whether President Trump will put the same priority on STEM initiatives. "It's a time where you don't know what's going to happen," Cruz said. "We'll see if there even is a science fair ... but obviously, full support from the White House would be great and beneficial."

Tyler Crowe, Jordan Wathen, and Beth McKenna (TMFDirtyBird) Feb 14, 2017 at 8:05AM America loves its underdog stories. Whether it's some unknown rising to prominence or a big name on the comeback trail after a fall from grace, there is always that desire to see those kinds of stories succeed over the long term. So we asked three of our contributors to highlight a stock they see as a real underdog in the market today and why investors should be watching this stock. Here's a quick look into why they picked banker Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), railcar manufacturer Greenbrier Companies (NYSE:GBX) , and egg wholesaler Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ:CALM) Image source: Getty Images. Banking on the stagecoach Jordan Wathen (Wells Fargo): Maybe Wells Fargo isn't exactly the kind of stock you'd think of as an underdog, given that it trades near post-crisis highs like most banks. But since its recent accounts scandal, Wells Fargo has broadly lagged the larger banking industry. Some of its sector-lagging performance can be explained by asset sensitivity. It just doesn't have as much to gain from higher interest rates as other banks do. The other part can be explained by a widespread belief that Wells Fargo's fee generators won't be as lucrative as they used to be. While Wells Fargo may be loved for its ability to generate fee income, its credit record is much better than that of its big-bank peers. In the years that followed the financial crisis, Wells Fargo's net charge-offs peaked at 2.3% of average loans, while Bank of America's reached 3.6%, and JPMorgan's "fortress" balance sheet endured losses equal to 3.4% of its loans. Wells Fargo has a long history of adequately provisioning for losses, and running from markets where it sees increasing default risks. As a recent example, its decision to pull back on subprime auto lending in 2015 appears to have been well timed. As long as the aggressive sales processes didn't infect its underwriting or credit processes, it should continue to outperform its big-bank peers by simply being a little smarter about managing its lending risks. A railroad investment picking up steam Tyler Crowe (Greenbrier Companies): It's hard to deny the competitive advantages that railroads have over other forms of transportation for moving goods over long distances. The average revenue per ton-mile for moving goods via rail is consistently a small fraction of the cost to move things via truck or rail. This means that there is little chance that freight rail is going to be disrupted anytime soon. That is the underlying idea for investing in railcar manufacturer Greenbrier Companies, but the story is much deeper than that. Greenbrier has undergone a major transformation over the past several years. What was once a debt-laden company with middling returns on equity now has cleaned up its balance sheet and is churning out strong rates of return. During that time of higher debt, the company was making some large investments to revamp its manufacturing capacity and expand into other types of railcars to meet customer demand. These efforts have led to higher margins and a large backlog of work. Wall Street doesn't seem to be wise to the changes that have happened at Greenbrier. The company's stock currently trades at an incredibly cheap enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.97 times. This stock looks like a real gem of a value at a time when valuations at so many other stocks are getting awfully frothy. A scrambled stock that has sunny-side-up potential Beth McKenna (Cal-Maine Foods): One underdog stock I'm watching is that of Cal-Maine Foods, the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States. The company isn't an underdog in the sense that it's a small player in its industry, but in the sense that its stock has been struggling, while the broader market has been performing well. Cal-Maine stock's total return is negative 18.6% for the one-year period through Feb. 9, while the S&P 500 has returned 26.5% over this period. It remains, however, a long-term winner, as the chart below shows. This superior long-term performance reflects the company's sustainable competitive advantages and management's ability to execute, in my opinion. So I believe the company and its stock have a good shot at eventually resuming their strong performances.  Data by YCharts. Cal-Maine's recent stock-price volatility stems from the avian flu outbreak in the U.S. in the spring of 2015. (None of Cal-Maine's flock tested positive for the virus.) The company's year-over-year financial results benefited big-time from the surge in shell egg prices following the outbreak, though naturally suffered when shell egg prices fell back down to Earth. Moreover, export demand declined as a result of the outbreak and still hasn't recovered. Cal-Maine has a strong balance sheet with just $22.5 million in debt and $197.7 million in cash at the end of the most recently reported quarter. So, unlike many smaller players, it's well equipped to weather the challenging market conditions. Moreover, the company has a huge long-term catalyst for growth: Nearly all major egg buyers, including retailers such as Wal-Mart and fast-food chains like McDonald's, have pledged to buy only eggs laid by cage-free hens by a certain date.  As the industry's heavyweight, Cal-Maine has the most resources to ramp up its cage-free egg production capacity, which it has been doing.  Beth McKenna has no position in any stocks mentioned. Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned. Tyler Crowe has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends The Greenbrier Companies.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files 6/6 By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK NEW YORK The trial of two men was delayed on Monday in a case stemming from a probe into a bitcoin exchange and a data breach at JPMorgan Chase & Co after prosecutors revealed a new witness. Jury selection was set to begin in Manhattan federal court in the case of Yuri Lebedev, whom authorities call the architect of bitcoin exchange Coin.mx's platform, and Trevon Gross, a pastor and ex-chairman of a now-defunct credit union. But U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan delayed jury selection until Tuesday after prosecutors said they had secured a new witness. The witness, Philip Burgess, was represented by the law firm of one of Gross' lawyers in an unrelated tax case in which he was sentenced in 2010 to eight months in prison. Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Noble said Burgess, while "reporting another potential fraud" to prosecutors on Wednesday, revealed he had incriminating information stemming from his time as a potential investor in the credit union Gross headed. But after spending the day discussing how to resolve the conflict of Gross and Burgess sharing the same law firm, Nathan ruled prosecutors could not call their eve-of-trial new witness. "It is my conclusion that we will proceed tomorrow and the government may not call Mr. Burgess," she said. Gross, 52, and Lebedev, 39, are among nine people who have been charged following an investigation connected to a breach JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 that exposed over 83 million accounts. While Gross and Lebedev were not accused of hacking, they came under scrutiny in connection with Coin.mx, which authorities said was operated by Florida resident Anthony Murgio and owned by an Israeli behind the JPMorgan breach, Gery Shalon.Shalon has pleaded not guilty to charges that he orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million people's information. Prosecutors said Coin.mx operated through a front called "Collectables Club" to trick financial institutions into believing it was a memorabilia club while it converted, with no license, millions of dollars into bitcoin. To further evade scrutiny, in 2014, Murgio, with Lebedev's help, tried to take over Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, which was linked to HOPE Cathedral. To do so, they and others paid $150,000 in bribes via the church to Gross, its pastor, in exchange for facilitating Murgio's takeover and arranging for Lebedev and others to be put on the credit union's board, prosecutors said.

US and UK banks are considering adding to their risk disclosures or beefing up particular sections in their annual reports due later this month, according to people familiar with the drafting of the documents. They’d likely cite the incoming new administration as a potential source of heightened uncertainty, but stop short of mentioning Trump by name, they said. Although banks stand to benefit from higher interest rates and Trump’s pledge to relax rules, heightened volatility could affect trading and a slowdown in global commerce may curtail deal making as the president turns his attention to trade policies with China and Mexico. Bank stocks have been on a bull run in recent weeks but some money managers say investors have ignored emerging political risks. Warnings that the new US administration may be disruptive “would most likely have to be included, given the potential ramifications,” said Rob Smith, a partner in risk consulting at KPMG in London. “I would be very surprised if a particular institution called out Trump. Rather, they will explain the impacts in broader terms about US regulatory reassessments. He presents a risk, but there are also opportunities.” The new disclosures could go further than banks’ warnings when Barack Obama took office. Back then, with Obama vowing to “crack down on the culture of greed and scheming” that caused the financial crisis, firms worried about stiffer financial rules. JPMorgan Chase & Co., for example, told shareholders in 2009 that the administration had signalled a “comprehensive plan for regulatory reform.” Bank of America said it faced “legislative and regulatory initiatives, both enacted and proposed, that may significantly impact” its business. It mentioned a new law overhauling credit-card rules. Senior executives at multiple major UK lenders have held internal discussions about highlighting potential disruption in annual reports, which are released next week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. Warnings about measures to restrict travel and curb global trade, as well as the capacity for market volatility, will probably be included as part of risk disclosures, the people added. While banks flag potential risks ranging from health pandemics to terrorist attacks in financial results, they have included more specific concerns in recent years arising from political events. UK lenders have previously cautioned about fallout from Britain’s exit from the European Union and the 2014 vote on Scottish independence. The decision on how to phrase the disclosures “is going to be very politically charged,” said Chris Wheeler, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. “They may have some comments on interest rates, inflation and taxation, but they’re not going to point the finger at Trump directly.” Companies across all industries have been grappling with what Trump’s policies and behaviour will mean for their prospects. Trump has promised tax cuts and stimulative infrastructure spending, while also attacking individual companies on Twitter for anything from their outsourcing practises to not carrying his daughter’s fashion label. “Trump just keeps on being volatile,” said Sandy Chen, an analyst at Cenkos Securities Plc in London. “It’s hard to get a clear view on whether he’ll be positive or negative for banks, but it’s highly uncertain what banks can say right now, which I don’t think Mr. Market finds all that reassuring.” Some of Trump’s policies could prove a boon for the financial industry. The president is moving to unravel the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act put in place to prevent another financial crisis that includes a ban on proprietary trading, while expectations for rising interest rates have also bolstered major lenders. Global banking regulations may also diverge as the US seeks to halt negotiations to develop international rules for bank capital standards known as Basel III. More broadly, many measures of corporate and investor sentiment are up. Executives used the word “optimistic” on a record 51 per cent of earnings calls this quarter. The S&P 500 is heading for its fourth straight monthly gain since the election. Yet, the president may erect trade barriers that would slow global trade and hurt international lenders. HSBC Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver has warned a trade war between the US and China “would clearly be negative for us.”   Most Popular Viewed 1 Why would Malaysia sell its ‘symbol of dignity’ to China? 2 How far can Singapore’s grand plan for economy really go? 3 Why 110 Japanese went bankrupt in China last year 4 China’s stock market regulator vows to ‘capture’ more tycoons 5 TVB shares rise to 11-month high on takeover offer Shared 1 Why would Malaysia sell its ‘symbol of dignity’ to China? 2 Growing number of foreign firms shutting shop in China 3 How far can Singapore’s grand plan for economy really go? 4 Why 110 Japanese went bankrupt in China last year 5 China’s stock market regulator vows to ‘capture’ more tycoons Commented 1 Why would Malaysia sell its ‘symbol of dignity’ to China? 2 How far can Singapore’s grand plan for economy really go? 3 Looser regulation, more risk: Singapore’s new economic plan 4 CK Property first in Hong Kong with 100pc stamp duty subsidy 5 We should sell our public housing for HK$1 per flat       You may also like Politics Why Malaysia is fighting Singapore over a rock 11 Feb 2017 - 12:21pm 5 Fast facts of cloud computing In partnership with: Alibaba Cloud Hong Kong Dwindling support for bitcoin businesses in Hong Kong 11 Feb 2017 - 10:55pm 2 We can make a difference Sponsored by: Hong Kong International School Opinion Trump’s assault on Muslims takes US back to 1882 11 Feb 2017 - 11:31am 36 World CIA files reveal how US used psychics to spy on Iran 11 Feb 2017 - 9:27pm 3 Post Magazine Hong Kong men victims of sextortion by Philippine cybercriminals 11 Feb 2017 - 9:31am 14 Geopolitics Revealed: Malaysia’s ‘new evidence’ in island row against Singapore 11 Feb 2017 - 2:19am 16 Hong Kong John Tsang builds big poll lead over Carrie Lam in leadership race 10 Feb 2017 - 10:28am 35 China China to store foreigners’ fingerprints upon entry, starting with Shenzhen 10 Feb 2017 - 8:25am 27 China Fire at Chinese factory that supplied Samsung Note 7 batteries 9 Feb 2017 - 10:25am 8 China Does China’s Communist Party follow any succession rules at all? 7 Feb 2017 - 9:21pm 10 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

Tyler Crowe, Jordan Wathen, and Beth McKenna (TMFDirtyBird) Feb 14, 2017 at 8:05AM America loves its underdog stories. Whether it's some unknown rising to prominence or a big name on the comeback trail after a fall from grace, there is always that desire to see those kinds of stories succeed over the long term. So we asked three of our contributors to highlight a stock they see as a real underdog in the market today and why investors should be watching this stock. Here's a quick look into why they picked banker Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), railcar manufacturer Greenbrier Companies (NYSE:GBX) , and egg wholesaler Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ:CALM) Image source: Getty Images. Banking on the stagecoach Jordan Wathen (Wells Fargo): Maybe Wells Fargo isn't exactly the kind of stock you'd think of as an underdog, given that it trades near post-crisis highs like most banks. But since its recent accounts scandal, Wells Fargo has broadly lagged the larger banking industry. Some of its sector-lagging performance can be explained by asset sensitivity. It just doesn't have as much to gain from higher interest rates as other banks do. The other part can be explained by a widespread belief that Wells Fargo's fee generators won't be as lucrative as they used to be. While Wells Fargo may be loved for its ability to generate fee income, its credit record is much better than that of its big-bank peers. In the years that followed the financial crisis, Wells Fargo's net charge-offs peaked at 2.3% of average loans, while Bank of America's reached 3.6%, and JPMorgan's "fortress" balance sheet endured losses equal to 3.4% of its loans. Wells Fargo has a long history of adequately provisioning for losses, and running from markets where it sees increasing default risks. As a recent example, its decision to pull back on subprime auto lending in 2015 appears to have been well timed. As long as the aggressive sales processes didn't infect its underwriting or credit processes, it should continue to outperform its big-bank peers by simply being a little smarter about managing its lending risks. A railroad investment picking up steam Tyler Crowe (Greenbrier Companies): It's hard to deny the competitive advantages that railroads have over other forms of transportation for moving goods over long distances. The average revenue per ton-mile for moving goods via rail is consistently a small fraction of the cost to move things via truck or rail. This means that there is little chance that freight rail is going to be disrupted anytime soon. That is the underlying idea for investing in railcar manufacturer Greenbrier Companies, but the story is much deeper than that. Greenbrier has undergone a major transformation over the past several years. What was once a debt-laden company with middling returns on equity now has cleaned up its balance sheet and is churning out strong rates of return. During that time of higher debt, the company was making some large investments to revamp its manufacturing capacity and expand into other types of railcars to meet customer demand. These efforts have led to higher margins and a large backlog of work. Wall Street doesn't seem to be wise to the changes that have happened at Greenbrier. The company's stock currently trades at an incredibly cheap enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.97 times. This stock looks like a real gem of a value at a time when valuations at so many other stocks are getting awfully frothy. A scrambled stock that has sunny-side-up potential Beth McKenna (Cal-Maine Foods): One underdog stock I'm watching is that of Cal-Maine Foods, the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States. The company isn't an underdog in the sense that it's a small player in its industry, but in the sense that its stock has been struggling, while the broader market has been performing well. Cal-Maine stock's total return is negative 18.6% for the one-year period through Feb. 9, while the S&P 500 has returned 26.5% over this period. It remains, however, a long-term winner, as the chart below shows. This superior long-term performance reflects the company's sustainable competitive advantages and management's ability to execute, in my opinion. So I believe the company and its stock have a good shot at eventually resuming their strong performances.  Data by YCharts. Cal-Maine's recent stock-price volatility stems from the avian flu outbreak in the U.S. in the spring of 2015. (None of Cal-Maine's flock tested positive for the virus.) The company's year-over-year financial results benefited big-time from the surge in shell egg prices following the outbreak, though naturally suffered when shell egg prices fell back down to Earth. Moreover, export demand declined as a result of the outbreak and still hasn't recovered. Cal-Maine has a strong balance sheet with just $22.5 million in debt and $197.7 million in cash at the end of the most recently reported quarter. So, unlike many smaller players, it's well equipped to weather the challenging market conditions. Moreover, the company has a huge long-term catalyst for growth: Nearly all major egg buyers, including retailers such as Wal-Mart and fast-food chains like McDonald's, have pledged to buy only eggs laid by cage-free hens by a certain date.  As the industry's heavyweight, Cal-Maine has the most resources to ramp up its cage-free egg production capacity, which it has been doing.  Beth McKenna has no position in any stocks mentioned. Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned. Tyler Crowe has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends The Greenbrier Companies.

The tendency for the governing or regulating bodies isn’t to try to get things from over-exuberant back to the mean, it’s to over-regulate, so it can never ever happen again. While that always seems like a good solution at the time, it is usually so stifling that in the normal course of events, transactions and business can be bottlenecked for years. A new Merrill Lynch research report makes the case that some regulatory relief is possibly on the way, and the resignation in April of this year of Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo, who is said to be the de facto head of bank supervision, could pave the way for an improved administration of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process. The analysts also feel this could free up some of the tremendous amount of capital the banks are forced to hold. In fact, they estimate that there is as much a $230 billion in what they call “dead weight” capital from the CCAR process. While two banks immediately hit the Merrill Lynch screens as possible winners from the rules changes, only one is ranked Buy at the firm. We suspect this would to a large degree help all banks, so we screened the Merrill Lynch research database for the large money center banks also rated Buy. Citigroup This is one of the banks that Merrill Lynch feels could benefit among the most if the CCAR is modified. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. It provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services and wealth management. Trading at a still very cheap 10.9 times estimated 2018 earnings, this company still looks very reasonable in what is becoming a pricey stock market. A continuing stock buyback program at the bank is a positive, which could be increased if some of the restrictions were relaxed. While fourth-quarter results were generally in line with estimates, management was conservative looking forward and some were disappointed. Citigroup investors receive a 1.2% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $64. The Wall Street consensus price objective is $64.61. Shares closed most recently at $59.90. JPMorgan This stock trades at a still low 11.8 times estimated 2018 forward earnings and could respond good in a rising rate scenario. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) is expected to continue to benefit from commercial loan growth and an upturn in capital spending. Wall Street analysts agree that the stock seems attractively valued on estimated price-to-earnings and a very solid price-to-book value. Some on Wall Street have cautioned that last year’s divestiture of the physical commodities business could provide earnings headwind going forward. With $2.6 trillion in assets on a worldwide basis, and one of Wall Street’s savviest leaders in Jamie Dimon, the stock is a solid buy for investors. Last year, Dimon put his money where his mouth was and bought a stunning 500,000 shares of the stock for a massive $26 million. The company reported solid fourth-quarter results that came in a touch above estimates. The analysts feel the company is able to take advantage of revenue opportunities while still improving efficiency. The firm’s forward estimates are above current Wall Street expectations. JPMorgan investors receive a 2.5% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $95 price target, and the consensus target is $89.21. The shares closed Monday at $88.24.

Explaining his forecast, Gartside said that the U.S. economy is "on an improving trajectory; inflation (is going) higher." Janet Yellen, the chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, would "react to reality," he added. Justifying his viewpoint, Gartside said that, "that sounds aggressive now, but remember that we've not yet seen the phenomenal tax plan that is yet to come," referring to new U.S. President Donald Trump's fiscal policy of reforming taxation in the country. "Tax cuts work very quickly for both consumers, for corporations," he added, viewing the potential changes as positive for U.S. economic growth. By way of suggesting when the first of this year's predicted rate hikes will be, Yellen "should keep March open – and if she's brave, she should go in March," said Gartside. "When you look at GDP (gross domestic product) in the U.S. this year, the reality is that the risk is to the upside, and considerably to the upside," emphasized Gartside. "The market's not got that yet," he added. With regards to U.S. debt, Gartside argued that "markets are dominated by animal spirits." "When we see the detail of those tax cuts, expect the greed bond to take over," he said. Discussing the U.S. 10-year bond yield, Gartside forecast that "by the end of the year, it probably (will go) to three and a half percent." "If you've got an environment where the economy is improving, corporations are making more money, households have bigger incomes, they have tax cuts, then that debt service is able to financed," he said, describing the U.S. economy's potential for "a self-fulfilling recovery as you look forward." "Probably before Easter time, we'll see markets really latch on to that," he added. Gartside thought that tax reform would be the first factor to affect U.S. bond yields. But commenting on the implication of political risk in Europe and how this could impact the U.S., Gartside said that the "when you look at the recent history of electoral surprises, a – they tend to be pretty idiosyncratic and pretty localized, and then secondly, markets have shrugged them off." He said that markets would be preoccupied with positive growth and inflation forecasts, and with "accommodative" central banks in Europe, "that's probably supportive for asset prices."

Here's why    Tuesday, 14 Feb 2017 | 7:19 AM ET | 03:21 While the nation's unemployment rate declines, the jobless trend for America's youngest veterans is climbing, jumping to 6.3 percent in January from 4.4 percent in September. "We still see around half a million veterans that are unemployed right now, and over a million veterans that are underemployed," said Brian Stann, CEO of Hire Heroes USA. Economist note that the jobless rate for post-9/11 vets is volatile, and the small sample size leaves it open to inaccuracy. But even looking at the trend over a three-month period, the scenario looks tough for young vets. One reason, according to Stann: "They get out of the military and they're competing against their peer group that just graduated college. And a lot of companies do not equate four years of military service to four years at a university or state institution." And it can be a huge challenge to transition from a regimented, follow-orders environment to the civilian world where self-starters succeed. Getty Images People cheer veterans in the Veterans Day Parade in New York City last year. Leaving the Army behind Brandon Smith left the Army in 2015. After a restaurant hosting job and a brief stint with UPS, he enrolled full-time in Syracuse University's Institute for Veterans and Military Families, the first-in-the-nation cross-disciplinary institute to focus on veterans. "I think a lot of the soldiers that go in the military don't have entirely what they need to tackle the workforce in the first place," Smith said. "I went in the military because I couldn't find the job I wanted, or I couldn't get the opportunity I wanted." To complicate matters, President Donald Trump's federal hiring freeze may hit veterans hardest. It's a primary source of civilian employment post-service because of its preferential hiring practices toward veterans. A third of federal workers are veterans. Companies that value the leadership and experience earned in the armed forces are working to make sure veterans have that same kind of training going into the civilian world. JPMorgan Chase committed $22 million to fund Syracuse's Institute for Veterans, and within its company has dedicated a team to recruit, acclimate and retain veterans. The bank has hired 11,000 veterans in the past five years. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz also pledged $20 million to the endeavor through his family foundation. The coffee chain has hired 8,800 veterans and military spouses, and that number is slated to increase to 10,000 by next year. But experts suggest that many employers have allowed their vigilance to lag when it comes to hiring vets. As U.S. forces withdraw from overseas conflicts, news coverage of military matters has softened, allowing national attention to lapse. Hollywood has also shifted its focus away from broader military themes, with movies and television shows honing in on extremes, portraying veterans who are either heroes or victims suffering from PTSD, addiction or suicidal tendencies. "A lot of people put me into a box, which is what a lot of veterans face when they go into the civilian world," said J.R. Martinez, one of the best-known veterans of the second Gulf War. "Once I started to deal with this feedback of people rejecting me, I then started to have to deal with the mental and emotional — then I became angry, developed resentment. … I'd earned the right for people to give me a shot, to give me a chance." Getty Images J.R. Martinez speaks on stage at Hollywood Bridging The Military Civilian Divide at Paramount Pictures on February 9, 2017 in Los Angeles. A different perspective Martinez got his chance when he landed a role on ABC's daytime drama "All My Children" and then went on to win "Dancing with the Stars," helping America see beyond his scars and disfigurement. "If we let that narrative be simply about victims or heroes, I think we've missed an opportunity," said Mike Haynie, executive director of the Syracuse's institute. "Most veterans are somewhere in the middle of those two extremes." At a panel sponsored by the institute about Hollywood's influence on America's perception, David Gale, formerly of MTV and now the co-founder of a veterans-focused production company We Are the Mighty, said, "We need more volume. We need more stories. We need to be able to show veterans in the complexities that everyday people are." CBS' "NCIS" employs more than 100 veterans on the show's roster of 250, and Scott Williams, a writer and executive producer of the show, says the vets fully inform the stories "NCIS" produces. That means writing storylines with complex, multilayered individuals with leadership, experience and problem-solving know-how. With some 200,000 servicemen and women leaving the military every year, highlighting that perception could make all the difference. "It's more competitive to stay in," said Zachary Watson, who left the Marines in the fall. "So, now a lot of people are realizing, 'OK, I can't stay in here. I've got to get a job or something.'" Watson is taking advantage of the GI bill, enrolled as a full-time student. He believes a college degree will help him launch a successful career in TV or film but thinks his military experience would be the most valuable to future employers. "At 22 years old, I was in charge of an entire crew, and I was responsible for being part of the whole organization and unit that was repairing helicopters that are [worth] millions of dollars. How many 22-year-olds are in charge of stuff like that?" Experts urge companies to consider adapting their approach to recruiting veterans — anticipating unique needs for acclimation and retention — in a similar way that they've had to change their approach for hiring millennials. Veterans say those in the armed forces need to prepare themselves for the civilian world six to nine months before leaving the military, taking advantage of the tools available to them through the military, the Veterans Administration and support groups. Martinez, who is taking a break from acting to study psychology full time at Fordham said, "As much as we're talking about hiring veterans and giving them an opportunity, we hope people don't translate that to just saying, 'Just hire us on the spot because we're veterans and because of what we've done for this country.' We want to be in the conversation. Give us a chance to sell ourselves to you, and to prove to you that we can, and we will!" CNBC's Michael Newberg contributed to this report. show chapters The ranks of unemployed young veterans are rising.

U.S. and U.K. banks are considering adding to their risk disclosures or beefing up particular sections in their annual reports due later this month, according to people familiar with the drafting of the documents. They’d likely cite the incoming new administration as a potential source of heightened uncertainty, but stop short of mention Trump by name, they said. Although banks stand to benefit from higher interest rates and Trump’s pledge to relax rules, heightened volatility could affect trading and a slowdown in global commerce may curtail dealmaking as the president turns his attention to trade policies with China and Mexico. Bank stocks have been on a bull run in recent weeks but some money managers say investors have ignored emerging political risks. Warnings that the new U.S. administration may be disruptive “would most likely have to be included, given the potential ramifications,” said Rob Smith, a partner in risk consulting at KPMG in London. “I would be very surprised if a particular institution called out Trump. Rather, they will explain the impacts in broader terms about U.S. regulatory reassessments. He presents a risk, but there are also opportunities.” Political Risks The new disclosures could go further than banks’ warnings when Barack Obama took office. Back then, with Obama vowing to “crack down on the culture of greed and scheming” that caused the financial crisis, firms worried about stiffer financial rules. JPMorgan Chase & Co., for example, told shareholders in 2009 that the administration had signaled a “comprehensive plan for regulatory reform.” Bank of America Corp. said it faced “legislative and regulatory initiatives, both enacted and proposed, that may significantly impact” its business. It mentioned a new law overhauling credit-card rules. Senior executives at multiple major U.K. lenders have held internal discussions about highlighting potential disruption in annual reports, which are released next week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. Warnings about measures to restrict travel and curb global trade, as well as the capacity for market volatility, will probably be included as part of risk disclosures, the people added. While banks flag potential risks ranging from health pandemics to terrorist attacks in financial results, they have included more specific concerns in recent years arising from political events. U.K. lenders have previously cautioned about fallout from Britain’s exit from the European Union and the 2014 vote on Scottish independence. The decision on how to phrase the disclosures “is going to be very politically charged,” said Chris Wheeler, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. “They may have some comments on interest rates, inflation and taxation, but they’re not going to point the finger at Trump directly.” Companies across all industries have been grappling with what Trump’s policies and behavior will mean for their prospects. Trump has promised tax cuts and stimulative infrastructure spending, while also attacking individual companies on Twitter for anything from their outsourcing practices to not carrying his daughter’s fashion label. ‘Highly Uncertain’ “Trump just keeps on being volatile,” said Sandy Chen, an analyst at Cenkos Securities Plc in London. “It’s hard to get a clear view on whether he’ll be positive or negative for banks, but it’s highly uncertain what banks can say right now, which I don’t think Mr. Market finds all that reassuring.” The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Some of Trump’s policies could prove a boon for the financial industry. The president is moving to unravel the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act put in place to prevent another financial crisis that includes a ban on proprietary trading, while expectations for rising interest rates have also bolstered major lenders. Global banking regulations may also diverge as the U.S. seeks to halt negotiations to develop international rules for bank capital standards known as Basel III.

Executives used the word “optimistic” on a record 51 percent of earnings calls this quarter. The S&P 500 is heading for its fourth straight monthly gain since the election. Yet, the president may erect trade barriers that would slow global trade and hurt international lenders. HSBC Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver has warned a trade war between the U.S. and China “would clearly be negative for us.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Though she is unlikely to win the mandate to become the next French president in the second round of voting, it is worth noting there is increasing support for the anti-euro and anti-European party. One of Le Pen's campaign pledges is putting the country's membership of the euro zone to a referendum, arguing that the common currency hasn't benefited the French people. Analysts have told CNBC that such an argument is nonsense and that in fact, the second-largest euro zone economy has been one the main beneficiaries of the single currency. "Interest rates were much higher pre-euro," Gilles Moec, chief European economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told CNBC over the phone on Friday. "It's thus hard to argue France has been a victim of the monetary union," he said. "In fact, France has been one of the main beneficiaries of the lower rates," he added. The euro was introduced on January 1, 1999, with the European Central Bank taking control of monetary policy. As a result, the euro has removed most of the politics from currency markets in Europe and has boosted trade. Vincent Juvyns, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC that he doesn't see any ground to blame the euro for the subdued economic growth in France. "The economy is picking up at the moment," he noted, adding that French companies have seen exports rise because of the single currency. According to data released by the European Commission, France is set to grow 1.4 percent this year, 0.2 percentage points higher than in 2016. The country has struggled to expand its economy, while reducing its government spending. In fact, France's deficit is set to increase from this year to the next, from 2.9 percent of gross domestic product to 3.1 percent in 2018 – above the EU's threshold. However, according to Juvyns from JP Morgan, the solution to boost the French economy is not returning to the franc as Le Pen supports. "I don't think this is a very good economic plan," he said, commenting on Le Pen's plan to convert the 1.7 trillion euros ($1.81 trillion) into francs. Looking at the main economic indicators pre and post euro membership, it is clear that exports rose since the country began using the euro and the economy has grown at a faster pace, despite a higher deficit and a stagnation in unemployment. 1998 2004 2015 Unemployment (percentage of active population) 10.3% 8.9% 10.4% Exports (in million) To the EU = 199,767 Extra EU = 105,662 To the EU = 240, 248 Extra EU = 122,960 To the EU = 268,205 Extra EU = 187,785 GDP (million euros) 1,350,167.7 1,710,760.0 2,181,064 Deficit (million) 829,384 1,123,511 2,097,610 Data from the Eurostat Furthermore, some analysts believe that France has potential to grow further. "France's demographics are a comparative advantage over other EU countries," Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note last month. "France can still benefit from 0.1-0.2 percent natural growth per year on average over 2018-25, while Germany's natural growth will turn negative to 0.4 percent absent further immigration acceleration," the bank added. The same research noted also that each hour worked in France creates 52.4 euros of real gross domestic product, above the 47.9 euros registered in Germany. "What's missing is stronger total factor productivity," the bank said, calling for labor market reforms. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

NEW DELHI: GIC of Singapore is set to enter into exclusive bilateral negotiations with KP Singh and his family, the promoters of India’s largest real estate firm DLF Limited, to acquire their 40% stake in DLF Cyber City Developers Limited (DCCDL), the company that owns a portfolio of leased commercial assets, including the entire Cyber City complex in Gurgaon. The deal will help the promoters raise about Rs 12,000 crore, valuing the rental arm at nearly Rs 40,000 crore, inclusive of its Rs 10,000-11,000 crore debt, said two persons familiar with the negotiations. The promoters plan to use most of these funds in subscribing to a Rs 10,000-crore preferential issue of DLF Limited, which in turn will use this money to retire a portion of its debt. “The agreement is likely to be signed soon,” said one of the persons quoted above. The balance 60% in DCCDL is owned by DLF Limited. A DLF spokesperson declined to comment. “We do not wish to comment on speculation. We are in our silent period as our quarterly results are scheduled for February 14,” said the spokesperson. GIC did not respond to queries. Last year, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan were mandated by DLF to help monetise their stake in an effort to deleverage their balance sheet. GIC, which already has close relationship with DLF, trumped Blackstone and a consortium of sovereign wealth funds from Abu Dhabi and Qatar, added officials in the know. Close to 15 suitors had expressed initial interests to partner DLF. DCCDL operates 27 million square feet of commercial property assets that are already leased and earning rent of Rs 2,250 crore as of March 31, 2016. It also has 20 million sq ft of future development potential. The proposed transaction will reduce DLF Ltd’s debt in a two-step transaction. The promoters will pump Rs 10,000 crore into India’s largest real estate developer by purchasing shares in a preferential issue with funds raised from the sale of their stake in the company’s rental unit. In addition, the real estate firm plans to raise about Rs 3,000 crore from institutional investors. From these two transactions, the company will raise about Rs 13,000 crore, and this money will be used to retire a portion of DLF Ltd’s standalone debt. In addition, DCCDL owes Rs 11,000 crore to its lenders. As it will continue to be 60% owned by DLF Ltd, its debt will remain in the parent company’s books. “DLF has been running operational cash flow deficit of Rs 5-6 billion (Rs 500-600 crore) per quarter due to slowdown in sales and continued construction spend (Rs 6.5-7 billion per quarter). With sales expected to remain muted, the company does not expect the gap to close in coming quarters. Closure of DCCDL transaction would help close that gap," wrote analysts from Axis Securities in a report in December. DLF shares fell 0.07%, or 10 paise, to close at Rs 147.7 50 on the BSE on Monday.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files 6/6 By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK NEW YORK The trial of two men was delayed on Monday in a case stemming from a probe into a bitcoin exchange and a data breach at JPMorgan Chase & Co after prosecutors revealed a new witness. Jury selection was set to begin in Manhattan federal court in the case of Yuri Lebedev, whom authorities call the architect of bitcoin exchange Coin.mx's platform, and Trevon Gross, a pastor and ex-chairman of a now-defunct credit union. But U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan delayed jury selection until Tuesday after prosecutors said they had secured a new witness. The witness, Philip Burgess, was represented by the law firm of one of Gross' lawyers in an unrelated tax case in which he was sentenced in 2010 to eight months in prison. Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Noble said Burgess, while "reporting another potential fraud" to prosecutors on Wednesday, revealed he had incriminating information stemming from his time as a potential investor in the credit union Gross headed. But after spending the day discussing how to resolve the conflict of Gross and Burgess sharing the same law firm, Nathan ruled prosecutors could not call their eve-of-trial new witness. "It is my conclusion that we will proceed tomorrow and the government may not call Mr. Burgess," she said. Gross, 52, and Lebedev, 39, are among nine people who have been charged following an investigation connected to a breach JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 that exposed over 83 million accounts. While Gross and Lebedev were not accused of hacking, they came under scrutiny in connection with Coin.mx, which authorities said was operated by Florida resident Anthony Murgio and owned by an Israeli behind the JPMorgan breach, Gery Shalon.Shalon has pleaded not guilty to charges that he orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million people's information. Prosecutors said Coin.mx operated through a front called "Collectables Club" to trick financial institutions into believing it was a memorabilia club while it converted, with no license, millions of dollars into bitcoin. To further evade scrutiny, in 2014, Murgio, with Lebedev's help, tried to take over Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, which was linked to HOPE Cathedral. To do so, they and others paid $150,000 in bribes via the church to Gross, its pastor, in exchange for facilitating Murgio's takeover and arranging for Lebedev and others to be put on the credit union's board, prosecutors said. Federal regulators took the credit union into conservatorship in 2015. Murgio pleaded guilty in January.

Finance Search US aid groups hobbled by banking barriersAAP – Tue, Feb 14, 2017 11:02 AM AEDT Most US aid groups working abroad face the unintended consequences of US banking regulations aimed at preventing terrorist financing, just as the number of people displaced worldwide has reached record levels, according to a new survey. Two-thirds of US non-profit organisations working internationally experience banking problems, according to the survey commissioned by the Charity & Security Network and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Fifteen per cent of non-profits experienced those problems constantly or regularly. Smaller organisations were more likely to face banking barriers, the report found. Major western banks have pulled out of certain lines of business or parts of the world because they fear violating tighter US regulations, a trend referred to as "de-risking". Those hit hardest include charities, money remittance services, and even entire regions. The most common problems charities face include delayed wire transfers, sometimes stretching into weeks, requests for more documentation, and higher fees, the survey found. Some non-profits see their accounts closed or banks refuse to open accounts for them in the first place. Non-profits are forced to use riskier ways to move money, including carrying cash, the report said. The Swasia Charity Foundation has had problems accessing banking services ever since it was founded in New Jersey in 2012 to provide aid to Syrians affected by the civil war, Rami Bitar, a board member, said in an interview. In 2014, Bank of America Corp blocked a transfer for about $US35,000 ($A45,822) because Swasia's treasurer mentioned the money was destined for an education program in a Syrian village. The bank asked for more information and in the end did not complete the transfer, Bitar said. The same year, JPMorgan Chase & Co gave the group two months' notice before it closed its account, Bitar said. "We did not inquire about why or whether they can do it or not," Bitar said. "We assumed the reason behind it is that we are a charity for the Syrian people and simply that was it." Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase declined to comment. Critics say the US government is primarily concerned with stopping terrorist financing, an approach they argue drives transactions outside the formal financial system and makes it harder to track illicit activity. "They want the bad guys out and that's the only thing they're set up to do," said Scott Paul, senior humanitarian policy adviser at Oxfam America. A State Department official said the US government's interests are served by charities being allowed to do their work, but that priority competes with that of protecting the global financial system from abuse. "It's not like there are great solutions that are leaping forward that are being ignored by anyone," said the official, on condition of anonymity. The Treasury Department declined to comment.

By Nicole Rojas February 13, 2017 23:27 GMT Close Co-op bank up for sale after turnaround stalled IBTimesUK/Wochit US markets continued to advance on Monday (13 February), with the three major indices reaching record finishes for a third straight session. Stocks were propelled by gains in the financial and industrial sector. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 142.79 points, or 0.7%, to settle at 20,412.16. Goldman Sachs, which advanced 1.46%, contributed the most gains to the blue-chips gauge. JP Morgan Chase & Co and Caterpillar Inc, which rose 1.3% and 2.3% respectively, also contributed gains to the Dow. According to CNBC, the Dow posted its 22nd record close since the US presidential election on 8 November. The S&P 500 gained 12.15 points, or 0.5%, to close at 2,328.25. Financials rose more than 1% to lead gains in the S&P 500, which recorded its 14th record close since the election. CNBC reported that the S&P also reached $20 trillion in market cap for the first time. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 29.83 points, or 0.5%, to end at 5,763.96. Apple, which rose 0.9% to close at a record of $133.29, contributed to gains on the tech-heavy index. "Even though we have social unrest and building geopolitical tensions, the market refuses to fall in any meaningful fashion, which means there remains a very strong underlying bid in the market," Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments, told MarketWatch. "This is due to a confluence of a few factors, including the earnings recession being over, a very strong bull market, and the hope for future prosperity under the pro-growth policies of the new administration." Traders work the New York Stock Exchange floorGetty US stocks have been on an upward trend following President Donald Trump's election victory but received an extra boost earlier in February when the president hinted he would announce a tax plan soon. "The combination of proposed regulatory and tax reform, and stronger than expected earnings amplified by growing consumer sentiment that President Trump will accomplish a large portion of his agenda, has permitted stock to rise to valuations not experienced since 2004," said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management Inc. There was no major economic data delivered on Monday (13 February), but Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is expected to give testimony on Capitol Hill on Tuesday (14 February). US Treasurys traded lower, with the benchmark 10-year yield around 2.431% and the short-term two-year yield by 1.19%. The ICE US Dollar Index inched up 0.17% against a number of currencies, with the euro around $1.0604 and the yen around 113.61, according to CNBC.

Ware   |   Feb. 13, 2017 at 6:09 PM Follow @upi Comments | License Photo Feb. 13 (UPI) -- The major U.S. blue chip stock index closed trading Monday in record territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 143 points to finish at 20,412.16, a new all-time high. The S&P 500 also inched up 12 points to close at 2,328.25, close to a record, and the Nasdaq rose 30 points to 5,763.96. The Dow, which closed above the 20,000-point mark for the first time on Jan. 25, is now almost halfway to 21,000. Shares of JPMorgan Chase and Caterpillar were the Dow's biggest movers Monday. Shares of Apple Inc. also reached a record close of $133.29. RELATEDFacing multiple pressures, oil prices move lower The S&P also reached a value of $20 trillion for the first time in its history on Monday. Strong momentum from last week carried into Monday as the post-election surge continues. Last week, President Donald Trump pledged a "phenomenal" tax plan would be announced in the coming weeks. "The markets have been giving the new president the benefit of the doubt, believing he will make the economy great again," Paul Nolte, analyst at Kingsview Asset Management, told The Street. "Of course, any tax plan must make its way through Congress and is not likely to be passed until later in 2017, meaning any benefits are not likely to be seen until 2018."

REUTERS/Charles Platiau (Copyright Reuters 2017) Apple Inc.'s shares reached their highest closing level ever Monday, as investors bet that the 10th-anniversary iPhone expected later this year will return the world's most valuable company to renewed momentum after its worst stumble in years.  Continue Reading Below The stock closed at $133.29, topping the prior record close of $133 set in February 2015. The all-time intraday trading high for Apple shares is $134.54, also reached in 2015.  That puts Apple's market value at about $700 billion, which is more than $120 billion ahead of the No. 2 company, Google parent Alphabet Inc. -- which not long ago was challenging Apple for the top spot -- and beyond the values of Exxon Mobil Corp. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. combined.  Major investors, including Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., poured into Apple stock when the share price dipped last year, a period when Apple reported three straight quarters of profit and revenue declines. Since then, a combination of a new iPhone, improved sales in China and surging sales of apps and streaming music subscriptions have buoyed the stock, investors and analysts said.  Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook helped bolster investor confidence last month with the announcement of an ambitious goal to double the company's $24.35 billion services business by 2021. He also expressed optimism that tax reform later this year would enable Apple to bring home cash held overseas, which could be used for mergers and acquisitions.  Still, the biggest driver of investors' renewed enthusiasm is the iPhone, which is both Apple's blessing and its curse. One of the most successful consumer products in history, the device is on track to top $980 billion in sales in the decade since it hit the market.  Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT The iPhone is now so huge that it propels Apple, accounting for two-thirds of sales and three-fourths of operating profit -- and leading to gyrations in the company's stock price alongside investors' changing views of each new model's prospects for success.  "Apple is really an iPhone business," said Sean Stannard-Stockton, chief investment officer at Ensemble Capital Management, a Burlingame, Calif., wealth-management firm with $500 million in assets; it counts Apple among its largest holdings. He added, "The next [iPhone] cycle should be strong."  The speculative frenzy that always precedes a new iPhone has been supercharged in anticipation of the 10th-anniversary release expected later this year. Analysts in research reports have predicted the phone will be one of Apple's most revolutionary, with some suggesting it will come in three sizes instead of the usual two, with a case made almost entirely of glass and possibly wireless-charging capability.  At least one of the anniversary phones is expected to have an OLED screen, technology that would make the device thinner and lighter. The display, on top of its being an anniversary edition, has led to speculation that Apple could charge record prices for it, said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with UBS.  Apple is extraordinarily secretive about its plans, making it difficult for analysts and investors to know what to expect -- and adding risk for anyone betting that the new phone will be a hit. Even the prospective name is debated: some analysts saying Apple will call it the iPhone 8; others suggest it will be the iPhone X. Apple declined to comment.  Apple has struggled with intensifying smartphone competition over the past couple of years. In China, the world's largest smartphone market, rivals have cut into Apple's market share with cheaper phones offering comparable technology. Samsung Electronics Co. and Google have added pressure with new, higher-priced devices.  The iPhone 7, launched in September, hasn't led to the kind of sales jumps Apple recorded with previous new models, but it has helped rekindle enthusiasm. It was the best-selling smartphone in China, according to Kantar Worldpanel, helping stabilize Apple's revenue there after three quarters of declines. That gave investors "increased comfort that China is not falling off a cliff," said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer of concentrated U.S. growth at AllianceBernstein Holding LP.  Since the first iPhone was unveiled, Apple shares have gained a median of 4.3% between the announcement of a new model and when it started selling, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The iPhone 7 extended that streak, surging 11% in the first full week after its unveiling. Apple reported in January that the new device helped deliver record shipments for the three months ended in December and helped boost total revenue in the quarter by 3% to a record $78.4 billion.  Apple has more going for it than smartphones. Its highly profitable services business, which includes sales of apps and streaming music, increased revenue 18% to $7.2 billion during the December quarter, making it bigger than many large companies. Apple also is holding $230.2 billion in cash overseas that it plans to bring back to the U.S. if there's tax reform -- a prospect that has raised hopes of stock buybacks, dividends and even an acquisition, Mr. Stannard-Stockton said.  But what Apple hasn't done is replicate its iPhone success with other products -- and that raises questions about its future. The company hasn't introduced a game-changing product since the iPad in 2011. The Apple Watch, introduced in 2015, hasn't been a breakout success, and its wireless Airpod earbuds are in their infancy.  "The iPhone as a form factor will sometime disappear," said Mr. Stannard-Stockton. "Can they produce entirely new form factors and devices?"  Still, Apple shares actually are relatively inexpensive, even after the recent run-up. They are trading at roughly 16 times the past 12 months of earnings, compared with prices averaging about 23 times earnings for other tech stocks in the S&P 500 -- and below Apple's 10-year average of 21 times earnings, according to FactSet.  "It's gone from a growth stock that was largely overvalued to a value stock," said Jack Brown of Aviance Capital Partners LLC, a Naples, Fla., investment firm that counts Apple among its largest holdings in both its growth-strategy and value-strategy portfolios.  And in some ways, the iPhone's lackluster performance over the past year or so has laid the foundation for more growth. There are now more than 600 million iPhones world-wide, and many of the phones in circulation are iPhone 6 models, suggesting Apple could benefit from a swell of upgrades in coming years. An estimated 85% to 90% of those iPhone users will buy another iPhone when they upgrade, according to UBS.  "What happened with the last quarter is people discovered there's a replacement need for these phones," said Michael Harkins, a partner at Levy, Harkins & Co., a New York investment advisory that counts Apple among its holdings. "They wear out and that's not changing any time soon."  What do you think? Click the button below to comment on this article.

JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon, 60, bought £21million of shares early last year when prices were low. He claimed the decision was made on a whim one morning. But as markets rocketed following the election of US President Trump, the Wall Street lender's share price rose with them.

Blankfein owned 2.3m shares in his bank a year ago and their value has jumped from £285million to £442million. Banks have soared since the election of Trump, on hopes that the new president will ease regulation. Former Goldman president Gary Cohn, who unlocked £227million of investments through the Wall Street bank when he left to join the Trump administration, has said: 'We're not going to burden the banks with literally hundreds of billions of dollars of regulatory costs every year.'

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Apple shares cruised to a record-high close Monday, helping catapult the S&P 500 stock index over the $20 trillion mark in what amounts to a victory for plain-vanilla mutual funds over a bevy of hedge fund managers who recently backed away from the iPhone maker. The largest component of the S&P 500 and a core holding on Wall Street, Apple's stock climbed 0.9 percent to end at $133.29, above its record high close of $133.00 hit on Feb. 23, 2015 and giving it a market value of about $699 billion. Its increase helped balloon the S&P 500's .SPX market capitalization on Monday beyond $20 trillion for the first time. While mutual funds have largely bet on Apple in recent months, some big names missed out on all or part of its recent acceleration. Hedge fund manager Dan Loeb's Third Point LLC cut its stake in Apple by 26 percent to 1.9 million shares in the fourth quarter, according to regulatory filings, while George Soros and Carl Icahn also shed their Apple shares last year. In contrast, the number of mutual funds reporting they became Apple shareholders in recent quarterly filings has jumped by 187 percent to 287, while the number of mutual funds liquidating their Apple holdings dropped by 26 percent to 151, according to Morningstar. Among the big names who backed the stock, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway last August said it had increased its stake in Apple by 55 percent to 15 million shares, now worth $2 billion. David Einhorn's hedge fund Greenlight Capital in January said it still likes Apple. Apple has climbed 50 percent from lows in the first half of last year and is up 15 percent so far in 2017. It was still short of its all-time intraday high of $134.54, set on April 28, 2015. Monday's gain came after Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski raised her price target for Apple to $150. She said she is more confident that an upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone will feature augmented-reality technology, which could help boost demand in a saturated smartphone market. Many investors are betting that Apple will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary with a dramatically improved model. They also believe that strong sales of the iPhone 6S two years ago have left a larger-than-normal base of customers ready to upgrade. The Cupertino, California company reported strong December-quarter results on Jan. 31, and although it gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter, Wall Street expects revenue to grow this year after sinking nearly 8 percent in fiscal 2016. In 1998, when the S&P 500 closed above $10 trillion for the first time, Apple accounted for just under 0.06 percent of the index. It now accounts for about 3.5 percent of the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The 721 days that have passed since Apple's previous record-high close represent the largest gap between such milestones since the iPhone's launch in 2007. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

Keris Alison Lahiff Feb 13, 2017 4:06 PM EST The good vibes that carried Wall Street to new records last week lingered on into Monday's session, pushing indexes to close at new highs for their third day in a row. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.70% to close at a record 20,412. The S&P 500 finished up 0.52% to close at 2,328. The Nasdaq also added 0.52%, ending the day at 5,763. The S&P 500 reached $20 trillion in value for the first time on Monday. The best gainers on the Dow were Caterpillar (CAT) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) . Apple (AAPL) rode nearly 1% on market momentum to close at a record $133.29 on Monday. The stock was on a tear after UBS analysts noted that its services business was currently undervalued. UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said on Monday that Apple's shares would be at least 10% higher if its services arm was valued like PayPal's businesses. The new record snapped the old one set in February 2015.   Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

Wall Street rallied to new heights last week as Donald Trump made vague promises of tax reform, hopes for which had given markets a big boost in the two months after the U.S. election in November. Trump said he would deliver a tax reform plan in the near future. The president on Thursday, in a meeting with airline and airport executives, said that lowering the overall tax burden on American businesses was important, adding, "We're going to announce something I would say over the next two or three weeks that will be phenomenal in terms of tax." "The markets have been giving the new president the benefit of the doubt, believing he will make the economy great again," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management. "Of course, any tax plan must make its way through Congress and is not likely to be passed until later in 2017, meaning any benefits are not likely to be seen until 2018 ... Some very high expectations with little certainty of the outcome may make the markets vulnerable to disappointment." Markets initially rallied following Trump's surprise victory in November as investors hoped for infrastructure spending, tax cuts, and loosened financial regulations. However, the Trump rally hit the skids following his January inauguration as geopolitical uncertainty, particularly in the wake of a controversial and unconstitutional travel ban, made for market waves. The travel ban, which affected seven Muslim-majority nations, was deemed unconstitutional last week by judges in the 9th Circuit. On Friday, all three major U.S. stock indexes closed at records for their second day in a row. The Nasdaq ended with its fourth straight closing record on Friday. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Trump met in Washington on Monday for the first time since Trump took office. In a post-meeting press conference, Trudeau said "Canada and the U.S. will always be each other's most essential partners." Trump also noted that the two countries have "some wonderful ideas on immigration." Trump-branded products continue to face the brunt of a largely divisive election campaign. Sears (SHLD) and Kmart announced they would drop 31 Trump Home lines due to weak profitability, following in Nordstrom's (JWN) footsteps. Nordstrom recently dropped Ivanka Trump's fashion line after a 32% slump in sales in the last fiscal year. Basic materials stocks were among the best performers on Monday. Chemours (CC) led the way after agreeing to split the $335.4 million settlement in personal-injury lawsuits with former parent DuPont (DD) . Lawsuits were tied to toxic chemicals in a West Virginian plant. Other materials stocks such as Rio Tinto (RIO) and Vale (VALE) were also higher. Verizon (VZ) , the largest wireless provider in the U.S., will begin offering plans with unlimited data starting Monday. Other telecoms including Sprint (S) had been gaining ground on the competitor with their own unlimited data plans. The stock fell, while AT&T (T) , Sprint, and T-Mobile (TMUS) also logged losses. Allergan (AGN) rose after agreeing to acquire Zeltiq Aesthetics (ZLTQ) , a company specializing in fat-reduction technology, in a deal worth $2.475 billion. The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of this year. Shares of Zeltiq rose 12.9%. Allergan is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

Promotional activity is increasing and it will likely take longer for a turnaround at Pottery Barn, Telsey said. Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) climbed 5% on Monday after reaffirming its fiscal 2017 guidance. The drugmaker anticipates full-year revenue between $23.8 billion and $24.5 billion and adjusted earnings of $4.90 to $5.30 a share. Crude oil prices returned to session lows on Monday morning despite proof Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries largely kept to a production cut agreement that went into effect in January. OPEC members and 11 other countries agreed to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day in an agreement reached in November. OPEC said Monday that countries reduced their output by 890,000 barrels a day in January, a 74% compliance rate. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 1.7% to $52.93 a barrel on Monday. Gold logged its worst daily loss in two-and-a-half weeks as Wall Street money flooded into equities. Safe-haven assets tend to perform poorly when riskier assets such as equities are on the upswing.

NEW DELHI: GIC of Singapore is set to enter into exclusive bilateral negotiations with KP Singh and his family, the promoters of India’s largest real estate firm DLF Limited, to acquire their 40% stake in DLF Cyber City Developers Limited (DCCDL), the company that owns a portfolio of leased commercial assets, including the entire Cyber City complex in Gurgaon. The deal will help the promoters raise about Rs 12,000 crore, valuing the rental arm at nearly Rs 40,000 crore, inclusive of its Rs 10,000-11,000 crore debt, said two persons familiar with the negotiations. The promoters plan to use most of these funds in subscribing to a Rs 10,000-crore preferential issue of DLF Limited, which in turn will use this money to retire a portion of its debt. “The agreement is likely to be signed soon,” said one of the persons quoted above. The balance 60% in DCCDL is owned by DLF Limited. A DLF spokesperson declined to comment. “We do not wish to comment on speculation. We are in our silent period as our quarterly results are scheduled for February 14,” said the spokesperson. GIC did not respond to queries. Last year, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan were mandated by DLF to help monetise their stake in an effort to deleverage their balance sheet. GIC, which already has close relationship with DLF, trumped Blackstone and a consortium of sovereign wealth funds from Abu Dhabi and Qatar, added officials in the know. Close to 15 suitors had expressed initial interests to partner DLF. DCCDL operates 27 million square feet of commercial property assets that are already leased and earning rent of Rs 2,250 crore as of March 31, 2016. It also has 20 million sq ft of future development potential. The proposed transaction will reduce DLF Ltd’s debt in a two-step transaction. The promoters will pump Rs 10,000 crore into India’s largest real estate developer by purchasing shares in a preferential issue with funds raised from the sale of their stake in the company’s rental unit. In addition, the real estate firm plans to raise about Rs 3,000 crore from institutional investors. From these two transactions, the company will raise about Rs 13,000 crore, and this money will be used to retire a portion of DLF Ltd’s standalone debt. In addition, DCCDL owes Rs 11,000 crore to its lenders. As it will continue to be 60% owned by DLF Ltd, its debt will remain in the parent company’s books. “DLF has been running operational cash flow deficit of Rs 5-6 billion (Rs 500-600 crore) per quarter due to slowdown in sales and continued construction spend (Rs 6.5-7 billion per quarter). With sales expected to remain muted, the company does not expect the gap to close in coming quarters. Closure of DCCDL transaction would help close that gap," wrote analysts from Axis Securities in a report in December. DLF shares fell 0.07%, or 10 paise, to close at Rs 147.7 50 on the BSE on Monday.

Cruz was released by the New York Giants on Monday. The good news is that he's been careful about his money since the start of his career. He may not be heading into retirement any time soon, but the wide receiver has been planning for it so that he won't end up broke, the way other players do. It all started with his first NFL paycheck in 2010. "Oh man. I remember holding it up into the light and making sure it was real. Kind of hiding it like is everybody else seeing this?" Cruz said. "It was definitely a moment where I knew things were different and where I had to take care of this and make sure I make this forever and ever and ever and not just short-term." Cruz's first NFL contract was with the Giants -- it was for three years and was worth $1.215 million. In 2013, he signed a five-year contract worth $43 million. His release by the Giants Monday came ahead of a $1 million roster bonus he was supposed to get on March 11. Early on, he was advised by New York Giants' staffer Charles Way to keep track of his money. "He was like, 'Man, make sure you understand what your money is doing and understand what's happening with your money. Don't just give it to some accountant and just let him do whatever he wants with it.'" Related: Inside the world of women's tackle football As part of his effort to be financially secure once his days playing -- and dancing -- are over, Cruz teamed up with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which manages his money. Cruz has been a partner with the bank for five years now. "They teach me to be conscious of how I spend my money and to plan for the long term, not just what I see in front me," he said. "That's sometimes easier said than done." The biggest thing he's learned? "Save as much as you can." "What you do with your finances, everything is calculated. You have to make concise and precise moves with your money and not be careless with it and I think football is the same way," Cruz said. "You have to understand what you're doing [in] practice so that when game time comes, you know what you're doing and you're just playing as opposed to just reacting." Cruz said he thinks many retired players get into financial trouble because they aren't informed. "They weren't knowledgeable about what their money was doing," he said. "[Things] can add up and next thing you know, you're in debt and you're in the hole and you have to struggle a little bit and live paycheck to paycheck." Related: Millionaire NBA player isn't only guy living with his parents When Cruz eventually does leave the NFL, he wants to work with kids and teach them about financial literacy and saving. After attending the White House Science Fair in 2012, he launched the Victor Cruz Foundation to help expose inner-city students to STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and math. "Once I attended the White House Science Fair, it just kind of hit me," he said. The program started at the Boys and Girls Club in Paterson, New Jersey, where he went as a kid, and Cruz hopes it will expand. President Obama's administration started the White House Science Fair in 2010. It's unclear whether President Trump will put the same priority on STEM initiatives. "It's a time where you don't know what's going to happen," Cruz said. "We'll see if there even is a science fair ... but obviously, full support from the White House would be great and beneficial."

Cruz isn't retiring any time soon, but he wants to make sure that when he does he won't end up broke, the way other players have. So the wide receiver has been planning ever since he got his first... By Ahiza Garcia NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Victor Cruz doesn't want to end up being a statistic. Cruz was released by the New York Giants on Monday. The good news is that he's been careful about his money since the start of his career. He may not be heading into retirement any time soon, but the wide receiver has been planning for it so that he won't end up broke, the way other players do. It all started with his first NFL paycheck in 2010. "Oh man. I remember holding it up into the light and making sure it was real. Kind of hiding it like is everybody else seeing this?" Cruz said. "It was definitely a moment where I knew things were different and where I had to take care of this and make sure I make this forever and ever and ever and not just short-term." Cruz's first NFL contract was with the Giants -- it was for three years and was worth $1.215 million. In 2013, he signed a five-year contract worth $43 million. His release by the Giants Monday came ahead of a $1 million roster bonus he was supposed to get on March 11. Early on, he was advised by New York Giants' staffer Charles Way to keep track of his money. "He was like, 'Man, make sure you understand what your money is doing and understand what's happening with your money. Don't just give it to some accountant and just let him do whatever he wants with it.'" As part of his effort to be financially secure once his days playing -- and dancing -- are over, Cruz teamed up with JPMorgan Chase, which manages his money. Cruz has been a partner with the bank for five years now. "They teach me to be conscious of how I spend my money and to plan for the long term, not just what I see in front me," he said. "That's sometimes easier said than done." The biggest thing he's learned? "Save as much as you can." "What you do with your finances, everything is calculated. You have to make concise and precise moves with your money and not be careless with it and I think football is the same way," Cruz said. "You have to understand what you're doing [in] practice so that when game time comes, you know what you're doing and you're just playing as opposed to just reacting." Cruz said he thinks many retired players get into financial trouble because they aren't informed. "They weren't knowledgeable about what their money was doing," he said. "[Things] can add up and next thing you know, you're in debt and you're in the hole and you have to struggle a little bit and live paycheck to paycheck." When Cruz eventually does leave the NFL, he wants to work with kids and teach them about financial literacy and saving. After attending the White House Science Fair in 2012, he launched the Victor Cruz Foundation to help expose inner-city students to STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and math. "Once I attended the White House Science Fair, it just kind of hit me," he said. The program started at the Boys and Girls Club in Paterson, New Jersey, where he went as a kid, and Cruz hopes it will expand. President Obama's administration started the White House Science Fair in 2010. It's unclear whether President Trump will put the same priority on STEM initiatives. "It's a time where you don't know what's going to happen," Cruz said. "We'll see if there even is a science fair ... but obviously, full support from the White House would be great and beneficial."

Now, almost a decade removed from those dark days, I can't recall seeing a single Wall Street banker take the perp walk for any of this financial debauchery. Only one trader at a second-tier bank, Credit Suisse, was busted for inflating the value of some mortgage-backed bonds and was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison. And that's about it. So whazzup with that? It is true that the U.S. Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators extracted some serious money from the wallets of big banks following the crisis — about $200 billion in fines and settlements. But that money mostly came out of corporate coffers. We law-abiding, hardworking little people would have preferred seeing a few hundred fat-cat bankers from the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and the now defunct Lehman Brothers Inc. busting rocks in prison. Initially, my take on this was that federal prosecutors lacked the will to criminally prosecute these cases because they were too complicated, too expensive and took too long to resolve. Just the phrase alone — mortgage-backed securities — would put most jurors into a coma of boredom. Others of a more cynical bent have proffered that Wall Street bankers are so rich, powerful and politically connected that government gendarmes dare not enter their corporate lairs. I suppose either of those explanations can partly account for the lack of criminal prosecutions in the wake of one of the worst financial crises ever. But those explanations are far too simplistic and don't bring any new insight into to this sordid affair. Actually, the fault lies within us, or more specifically, within the legal and corporate systems we created over the last 200 years, according to Samuel Buell, author of a new book, Capital Offenses. Buell, who brings considerable street cred to this topic as the government's lead prosecutor in the Enron case, explains that the essence of a corporation — its mission and reason to exist — is to reduce individual responsibility. "That's not a byproduct or regrettable cost of organizing our economic lives around the corporation," he writes. "It's the purpose of doing so. People lacked efficient and effective means to share capital while managing personal risks. The corporation solved this problem." 150 years of precedent This legal principle of "limited liability" allowed people to start businesses, and if the venture went south, they lost only the money they invested, not everything they owned. And this idea has worked fairly well for 150 years. The problem, however, is that this same corporate structure, with layers of supervision and diffused responsibility, also protects executives when they commit crimes. And that notion feeds directly into a second obstacle to prosecuting corporate wrongdoing. One of the foundations of our criminal justice system is that to be convicted of a serious criminal offense defendants must have intended to do harm. "In the complicated arena of financing the activities of large corporations, in which our economic system has deliberately licensed creativity and risk taking, an executive's claim that he believed in good faith that he was following the rules presents a severe, even disabling, obstacle to prosecution," Buell writes. Prosecutors must prove that a sophisticated banker's intent in selling, say, mortgage-backed securities to a similarly positioned and sophisticated Deutsche Bank trader was to deceive. It is this proof that distinguishes "the criminal deal from the merely aggressive, or even stupidly aggressive, one," Buell writes. Often executives rely on the opinions of their accountants and auditors, which makes it difficult for prosecutors to prove criminal intent. Clear-cut and provable accounting frauds like the ones committed by Enron and WorldCom executives — who knew what was going on — led to imprisonment, but those are exceptions. Finally, business fraud involves deception, but Buell points out that deception occurs within context. In other words, we all but expect used car salespeople at U-Tote-the-Note dealership to lie to us. It's caveat emptor — buyer beware — but we don't expect such shady practices when we visit, say, our physician. Business practices become criminal fraud "only if the norms of the particular market make that behavior wrong," according to Buell. Do we as a society really want to put a hotshot Goldman Sachs banker in prison for unloading a tranche of risky mortgage securities to an equally sly Deutsche Bank trader? "The most serious obstacle to fraud prosecutions was the nature of the market for mortgage derivatives," Buell writes. "[This] was a meeting place for some of the world's most sophisticated and risk-hungry buyers and sellers." We as a society may want to throw a few more people in prison, but that won't lessen corporate fraud. Change will come only if we change what we as a society created — limited liability for corporations and the people who run them. "To preside over a company when it fails is not a crime," Buell writes. "Indeed, bankruptcy law and limited liability for corporations are two ways modern legal systems embrace business risks."

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Updated at 4:55 p.m. NEW YORK • Stocks around the world continued their march higher on Monday, and U.S. indexes again hit new highs. Strong gains for Citigroup and other financial stocks helped the Standard & Poor's 500 index rise 12.15 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,328.25. It's the third straight day the index has set a record. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 142.79, or 0.7 percent, to 20,412.16. The Nasdaq composite climbed 29.83, or 0.5 percent, to 5,763.96. Earlier in the day, markets rose across Europe and Asia. Stocks have resumed their rally in recent days after stalling for a couple weeks. Stronger-than-expected profit reports from companies, continued improvement in the U.S. economy and expectations for business-friendly policies from Washington have helped propel the market. With no major economic reports or other big news on Monday, stocks continued to follow the path of least resistance, analysts say. "The market's got such good momentum now that it's going to continue until something slows it down," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. "There's really not any negative catalyst right now." The S&P 500 has climbed five straight days and is up 8.8 percent since Donald Trump won the White House in November. Companies whose profits are most dependent on the strength of the economy were some of Monday's biggest gainers. Financial stocks in the S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent, the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the index. Industrials rose 1 percent. Roughly three stocks rose for every two that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. The biggest stock in the S&P 500, Apple, is also at a record closing high. It rose $1.17, or 0.9 percent, to close at $133.29. The iPhone maker's performance carries extra weight for many 401(k) accounts because of its status as the biggest publicly traded company in the world. It alone accounts for about 3.5 percent of S&P 500 index fund investments. Chemical company Chemours jumped $4.01, or 14.3 percent, to $32.14 after it announced an agreement with DuPont to jointly pay $670.7 million to settle roughly 3,500 personal-injury claims related to the release of perfluorooctanoic acid from a West Virginia plant. DuPont rose 99 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $77.82. Zeltiq Aesthetics jumped $6.53, or 13.2 percent, to $55.93 after Allergan said it would buy the company, whose CoolSculpting system helps people reduce bulges of fat. Allergan, which sells Botox, agreed to pay $56.50 per share for Zeltiq. The only sector in the S&P 500 to fall on Monday was telecoms, which sank on worries that more pricing wars may be on the way. Verizon unveiled an unlimited-data plan for its customers, and its stock dropped 43 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $48.55. Competitors fell more.

Jury selection is set to begin in Manhattan federal court in the case of Yuri Lebedev, who authorities call the architect of bitcoin exchange Coin.mx's electronic platform, and Trevon Gross, a pastor and ex-chairman of a now-defunct credit union. Prosecutors contend Lebedev schemed to deceive financial institutions into processing transactions for the unlicensed Coin.mx. They say he also participated in bribing Gross to gain control over the credit union to facilitate the virtual currency business. Both men have pleaded not guilty. Eric Creizman, Lebedev's lawyer, said he was "looking forward to his day in court". Gross' attorneys did not respond to requests for comment. They are among nine people who have faced charges following an investigation connected to a breach JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 that exposed more than 83 million accounts. Gross, 52, and Lebedev, 39, were not accused of hacking. But they came under scrutiny in connection with Coin.mx, which authorities said was operated by Anthony Murgio, who attended Florida State University with Lebedev, and was owned by an Israeli behind the JPMorgan breach, Gery Shalon. Prosecutors say Shalon, together with Maryland-born Joshua Samuel Aaron, orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million peoples' information. Prosecutors said they carried out the cyber crimes to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with promotional emails. Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors said Coin.mx operated through a front called "Collectables Club" to trick financial institutions into believing it was a memorabilia club while it converted, with no license, millions of dollars into bitcoin. To further evade scrutiny, in 2014, Murgio, with Lebedev's help, tried to take over Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, which was linked to HOPE Cathedral. To do so, they and others paid US$150,000 (RM667,275) in bribes via the church to Gross, its pastor, in exchange for facilitating Murgio's takeover and arranging for Lebedev and others to be put on the credit union's board, prosecutors said. Gross' lawyers deny he was lining his pockets with what they call a church donation and say Collectables Club victimised the board. Federal regulators took the credit union into conservatorship in 2015. Murgio pleaded guilty in January. — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested ‘League of Legends’ adds practice mode Brazil judge rules Uber drivers are employees, deserve benefits Carpool and save with GrabShare Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts Spotify expands with World Trade Centre move Gartner: Spend your limited IT budget wisely Others Also Read Ensuring a clean and safe Thaipusam Butterworth Art Walk in alley aimed at getting visitors to stop and ponder Najib: New KL ATCC will enable improved air traffic control facilities advertisement Latest News Carpool and save with GrabShare Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Pokémon Go: The universe expands Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: The universe expands Nokia 3310 on the comeback trail: report Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Stand up to cancer Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple: study Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Of the 1,013 funds examined, 165 performed as "potential closet index funds" between the period from 2009 – 2014, according to the research by Better Finance, details of which were first published in the Financial Times on Sunday. The investigation followed on from the results of an investigation announced by the regional watchdog, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), in March 2016 which alleged that up to 15 percent of equity funds across the continent could be potential closet indexers. However, the regulatory body refused to name the funds concerned, prompting Better Finance to attempt to replicate the inquiry. The advocacy group used identical parameters to ESMA to determine the "potential" closet trackers, namely whether funds had less than 60 percent active share and 4 percent tracking error. The first measure evaluates how differently a portfolio's holdings differ from the benchmark's while the second measure looks at the difference in returns. Guillaume Prache, managing director at Better Finance, told CNBC on Monday that the key goal was to exactly replicate the study and disclose all the funds analyzed to avoid "leaving fund investors in the dark." He confirmed that so far none of the funds investigated had engaged with Better Finance on the results but "we welcome any additional disclosures and analyses that can better inform fund investors about closet indexing." Among the names, behemoths with many billions of investor dollars under management including Amundi, Fidelity International, Henderson, JPMorgan Asset Management (JPMAM) and Schroders, who offered varied responses to enquiries from CNBC on Monday. Schroders questioned the accuracy of the data and encouraged investors to use a broader set of measures to assess the level of active management, as well as examine fund performance on the longer-term basis towards which they are geared. JPMAM described active share as a "useful, if one dimensional" risk measure and highlighted the index outperformance of their equity funds listed in the report over three and five year periods. Fidelity noted that the average active share of its fund range is 74.3 percent, "significantly above the 60 percent threshold, which we believe is highly active for the considerable size and array of assets we run," and concurred with Schroders and JPMAM's arguments that a broader set of factors should be assessed. Furthermore, the spokesperson from Fidelity added, "The data used to compile the list is looking at the period from 2009-2014. This would include the period immediately after the financial crises and an industry-wide pullback in investor risk appetite. With liquidity a prime concern, small-cap positions were cut back with the effect of reducing active share levels. It is also important to note that 95 percent of the assets in the funds listed are held by institutional or professional investors looking for specialist access to thematic or niche sector specific investments. These types of funds often use large-cap indices and invest in smaller number of companies, resulting in a lower active share." Both Henderson and Amundi declined to comment. 'Third wave' for the industry The revelations increase the pressure on the active management industry at a time when the bleed of investor money out of its funds and into passive continues apace. While passive assets under management increased by 18 percent in 2016, actively managed assets only edged up by 4 percent, according to data from Morningstar. Which is why now is the time for a "third wave" of the fund management industry, asserted David Stubbs, Global Markets Strategist at JPMAM, speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Monday. "Now you have the retaliation against passive ... In my view active managers such as our own have developed active funds that aim to beat passive, I call them passive killers," explained Stubbs. Jose Luis Pelaez | Blend Images | Getty Images The "passive killers" are actively managed funds with an intentionally low active share but which charge lower fees than traditional active funds. They often aim to match sector and style characteristics to the benchmark but then seek to take lots of small "overweight" and "underweight" positions among the individual stock names with a goal of generating 50 – 100 basis points of outperformance (alpha in industry parlance) per year. "You're getting maybe 50, 60, 70 basis points a year but over 25 or 30 years as your core holding, that's real money," he argued. The appeal of these strategies relative to passive is that there is the expectation of outperformance. "Passive does the opposite, you get the benchmark minus the fee, you lock in underperformance with passive," he added. Despite many commentators describing the year ahead as one that could provide more opportunities for active managers to shine as the performance of individual stocks diverges more than in recent years given changing macro and market dynamics, Stubbs describes the advent of both passive funds and "passive killers" as a permanent change in asset managers' offerings. "I don't think that masks the change in the fund offering … Passive isn't going anywhere and nor should it." Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Government officials will travel to London, New York, Boston and Los Angeles between March 5 and March 12, said the person, asking not to be identified as the information is private. A sale could be completed by the end of March or early April, the person said. The country hired six banks including Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., and HSBC Holdings Plc as lead managers for the sale, people familiar with the matter said last month. Deutsche Bank AG, Standard Chartered Plc and NBK Capital were hired as advisers, they said. Kuwait is selling bonds as the country expects a budget deficit of 7.9 billion dinars ($26 billion) in 2017/18, compared with 9.7 billion dinars in 2016/17, according to deputy Prime Minister Anas Al Saleh. The government said in July it may raise as much as $10 billion from global debt markets. The country is rated AA at S&P Global Ratings, the third-highest investment grade. Ministry officials couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. Neighboring Gulf states including Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia raised more than $48 billion in sovereign bond sales last year -- the most since at least 2007 -- to finance their budget deficits, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bond sales in the Middle East and North Africa region more than doubled to nearly $80 billion in 2016, according to the data. Kuwaiti officials will visit investors in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore between February 12 and February 17, Al-Anba newspaper said last week, citing government sources.

The U.S.’s protectionism would create downward pressure on the dollar against funding currencies.” The yen tumbled in the initial response to the Trump-Abe meetings, where the two leaders delegated the task of overseeing economic dialogue to the vice president and deputy prime minister. Even so, Sasaki said he was “comfortable” with his call that the yen could climb past 100 by the end of 2017. Sasaki last year projected that Trump’s trade policies would prove bad for the dollar in much the same way as during the 1993-95 period during Bill Clinton’s administration. His forecast compares with a median yen target of 117 per dollar by the end of this year, a Bloomberg survey shows. While Trump last month said that Japan and China “play the money market, they play the devaluation market and we sit there like a bunch of dummies,” his meetings with Abe on Friday and Saturday focused on national security ties rather than economic issues. Exchange rates weren’t entirely absent from the gathering, however. The president in a joint news conference Friday with Abe, following a separate phone call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, said that the currencies of the U.S., China and Japan would soon be on “a level playing field.” Hugs and hand-holding characterized the bilateral meetings. “As far as the currency devaluations, I’ve been complaining about that for a long time — and I believe that we will all eventually and probably, very much sooner than a lot of people understand or think, we will be all at a level playing field,” Trump said without specifying how that would happen. The next day, five hours on a golf course in Florida underscored the personal rapport between the new U.S. leader and Abe. “Considering Trump’s remarks in the past, trade and currency policy-related discussions from here would not necessarily continue to be smooth and friendly,” Sasaki said. There is still the “possibility that the U.S. will continue to criticize weak yen going forward.” Keywords China, Shinzo Abe, U.S., yen, dollar, currencies, Donald Trump Related Trump and Abe hit it off during round on Florida golf course Economy Japan’s export-driven growth on shaky ground amid sluggish domestic demand Deja vu as currency traders forced to brush up on trade data skills Japan’s economy grew 1.0% in 2016 despite slower last quarter Trump trumpets ‘phenomenal’ tax announcement, divulges no specifics Mail the editor Error Report Republishing Commenting Policy The Japan Times ST The Japan Times on Sunday What's Trending Now Abe says Trump encouraged him to boost ties, dialogue with Putin The Japanese and love — more complicated than you think Apa under fire again, this time for anti-Semitic remarks Suit opens in Tokyo court over cervical cancer vaccine side effects Toshiba says it is now considering selling majority stake in flash memory spinoff U.S. believes Pyongyang agents killed Kim Jong Nam; Malaysia cops seek female pair who fled in cab Solid fuel believed used in North Korean missile, setting stage for mobile, stealthy arsenal Fired once by Obama, Flynn quit because he’d become ‘lightning rod’ over Russia ties: Conway Blogs Japan Pulse Yen for Living BACK TO TOP The Japan Times on Sunday The Japan Times ST Jobs Study in Japan JT for Women JT Bookclub Japanese School Directory Email Updates | Home Delivery RSS Twitter Facebook Newsletter News National World Business Asia Pacific Reference Columns Multimedia Opinion Editorials Commentary Reader Mail Cartoons Life Travel Digital Food & Drink Environment Style & Design Language Lifestyle People Columns Multimedia Community Voices Issues Our Lives Event Listings How-tos Columns Culture Film Music Art Stage Events Festivals Books TV Columns Multimedia Sports Baseball Soccer Basketball Sumo Rugby Figure Skating Tennis More Sports Columns Multimedia About us Contact us Privacy Policy Link Policy Reprints FAQs Support Press Sitemap Advertise The Japan Times LTD.

The market is doing better because business is better, both in the U.S. and overseas. Stocks now have different catalysts than they used to, which means investors need to react differently if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Instead of dumping stocks on a rate hike, Cramer said to buy them. "Business has momentum. This market is saying that momentum will not be broken up by three rate hikes, nor by the president, nor Congress. It is a rising tide that is lifting almost all of the boats, except those that did best under Obama," the "Mad Money" host said. There are new rules to follow now, Cramer said. He outlined everything that investors must unlearn, so that the market can continue to power higher. Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty Images Federal Reserve Board Chairwoman Janet Yellen speaks about the Federal Reserve's semiannual report during a hearing of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on Capitol Hill February 14, 2017 in Washington, DC. In the past decade, any time Fed Chair Janet Yellen spoke about raising interest rates, the market would plummet. Those days are now over, Cramer said. It is time to recognize that if the Fed tightens while business is doing better, it will not be a disastrous move, but instead be the validation that the market craves. Cramer also reminded investors that President Donald Trump is a pro-business president. While the stock market did rally under Obama, it was a different set of stocks. Now, it a completely different group stands to benefit, as stocks like Bank of America and JPMorgan continue to push higher. Bank stocks seem very cheap to Cramer versus the rest of the market. "They are only going to get cheaper if Trump's deregulation allows them to return capital at their own pace and not the pace of the government," Cramer said. The third rule to unlearn is that even though many investors think that stocks are undervalued, that doesn't mean it is the truth. When Cramer looked around the world, he saw that other markets are doing far better than the U.S. That is because their economies were even worse than the U.S. was to begin with. So, these three new stock market rules mean that it is time for investors to throw away their old playbook and get ready for a rate hike. Rates must go higher because there is more demand for money, which means banks will do well. And a president who is pro-business could ultimately mean good things for business, too, even if his approach is a bit unorthodox. Questions for Cramer?

Ironically, the main catalyst is President Trump's promises to undo safeguards put in place to prevent another meltdown. File- A photograph of the exterior of a Goldman Sachs building. By Matt Egan NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Goldman Sachs has finally recovered from the 2008 financial crisis. Ironically, the main catalyst is President Trump's promises to undo safeguards put in place to prevent another meltdown. Goldman Sachs stock closed on Tuesday at a new all-time high, taking out the prior record that was set in October 2007. Virtually all bank stocks have been on fire since Trump's victory in anticipating of lighter regulation, higher interest rates and faster growth. But Goldman Sachs has been particularly hot, surging an incredible 37% since the election. That's quadruple the S&P 500's post-election advance. Clearly, Goldman Sachs has already emerged as a big winner of Trump's pledge to "do a big number" on Dodd-Frank, the 2010 Wall Street reform law. "If you really think deregulation is coming and banks are going to be cut loose, who's going to win? It's going to be them. We've seen that time and again," said Michael Block, chief market strategist at Rhino Trading. Goldman's market value surged by $4 billion on the day that Trump signed an executive order beginning the process of rolling back Dodd-Frank. The irony is that Trump slammed Wall Street and Goldman Sachs during the campaign. He even used an image of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein during his closing campaign ad while condemning the "global power structure." But Trump has gone from criticizing Wall Street and Goldman Sachs to hiring Goldman veterans to help him govern. Trump's two biggest economic hires are Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner, and top economic adviser Gary Cohn, who stepped down in December as chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs. Analysts say those hires may actually be helping Goldman stock. "With so many Goldman Sachs alums in the administration, maybe some think that policies will skew in the bank's favor," said Michael Wong, a Morningstar analyst who covers Goldman Sachs. Wong cautioned that he doesn't think "anyone should make an investment thesis based on that." Mnuchin, who was confirmed on Monday as treasury secretary, is in favor of reforming the Volcker Rule, which prevents big banks like Goldman Sachs from making risky bets with their own money. Goldman's post-election surge can't really be explained by higher interest rates. Higher rates provide a bigger boost to the profits of consumer-focused lenders like Bank of America and Wells Fargo than investment banks like Goldman. "Higher interest rates is not playing that much into Goldman Sachs' valuation," said Wong. But Goldman Sachs would benefit from faster growth and increased CEO confidence that could spark a wave of lucrative M&A and IPO deals. Goldman shares have made a remarkable rebound from the 2008 crisis when many investors feared the complete collapse of the financial system. Goldman is up 380% since its low of $52 in November 2008. While JPMorgan Chase returned to its pre-crisis high in 2013, it wasn't until now for Goldman stock. Other big banks like Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are nowhere near their all-time highs. But is the Goldman rally overdone? After all, not even Trump is talking about completely repealing Dodd-Frank and efforts to water regulation down are running into resistance, including from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen. Wong thinks Goldman shares are "slightly overvalued" at this point. "They're pricing in a lot of perfection in terms of deregulation and the ability to take advantage of that," Block said.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images/AFP) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks pushed to fresh records again on Tuesday (Feb 14), with financial shares rallying after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signalled higher interest rates are on their way. All three major indices set records for the fourth straight session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 92.25 points (0.45 per cent) at 20,504.41. The broad-based S&P 500 gained 9.33 points (0.40 per cent) to close at 2,337.58, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 18.62 points (0.32 per cent) to 5,782.57. Yellen presented an upbeat view of the economy in her testimony to Congress, noting labour market conditions continue to improve and inflation is inching up to the Fed's two per cent target. She confirmed the next rate increase could come at any time, which leaves open the possibility of a move at the Mar 14-5 policy meeting. Bank of America jumped 3.1 per cent and JPMorgan Chase rose 1.6 per cent following the Yellen hearing. Banks typically prosper from interest rate increases. US stocks have been on a tear since President Donald Trump last week said he planned to unveil a tax-cut plan within the next two to three weeks. Consumers stocks were strong with Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot both gaining 1.0 per cent. Technology giant Apple won 1.3 per cent to finish at an all-time high. General Motors jumped 4.8 per cent after French car manufacturer PSA said it was considering an acquisition of Opel and Vauxhall, GM's loss-ridden European subsidiaries. GM confirmed the talks, cautioning that "there can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached." Health insurer Anthem fell 0.2 per cent after rival Cigna announced it was suing Anthem for billions of dollars in breakup and other fees after a US court blocked their proposed merger on antitrust grounds. Anthem said the suit was invalid and that it was committed to completing the merger. Cigna gained 0.8 per cent. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Alts Equities Fixed-Income New ETFs ETF Ecosystem Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel 2017 Outlook Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2017 → February → Active Equity ETFs to Target Opportunities, Limit Risks Active Equity ETFs to Target Opportunities, Limit Risks February 14, 2017 at 3:13 pm by Max Chen An actively managed exchange traded fund strategy may help investors access targeted opportunities while diminishing risk exposure in an extended bull run that has stretched valuations in many segments of the market. On the recent webcast (available on-demand for CE Credit), All-Star Manager Chris Davis Discusses His Top Ideas and New ETF Strategy, Christopher Davis, Chairman and Portfolio Manager of Davis Advisors, warned of the many unknowns that could weigh on an investor’s portfolio. For instance, real gross domestic product growth has varied widely from the average of professional forecasters. With the Federal Reserve eyeing interest rate normalization ahead, the markets have not showed a good track record in predicting the changes. Since 1982, the six month average forecasted direction of short-term interest rates were incorrect 64% of the time, compared to the actual direction of interest rates. Given the number of unknowns, Davis argued that investors should focus on the specifics and data that is readily available. For instance, investors can look to the price compared to value in U.S. markets or focus on leaders in non-U.S. markets. Opportunities can not be found in the average company in our current market environment. Instead, you have to be selective, Davis said. After a multi-year bull run, investors may be more at risk in traditional passive, index-based strategies. Passive funds have no valuation discipline and will overweight companies and sectors that have outperformed. On the other hand, Davis argued that active managers can find opportunities, even with markets at all time highs. For instance, global leaders that are trading at relatively cheap valuations, such as United Technologies and Johnson Controls. Other underappreciated companies that are undervalued, like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co and Visa. Areas of growth that could lead to tomorrow’s blue chips, including Google and Amazon. Lastly, national giants in emerging economies, such as Naspers. In a survey of financial advisors who attended the webcast, 58.5% of respondents revealed they expect active strategies to outperform in 2017. Given their outlook on potential opportunities, Davis Advisors has focused on the financial sector as a “triple play” opportunity, pointing to attractive earnings, multiples and buybacks/dividends. S&P 500 financial companies are currently trading at the greatest discount to the broader market, reflecting their cheap valuations. Additionally, banks and insurers are also paying out some of the lowest dividends, which leaves them more room to grow their payouts in the years ahead. In the same survey of financial advisors, 35.5% believed financials were undervalued while 43.9% said the sector is fairly valued. Davis Advisors’ preference for the financial sector is also reflected in their recently launched active Davis Select U.S. Equity ETF (NasdaqGM: DUSA), Davis Select Financial ETF (NasdaqGM: DFNL), and Davis Select Worldwide ETF (NasdaqGM: DWLD). DUSA includes high-conviction U.S. large-cap stocks. Top holdings include Berkshire Hathaway 9.6%, Amazon 7.5% and Alphabet 7.3%. The portfolio leans towards financials at 38.7%, followed by industrials 14.8% and energy 13.4%. DFNL includes the best-of-breed financial companies, including Markel Corp 6.7%, American Express 6.0% and Loews 5.8%, with a focus on diversified financials, insurers and banks.

While you were sleeping: Stocks rise on Yellen Feb. 15 (BusinessDesk) – Wall Street continued its record-setting streak while the US dollar also gained after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signalled further interest rate increases ahead. “At our upcoming meetings, the committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate,” Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee. The Federal Open Market Committee begins its next two-day policy meeting on March 14. “I can’t tell you which meeting it would be,” Yellen said, including specifying “whether it’s March or May or June,” according to Reuters. “Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession,” Yellen noted. Yellen warned that changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook. “Of course, it is too early to know what policy changes will be put in place or how their economic effects will unfold,” she noted. “While it is not my intention to opine on specific tax or spending proposals, I would point to the importance of improving the pace of longer-run economic growth and raising American living standards with policies aimed at improving productivity.” Wall Street moved higher. In 1.30pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.2 percent. In 1.14pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.3 percent. The three benchmarks touched fresh record highs. The Dow rose to 20,475.89, while the S&P 500 climbed to 2,334.56, and the Nasdaq reached 5,778.45. “This doesn’t mean they will move in March, but the Fed wants to have the option to move,” Omer Esiner, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington, told Reuters. “The market seems to be under-pricing a upcoming rate hike.” The Dow climbed, led by gains in shares of Goldman Sachs and those of JPMorgan Chase, recently up 1.5 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. Apple shares touched a record high US$134.93 amid bets its next iPhone model will bolster sales. US Treasuries declined, pushing the yield on the 10-year note five basis points higher. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 0.1 percent increase from the previous close, underpinned by gains in car makers.

SONA: Zuma's R2.5bn for drought aid questioned SONA: SA to foster US trade and support China one-state policy   Cape Town - President Jacob Zuma's State of the Nation Address (SONA) speech was predictably more populist, aimed at providing a distraction to his own shortcomings and the ANC’s current challenges and shoring up the ANC’s loss of support to the EFF, said Overberg Asset Management (OAM) in its weekly overview of the SA economic landscape. Following the EFF’s removal from Parliament during SONA, the DA together with Cope also left. While there were few left to listen to Zuma’s address, he nonetheless pushed ahead with the delivery. The SONA was a public relations disaster for Zuma and will undermine his ability to push aside Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan or to further his political agenda and choice of successor as leader of the ANC, according to OAM. The finance minister’s much anticipated budget speech on February 22 is likely to provide a stark contrast to Zuma’s address in terms of security presence and level of parliamentary support.  South Africa economic review • Manufacturing production fell in December by a larger than expected 2.0% year-on-year worse than the 0.4% consensus forecast decline.

On a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis manufacturing production increased by 0.3%. Among manufacturing sectors, food and beverages fell 6.2% on the year, and electrical machinery by 4.3%. Production of motor vehicles, parts and accessories and other transport equipment gained by 3.1%. Forward-looking indicators, including the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) and the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s business confidence index, signal an improvement in manufacturing conditions in the first half of 2017.   • The decline in mining production slowed from -4.5% year-on-year in November to -1.9% in December while on a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis production increased by 0.7%. Among the mining sectors, gold production fell 7.1% on the year and platinum group metals by 15.1%. Iron ore and copper production gained by a slender 1.3% and 0.2% on the year. In the fourth quarter (Q4) mining production fell by 2.7% quarter-on-quarter. While regulatory uncertainty will hamper production volumes during 2017 the industry should benefit from firming commodity prices and rising global demand. • This year’s SONA was once again marked by vociferous and violent objections with the opposition drawing strength from the Constitutional Court’s Nkandla ruling last year that Zuma had breached his oath of office.  A further visible difference was the increased security presence, which included barricades of police armoured vehicles. The security presence epitomizes the legitimacy challenge facing Zuma’s leadership. Following the EFF’s removal, the DA also left parliament together with Cope. While there were few left to listen to Zuma’s address, he nonetheless pushed ahead with the delivery. Zuma’s SONA speech was predictably more populist, aimed at providing a distraction to his own shortcomings and the ANC’ s current challenges and shoring up the ANC’s loss of support to the EFF. The week ahead • South African unemployment: Due Tuesday 14th February. The household Labour Force Survey is expected to show that unemployment subsided slightly from 27.1% in the third quarter (Q3) to 26.9% in Q4. A small seasonal uptick in employment is likely owing to temporary jobs growth in the retail and hospitality sector. READ: Slight drop in SA's unemployment rate • Consumer price inflation: Due Wednesday 15th February. According to consensus forecast consumer price inflation (CPI) is expected to show no change from December’s 6.8% year-on-year rate in January. While the reweighted CPI basket should temper the inflation rate food and fuel prices are likely to have an upward effect. • Retail sales growth: Due Wednesday 15th February. According to consensus forecast retail sales growth is expected to slow from 3.8% year-on-year in November to 2.0% in December as the boost from Black Friday discount shopping fades. Consumer confidence is constrained by high inflation, weak credit extension and poor jobs growth. Technical analysis • While the rand has broken below key resistance levels versus the dollar at R/$ 14.20 and 13.80 the strengthening trend is not confirmed by momentum indicators, signalling that the currency is overbought. • The US dollar index is testing a major 30-year resistance line, which if broken will pave the way for further strong gains in the currency. • Following the Brexit vote the British pound hit its weakest level against the US dollar since 1985. The key £/$1.30 level support level has been broken opening up a £/$1.20-1.24 target. • The JPMorgan global bond index is testing the support line from the bull market stemming back to 1989, which if broken will project further sharp increases in bond yields. • The US 10-year Treasury yield has broken back above the key support level of 2.0% endangering the multi-year bull trend in US bonds. • The benchmark R186 SA Gilt yield is now testing the key support level of 9.0% endangering the mini-bull market in bonds which has been in place since the start of the year. • Key US equity indices, including the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial, Dow Jones Transport, Nasdqaq and Russell 2000, have simultaneously set new record highs, confirming a bullish outlook for US equity markets.   • The Brent crude price is well supported at $40 a barrel and having broken key resistance at $50 is targeting further gains to the next key level at $60. Base metal prices are in a bull trend confirmed by copper’s increase above key resistance at $5 000 per ton. • Gold has developed an inverse “head and shoulders” pattern, which indicates further upward momentum and a test of the $1400 target level. • The JSE All Share index is testing an important resistance line but if this remains unbroken the index is likely to move back below the 24-month moving average at 50 900 in turn opening a downside target of 45 000. A break above 54 200 on the JSE All Share index would project an upward move to 60 000 marking a new high for the JSE. The bottom line • This year’s SONA was once again marked by vociferous and violent objections with the opposition drawing strength from the Constitutional Court’s Nkandla ruling last year that Zuma had breached his oath of office.  A further visible difference was the increased security presence, which included barricades of police armoured vehicles. The security presence epitomizes the legitimacy challenge facing Zuma’s leadership. • Following the EFF’s removal, the DA also left parliament together with Cope. While there were few left to listen to Zuma’s address, he nonetheless pushed ahead with the delivery. • Zuma’s proposed “radical socio-economic transformation” would be brought about by a mix of legislation and state funding and although short on detail would include the following key pillars: - Greater use of the government’s procurement and infrastructure budgets to assist black-owned enterprises; - Dismantling high levels of concentration in the economy to make way for smaller and black-owned businesses; - Increasing the share of the property market owned by black people; - Continuing with redistribution of agricultural land; - Increasing black ownership in the mining sector. • Despite the left-leaning rhetoric and promise of greater populism, financial markets barely reacted to Zuma’s SONA. The rand hardly budged while bond and equity markets actually firmed. The rand moved over the week from R/$13.22 to 13.41, from R/€14.27 to 14.25 and from R/£16.54 to 16.74. Government bonds strengthened with the yield on the R186 2025 firming from 8.82% to 8.79%. Equity markets also strengthened, with the benchmark All Share, Industrial, Financial and Resources indices all rising over the week by 0.8%, 0.7%, 1.7% and 0.2%, respectively.

The Federal Open Market Committee begins its next two-day policy meeting on March 14. "I can't tell you which meeting it would be," Yellen said, including specifying "whether it's March or May or June,” according to Reuters. “Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession,” Yellen noted. Yellen warned that changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook. “Of course, it is too early to know what policy changes will be put in place or how their economic effects will unfold,” she noted. “While it is not my intention to opine on specific tax or spending proposals, I would point to the importance of improving the pace of longer-run economic growth and raising American living standards with policies aimed at improving productivity.” Wall Street moved higher. In 1.30pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.2 percent. In 1.14pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.3 percent. The three benchmarks touched fresh record highs. The Dow rose to 20,475.89, while the S&P 500 climbed to 2,334.56, and the Nasdaq reached 5,778.45. "This doesn't mean they will move in March, but the Fed wants to have the option to move," Omer Esiner, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington, told Reuters. “The market seems to be under-pricing a upcoming rate hike." The Dow climbed, led by gains in shares of Goldman Sachs and those of JPMorgan Chase, recently up 1.5 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. Apple shares touched a record high US$134.93 amid bets its next iPhone model will bolster sales. US Treasuries declined, pushing the yield on the 10-year note five basis points higher. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 0.1 percent increase from the previous close, underpinned by gains in car makers. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index slipped 0.1 percent, and Germany’s DAX Index edged 0.02 percent lower. France’s CAC 40 Index added 0.2 percent, bolstered by shares in Peugeot.

Reuters had reported in January that the ABA was running a formal bidding process to secure an online lending partner, as a growing number of banks launch digital lending services or partner with startups in the sector. Akouba, which provides a loan origination and underwriting platform that integrates with a bank's own credit policies, was chosen because of a number of factors, including its ability to assess and manage risk, the ABA said on Monday. It is part of a growing cohort of young tech-savvy companies that automate much of the lending process, making it faster and cheaper than traditional brick-and-mortar operations. While the online lending sector was initially largely left to the new entrants, such LendingClub Corp, Prosper Marketplace and On Deck Capital, big banks have started fighting back. For instance, Banco Santander partnered with Kabbage last year to offer small business loans, while JPMorgan Chase & Co sealed a partnership with marketplace lender On Deck Capital Inc in 2015. Goldman Sachs Group Inc launched its own online consumer lending service this year. Smaller banks have instead relied on ABA, which represents institutions with less than $250 million, to source vendors for technology and other services. Member banks typically receive discounted pricing from partner vendors. "The small business loan application process is very time-sensitive and costly for banks, and there is a need to simplify and accelerate the process," Bryan Luke, chairman of ABA's Endorsed Solutions Banker Advisory Council, said in a statement. Partnerships allow fintech startups to tap into a larger network of customers, while allowing banks to improve digital offerings quickly without having to bear costs of developing new services.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Scott Deshefy: Trump policies may presage another economic meltdown Friday Feb 10, 2017 at 9:10 PM Scott Deshefy Even before social media, lies were at full sprint before truth could hear the starting gun. Misconceptions are contagious. Maybe that’s why George Orwell attacked euphemisms so frequently. He would have had a field day with “trickle-down economics.” Despite James Carville’s slogan during Bill Clinton’s 1992 election, we already knew it wasn’t the economy, but the climate, stupid. Still the misdirection worked, fixating Americans on the stock market. When Clinton and concurrent congresses repealed the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, allowing investment and commercial banks to merge and gamble recklessly, market shares soared for awhile. Then the deregulatory blunder plunged us into the Great Recession, and sluggish economies followed. Even in this Gilded Age of Wall Street excesses and concentrated wealth, climate change remains our biggest threat, not only to the biosphere but to the economy. Those unearned riches 1-percenters glean from Wall Street come from somewhere, much of it from industries that warm the Earth. The more heritable wealth they hoard, the less is made available to middle classes and the poor to circulate. Trickle-down is really trickle-up, the way war is peace, freedom is slavery and ignorance is strength in 1984 or, for that matter, 2017. In case you missed the news, 2016 was the hottest year on record. In fact, the 16 years this century rank among the warmest 17 ever recorded. That makes fossil fuel divestment and restoring Glass-Steagall even more vital. The top 100 air polluters, by the way, vented more than 270 million pounds of toxic chemicals in 2014. A tribute to Paddy Chayefsky’s prescience, there’s a scene in the movie “Network” where a television executive, portrayed by Ned Beatty, tells Howard Beale (actor Peter Finch) that there aren’t any cities or countries per se, just one giant corporation. Case in point: Should President Trump dismantle Dodd-Frank financial reforms, however poorly they substitute for Glass-Steagall, brace yourself for another international meltdown. Trump also plans to trash Obama’s fiduciary requirement that retirement advisers work for their clients’ best interests instead of their own. Then there’s Jay Clayton, picked to head the Securities and Exchange Commission and stop big banks and hedge funds from “getting away with murder.” Clayton spent his legal career helping Wall Street beat the rap. Empowering too-big-to-fail banks makes it harder to establish state banks or offer low-income banking at U.S. post offices, ideas the Green Party and Bernie Sanders champion. Six big banks, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase, already bankroll private prison firms such as CoreCivic and the GEO Group. Deriving profits from incarceration, rehab and immigration enforcement industries is troubling enough, but especially when monopolized and partnered with Wall Street. Also worrisome are the many Trump appointees who are alumni of Goldman Sachs. The world’s most powerful investment bank, Goldman has been at the heart of the worst financial troubles of the last 100 years, from the crash of 1929 to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act repealing Glass-Steagall. If we aren’t careful, the silted anger of the last election will obscure the real enemy. Scott Deshefy is a two-time Green Party congressional candidate. Email him at baronarad11@yahoo.com.

X Ireland lacks talent ‘quantity’ in scramble for Brexit finance firms Shortage of financial service skills could hinder Dublin in fight for companies fleeing City Tue, Feb 14, 2017, 08:16 Gavin Finch, John Detrixhe, and Peter Flanagan “Up to now, the type of finance jobs available in Ireland have generally not matched London for compensation and other perks.” That could change as City firms consider moving base in light of Brexit. Photograph: EPA/Justin Lane         When Rob Boardman is scouring Dublin to hire for his firm’s electronic broking and dark-pool business, it can take up to a year to find the right candidate. “It’s a question of quantity of talent, not quality,” said Boardman, European chief executive of Investment Technology Group, who has been recruiting in the city since 2010. “It can be hard to hire in financial services for front-office traders.” Dublin, with similar laws and regulations as the UK, is the only other English-speaking hub in the European Union, making the city a go-to option for London-based banks seeking uninterrupted EU access post-Brexit. But one big problem is a shortage of talent. More people work in finance in Edinburgh than in the whole of Ireland, posing a concern for the half-dozen global banks considering setting up camp here. “There are probably more Irish bankers working in London than there are in Dublin,” said Jonathan Astbury, partner in global markets at executive search firm Newington International. “There is still a sense among front-office types that if you’re not in London, you’re not at the cutting edge. Ultimately, London is going to remain the centre of the banking world for many years to come, so Dublin is going to be a hard sell for them to attract the best people.” Certain drawbacks Cities across Europe have begun courting banks and their high-paying roles. But potential locales all have their drawbacks. Financial firms have concerns over language issues, labour laws and taxes in Frankfurt and Paris. What will start as a trickle – banks plan to move only a couple of hundred jobs into their new bases at first – could become a torrent if it looks like the UK is heading for a “cliff edge” Brexit, whereby all EU access is cut off by 2019. ADVERTISEMENT Firms weighing Dublin for their new base will initially relocate Irish employees currently working in London, according to two people with knowledge of their firm’s contingency plans. There are about 35,000 people working in finance in Ireland, compared with more than 60,000 in Frankfurt, 180,000 in Paris and 360,000 in London. Goodbody estimates that Dublin could gain as many as 15,000 financial jobs from Brexit, and a talent shortage may not scare off banks that see Brexit as an opportunity to reduce costs. A few large international banks have held discussions about moving a small number of senior managers to their new EU hubs to train cheaper local hires while London jobs are cut, according to two recruiters who said they’ve had talks with the firms. Irish officials acknowledge that the country lacks the depth of banking talent available in other cities competing for Brexit spoils, but say they are confident they can attract workers from elsewhere in the EU. They point to the 250 financial institutions already in Dublin, including Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse Group, not to mention major tech firms such as Google, eBay and PayPal. “In the context of a UK which will potentially be outside the EU, where there won’t be such mobility, we are likely to win more of these highly skilled people coming to Ireland, and I think that’s the way our companies and potential investors are reading it,” said Martin Shanahan, chief executive of IDA Ireland. “If the skills are going to be available, they are going to be available in Ireland.” Incentive for Irish Brexit could help reverse a trend: For decades, the brightest Irish university graduates with ambitions in finance sought out their fortunes in the narrow lanes of London’s square mile, according to Denis Curran, the IDA’s head of international financial services. “If front-office or investment-banking jobs do come to Dublin as expected, then it would act as an incentive for Irish in those roles in London who may want to move back,” said Peter Cosgrove, a director at Dublin recruiting firm CPL. “Up to now, the type of finance jobs available in Ireland have generally not matched London for compensation and other perks. Already, we have seen a spike in inquiries from Irish in London and EU nationals who were considering moving to the UK but are looking closer at Dublin as an alternative.” Where all these people are going to live and work is another matter. Dublin already suffers from an acute shortage of residential housing, particularly at the top end. And while prices are significantly lower than in London, they’re rising fast. Vacancy rates for prime office space in the city centre are also at record lows. As well, Dublin is home to only five Michelin-starred restaurants – a must for any well-heeled investment banker. That is compared with more than 60 in London and 100 in Paris. – (Bloomberg)       Read More Credit Suisse to cut 5,500 jobs in 2017 after €2.3bn loss Irish Life health insurance wing loses almost €6m in five months Irish and UK PR agencies hired to work on possible AIB IPO Central bank allocates 28 out of 170 new staff to Brexit Hospital support staff to strike over pay dispute Britain’s Co-operative bank puts itself up for sale Insurance bosses see falling profits and Brexit as key challenges Payments group Monex surpasses €100m revenue milestone Irish firm in talks to buy up to 2,000 distressed mortgages How the Flash Crash Trader made $50m – and lost it again Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Health & Pharma Fyffes melon workers’ dispute escalates as takeover nears Technology 1:13 How a Dublin teenager is helping you bring your secrets to the grave Politics Cabinet discusses McCabe tribunal as focus remains on Kenny’s leadership Rugby Kieran Keane a strong contender be next Connacht coach Sponsored How Concur’s 10-step guide could help streamline your supplier invoice process Would you like customer insight with that?

She probably won't win. But what if she does? Bradley Keoun Feb 14, 2017 11:16 AM EST First there was Brexit. Then Trump. Is it time to start getting ready for Frexit? Investors are preparing for the possibility -- if remote -- that France ditches the euro as its home currency and brings back the franc. There's also a chance -- even more remote -- that France might exit the European Union altogether. It seems almost unthinkable that the second-biggest economy among euro-based countries would choose to depart, but the rise of nationalism among voters around the world has given traders cause to fear surprising election outcomes. The dynamic emerged last June when Britain voted to leave the EU and was underscored by U.S. President Donald Trump's November victory on pledges to "Make America Great Again." France will hold its first round of presidential elections on April 23, and Marine Le Pen, a far-right candidate with the National Front party who has pledged to restore the national currency and push for a referendum on exiting the EU, is leading the polls. While most candidates say she's likely to lose in the second round of voting, an unexpected victory would roil global markets. Risks could include a steep plunge in European bank securities, a selloff of U.S. stocks and corporate bonds and a steep drop in Treasury yields, as investors seek safety in U.S. government debt. France, which currently boasts a AA credit rating from Standard & Poor's, could default if Le Pen succeeds in her push to redenominate the government's euro-based debt into francs. "People are concerned that what should happen according to script might not happen according to script," said Scott MacDonald, chief global economist for Smith's Research and Gradings in White Plains, N.Y. Last year's script was anything but predictable, as voters in the U.K. and U.S. latched onto campaigns tied to anti-globalization sentiment. Le Pen stands in that camp, with her planks of exiting the euro and ending automatic citizenship for people born in the country. And, in an echo of Trump's pronouncements, she would seek to improve relations with Russia. The Frexit risk adds to a growing roster of international trouble spots for investors, from China's slowing economy to potential trade disputes with Japan and Mexico. There's also the risk of escalated military conflict; North Korea said Monday that it had successfully tested a nuclear-capable missile over the weekend.  According to MacDonald, Le Pen garnered 25% in a Feb. 10 poll of voters' first-round election preferences. Second with 21% was Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker who's considered socially liberal but economically pragmatic. Francois Fillon of the Republicans party, who has espoused a fiscally conservative approach, was an early favorite but has slipped to just 20% in the poll due to the fallout from revelations that he paid his wife hundreds of thousands of euros as his supposed parliamentary assistant. Benoit Hamon, the candidate for sitting French President Francois Hollande's Socialist Party, is polling 16%; he has pledged to legalize marijuana and tax the use of robots.  So the Frexit warnings are beginning to trickle out. Bank of America analysts wrote in a report last week that a French exit from the euro could have "far-reaching systemic implications for the global financial system." Moody's Investor Service said Feb. 3 that "financial markets do not appear to be pricing in acute fragmentation risks, suggesting that the impact of any such shock could be severe." If France insisted on repaying its euro-denominated debt in francs, the country would be declared in default, Moritz Kraemer, S&P's head of sovereign ratings, wrote in a letter published in The Economist earlier this month, according to Reuters. Markets have already started to price in a higher risk of deterioration in France's credit standing. The yield on 10-year French government bonds has climbed to 1.04%, from 0.69% at the start of the year. It's now 0.74 percentage point over yields on comparable German bonds -- the highest gap in four years. A Le Pen victory could bring a stock-market rout for large U.S. banks, MacDonald said, given their exposure to France and the rest of the European Union; firms such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) , Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) already are grappling with whether and how to relocate their London-based trading hubs following the Brexit vote. "If there is turmoil in markets because of the French elections, it'll come through U.S. banks," MacDonald said. "We're talking big banks. They're international, and they have exposure around the planet." For example, in its most-recent annual report, JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, listed $26.2 billion of lending, trading and investing exposures to France -- the third-most after the U.K. ($46.7 billion) and Germany ($30.7 billion.) French, German and Swiss banks would obviously also come under severe pressure, MacDonald said. The smartest and easiest thing right now for investors worried about Frexit would be to reduce exposure to peripheral European countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, he said. MacDonald estimates that Le Pen has, at most, a 35% chance of victory in the second round of elections. A terror attack in France before the elections could sway the vote in her favor. If elected, she'd likely face resistance to a euro exit from within the French parliament, he said. "There's a long way between here and there," he said. "But people have looked out here at the political scenario, and if it's like the U.S., we'll end up with a 'neofascist' sitting in the Elysee Palace."

Putting aside the fact that Hensarling would take this position irrespective of whether it was true, bank noise-making on this front has to be taken with a fistful of salt, since their baseline is that any restriction on their ability to loot and pillage their freedom of operation must be beaten back on principle, even if it might be for the good of the institution. Andrew Haldane of the Bank of England described why banks need to be curbed in his 2010 speech, The $100 Billion Question: Tail risk within some systems is determined by God – in economist-speak, it is exogenous. Natural disasters, like earthquakes and floods, are examples of such tail risk. Although exogenous, even these events have been shown to occur more frequently than a normal distribution would imply.24 God’s distribution has fat tails. Tail risk within financial systems is not determined by God but by man; it is not exogenous but endogenous. This has important implications for regulatory control. Finance theory tells us that risk brings return. So there are natural incentives within the financial system to generate tail risk and to avoid regulatory control. In the run-up to this crisis, examples of such risk-hunting and regulatory arbitrage were legion. They included escalating leverage, increased trading portfolios and the design of tail-heavy financial instruments. In other words, individuals in financial institutions will take risks because more risk means more upside. And since the upside goes to the employees and bosses, and catastrophic losses fall on society at large, financiers have every incentive to take as many gambles as they can get away with. But Trump in his Presidential campaign repeatedly claimed that Dodd Frank was hurting growth by constraining bank lending. This view may be due to Trump embracing bog standard Republican ideology about the evils of regulations, or may be based on his self-serving belief from his days in real estate that loans are always more trouble to get than he’d like and banks ought to be delighted to hand over money to him. Obviously, some evil force was getting in the way. On a high level, the idea that Dodd Frank has a macro impact on lending is dodgy. For starters, big corporations use bank loans only for limited purposes, such as revolving lines of credit (which banks hate to give but have to for relationship reasons because they aren’t profitable) and acquisition finance for highly leveraged transactions (and the robust multiples being paid for private equity transactions says there is no shortage of that). Banks lay off nearly all of the principal value of these loans in syndications or via packaging them in collateralized loan obligation. They are facing increased competition from the private equity firm’s own credit funds, which have become a major force in their own right. Otherwise, big companies rely on commercial paper and the bond markets for borrowing. And with rates so low and investors desperate for yield, many have been borrowing, for sure….but not to invest, but to a large degree to buy back their own stock. And as we’ve reported, small businesses in the post crisis era haven’t been keen about borrowing due to weak overall demand. Entrepreneurs don’t borrow and expand because money is cheap; they borrow because they see an business opportunity and think they can exploit it. In addition, even in the areas where growth has been strong, there’s a much bigger impediment to small business lending: contra Trump and Hensarling, banks have almost entirely abandoned that business. Banks quit training credit officers who could assess idiosyncratic small business in the mid-later 1980s and turned branches from free standing little businesses under a branch manger into retail stores that open bank accounts and sell lending products to mass customers. But even with this 50,000 foot view, could Trump and Hensarling nevertheless have a valid critique of Dodd Frank, in terms of it constraining lending in certain economically important niches? After all, many would assume that because the banks all got high before the crisis and made a whole bunch of reckless real estate loans that Dodd Frank throttled that down. Even if you think that’s an entirely desirable outcome, the Republicans could then claim that Dodd Frank did in fact reduce lending, leaving the experts and ideologues on both sides to argue whether the line was drawn in the right place or not. A Financial Times article today does the important service of examining the bigger question of whether Dodd Frank curbed growth. The bottom line is it can’t find much evidence to support that claim. And even though residential real estate lending in particular did become more stringent after the crisis, Dodd Frank had almost nothing to do with that. Mind you, the article, Did Dodd-Frank really hurt the US economy?, doesn’t even factor in the issue we raised earlier, that the bad incentives inherent in the financial services industry and its demonstrated ability to blow up the real economy means that even if there were a near-term economic cost to having banking be safe and boring, the cost of financial crises is so high you’d still come out ahead in the long term. Key points from the article: The headline data do not suggest that loans are too hard to obtain. Figures from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation show that gross loans across the US’s commercial banks have grown pretty steadily for at least three years, spread across all categories except home-equity lines of credit and loans to other banks… “Loan growth remains robust,” said Marianne Lake, his counterpart at JPMorgan Chase, while presenting record annual net income of $24.7bn last month. But what about particular products and niches? Remember all those bitter bank complaints about the evils of Dodd Frank mortgage requirements? The article acknowledges them but observes: But Laurie Goodman, co-director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute, a liberal think-tank, argues that other factors have had a greater effect. Credit remains “extremely tight”, she says, because lenders are worried by the representations and warranties they need to make to Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage buyer, and the high cost of servicing delinquent loans, among other factors. None of that was in Dodd-Frank. In her former life at Amherst Securities, Goodman was a, if not the, top mortgage analyst. She is a hard-core data nerd. She’s not the sort that would take a position if she could not substantiate it well, and her standards are high. So one should take her reading seriously. It is hard to reach any conclusions for small business loans: Small-business lending is a mixed picture too. Non-mortgage loans of less than $1m to non-farm businesses peaked at $375bn in 2007, according to FDIC data, and have since fallen to $284bn. To Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a centre-right think-tank, that is a sign of the extra burdens of compliance. But other analysts say it is hard to disentangle Dodd-Frank effects from extra caution as banks rebuilt capital; a relatively sluggish economy; and competition from a host of nonbank platforms. Some note that the main piece of Dodd-Frank targeting small-business loans ― which requires banks to collect and report more data ― has yet to take effect. Even if the evidence of Dodd-Frank hurting bank lending is unpersuasive, says Michael Barr, a professor at the University of Michigan, that will not stop Republicans determined to unwind it…. He notes that lobbyists are already talking about scrapping the Volcker ban on proprietary trading, and abolishing the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which was supposed to monitor risks developing outside the deposit-taking banks. None of this has much to do with easing the flow of credit. The only place where the Dodd Frank critics might have a case is in credit cards: In products such as credit cards and personal loans, for example, analysts say activity has been damped by fear of censure by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB was one of the agencies spawned by Dodd-Frank; it enforces 19 federal consumer protection statutes covering everything from home finance to student loans, credit cards and banking practices. Dodd-Frank ordered the agency to look out for “unfair, deceptive or abusive” practices in any financial product or service offered to a consumer. That may have caused banks to be wary of customers on low incomes and with thin credit files, says Justin Schardin, director of financial regulatory reform at the Bipartisan Policy Center. He cites a study last year showing that customers with non-prime credit scores were awarded less than one-fifth of new credit-card accounts in 2015, down from 29 per cent in 2007. However, this is dodgy. Numerous studies have found that high levels of consumer borrowing are strongly correlated with lower economic growth. High levels of private credit growth are now widely understood to increase the risk of financial crises. And in the last two years, more and more economists have concluded that overly large financial sectors dampen growth. The IMF concluded in 2015 that the optimal level was roughly that of Poland. And they concluded having a more significant banking sector was a plus only if it was well regulated. So if curbing credit growth is a good idea (for everyone but banks), the place to start would be the riskiest and least economically productive loans. Credit card lines to weak borrowers would be high on the list. So the common sense conclusion, that Dodd Frank can’t have done much if any harm because it didn’t change all that much, is borne out by a look at the data and related considerations. But even mild pro-safety measures are too much for the deregulation-mad Republicans. 001601 This entry was posted in Banana republic, Banking industry, Credit cards, Credit markets, Economic fundamentals, Politics, Real estate, Regulations and regulators on February 14, 2017 by Yves Smith.

It’s not just “deregulation-mad Republicans”. There are neo-liberals in the three main European political groupings (Christian Democrat / Conservative, Liberal and Socialist / Labour) itching to do so. As soon as Trump talked about and then ordered the review of Dodd-Frank, the media and financial analysts has been speculating about the “high water mark of regulation”, the “swing of the pendulum” and the pressure on European, including British, to “ease or back off”. The worst, IMO, is City AM, a free sheet given away each morning in London. I am glad that you mentioned Andy Haldane. Unfortunately, he is unlikely to become governor. My money is on Tory grandee and aristo, Charlotte Hogg. She has just been made a deputy governor. Perhaps, one should be grateful for the small mercy that Treeza is unlikely to appoint a City banker, especially one from Goldman Sachs. Reply ↓ L February 14, 2017 at 10:32 am Yves, thank you for this concice reply to his comments. On this point I have three comments: But Trump in his Presidential campaign repeatedly claimed that Dodd Frank was hurting growth by constraining bank lending. This view may be due to Trump embracing bog standard Republican ideology about the evils of regulations, or may be based on his self-serving belief from his days in real estate that loans are always more trouble to get than he’d like and banks ought to be delighted to hand over money to him. Obviously, some evil force was getting in the way. Why can’t it be both? When he had his bromance moment with Jamie Dimon he presented it in the personal (paraphrasing) “I have so many friends who can’t get loans because of Dodd Frank.” This seems to be a consistent pattern for him and it is consistent with the way he presents most things in the royal I. But given his legal troubles over the years I am not surprised that he would hate regulations with a passion. That said this will probably play well in Peoria. As a private citizen, pre-2008 I had people falling all over themselves to lend me money. Now those bulk mailings have dried up, and I didn’t do anything different. Dodd Frank probably didn’t cause that alone but post hoc ergo propter hoc always sounds good on the talk shows. Reply ↓ dw February 14, 2017 at 3:49 pm or that he would have a problem getting a loan. banks and others tend to look down at potential debtors who file bankruptcy. a lot Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers February 14, 2017 at 10:34 am With regard to “their ability to loot and pillage their freedom of operation”, some, if not many, of the bankers et al I work / have worked with gave the impression that they have / had a “divine right of kings” to do so as they are “super smart”, went to the right schools and universities, pulled themselves up by their bootstraps, work hard / long hours etc. Such types are around and waiting for the opportunity. Reply ↓ Inode_buddha February 14, 2017 at 5:31 pm “With regard to “their ability to loot and pillage their freedom of operation”” My experience is that this sort of baseline thinking is not limited to banks. Rather, most of the private sector seems to think this way, in the USA, medium and large enterprises. Having spent my entire life in privately held medium size outfits and dealt directly with the upper class, I have heard more than one of them state that its only illegal if you get caught. Reply ↓ Sally February 14, 2017 at 10:35 am The Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 was just 5-6 pages long, and it basically divided commercial banks from high risk investment banks that wanted to gamble on more high risk ventures? The problem is the The Dodd Frank legislation is over 2000 pages long and is very complicated. Also, it has had the effect of shutting down local commercial banks through over regulation. The very opposite to what is wanted. What is needed is many more local independent banks that are detached from the big boys on Wall Street. A relatively simple act of a few few pages worked for nearly 70 odd years. Why over complicate things? Sometimes it looks as if the politicians regulate for the purpose of reducing competition for the big boys. Reply ↓ Vatch February 14, 2017 at 11:31 am Minor point: the Glass Steagall Act was 34 pages long. See: http://legisworks.org/sal/48/stats/STATUTE-48-Pg162a.pdf Aside from that cavil, I enthusiastically agree with you about the value of Glass Steagall. The Republicans promised to restore it; I wonder what the chances are of that actually happening? Here’s the relevant text from page 28 of the 2016 Republican platform: https://prod-cdn-static.gop.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5B1%5D-ben_1468872234.pdf We support reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 which prohibits commercial banks from engaging in high-risk investment. Reply ↓ Sally February 14, 2017 at 12:09 pm Thanks Vatch for correcting me about the 34 pages, my point being it was a simple piece of legislation, and did the job for 70 odd years quite well. And I agree they should bring it back or something similar. You either regulate investment banking which bankers hate because it limits their freedom to take risks or you deregulate them, but with the proviso that if they bankrupt their own bank, then tough, no bail outs. We created the worst possible system. We deregulated them so they could carry out risky transactions, and then gave then the protection of total bail outs. To do this you need a healthy banking system for the little guys to be able to deposit their life savings, and perhaps borrow for a mortgage or small business without the high risk that people will lose all their money. Reply ↓ DH February 14, 2017 at 1:40 pm Complex regulation is weaponized to assist large companies and special interest groups. If you can keep competition out simply by making start-ups difficult, time-consuming, and expensive then you can charge more with less competition. It happens at all levels from professions to banking regulations. The big banks may want to some rules lifted (especially the CFPB and the fiduciary rule) but in general they have the resources to deal with a complex regulatory environment. Small firms have to spread the same compliance costs over a much smaller asset base, so its margins are lower. The last thing in the world big banks want is a simple 40 page regulation that restricts their capital ratios and prevents them being in some markets. Reply ↓ Vatch February 14, 2017 at 2:22 pm Sally and DH, you are both correct. It’s a mess, and the leaders of both political parties have little incentive to fix it. I hope we can embarrass some Republicans enough so that they really do try to fix it — the fix was in their platform, after all. Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers February 14, 2017 at 11:54 am Thank you, Sally. Oh, yes. The lobbyists make sure that a barrier to entry is erected. That is one of the dirty secrets of the trade. Reply ↓ dw February 14, 2017 at 3:56 pm the reason laws are so much longer is that business doesnt really like uncertainty, which means that they have to go court to find out what the law means, and they spend money to do that, with a much more detailed law, you can skip that for the most part. after all, legislatures could just tell us to not go to faster than it was safe to go. but then we would end up in court tying to determine what that means. Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers February 14, 2017 at 11:08 am It’s good that Yves mentions Poland. At HSBC from 2003 – 6, I worked on Polish transactions. HBPL operated as a branch, but had to convert to a subsidiary when the bank sought local / retail funding. That was a condition imposed by the Polish authorities. It was the same in Russia (HCRR). The Polish authorities are wary of foreign dominance of their banking system and not taking chances with regard to deposits, especially retail. Poland insisted on (retaining) the ability of local regulators to adapt the European iteration of the Basel accords, CRD / CRR, to local conditions, especially establishment. Reply ↓ Hugh Stephens February 14, 2017 at 2:25 pm Respectfully, This article misses what I consider to be a key point. I feel that the biggest issue with Dodd-Frank is the concentration of larger banks. In 1990, the five largest banks held 9.7% of the industry’s total assets. 2008 it was over 33%. Today it is 44% and continues to grow. Community banks in total own approximately 20% and that share is declining at a much faster rate since 2010. Personally, my community bank has been bought out twice since Dodd-Frank. I have acquaintances working for small banks who reaffirm my belief that the additional regulatory cost caused by Dodd Frank will only solidify the Too-Big-To-Fail structure that we’ve seen internationally. Community banks serve a disproportionately high number of commercial loans for small businesses, agriculture and residential mortgages. Building a more robust and competitive banking structure isn’t what Dodd-Frank has accomplished. It certainly didn’t hold any of the bank executives responsible for careless lending practices. America needs to find a solution, I think someone outside of the Big five’s pockets is the right place to steer the ship. This issue transcends political affiliation. Reply ↓ dw February 14, 2017 at 3:58 pm Dodd-Franks didnt create the concentration of banks. the ever popular free market, along with acceptance by regulators did that Reply ↓ ArkansasAngie February 14, 2017 at 2:53 pm Small banks are over burdened with the regulations that are slapped on them that are designed to go after the big boys. I’d rather simply exclude them from some of the regulations than give the Goldmans et al free reign. This is a place where the Trumpster will loose support from independents … if he doesn’t stay true to draining the swamp.. Reply ↓ dw February 14, 2017 at 4:00 pm too late. he has already stopped the drain the swamp pledge, after all , his cabinet is made up of billionaires and some less dubious others. Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorFebruary 14, 2017 at 6:40 pm The big banks have been using small banks to lobby on their behalf. This is so prevalent that it has been reported several times in the press. You believe what amounts to big bank PR. Reply ↓ Knute Rife February 14, 2017 at 9:02 pm If Glass Steagall were still in place, we wouldn’t be seeing this allegation. Another big thanks to the DLC collaborators. Reply ↓ Anonymous February 15, 2017 at 8:36 am My gripe with Dodd-Frank is that it did away with a seventy-year old registration exemption for investment advisors who had fifteen or fewer clients–all of whom were ‘qualified’, i.e…rich. Generally those sorts of advisors had profit incentive arrangements with their clients. Phil Fisher, of ‘Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits,’ was one such advisor. The alternative to this sort of arrangement is the hedge fund. I think this is worse for the client. Why, because it exposes the client to the needs and fears of the hedge fund’s other limited partners. If a big limited partner heads for the exit, it’s almost guaranteed that the other limited partners will end up with a less liquid portfolio. Hedge funds are exempt from registration if they manage less than $100 million in assets. Eliminating this registration exemption was just bureaucratic overreach. People who are as smart as Phil Fisher are rare. They could easily just manage their own money. They hate filling out forms.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 February 2017 by Military News Convergence Launches Advisor Complexity Profile, New Technology Designed To Deliver Complete Transparency Into The Alternative Asset Industry Convergence, a financial technology company founded by industry veterans, has launched Advisor Complexity Profile (“Complexity”), a new service designed to address the challenge of operational and business model transparency in the alternative asset management industry, it was announced today. Complexity provides insight into all the major alternative asset classes, including hedge funds, private equity, real estate, venture capital, and structured asset funds, incorporating approximately 8,300 managers in more than 50 countries, and assigns each of them a high, medium or low complexity profile. It is designed to meet the needs for improved transparency and analysis for all the major industry participants: investors and asset allocators, assets managers, and service providers. “The digital footprint being created by thousands of asset managers continues to expand making it harder to identify the critical data points that can provide insight into operational due diligence and risk management. Until now there has been no unifying product to capture, normalize and structure the kind of information that can give users an insightful and timely view into the complexity of an asset manager’s business model,” said John Phinney, Chairman & Co-President at Convergence. “Complexity Profiling does just that, allowing asset managers and asset owners to proactively protect against risks that may have previously gone undiscovered in a manager’s operating model.” Complexity captures approximately 2,000 data points per manager, allowing Convergence and its clients to objectively compare manager complexity over time using a consistent set of metrics to track change and identify potential issues. Proprietary algorithms are used to create a “Complexity Profile” based on 40+ un-weighted factors identified in the manager’s business model. Profiles are updated daily. A low/medium/high complexity profile is assigned to the asset manager based on the number of high complexity factors present in their business model. Among the factors captured and analyzed are internal valuation, self-administration, and qualified audits. Asset managers would be expected to have the infrastructure in place to manage the level of complexity inherent across their organization. Complexity Profiles are designed to be used for a variety of purposes including fund raising, manager research and selection; ongoing surveillance and due diligence; pricing services and assessing risk, benchmarking versus peers and competitors, and in sales support. Complexity Profiles allow users to pinpoint specific complexity areas where risk exists and where risks have been created since the initial due diligence was conducted. “Complex operating models do add risk, and unnecessarily complex models can add unnecessary risk,” said George Evans, Co-President at Convergence, noting that Convergence estimates that as many as seven percent of asset managers may be under major operating model stress at any given point. “These potential issues have historically been invisible to investors and allocators. With Complexity, we are bringing unconstrained transparency to the operating risk in each manager’s structure and in the industry overall, while also allowing managers to gauge the complexity of their own businesses,” he added. Convergence founders Phinney and Evans bring a long track record of financial industry success to the new company. Prior to starting Convergence, Mr. Phinney held a number of senior positions, including CFO/COO with Apollo Global Management, The Rohatyn Group and JPMorgan. Mr. Evans was previously Managing Director with The Gladstone Group, and Global Head of Business Development with GlobeOp Financial, BISYS and JPMorgan Investor Services. Convergence currently counts among its users many leading fund administrators and auditors, pensions, endowments and foundations, as well as large established and emerging asset managers. With Complexity, it is targeting a market comprised of more than 17,000 registered investment advisors, 58,000 alternative funds, and an expected $20 trillion in assets by year-end 2020. “If you’re an asset manager, you want to know where you have issues compared to your peer groups that might be costing you business. If you’re an allocator, you want to identify the best managers, and flag any potential issues early in the process. For a service provider, there’s a need to identify where to market your products and price them accordingly. Our research and analytics are designed to provide insight for all these constituencies,” said Phinney. About Convergence, Inc. Founded in 2013, Convergence is an independent growth company that has created an entirely new platform comprising (1) data, (2) research and analytical products, and, (3) surveillance / monitoring services, all providing transparency into the infrastructure of the alternative asset management industry. The firm’s leadership team has 120+ years of experience managing operating risk in many of the world’s leading asset management organizations. The depth and breadth of this industry expertise differentiates Convergence from any research players in the industry who provide data but fail to provide actionable context. Convergence does not render investment advice.

Follow @LionelRALaurent Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Feb 14, 2017 5:59 AM EST CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG-REG -0.10 As of 4:26 AM EST 15.32 CHF Once at risk of becoming the next dead man walking of European banking, Credit Suisse Group AG CEO Tidjane Thiam has won himself some time. How long his reprieve lasts depends on factors outside his control. Quarterly loss $2.3 billion As dismal as the 2.35 billion-franc ($2.3 billion) quarterly loss he reported on Tuesday was, Thiam was still able to draw a line under the Swiss bank's involvement in the U.S. mortgage probe without depleting capital by as much as investors had feared. That’s heartening for shareholders who had fretted about being diluted by a big stock offering. There’s even a chance the bank won't have to sell shares in its prized domestic unit to bolster capital. That all helped to send the shares up by as much as 3 percent. Roller Coaster Credit Suisse shares have clawed back their losses over the past year Source: Bloomberg There’s still much work to do. Credit Suisse has as many as 6,500 more jobs to cut this year, an estimated 5 billion Swiss-franc capital gap to fill, and 14 billion francs of unwanted assets to offload by 2019. Meanwhile, return on equity is stubbornly anemic. Profitability Problem Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam is struggling to revive the Swiss bank's return on equity Source: Company filings 2017 has got, though, off to a bright start for bankers: markets are hitting highs and the U.S., under President Donald Trump, is preparing to roll back regulations intended to make customers safer. The “pendulum has swung,” Thiam said in a Bloomberg Television interview. It will need to keep swinging if he is to offset the cost of overhauling Credit Suisse and deliver the reliable profits shareholders want. Missing Out Credit Suisse's investment banking revenue growth trailed almost all the firm's peers Source: Bernstein analysis, company reports Percentage growth is compared with the year-earlier period Volatility in fixed-income markets, together with growing expectations of increases in U.S. interest rates, did wonders for Credit Suisse’s traders and investment bankers in the fourth quarter. FICC revenue climbed 14 percent and investment banking income 19 percent, even if equities fell, according to Bernstein estimates. January looks to have been strong, too, with the bank reporting a doubling of sales in some credit products. But that’s no guarantee of a strong year to come. Early 2017 may turn out to have been a convenient window of opportunity for clients and companies before the elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany and expected U.S. rate rises. Wealth management is still feeling the pinch from tougher rules on tax transparency, client risk aversion and low rates. Combined outflows of the bank’s wealth management divisions totaled 2.4 billion Swiss francs, according to JPMorgan estimates. Credit Suisse says January was strong, and margins are already improving -- but this is a business that also relies on risk appetite and positive market sentiment to thrive. Competitive threats from low-cost passive products aren't going away either. Another part of Credit Suisse that needs market sentiment to stay positive is its so-called bad bank. Impressively, the operation cut assets by almost half in 2016. Benign markets and higher interest rates will limit losses from further sales, according to HSBC. Thiam needs a lot to keep going right before he can declare his work done. Revenue in 2016 fell to the lowest since the financial crisis and return on equity was negative for a second year in a row. At 11.6 percent, Credit Suisse's capital ratio is still lower than Deutsche Bank AG. The shares still trade at a steep discount to their book value. Investors will need several more pendulum-swinging quarters before they're willing award the bank a better valuation: Thiam has won a reprieve rather than a pardon.

Even though the Andrew Ross Sorkin book Too Big to Fail and the related movie were released years ago, they played a critical role in shoring up the party line on the handling of the financial crisis, that heroic financial regulators saved the banks and therefore the economy from collapsing. Since many readers of this site joined us after our extensive real-time and post-crisis commentary ran, this post provides a good overview of what is wrong with the official story. By Bill Black, the author of The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One and an associate professor of economics and law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Jointly published with New Economic Perspectives I am watching the film Too Big to Fail based on Andrew Ross Sorkin’s book of the same name. It led me to check out the price of the used book, which has fallen to $1.02, which is low enough that I am willing to buy a copy of the book, particularly since not a penny will go to Andrew Ross Sorkin. The financial analytics displayed in the movie and the book are so poor and dishonest that I need to have a copy by my keyboard as an inspiration to keep trying to cut through the calculated dishonesty about Wall Street pumped out nearly every day in the pages of the New York Times. The movie starts with the imminent failure of Lehman. It is an astonishingly sympathetic portrait of Wall Street, Hank Paulson, Tim Geithner, and Ben Bernanke. The movie invents a scene in which the Treasury leadership explains “in English” the causes of the crisis to the Treasury PR person. There is not a word about the three fraud epidemics that hyper-inflated the bubble, drove the crisis, and produced the Great Recession. As one expects of a Sorkin tale, it is all about personalities and “great men.” (Women are rare and powerless, even FDIC Chair Sheila Bair.) The movie and book have a patina of financial jargon that Sorkin thinks constitutes analytics, and a nearly total failure to probe the Wall Street BS about the crisis. One odd aspect of the book and movie is that they almost (in the case of the book) totally ignore the largest financial run in history – the $300 billion run on money market mutual funds. That run was enormously important in its own right – and only staunched by the temporary provision of federal deposit insurance to the formerly uninsured industry. The run also freaked every senior financial regulator in the world. The movie ignores the run even though it caused Paulson’s fears to spike. The book’s treatment of the run is cursory and devoid of analysis. Sorkin’s attempt to make Paulson the flawed hero and Geithner the most effective hero of the financial crisis is the primary theme of the book and movie. Sorkin presents Bernanke as a kindly grandfather. This indicates that Geithner was Sorkin’s primary source and that Paulson was a major source. Sorkin’s account suggests that Paulson had one tragic flaw and one PR flaw. The tragic flaw is incompetence. Sorkin does not directly charge Paulson with this flaw, but even the weakest factual account of the crisis displays Paulson’s incompetence. In Sorkin’s account, Paulson recurrently fails to anticipate the information he will need to make key decisions and is therefore constantly surprised by developments and unprepared to respond. Paulson, the former head of Goldman Sachs, should be a caution to everyone that believes we can only staff key government finance positions with Wall Street elites because of their unparalleled expertise. In Sorkin’s presentation, Paulson’s PR problem stems from his obtuseness about humans. Paulson repeatedly proposes massive bailouts for the most elite banksters while providing no relief to the banksters’ victims. Similarly, he drafts a three-page bailout plan (TARP). The TARP draft exemplifies both of Paulson’s flaws. It is incompetent because it requires Treasury to make massive purchases of bad assets from the most fraudulent banksters. Putting aside, as Sorkin largely does, why this is terrible policy, Treasury cannot do it in the time required. Paulson should have known that from experience. He does not, and he does not have his staff work out the mechanics, which would have revealed that the plan would fail. The movie does a poor job of explaining why the three-page plan revealed Paulson’s obtuseness. The movie shows him as believing that simple and short is good, and mystified by the congressional hostility to the plan. (I believe the portrayal is false and that Paulson’s design of his plan was not obtuse but, unsuccessfully, devious and malign.) The movie lost both reality and power by offering a bland summary of the plan rather than quoting its key passage that was brief – and chilling. Sec. 8. Review. Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion, and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency. Paulson’s plan was neither simple nor concise. Indeed, the Treasury “plan” had no plan. It simply said that Paulson got a blank check for $700 billion in federal funds that he could use in any fashion he wanted – and that he was exempt from the normal rules of law. It was an astonishing power grab by Paulson to be used to convey massive amounts of money to the banksters and other cronies without any of the reviews we have historically found essential to prevent abuse. Sorkin’s emphasis on the personalities of elite bankers rather than analysis leads to a generally sympathetic treatment of the Nation’s worst banksters and an “out of history” failure to supply context essential to analytics. It is as if a problem arose in mid-2008, and Treasury was shocked that it arose. The reality is far different. First, Paulson led Goldman Sachs so heavily into purchasing toxic mortgage product that he endangered its survival. Paulson had considerable experience with the fraudulent origination by lenders, the fraudulent resale of those loans by lenders in the secondary market, and the fraudulent sale of derivatives supposedly collateralized by those toxic loans in the tertiary market. The industry called (behind closed doors) the loans and the derivatives “toxic” because they were pervasively fraudulent. Second, Goldman purchased large amounts of credit default swaps (CDS) from AIG as “protection” for its collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Toxic mortgages were the (supposed) primary underlying “collateral” for most CDOs. Paulson was uniquely well-placed to prevent the crisis. Paulson was unusual in knowing that Goldman and other banks had such large claims against AIG’s CDS that AIG was insolvent. Third, Paulson had known for over a decade that the CDO market depended on the absurdity of the rating agencies giving “AAA” ratings to the top tranche of the CDOs despite the toxic collateral and the massive housing bubble. Paulson knew that the top tranche of the average CDO represented 80% of the entire CDO. He knew that this meant that the top tranche had very little protection based on prioritization of rights to cash flows. This made its “AAA” rating laughable. Fourth, Paulson knew that CDOs had twice suffered losses so great that the CDO market collapsed. The felon Michael Milken created the first CDOs in 1987 (FCIC Report: 129). The collateral, which proved toxic, was junk bonds. George Akerlof and Paul Romer’s 1993 article “Looting: The Economic Underworld of Bankruptcy for Profit” discusses the evidence of the fraudulent inflation of junk bond asset values by Drexel Burnham Lambert. Junk bond prices fell sharply after Milken and then Drexel pleaded guilty to felonies and the first CDO market collapsed within two years. The second CDO market used a potpourri of overvalued, highly risky assets as the (grossly inadequate) collateral for CDOs. The CDO recipe has always been the same. You take greatly overvalued assets with ridiculously inadequate loss reserves and high credit (and sometimes interest rate) risk. The assets therefore have a relatively high nominal yield compared to safer assets that could really warrant “AAA” ratings. (The risk premium on the toxic assets, however, is too small to compensate for the greatly increased risk of the asset.) The credit rating agency then agrees to treat the bad assets as if they were great assets warranting “AAA” ratings. The pretext for this is that the CDO is “structured” to protect the top tranche, which receives the “AAA” rating. The problem with the pretext is that the top tranche is so large, and the assets are of such poor quality, that the structuring provides far too little protection against loss. The most typical bad assets used in the second CDO incarnation were mobile homes, aircraft leases, and mutual fund fees. The second CDO incarnation collapsed around 2002. The third CDO incarnation, which used home loans as the collateral, was a vastly superior fraud scheme than its two predecessors. It was far larger and home loans had long been exceptionally safe assets. The banksters knew, however, how to understate enormously the risk of a home loan, which inevitably overstates substantially the value of the asset. Most importantly, they (and Paulson) knew that it was child’s play to get the big three rating agencies to give “AAA” ratings to toxic assets. Paulson knew that the third incarnation of the CDO scam was likely to collapse and cause far larger losses than the first two incarnations. Fifth, there were repeated warnings about the massive housing bubble. Dean Baker deserves particular praise in this regard. The bubble stalled in 2006, and house prices in much of America began falling in late 2006. Sixth, fraudulently originated liar’s loans were the biggest single driver of the financial crisis. Paulson had nearly two decades of forewarning about liar’s loans. The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) examiners in the West Region figured out that lenders made liar’s loans for fraudulent purposes in 1990, within a year of liar’s loans becoming an emerging practice among Orange County, California thrifts. We promptly began driving liar’s loans out of the industry. Akerlof and Romer’s 1993 paper contains their conclusion (and our conclusion as regulators) that only fraudulent lenders would make such loans. The banking regulatory agencies, even under the second Prinesident Bush, warned lenders repeatedly against liar’s loans. For ideological reasons that Paulson embraced, the Bush administration refused to ban the pervasively fraudulent liar’s loans. MARI, the mortgage lending industry’s own anti-fraud experts, warned the industry in 2006 that the incidence of fraud in liar’s loans was 90 percent. They warned also that the regulators were discouraging such loans and that the first incarnation of such loans produced substantial losses. The industry response was to increase liar’s loans. By 2006, half the loans called “subprime” were also liar’s loans (the two categories are not mutually exclusive). About 40% of the loans originated in 2006 were liar’s loans. Paulson also received an early warning of the second great epidemic of loan origination fraud. The appraisers warned publicly beginning in 2000 that lenders were blacklisting honest appraisers who refused the demands of lenders and their agents that appraisers inflate the value of homes. The big banks like Goldman Sachs closely follow real estate valuation information. Surveys of appraisers in 2003 and 2006 found the percentage of appraisers personally subjected to such extortion rose to 90 percent. Paulson and Goldman also knew that once loans are fraudulently originated they can only be resold or packaged through fraudulent “reps and warranties.” They knew that secondary and tertiary markets sales of mortgage products were pervasively fraudulent. In 2004, the FBI informed everyone that followed finance (including Paulson and Goldman) that mortgage fraud was becoming “epidemic.” They knew that the FBI was predicting that the fraud epidemic would cause a financial “crisis” unless stopped. Paulson, once he became Treasury Secretary, never followed up on the FBI warning. That made him the norm under the Bush administration. No regulator got in touch with the FBI official that issued the warning. Seventh, by late 2006, the mortgage banks that originated primarily fraudulent loans began to fail. During 2007, hundreds of them failed due to their pervasive frauds. By the end of 2007, nearly every member of the entire mortgage banking industry that specialized in making nonprime loans had failed. Eighth, Paulson knew that the next dominoes to fall would be commercial and investment banks, and savings and loan institutions. The underlying problem that kills banks is typically credit losses, but a liquidity crisis is the quickest killer of financial institutions. Because of their size and deposit insurance, a liquidity crisis would take longer to destroy these banks than the (uninsured and smaller) mortgage banks. Specifically, it was apparent to Paulson and his successors at Goldman by late 2006 that Fannie, Freddie, Bear, Lehman, Merrill Lynch, and AIG would fail because they would suffer massive losses on fraudulently originated mortgages and fraudulently sold CDOs. (AIG had sold massive amounts of CDS protection for CDOs that would cause it losses well in excess of its capital.) By mid-2008, huge insured savings and loans such as Countrywide and Indymac that fraudulently originated massive amounts of loans were failing or being acquired to avoid failure. Paulson’s successor as Goldman’s leader clearly understood the danger. He began to dump the toxic mortgage products that Goldman held in portfolio, purchased on Paulson’s watch, on clients. Ninth, Paulson knew that regulation of the investment banks was Potemkin – because he played a key role in constructing the SEC’s fake regulation of the big five investment banks known as Consolidated Supervised Entity (CSE) program (FCIC Report: 150-155). He knew that the investment banks combined extraordinary leverage with enormous exposure to fraudulent mortgage product. Paulson knew that Goldman was desperately seeking to reduce its loss exposure, but Bear, Lehman, and Merrill Lynch were increasing their already fatal exposures. Tenth, Bear failed – and almost nobody wanted to purchase it. JPMorgan did want to buy it – but at a purchase price that Wall Street found to be exceptionally low. Eleventh, after Treasury assisted JPMorgan’s purchase of Bear in March 2008, everyone in finance knew that Fannie, Freddie, and Lehman were going to be the next huge entities to collapse. Treasury chose to put only three officials in Lehman to do due diligence on its operations and collateral. That was a preposterous decision – another example of Paulson (and Geithner’s) failure to gather essential information when it could still do some good. Reviewing the collateral would have immediately apprised Paulson and Geithner of the toxic quality of Lehman’s real estate and its immense liability for the hundreds of billions of dollars in fraudulently originated mortgages that it resold to others through fraudulent reps and warranties. Instead, Paulson further ruined his credibility by asserting that there was net positive value in Lehman and that its rivals should be rushing to buy it without Treasury providing financial assistance. Reviewing Lehman’s collateral and the claims of its creditors would have also revealed to Treasury something about Lehman that could have reduced the carnage. Treasury would have learned that Reserve Primary Fund had loaned heavily to Lehman on an unsecured basis and that when Lehman filed for bankruptcy the money market mutual fund would “break the buck.” That means its losses on its loans to the bankrupt Lehman would exceed its capital and people and firms who invested in the fund would suffer losses. Paulson knew that the fund’s primary investors were huge corporations and that “breaking the buck” would lead to immediate and massive withdrawals from the fund that would likely bankrupt it. Paulson also knew that this could lead to mass withdrawals from other money market mutual funds because the federal government does not insure such funds. It is unlikely that Paulson would have chosen to let Lehman fail had he known these facts about the Reserve Primary Fund’s loss exposure to Lehman. The combination of the Treasury and the Fed’s failure to check Lehman’s asset quality and creditors and Paulson’s decision to let Lehman fail led to the largest run in history. Only the extension of federal deposit insurance for a considerable time until the most acute phase of the crisis ended broke the $300 billion run on money market mutual funds. Lehman, Fannie, Freddie, and AIG all failed, and Bank of America acquired Merrill to prevent its failure within a few days of each other. Lehman’s imminent collapse drove the timing of these failures and acquisitions (as well as emergency capital infusions to the two surviving major investment banks by Mitsubishi and Warren Buffett). Lehman’s failure immediately created the $300 billion run on money market mutual funds. Financial markets globally began to cease functioning. Sorkin’s Three Related Theses Are False Paulson’s (Purported) Goal of Ending Too Big to Fail With this historical and analytical context in mind, we can analyze Sorkin’s key theses. Sorkin’s fundamental tension, and the basis for his sympathetic portrayal of Paulson, is Paulson’s (purported) desire to end federal bailouts of large failing financial institutions. The movie presents this as a noble goal for which even the New York Times praises Paulson. (We are supposed to ignore the circularity of the fact that Sorkin heavily influences that paper’s coverage of finance and the fact that Sorkin is Wall Street’s ‘sycophant-in-chief.’ We are supposed to believe that the NYT is unremittingly hostile to Wall Street and Bush’s top financial regulators, so if the NYT says anything nice about Paulson it must be a grudging admission of an inescapable and inconvenient truth.) (Spoiler alert about the movie.) The movie’s best moment of drama is when Paulson is walking down the street shortly after Lehman files for bankruptcy and he is startled to see the stock market is not collapsing. He calls his staff in confusion and they inform him that the markets love his decision not to bail out Lehman and that the NYT praised his decision. He promptly holds a triumphal press briefing claiming credit for standing firm against pleas for a bailout and cites the stock market reaction as proof that he did the right thing. The markets, however, are already tanking by the time he cites the stability as proof of his correct call. (The movie ignores the fact that the world’s largest run is also raging by the time he, falsely, claims credit for a supposedly courageous and principled decision to refuse to bail out Lehman.) Sorkin’s first thesis is false. First, once you allow a financial institution to become so big that its failure will cause a global crisis there are no good public policy options. Sporkin generally presents the issue as if it were an issue of toughness or principle, but that is bad analytics. If the regulator permits an unconstrained failure of a systemically dangerous institution (SDI) it will cause a global financial crisis. A global financial crisis is likely to cause a severe global recession or depression. No rational regulator creates a global recession or depression. Second, being “tough” by permitting an unconstrained failure that triggers a global financial crisis and a severe global recession does nothing to prevent future crises. Financial crises do not occur because there were past “bailouts” of SDIs. It is important to understand what “too big to fail” (TBTF) meant when regulators used that phrase. It did not mean that bank would not fail. Regulators put TBTF banks into receivership. It meant that the federal insurance funds paid general creditors in full even if the bank was insolvent. The purpose is to avoid cascade failures. The primary unsecured creditors of huge banks tend to be other huge banks. Regulators want to avoid the failure of one massive bank triggering the failure of a string of banks. Note that the “bailout” does not go to the shareholders or the subordinated debt holders (collectively, the “risk capital”). The typical criticism of TBTF is that the owners (shareholders) of giant banks are willing to take excessive risks because they know that if they fail the federal government will bail them out and prevent them from suffering any loss. That criticism is false, if the regulators place the failed TBTF bank into receivership or otherwise wipe out the risk capital. Paulson and Geithner seem not to have even understood the concept. They virtually never put TBTF institutions through receiverships or otherwise eliminated the risk capital as a condition of extending government assistance. Third, elite fraud epidemics led by financial CEOs drive financial crises. CEO banksters do not want to engage in “risk.” The want a “sure thing” as Akerlof and Romer emphasized. Fourth, Geithner, Bernanke, and Paulson did the opposite of preventing TBTF financial institutions. They took no regulatory steps to shrink TBTF banks to the point that they no longer posed a global risk when they failed. Worse, they consistently encouraged acquisitions of the largest failing financial institutions by even larger banks, making the TBTF problem far worse. There are strong reasons for believing that their explanation for their refusal to prevent Lehman’s unconstrained failure was a pretext. Fifth, Sorkin’s book, and reality, provide the real basis for their catastrophic decision to allow Lehman’s unconstrained collapse. Conservative Republicans and Bear’s rivals criticized Paulson relentlessly on ideological, political, and ad hominem grounds after he had Treasury bail out Bear. The personal attacks portrayed Paulson as weak. These attacks deeply troubled him. The Purported Willingness (and Ability) of the SDIs to Fix the Crisis is False Sorkin describes the SDIs as stepping up to the plate with their own capital to fund a resolution of Lehman through a privately funded bailout of its bad assets. The theme is the courage and responsibility of the CEOs of our Nation’s SDIs. Sorkin’s second thesis is false. The context is the meeting in which Paulson tried to play tough with the CEOs of America’s largest financial SDIs in connection with assisting Barclay’s acquisition of Lehman. Note that this acquisition would have created an even larger SDI, so it is bizarre that Sorkin pitches it as Paulson’s stand against SDIs. Barclays was (and remains) a bad, under-capitalized UK bank. Its management led a series of massive frauds and predation on customers. No responsible regulator would ever have considered it an acceptable acquirer of anything, much less a cesspool like Lehman. The UK regulators first hinted and then told Paulson that they would reject Barclays as a purchaser of Lehman. Lehman was insolvent and in a liquidity crisis – and that is ignoring its massive liabilities for its fraudulent sales of fraudulently originated mortgages through fraudulent reps and warranties. On top of that, it engaged in other major accounting abuses to hide its losses and its liquidity crisis. In particular, its real estate was worth less than half the inflated values that Lehman had on its books. The book and movie act as if Lehman’s insolvency and liquidity crisis were not real. They present the claim that the willingness of several CEOs to put in a billion dollars per firm would have sufficed to fill the hole in Lehman’s bad real estate assets (ignoring Lehman’s far larger liability for its fraudulent reps and warranties). The implication is that if the UK regulators had only approved Barclay’s acquisition of Lehman there would have been no crisis. The numbers do not come close to adding up. The private capital on (vague) offer (on terms that were never even sketched must less agreed to) was trivial compared to the size of the hole. AIG, Fannie, and Freddie had already collapsed. The big banks that purported to have “excess” capital demonstrated not their strength, but the grossly inadequate nature of capital requirements. Blaming Lehman’s Failure on the UK Regulators Is Absurd Sorkin thesis is that that Geithner and Paulson’s frantic efforts to avert the crisis by getting Barclays to buy Lehman with private financial protection against Lehman’s terrible real estate assets were on the verge of success. The pusillanimous UK regulators pulled the rug out from under these valiant U.S. public servants by vetoing Barclays’ purchase. The UK regulators refusal to allow the purchase was bizarre because the deal was a godsend for Barclays. I have refuted each aspect of this assertion. 602801 This entry was posted in Banking industry, Credit markets, Doomsday scenarios, Economic fundamentals, Federal Reserve, Free markets and their discontents, Guest Post, Media watch, Politics, Real estate, Regulations and regulators, Ridiculously obvious scams on February 14, 2017 by Yves Smith.

I have forwarded to many people around. I confess to buying the Sorkin book in NYC not long after publication. I gave it to the local library a year or two letter. It’s amazing how that rubbish is treated as gospel. I worked at Barclays from the spring of 2014 to the summer of 2016. I agree with Bill Black’s comments about the firm. I think the worse thing about the Lehman acquisition was the arrival of the Lehman bankers, many of whom still work for the bank. They added more poison to the well and still do. The arrival of executives from JP Morgan is not helping. There is a real cultural difference between the Americans / investment bankers and the Brits / corporate and retail bankers, not that the latter are blameless for the bombing out of the blue eagle, especially over a strategic issue like the withdrawal from Africa. The expectation is that once Jes Staley and his gang have left, the bank will return to the former colonies and probably buy a bank that is not a good fit, a la ABSA. I had the misfortune of working on securitisations with Lehman, Merrill and Bear from 2003 – 2006 at HSBC. My thoughts about them are unprintable for this blog. I am often not unhappy that the trio went bust. Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorFebruary 14, 2017 at 4:48 am Thanks for your comment. Since the Black post was so strong, I didn’t want to complicate matters by adding a clarification: the idea that the FSA nixed the Lehman deal is not accurate, even though it is widely accepted by virtue of having been flogged so hard by US authorities and not forcefully debunked by the FSA. While it is true that the FSA was not prepared to waive the one-month period required for Barclays to obtain shareholder approval, which would have required a US party, presumably the Fed, to backstop Lehman positions, there was a bigger impediment: the Barclays board wasn’t prepared to back the deal! Bob Diamond gave the US side the impression he was authorized to negotiate and make commitments when he wasn’t and Geithner convinced himself he could get the Brits to buy a pig in the poke. Interestingly, Paulson never thought a Barclay’s deal was on, which means the disorderly Lehman collapse was Geithner’s fault (even with a Lehman fail inevitable, doing so with a bare-bones bankruptcy filing assured that the damage was greater than it needed to be. Too Big to Fail does get a wee bit of credit in making clear that no one had alerted Lehman’s bankruptcy lawyer, Harvey Miller, the best in the business, that there was any real risk. And he made it was insane to do what he had to do, to put in a thin-form filing on a few hours’ notice.

The British government was not keen on the acquisition, either. I am surprised by the Barclays board’s reticence. They were / are seen as patsies for Bob Diamond. Staff there thought / think John Varley was a useful fig leaf, especially an upper class one who had married into one of the bank’s founding families, for the Barclays Capital clique led by Bob Diamond, Rich Ricci, Jerry del Missier and Tom Kalaris. Reply ↓ Tom_Doak February 14, 2017 at 9:28 am I hope you will consider going back to the library to which you donated the book and asking that they destroy it. You would not want some poor citizen to check it out and actually believe it as written ! Still, the greatest tragedy of the last generation is not the financial crisis; it’s that we have encouraged the brightest young minds of the past 25 years to apply their genius to figuring out ways to skim money from the rest of us. Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers February 14, 2017 at 10:44 am Thank you, Tom. That is a good idea. I agree with your comment about the tragedy (of the last generation). This is also allied, in the UK, to Thatcher’s children, a generation who got used to / are happy with “rugged individualism” and a muscular foreign policy.

Reply ↓ bmeisen February 14, 2017 at 5:15 am There’s hope. Maybe someday they’ll make a movie based Econned and Bill Black. I had no idea that Sorkin’s strip-joint soft sell had been filmed – OMG. I still want to know why Simon Johnson gave Sorkin a good review in the WaPo – after reading Johnson I went out and paid top-price for the hardcover. Thank you Yves for Econned. Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorFebruary 14, 2017 at 6:54 am Thanks for the kind words! FWIW, the TV movie got generally got lousy reviews (Wikipedia says 67/100). But sadly Sorkin clearly got paid for the screen rights and may have gotten additional fees for consulting.

Also for having seen the video of Enron’s CFO pitching to Banksters in the docu of “The Smartest Guys in the Room.” Reply ↓ Ian February 14, 2017 at 7:01 am When I read “Too Big To Fail” in 09 or 10, i was astonished that the word “subprime” was only mentioned 5 times in the entire book, and briefly, at that. A couple things; I never heard mention of TALF again,(troubled asset loan facility) wherein banks could borrow from the Fed against their (worthless) financial instruments at up to 100% on the dollar, and during the QE program, when the Fed was buying MBS (also worthless) to the tune of 85-100 bn$ per month, what was done w these MBS? Are the MBS part of the 3 trillion$ in “assets” on the fed’s balance sheet? Thanks. Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers February 14, 2017 at 7:53 am The worry about Bill Black’s article and this thread is that the people who are running banks and those who will in the decades to come are not interested in this (sort of discussion) and confuse Sorkin with an objective journalist. If there are books and DVDs that darken the dwellings of City employees, they are likely to be this one and The Big Short. Reply ↓ Didier February 15, 2017 at 8:27 pm Also “Inside Job”.

Wonder how he’ll dig the account in today’s (2/14) NYT Biz by Sorkin that gilds the repellent Schwarzman’s 70th birthday gala, festooned like a Christmas tree with Trump Cabinet appointees, with a bootlicking “populist” apologia for the 0.1%. Reply ↓ Katharine February 14, 2017 at 9:33 am Thanks for this historical review and analysis. It’s good to have something so comprehensive well after the fact. I still remember my incredulity listening to his presentation, that any grownup, let alone responsible official, would have the effrontery to come to Congress with a three-page proposal demanding lots of money and zero accountability and try to stampede them into approving it with quasi-hysterical blathering. It was like the shady contractor looking for gullible widows in a poor neighborhood, who tells them their houses need major work or they’ll fall down, and offers easy payment plans that just happen to include mortgages (no problem, just a formality, sign here). Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers February 14, 2017 at 10:55 am Thank you, Katharine. I wonder if Paulson got the practice from dealing with “muppet” clients and bootlicking politicians and officials when at Goldman.Having observed Goldman in London and Brussels and how they got / get away with it, I can see why Paulson would try that stunt. One morning in 2009 or 2010, my manager and I went to the (UK) Treasury to discuss capital adequacy reforms. My manager was on good terms with the Treasury official, so we brought coffees and Krispy Kremes to ease the discussion. It was about 9 am. At the building’s reception, a dozen Goldman staffers were strutting around as if they owned the place and looked at us / the sugar rush with undisguised contempt. I recall half a dozen incidents from 2008 – 12 where Goldman was allowed to get away with certain conduct or indulged by the authorities. No other firm would have been able to do so or been indulged.

There was a panel discussion about the financial crisis on television that was hosted by Sorkin. He shared the stage with Michael Lewis, Bethany McLean, and two or three others whose names I can’t recall. But, the moment that shocked everyone was when John J. Mack, CEO of Morgan Stanley, who was sitting in the audience, stood up and simply said to the panel, “You have to stop us.” Reply ↓ Peter Boardman February 14, 2017 at 6:13 pm Then along came Obama… Reply ↓ Chauncey Gardiner February 14, 2017 at 6:20 pm Thank you Bill Black for not allowing the banksters to write the history. And what a history of fraud, chutzpah, and disregard of the public interest for private gain it is! This critique of Sorkin’s hagiography is also a timely reminder of the nexus between corporate media and Wall Street as we witness the manic markets celebration of another Goldman appointee at Treasury this week and a possibly erroneous but widely shared perception of their control of We the People’s Treasury, financial markets, central banks, congress and the executive branch. Particularly appreciated Bill Black’s observations about the failure of Paulson and Geithner to shrink the size of the “TBTFs” so they no longer pose a risk, whether they had initiated legislation such as restoration of the Glass-Steagall Act or simply broken them up into smaller entities; as well as their failure to wash out the risk capital in receivership. I remain particularly concerned about the continuing failure to address the enormous over-the-counter derivatives exposures at the “TBTFs”. Just a couple of minor observations: ▪ Agree that Paulson’s plan was “devious and malign”. As I recall, his initial TARP bailout legislation in early October 2008 not only cynically carried a Mental Health title, but was very poorly written. ▪ The roles in the bailouts of Rep. Barney Frank and other senior members of Congress at that time remain obscure IMO. Reply ↓ JoeK February 16, 2017 at 1:07 am It would be nice to hear about the threat of Martial Law that Paulson made, to me that perfectly sums up the man and his coterie.

X Ireland lacks talent ‘quantity’ in scramble for Brexit finance firms Shortage of financial service skills could hinder Dublin in fight for companies fleeing City Tue, Feb 14, 2017, 08:16 Gavin Finch, John Detrixhe, and Peter Flanagan “Up to now, the type of finance jobs available in Ireland have generally not matched London for compensation and other perks.” That could change as City firms consider moving base in light of Brexit. Photograph: EPA/Justin Lane         When Rob Boardman is scouring Dublin to hire for his firm’s electronic broking and dark-pool business, it can take up to a year to find the right candidate. “It’s a question of quantity of talent, not quality,” said Boardman, European chief executive of Investment Technology Group, who has been recruiting in the city since 2010. “It can be hard to hire in financial services for front-office traders.” Dublin, with similar laws and regulations as the UK, is the only other English-speaking hub in the European Union, making the city a go-to option for London-based banks seeking uninterrupted EU access post-Brexit. But one big problem is a shortage of talent. More people work in finance in Edinburgh than in the whole of Ireland, posing a concern for the half-dozen global banks considering setting up camp here. “There are probably more Irish bankers working in London than there are in Dublin,” said Jonathan Astbury, partner in global markets at executive search firm Newington International. “There is still a sense among front-office types that if you’re not in London, you’re not at the cutting edge. Ultimately, London is going to remain the centre of the banking world for many years to come, so Dublin is going to be a hard sell for them to attract the best people.” Certain drawbacks Cities across Europe have begun courting banks and their high-paying roles. But potential locales all have their drawbacks. Financial firms have concerns over language issues, labour laws and taxes in Frankfurt and Paris. What will start as a trickle – banks plan to move only a couple of hundred jobs into their new bases at first – could become a torrent if it looks like the UK is heading for a “cliff edge” Brexit, whereby all EU access is cut off by 2019. ADVERTISEMENT Firms weighing Dublin for their new base will initially relocate Irish employees currently working in London, according to two people with knowledge of their firm’s contingency plans. There are about 35,000 people working in finance in Ireland, compared with more than 60,000 in Frankfurt, 180,000 in Paris and 360,000 in London. Goodbody estimates that Dublin could gain as many as 15,000 financial jobs from Brexit, and a talent shortage may not scare off banks that see Brexit as an opportunity to reduce costs. A few large international banks have held discussions about moving a small number of senior managers to their new EU hubs to train cheaper local hires while London jobs are cut, according to two recruiters who said they’ve had talks with the firms. Irish officials acknowledge that the country lacks the depth of banking talent available in other cities competing for Brexit spoils, but say they are confident they can attract workers from elsewhere in the EU. They point to the 250 financial institutions already in Dublin, including Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse Group, not to mention major tech firms such as Google, eBay and PayPal. “In the context of a UK which will potentially be outside the EU, where there won’t be such mobility, we are likely to win more of these highly skilled people coming to Ireland, and I think that’s the way our companies and potential investors are reading it,” said Martin Shanahan, chief executive of IDA Ireland. “If the skills are going to be available, they are going to be available in Ireland.” Incentive for Irish Brexit could help reverse a trend: For decades, the brightest Irish university graduates with ambitions in finance sought out their fortunes in the narrow lanes of London’s square mile, according to Denis Curran, the IDA’s head of international financial services. “If front-office or investment-banking jobs do come to Dublin as expected, then it would act as an incentive for Irish in those roles in London who may want to move back,” said Peter Cosgrove, a director at Dublin recruiting firm CPL. “Up to now, the type of finance jobs available in Ireland have generally not matched London for compensation and other perks. Already, we have seen a spike in inquiries from Irish in London and EU nationals who were considering moving to the UK but are looking closer at Dublin as an alternative.” Where all these people are going to live and work is another matter. Dublin already suffers from an acute shortage of residential housing, particularly at the top end. And while prices are significantly lower than in London, they’re rising fast. Vacancy rates for prime office space in the city centre are also at record lows. As well, Dublin is home to only five Michelin-starred restaurants – a must for any well-heeled investment banker. That is compared with more than 60 in London and 100 in Paris. – (Bloomberg)       Read More Credit Suisse to cut 5,500 jobs in 2017 after €2.3bn loss Irish Life health insurance wing loses almost €6m in five months Irish and UK PR agencies hired to work on possible AIB IPO Central bank allocates 28 out of 170 new staff to Brexit Hospital support staff to strike over pay dispute Britain’s Co-operative bank puts itself up for sale Insurance bosses see falling profits and Brexit as key challenges Payments group Monex surpasses €100m revenue milestone Irish firm in talks to buy up to 2,000 distressed mortgages How the Flash Crash Trader made $50m – and lost it again Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Health & Pharma Fyffes melon workers’ dispute escalates as takeover nears Technology 1:13 How a Dublin teenager is helping you bring your secrets to the grave Politics Cabinet discusses McCabe tribunal as focus remains on Kenny’s leadership Rugby Kieran Keane a strong contender be next Connacht coach Sponsored How Concur’s 10-step guide could help streamline your supplier invoice process Would you like customer insight with that?

(IDT®) (NASDAQ:IDTI) and GigPeak, Inc. (NYSE MKT:GIG) today announced that they have signed a definitive agreement for IDT to acquire GigPeak, Inc., for total cash consideration of $3.08 per share, or approximately $250 million in cash. This per share consideration would represent a premium of approximately 22% to GigPeak's closing share price on February 10, 2017. The acquisition of GigPeak provides IDT with a highly regarded optical interconnect product and technology business that is complementary to IDT's leadership position in real-time interconnect products. GigPeak's optical interface products are already broadly used by leading companies in the Communications, Cloud Data Center, and Military/Aviation markets. IDT will now provide seamless ultra-high speed data connectivity products using electrical, RF, and optical technologies. "GigPeak is a recognized leader in high performance Optical, RF, and Video Transport technology, and is a perfect fit for IDT. The products, technology, and culture of GigPeak all complement and represent an acceleration of our current strategy," said Gregory Waters, IDT President & CEO. "We gain an exceptional group of talented people and valuable intellectual property with the GigPeak team, and welcome them into one of the most innovative companies in the semiconductor industry." "IDT's acquisition of GigPeak will be a meaningful milestone for all of our stakeholders -- stockholders, employees, customers and partners," said Dr. Avi Katz, Founder, Chairman and CEO of GigPeak, Inc. "We find an exceptional culture, customers, business and technology compatibility with IDT, and we are delighted to join this fine team. Upon the consummation of this acquisition, our leading product suite, which currently addresses the need for greater bandwidth across the network, will now have the advantage of leveraging the scale of resources and broad distribution channels of IDT." Offer Recommended by GigPeak Board of Directors Under the terms of the merger agreement, IDT will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of GigPeak for $3.08 per share. The implied fully-diluted equity value of the offer amounts to approximately $250 million. The Boards of Directors of both GigPeak and IDT have unanimously approved the terms of the merger agreement, and the Board of Directors of GigPeak has resolved to recommend that stockholders accept the offer, once it is commenced. The acquisition is structured as an all-cash tender offer for all outstanding issued common stock of GigPeak followed by a merger in which remaining shares of GigPeak would be converted into the same dollar per share consideration as in the tender offer. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition, and completion is anticipated during the second calendar quarter of 2017. The transaction is subject to customary conditions, including the tender of the majority of the outstanding GigPeak shares and the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The transaction is expected to close during the second calendar quarter of 2017. GigPeak is expected to be delisted from the NYSE MKT and integrated into IDT thereafter. Cowen and Company, LLC and Needham & Company, LLC acted as financial advisers and Crowell & Moring LLP acted as legal adviser to GigPeak. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC acted as exclusive financial adviser to IDT and provided financing commitment for the transaction, and Latham & Watkins LLP acted as legal adviser to IDT. Conference Call IDT management will host a conference call on Tuesday, February 14, 2017 to discuss the transaction at 5:00 a.m. PT / 8:00 a.m. ET.

The call will also be webcast live on the IDT website at www.idt.com and on the GigPeak website at www.gigpeak.com.

By: Reuters | Tokyo | Published:February 14, 2017 9:01 am Japanese stocks edged down on Tuesday morning, with Toshiba Corp’s falling as investors brace for the industrial conglomerate to book a massive multibillion dollar writedown . (Source: Reuters Photo) Japanese stocks edged down on Tuesday morning, with Toshiba Corp’s falling as investors brace for the industrial conglomerate to book a massive multibillion dollar writedown when it reports earnings shortly. Many investors were also sidelined ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s semi-annual testimony on policy later in the global day. The Nikkei share average was down 0.1 percent at 19,429.84 in midmorning trade, pulling back from more than one-month highs scaled on the previous day. WATCH WHAT ELSE IS IN THE NEWS Toshiba shares slumped 2.0 percent as investors wait on its earnings at 0300 GMT when the company is set to uncover the scale of a multi-billion dollar writedown from cost overruns at its U.S. nuclear arm, along with a recovery plans as it scrambles for cash. Exporters were mixed, with Toyota Motor Corp shedding 0.3 percent, Honda Motor Co falling 0.3 percent, and Panasonic Corp rising 0.3 percent. Yellen is due to present the U.S. central bank’s semi-annual report on monetary policy and the economy in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee later in the day, followed by a the semi-annual monetary testimony before the House Financial Committee on Wednesday. With the Fed’s policy path still a key catalyst for global asset markets, Yellen’s comments will be closely watched for any further clarity on rate increases over the rest of this year. Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said Japanese stocks will likely take cues from the dollar-yen moves, which may be influenced by Yellen’s comments. “Since the Nikkei has recovered from its recent lows, investors started to be cautious about its valuations,” Shigemi said. On Tuesday, the dollar was slightly lower at 113.69 yen , below Monday’s high of 114.17 but well above a 10-week low of 111.59 yen touched a week ago. Nikon Corp dived 13 percent after the company warned of a net loss of 9 billion yen for the year ending March, wider than a loss of 6 billion yen it had expected earlier. CLSA cut its rating to “sell” from “underperform”, saying that it is making progress in restructuring but for a second straight quarter, it cut its guidance for the full year as it has lower expectations for the imaging and instrument segments.

Many investors were also sidelined ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's semi-annual testimony on policy later in the global day The Nikkei share average was down 0.1 percent at 19,429.84 in midmorning trade, pulling back from more than one-month highs scaled on the previous day. Toshiba shares slumped 2.0 percent as investors wait on its earnings at 0300 GMT when the company is set to uncover the scale of a multi-billion dollar writedown from cost overruns at its U.S. nuclear arm, along with a recovery plans as it scrambles for cash. Exporters were mixed, with Toyota Motor Corp shedding 0.3 percent, Honda Motor Co falling 0.3 percent, and Panasonic Corp rising 0.3 percent. Yellen is due to present the U.S. central bank's semi-annual report on monetary policy and the economy in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee later in the day, followed by a the semi-annual monetary testimony before the House Financial Committee on Wednesday. With the Fed's policy path still a key catalyst for global asset markets, Yellen's comments will be closely watched for any further clarity on rate increases over the rest of this year. Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said Japanese stocks will likely take cues from the dollar-yen moves, which may be influenced by Yellen's comments. "Since the Nikkei has recovered from its recent lows, investors started to be cautious about its valuations," Shigemi said. On Tuesday, the dollar was slightly lower at 113.69 yen , below Monday's high of 114.17 but well above a 10-week low of 111.59 yen touched a week ago. Nikon Corp dived 13 percent after the company warned of a net loss of 9 billion yen for the year ending March, wider than a loss of 6 billion yen it had expected earlier. CLSA cut its rating to "sell" from "underperform", saying that it is making progress in restructuring but for a second straight quarter, it cut its guidance for the full year as it has lower expectations for the imaging and instrument segments. The broader Topix dropped 0.2 percent to 1,441.86 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 fell 0.2 percent to 13,914.72.

"It can be hard to hire in financial services for front-office traders." Dublin shares similar laws and regulations as its U.K. neighbor and is the only other English-speaking hub in the European Union, making the city a go-to option for London-based banks seeking uninterrupted EU access post Brexit. One big problem: a talent shortage. More people work in finance in Edinburgh than in the whole of Ireland, posing a concern for the half-dozen global banks who are considering setting up camp there. "There are probably more Irish bankers working in London than there are in Dublin,” said Jonathan Astbury, partner in global markets at executive search firm Newington International. “There is still a sense among front-office types that if you’re not in London, you’re not at the cutting edge. Ultimately, London is going to remain the center of the banking world for many years to come, so Dublin is going to be a hard sell for them to attract the best people."   While cities across Europe have begun courting banks and their high-paying roles, all the potential locales have their drawbacks. Financial firms have concerns over language issues, labor laws and taxes in Frankfurt and Paris. What will start as a trickle -- banks plan to move only a couple of hundred jobs into their new bases at first -- could quickly become a torrent if it looks like the U.K. is heading for a "cliff edge" Brexit, whereby all EU access is cut off by 2019. Firms weighing Dublin for their new base plan to initially relocate Irish employees currently working in London, according to two people with knowledge of their firm’s contingency plans. Lacking Depth There are about 35,000 people working in finance in Ireland, compared with more than 60,000 in Frankfurt, 180,000 in Paris and 360,000 in London. Goodbody, Ireland’s oldest stockbroking firm, estimates that Dublin could gain as many as 15,000 financial jobs from Brexit. The talent shortage may not scare off banks that see Brexit as an opportunity to reduce costs. A few large international banks have held discussions about moving a small number of senior managers to their new EU hubs to train cheaper local hires while London jobs are cut, according to two recruiters who said they’ve had talks with the firms. Read more: The Brexit exodus -- a QuickTake Q&A Irish officials acknowledge that the country lacks the depth of banking talent available in other cities competing for Brexit spoils, but say they are confident they can attract workers from elsewhere in the EU. They point to the 250 financial institutions already in Dublin, including Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG. Major tech firms, such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google, EBay Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc., also have European operations there. Moving Back "In the context of a U.K. which will potentially be outside the EU where there won’t be such mobility, we are likely to win more of these highly skilled people coming to Ireland, and I think that’s the way our companies and potential investors are reading it," said Martin Shanahan, the CEO of IDA Ireland, the agency tasked with attracting international investment. "If the skills are going to be available, they are going to be available in Ireland." There’s a wide range of financial companies considering an Irish outpost. Besides the largest banks, trading platforms like currency venue LMAX Exchange and Bats Global Markets Inc.’s London unit are also on the list. Chicago-based derivatives behemoth CME Group Inc. has examined Dublin as it seeks to ensure its clearinghouse retains access to EU customers, people familiar with the discussions said in November. Brexit could help reverse a trend: For decades, the brightest Irish university graduates with ambitions in finance have sought out their fortunes in the narrow lanes of London’s square mile, according to Denis Curran, the IDA’s head of international financial services.

Sign Up “If front-office or investment-banking jobs do come to Dublin as expected, then it would act as an incentive for Irish in those roles in London who may want to move back," said Peter Cosgrove, a director at Dublin recruiting firm CPL. "Up to now, the type of finance jobs available in Ireland have generally not matched London for compensation and other perks. Already, we have seen a spike in inquiries from Irish in London and EU nationals who were considering moving to the U.K. but are looking closer at Dublin as an alternative." Where all these people are going to live and work is another matter. Dublin already suffers from an acute shortage of residential housing, particularly at the top end, a legacy of the country’s property crash. And while prices are significantly lower than in London, they’re rising fast. Vacancy rates for prime office space in the city center are also at record lows. And Dublin is home to only five Michelin-starred restaurants -- a must for any well-heeled investment banker -- compared with more than 60 in London and 100 in Paris.

Ogg February 13, 2017 1:55 pm EST Print Email Tweet When markets hit all-time highs and create even more milestones, sometimes there are interesting observations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average went above the 20,000 mark in the latest rally, only to eclipse 20,400 on Monday, February 13, 2017. The S&P 500 is far more important to investors because it is 500 of the largest U.S. companies, with a weighting by market cap, rather than just 30 stocks where the weighting is based on share price. Now investors have to consider something new. The S&P 500 hit a market capitalization of $20 trillion, which means that the value of the S&P 500 is now just over the U.S. total debt. The U.S. Debt Clock shows that the U.S. national debt is just under the $19.975 trillion mark on February 13. There are several other considerations here. We received an email from S&P that even on February 1, 2017, the S&P 500 was valued at 19.4 times 2016 earnings. The S&P was also valued at 17.4 times expected 2017 earnings (per share), a level hit in 2015 but not seen in a decade. While many tech stocks like Apple have been winning here, the reality is that financials, materials, industrials and infrastructure have all continued to be the post-election winners. The no-growth dividend payers and defensive stocks have been laggards to mixed as investors have focused on growth and reflation. Now go back to the absolute lows when the S&P 500 hit 666 in March of 2009. This was the selling zenith, and that means they bull market is now eight years old. The S&P 500 has risen about 240% since the V-bottom of the market. Apple shares are now challenging all-time highs, but other Dow stocks and S&P 500 stocks have hit all-time highs too: Allstate, Costco, Deere, EA, General Dynamics, Home Depot, Honeywell, JPMorgan, Netflix, Norfolk Southern, Southwest Air and many more. The media Dow dividend yield is 2.85%, versus the yields on the 10-year Treasury at 2.44% and 3.04% on the 30-year Treasury. Gold was last seen trading down almost $7.00 at $1,223.11 per ounce and NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil was down $1.00 at $52.86. S&P’s latest month-end data showed that there is over $7.8 trillion benchmarked to the S&P 500 Index, and the actual index assets were about $2.2 trillion in total. BlackRock now manages $5 trillion in total assets around the world, followed by $4 trillion by Vanguard. Other asset managers with north of $2 trillion in assets under management (all classes that is) were last seen as UBS, State Street, Fidelity, Allianz and perhaps JPMorgan after a recent short-term asset win. These two images from the U.S. Debt Clock and Reuters show that each crucial level is $20 trillion.

Adrian Cheng, the Harvard-educated heir apparent of New World Development Co. and Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd., is in focus after his 69-year-old father, Henry, recently went on leave because of an unspecified illness. The companies declined to comment on media reports that the senior Cheng had a stroke. When the 36-year-old scion ultimately takes over from his father, he will be in charge of a conglomerate that controls one of the city’s biggest property developers, runs the Carlyle Hotel in New York City and operates a chain of jewelry stores that generates about 80 percent more revenue than Tiffany & Co. globally. Today, the family controls four listed companies with a total market value of more than USD25 billion, as well as some that are closely held. Yet challenges abound for Cheng. If he were to take over now, he would be facing declining margins in the family’s main property-development business and slumping demand for high-end jewelry. He’d also face the challenges of retaining decades of connections his elders built up and rebuilding investor trust after past family missteps raised concerns about corporate governance. “He needs to prove himself,” said Joseph P.H. Fan, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who has researched family-run businesses for two decades. “He doesn’t need to be a know-it-all in business operations because the professional teams will do it for him, but he needs to prove he’s capable of bringing everyone together.” Despite his youth, the grandson of the late magnate Cheng Yu-tung has been groomed for years and already juggles more than a dozen titles, including vice chairman of New World Development and executive director at Chow Tai Fook. The Cheng clan isn’t alone in preparing for succession, which is increasingly looming large at some of the biggest businesses in Hong Kong, where the landscape is dominated by a handful of tycoons. That’s as those moguls, many of whom were Chinese refugees who fled Japanese invaders in the 1940s, approach retirement age. Henderson Land Development Co.’s billionaire chairman Lee Shau Kee turned 89 last month, an anniversary that Hong Kong’s richest man,  CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.’s Li Ka-shing, will hit in July. As to the Cheng family’s next leader, below are some of the biggest challenges he faces: PROPERTY, JEWELRY DOWNTURNS Hong Kong may boast the world’s most-expensive housing market, but that’s not necessarily benefiting New World. Higher land costs are likely to squeeze developers’ profit margins, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The brokerage estimates projects using land bought last year will probably yield margins of 22 percent when they are completed, versus returns of 32 percent on real estate bought in 2011. To cope with the tougher environment in Hong Kong, New World in recent years has been looking to increase its proportion of property in China’s first-tier cities by disposing of projects in smaller cities — a move that Macquarie Group Ltd. analyst Raymond Liu in December applauded as likely to “unlock value.” At Chow Tai Fook, profits have fallen for two and a half years to their lowest levels since 2011 as an anti-corruption drive in China sapped demand for luxury products and as tourism in Hong Kong waned. In December, retail sales in the city dropped for their 22nd straight month, dragged down by a slump in demand for jewelry, watches and valuable gifts. Though Cheng declined to comment for this story, he said in an interview last year that he would step up Chow Tai Fook’s focus on attracting millennials by introducing more fashionable jewelry designs and pushing his brands globally. “In the next 10 years, Chinese brands, Chinese originality, Chinese creativity will be part of the world’s realm,” Cheng said in November. “People will be going back and talking about what’s cool in China, instead of what’s cool in the U.S.” Cheng, who is an art enthusiast and has a bachelor’s degree from Harvard University, has opened shopping centers merged with galleries and a mall targeting children. DWINDLING CONNECTIONS At his grandfather’s funeral last year, pallbearers included current and former heads of Hong Kong and Macau, as well as the only two people in the city richer than the deceased: Li Ka-shing and Lee Shau Kee. The proceeding helped illustrate how connected his grandfather was. For Adrian Cheng to succeed, it will be crucial for him to retain relationships within the family and stakeholders because “Hong Kong has barely known this guy,” said Chinese University’s Fan. Family firms lose almost 60 percent of their value each time leadership is transferred from one generation to the next, as they fail to pass on intangible assets such as relationships and trust, according to Fan. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Shares of the Cheng family’s New World Development have, on average, traded at 45 percent of the company’s book value in the past five years, the worst performer based on that measure in Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Behind the discount are governance concerns. When Henry Cheng first took over the family business in the late ’80s, he kicked off a series of acquisitions, including the purchase of the Ramada hotel chain and Wing On (Holdings) Ltd. That drove up the family empire’s debts so high that the founder stepped back in and sold some assets. Though past stumbles have soured investors’ perceptions about the group, the younger Cheng is in a position to reverse those perceptions, according to Raymond Cheng, Hong Kong- based analyst at CIMB Securities Ltd., who isn’t related to the family behind New World. “Even if Henry were to take a long leave, I don’t see a problem elevating Adrian’s role,” the analyst said. “It wouldn’t be bad news for him to fully take over.” Prudence Ho, Daniela Wei, Bloomberg Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Categories Business Headlines Share This Post Related Posts Singapore to ease VC rules to promote financing for startups Toyota hopes revamped plug-in sells better than first model  Hong Kong | TVB sweetens buyback offer; shares soar Singapore still sees value in F1, tourism chief says No Comments Cancel Reply Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

Finance Search US stocks end at record highs, extending 'Trump effect' rallyAFP – Mon, Feb 13, 2017 10:33 PM AEDT Wall Street stocks sprinted to another day of fresh records Monday, extending last week's rally on expectations President Donald Trump will soon present his promised tax cut plan. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7 percent to close the day at 20,412.16. The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to end 2,328.25, as did the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index up 0.5 percent to 5,763.96. It was the third straight session that all three major indices ended at all-time highs following Trump's comments Thursday that he plans to release details about a "phenomenal" tax cut plan in the next two to three weeks. "It's just a carry over from last week," said Bill Lynch, director of investment at Hinsdale Associates. "The market seems to be giving Trump the benefit of the doubt." Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said, "I am getting a sense of a party atmosphere and investors just do not want to be left out." Among the winners, several banks climbed on expectations that Trump will ease regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup all rose more than one percent. Technology shares with larger gains included Amazon, up 1.1 percent, and Tesla Motors, up 4.2 percent. Apple climbed 0.9 percent to finish at an all-time closing high of $133.29. But mobile phone companies were on the downswing after Verizon said it would sell unlimited data packages, a sign of rising competition among providers. Verizon lost 0.9 percent, AT&T fell 1.8 percent and T-Mobile US dropped 2.4 percent. Zeltiq Aesthetics, a maker of body sculpting technology that essentially freezes away fat, surged 13.2 percent after agreeing to be acquired by Allergan for $2.5 billion. Allergan rose 0.2 percent. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries rose 5.6 percent after reporting a fourth-quarter loss of $973 million due to the write down of assets from a recent acquisition. Despite the loss, analysts said they were reassured by the generic drug maker's confirmation of its earnings outlook.

Mexican output growth is projected to slow to a near halt in 2017, the WSJ’s Robbie Whelan reports, with business investment tumbling amid long-term concern over Mexico’s dependence on exports. Exports account for a third of the country’s economic activity, and some 80% of those go to the U.S. Mexico’s leaders are speeding up negotiations for expanded trade deals with the European Union and opened talks with Argentina and Brazil aimed at easing the country’s dependence on U.S. grain” [Wall Street Journal]. #OrovilleDam Alert reader Bob got interested and provide some material. Here’s a useful video giving a helicopter’s-eye view. Note that this video was taken before the emergency spillway was used. They knew they had a problem before they had to use it. Bob comments: “[A]t about 6:30 they zoom in and show a concrete pumper truck with a concrete truck feeding it. They are trying to ‘patch’ an area below the emergency spillway with A) boulders and then B) grout. Where those pumper trucks are is where they think they have the problem.” Bob summarizes: They have 2 ongoing problems, one new, one old: 1) the spill way is not intact. The main spillway is broken. They can’t do much to fix it, and the hole keeps getting bigger, although it’s far enough from the lake and impoundments that it’s not undermining them. 2) the emergency spillway. This is getting lost in the newz mess. That area to the left that’s meant to shed water is apparently being undermined by the water flowing over it for the first time ever. That’s the area with the pumper trucks, just next to the higher wall for the main spillway. Not sure how it’s being undermined, but it looks like it is being undermined. This is geology of the existing hlll, and I can’t add anything to it. It may be concrete tied to bedrock (should be) but I don’t know. Too much other mess there to see. Water like this tends to scour down til it can’t anymore. To which I would add 3) they need to lower the lake so predicted rain later this week doesn’t overtop the dam. So, they have to use the spillways to do that, but using the spillways is dangerous. I don’t envy them the trade-offs. Hey, as long as the cores don’t melt… * * * Here’s a handy diagram showing the dam and the spillways: #Orovilledam graphic by @CA_DWR Shows threatened auxiliary spillway. pic.twitter.com/FyJJP4e3AU &mdash; Kurt H (@khphotos) February 13, 2017 “Live updates: Mass evacuation below Oroville Dam as officials frantically try to make repairs before new storms” [Los Angeles Times]. “More than 100,000 people were told to evacuate because of a ‘hazardous situation’ involving the Northern California dam’s emergency spillway. At one point, the [National Weather Service] warned that the auxiliary spillway was expected to fail and could send an ‘uncontrolled release of flood waters from Lake Oroville.’ However, by late Sunday night, officials said the immediate threat had passed because water had stopped washing over the emergency spillway.” “Water stops spilling over Oroville auxiliary spillway” [KCRA]. “While evacuation orders remain in place for many communities and cities around Lake Oroville and downstream along the Feather River, Lake Oroville has fallen below 100 percent capacity of 901 feet to 896 feet — 3,489,000 acre-feet of water — as of 9:30 a.m., according to the California Department of Water Resources. At its peak, the lake was at 902.59 feet… However, officials are still looking to lower the lake another 50 feet — or more than 675,000 acre-feet of water — to allow space in the lake for the upcoming storm, projected to arrive Thursday. ” UPDATE There was an inspection of the spillway at first light (see here), but I can’t find information that gives the results, hours later [snarl]. Readers? “Oroville Dam: Feds and state officials ignored warnings 12 years ago” [San Jose Mercury News]. “Three environmental groups — the Friends of the River, the Sierra Club and the South Yuba Citizens League — filed a motion with the federal government on Oct. 17, 2005, as part of Oroville Dam’s relicensing process, urging federal officials to require that the dam’s emergency spillway be armored with concrete, rather than remain as an earthen hillside.” See also “State was warned about inadequacy of emergency spillway” [Oroville Mercury Register]. More quotes from locals and activists. UPDATE “Too much water: How Oroville Dam problems became a crisis” [Los Angeles Times]. “With northern Sierra precipitation levels tracking ahead of the wettest year on record so far this winter, Oroville managers have a nerve-racking several months ahead of them. “There’s a lot of snow up there,” said Bill Croyle, acting director of the Department of Water Resources.” Yikes. So the story isn’t over with this week’s storm to come. Unless it is. “PHOTOS: Oroville Dam Spillway Trouble and Evacuation” [KQED]. Politics Trump Transition “Moreover, given some past comments by Mr. Trump and his aides, many companies worry that the administration plans new restrictions on visas for high-skilled workers from abroad, among other potential changes to the immigration system that could be unwelcome to Silicon Valley” [Wall Street Journal, “Trump Takes on Tech Industry in Early Policy Moves”]. That’s the lead. UPDATE “Reality check: After three weeks, Trump has hit a Washington wall” [USA Today]. “‘Being head of a family business is just about the worst preparation imaginable for the institutional constraints of Washington,’ says William Galston, a veteran of the Clinton White House staff. ‘Donald Trump is in for a set of experiences that will be entirely novel to him.'” That’s why Trump needs his own James Baker; but one doesn’t seem to be on offer. That said, volatility voters didn’t elect Trump because he wouldn’t rock the boat. And surely Galston knows that the Clinton Dynasty is, exactly and precisely, a family business? UPDATE “Turmoil at the National Security Council, From the Top Down” [New York Times]. One way to shovel back the tide of bullshit is to look at the sourcing. Six paragraphs down, here it is: This account of life inside the council — offices made up of several hundred career civil servants who advise the president on counterterrorism, foreign policy, nuclear deterrence and other issues of war and peace — is based on conversations with more than two dozen current and former council staff members and others throughout the government. All spoke on the condition that they not be quoted by name for fear of reprisals. So the access journalism here could be true, even given priors at the Times. What I get out of the story: The Blob is pissed. And if Trump really is the person he is portrayed as being — Baby Hitler, a lunatic with his hands on the button, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera — you’d think that at least one of these sources would be willing to risk their career by going on the record about it. But no. UPDATE “Trump’s national security adviser Flynn trying to survive crisis” [Reuters]. Same deal. Let’s look at the sourcing: “officials said.” Oh, OK. Again, if the story means that Flynn is a traitor or a Russian stooge, doesn’t it make sense that somebody would be willing to go on the record about it? UPDATE “The Spy Revolt Against Trump Begins” [The Observer]. Begins? Begins?! What’s interesting is that The Observer is Kushner’s house organ. So WTF? “‘President Trump is backtracking on every economic promise he made to the American people,’ Mr. Sanders, (I., Vt.), said on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday. ‘He is appointing Wall Street bankers, the same people he told us he would oppose, to very high positions'” [Wall Street Journal]. “Mr. Sanders, who has emerged as a leader of Democratic Party progressives, also pointed to pledges by Mr. Trump not to cut entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.” Gotta love Bernie, plugging away on actual vote-getting policies amidst the pearl-clutching and yammering. I mean, come on. If we didn’t appoint bankers to high office, would that end racism? No! UPDATE Sanders in West Virginia: “‘So what if you lose, you’ll win the next time,’ Sanders said. ‘Let me just tell you, I also know one of the things that really troubles me when I talk to people, they say, ‘You know Bernie, I just don’t know enough about education or economics or health care to run.’ I work in the United States Senate. If you saw some of the guys in the United States Senate, your confidence in yourself would soar” [Charleston Gazette-Mail]. Realignment and Legitimacy “Every leading contender to take over the Democratic National Committee believes Hillary Clinton focused too much on attacking Donald Trump at the expense of articulating an affirmative case for holding the White House” [which they’ve obviously doubled down on, along with doubling down on every other tactic that failed]. During their final showdown before the chairman’s election in Atlanta on Feb. 25, there was consensus that the party’s problems derive mainly from subpar organization and communication — not anything fundamental” [WaPo]. Like organization isn’t fundamental. And one of the few lessons I retained from organization behavior is that communication is never the problem. Perez is the clear front-runner, but he still does not have the votes locked up. With backing from key figures in Barack Obama’s orbit (Joe Biden) and the Clinton machine (Terry McAuliffe), he is the establishment favorite. But his progressive bona fides are beyond question, from his tenure as a Montgomery County councilman to helming the Justice Department’s civil rights division. That makes it hard for Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), who won an early endorsement from Sanders and Chuck Schumer, to get too far to Perez’s left. That is part of the explanation for why the chairman’s race lacks much ideological tension. Well, there is that little matter of the Podesta mail where Perez explains to the DNC how to smear Sanders as a racist. But other than that… UPDATE “The DNC Contenders Are Not Interested In Your Populist Moment” [HuffPo]. “Many committed Democrats are following the DNC race as a fight for the future of the party. After a devastating presidential defeat and nearly a decade of steady losses in Congress and at the state level, there aren’t many other political battles for party activists to focus on. But the candidates themselves are not catering to grass-roots organizers or rank-and-file voters. They’re seeking the support of a majority of DNC members ― mostly state party leaders and political appointees ― and doing their damnedest to avoid ruffling any feathers.” UPDATE “Three weeks into President Trump’s term, the Democratic Party and progressive establishment have almost entirely adopted the demands of a restive, active and aggressive base” [WaPo]. BWA-HA-HA-HA!!!!!!!!! I mean, really? The Democrats are now supporting Medicare for All? Did I not get the memo? “You don’t know who does what in a bloc, you don’t look to find out. If bodies run out of formation to take a rock to a Starbucks window, they melt back to the bloc in as many seconds. Bodies reconciled, kinetic beauty” [Natasha Leonard, The Nation]. I remember Graeber peddling the same nauseating stuff from his own comfortable perch. And so what if half the black bloc are cops? Ego, ego, ego. Stats Watch There are no official statistics today, so I’ll catch up on The Bezzle. Supply Chain: “Dutch payments company Adyen saw a big jump in the number of transactions it processed last year for clientele including Facebook, Airbnb, Spotify, Uber and Netflix. Transaction volume increased by 80 percent on-year to $90 billion in 2016, the company said on Wednesday” [CNBC]. “While Adyen’s 2016 revenue is yet to be released, in 2015 it earned about $350 million in revenue against a transaction volume of $50 billion — which means Adyen grossed about 0.7 percent of every dollar processed in 2015. The company says it’s been profitable since 2011.” Supply Chain: “[Kellog’s,] the maker of Froot Loops, Pop-Tarts and Keebler cookies will ship its goods to the stores’ own warehouses and leave it up to grocery chains to manage the movement to their retail sites. Kellogg says it’s following its customers who are increasingly doing their shopping online, a shift that is chipping away at the traditional economics behind supplier-store relationships. At Kellogg, that will mean shuttering 39 U.S. distribution centers with more than 1,000 workers as it consolidates moves to grocery warehouses” [Wall Street Journa]. Shipping: “‘Aggressive’ cape scrap price could entice owners to head for the beach” [Splash 247]. “Global shipowning body BIMCO warned recently that far more scrapping is needed in dry bulk to try and right the still troubled supply/demand equilibrium. BIMCO said it is vital that 30m dwt of bulkers are scrapped this year as there is a serious influx of new tonnage coming in from Asian yards this year and next.” Why don’t we just set up the shipyards right on the beach, then? Wouldn’t that be more direct? Shipping: “While US east coast ports reported increased volumes in 2016, there is little evidence of a boost in volumes from the expanded Panama Canal, according to new research from SeaIntel” [Lloyd’s List]. Concentration: “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox” [Lina M. Khan, Yale Law Journal]. “Amazon is the titan of twenty-first century commerce. In addition to being a retailer, it is now a marketing platform, a delivery and logistics network, a payment service, a credit lender, an auction house, a major book publisher, a producer of television and films, a fashion designer, a hardware manufacturer, and a leading host of cloud server space. Although Amazon has clocked staggering growth, it generates meager profits, choosing to price below-cost and expand widely instead. Through this strategy, the company has positioned itself at the center of e-commerce and now serves as essential infrastructure for a host of other businesses that depend upon it. Elements of the firm’s structure and conduct pose anticompetitive concerns—yet it has escaped antitrust scrutiny.” The Bezzle: “Amazon does have a very complex system in place for weeding out counterfeits. These processes range from taking action based off of buyer and seller complaints to a sophisticated algorithm that spiders through all the pages on the site, flagging potential counterfeits and dumping them into a massive queue for fraud prevention teams to inspect manually. It is in this later stage where the system appears to break down” [Forbes]. “Michael Jakubek, who worked on Amazon’s fraud and abuse prevention teams between 2004 and 2012, stated bluntly that the quality of the Amazon marketplace comes down to the quality of these manual investigations. He posits that one of the main reasons why so many counterfeit listings continue falling through the gaps of Amazon’s quality control dragnet is that these investigation teams are not simply being trained or administered properly. ‘The big problem with this is that the investigators get rewarded based on how quickly they go,’ Jakubek said. ‘There’s no reason they can’t identify that these sellers are bad, but they’re compensated to go so quickly that they typically just do really cursory reviews.'” The Bezzle: “Despite passing the big-scary-number and terrifying-narrative tests, the college debt burden just doesn’t quite analogize so well with the housing collapse. Though there are some factors that weigh on the side of eventual catastrophe – the debt can’t be extinguished in bankruptcy, the population of borrowers are particularly vulnerable to suasion and fraud – there are more differences than similarities” [Dealbreaker]. “For one thing, Goldman won’t build a credit-default swap for you based on some student loan metric.

The Bezzle: “I can report that [the Tesla Model S] autopilot works perfectly on motorways, and adequately on undivided A-roads, but you probably shouldn’t use it on B-roads unless you’re feeling brave. Basically, autopilot’s primary mode of operation is following road markings. If there aren’t any central or side lines, autopilot attempts to follow the car in front—and if there’s no car in front, autopilot disengages. I had one particularly close call when the road markings had disappeared due to resurfacing, and then the car in front turned a corner. The car didn’t really know what to do, and ended up veering sharply towards a hedge” [Ars Technica]. “It is a curious thing, though, that Tesla recommends you only use autopilot on divided highways—but that recommendation isn’t enforced in software. Perhaps Tesla should just disable autopilot completely when GPS detects that you’re on a B-road?” The Bezzle: “Here’s How Time Warner Cable Was ‘Ripping You Off’ All Those Year” [Vice]. “In a blockbuster lawsuit filed Wednesday in New York State Supreme Court, Schneiderman accused Time Warner Cable, which last year was absorbed by telecom titan Charter Communications, of conducting a years-long ‘systematic scheme’ to defraud and mislead consumers by promising internet service that the company knew it could not deliver.

Donate $25$50$75$100 00400 This entry was posted in Water Cooler on February 13, 2017 by Lambert Strether. About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Reply ↓ ambrit February 14, 2017 at 2:20 am In the “darkly” perverse metrics of modern politico-mythopoesy, Trump has already staked out a position reminiscent of “Robin Hood.” Mz Ivanka as Maid Marian adds luster to the story. The harder the “elites” try to tear Trump, the public person, down, the stronger the backlash from a substantial portion of the public. I think that the Never Trump cohort doesn’t get that Trump has identified himself with “aspiration” in much of the public’s unconscious. Attacking Trump on a personal level is subconsciously equated with an attack on the “average” citizen’s “self.” I’m not sure how he did this, but Trump appears to have pulled off a “master stroke.” Reply ↓ b1daly February 14, 2017 at 4:41 am Part of how he did was by setting up the cultural elite as the enemy, and then actually defying the social norms of that elite. Which is pretty unprecedented for a modern politician. He also set up immigrants as the “other,” and again gave people social permission to scapegoat that other. Scapegoating is a powerful instinct, as old as the hills, and in modern American politics it has become “politically incorrect.” ( I think this represents actual social progress, as modest as it is.) It just feels good to scapegoat others, as it provides an illusion of control, against the existential anxiety and risk that comes with being alive. Trump caught a demographic wave that fit with his political voodoo, allowing him to just squeak by. There were just enough voters, in the right places, to whom this psychological structure might appeal. In part, I think there is a strong a**hole component to his appeal. Incredibly, many of his voters think of him as being some kind of straight-shooting “truth teller.” They (hypothetical Trump voter) might say: “It’s like he gets me. I can understand what he’s saying, he’s not afraid to speak the truth, and tell all these upitity PC idiots to shove it.” Part of my theory is that we all have an inner a*hole, who we have to keep under control, and repressed. The angrier people get, the more they feel justified letting that side of themselves out. The demographic that went for Trump represented a cultural group that had lost position in the social hierarchy of the US, both economically, and culturally. Loss loss leads to anger. Trump is one of the biggest a*holes in modern memory, so just him getting out there and saying, you guys have a right to be angry, and it’s ok to be an a*hole, was like a revelation to some people. They bonded. They were validated. Admittedly, I might not have all of the details worked out, but these are my provisional theories. Dilbert author Scott Adams (who is unbearable to me) has a loosely articulated theory about Trump and persuasion. To his credit, he called the Trump win long before any other high profile pundit. His take was that Trump is a master persuader, and deliberately uses pro-active techniques to persuade. There’s more to it, but a big component is appeal to emotion, not facts. http://blog.dilbert.com/post/156532225711/the-persuasion-filter-and-immigration The thing that was fascinating to me, was that it’s clear does have some powerful persuasion skills, but only for a subsection of the population. I, and a majority of US citizens, find him repellant. That’s a paradox. So I was not persuaded that Trump is a master persuader. One thing that Trump clearly excels at, is picking out the weaknesses in his opponents, and powerfully summing them up in simple, bit indelible, insults. Part of this ability is the hallmark of a bully, which is, once again, transgression of social norms. Normal people, with a modicum of social instinct and empathy, learn not to attack opponents in social conflict with their sharpest weaknesses. Even though we can all pick up on others flaws, our empathy, and socialization, hold us back from humiliating others in public. However, many of us are not above standing in a circle watching with interest as the bully shoves his hapless victim’s face into the dirt of the schoolyard playground. Metaphorically speaking. Also, some people just like to see shit burn. Reply ↓ Outis Philalithopoulos February 14, 2017 at 11:07 am A core rhetorical practice in your comment involves offering up a sort of empathy for other people, while letting ambiguity over who “us” is shift back and forth. The ultimate effect is to subvert the apparent empathy and rhetorically other those people. When you say “it just feels good to scapegoat others,” “we all have an inner a*hole,” “many of us are not above standing in a circle watching with interest as the bully…,” you are, in words, including yourself with the people you are psychologically analyzing. However, you then make it clear that you are not one of them. Thus you say, “was like a revelation to some people,” “some people just like to see shit burn,” where “some people” refers to others. Those people have not repressed their inner a*hole, though you have; those people give in to their instinct to scapegoat, though you recognize that they should not do so. Upon removing this rhetorical undergirding, your argument becomes the following: A significant subsection of the population is emotionally primitive – they seek for scapegoats, they are looking for an excuse to let out their repressed a*hole, they applaud bullies who shove their victim’s face into the dirt, they enjoy watching shit burn. Their primitiveness is connected to their (illegitimate) rage at lost cultural and economic status. The rest of the population is emotionally mature, and is viscerally repelled by all of this. Trump’s political voodoo consists in having given the emotionally primitive people permission to release their dark ids. They appreciate this service and repay him with loyalty. I will critique this stylized picture in a subsequent comment. Reply ↓ Outis Philalithopoulos February 14, 2017 at 12:34 pm Continuing… The reason I am writing a fairly detailed response is that your “provisional theories” are the standard go-to depiction of non-Democratic voters in mainstream liberal culture, and have been for at least five years. That doesn’t automatically make them wrong, and it’s worthwhile to look at how accurate they are. In brief, my position is that your analysis makes too sharp a distinction between the culturally mature and the culturally primitive, effectively attributing two very different psychologies to two fairly disjoint groups of people. We know instead from polling that many people voted for Trump despite these behaviors and not because of them; on the other hand, to find plentiful examples of similar behavior in anti-Trump culture, all one has to do is look around. I was taken aback by your statement: Scapegoating is a powerful instinct, as old as the hills, and in modern American politics it has become “politically incorrect.” What have we seen from the liberal establishment since November 8 but scapegoating? Done in a politically correct way, perhaps, but still… Or “watching with interest as the bully shoves his hapless victim’s face into the dirt” – this is a ubiquitous feeling while reading comment threads, including liberal-leaning ones. A sibling mentioned to me a recent movie (or TV program?) where the noble president, after learning the location of an evil terrorist leader, calls up the terrorist to mock him before blowing him up in a drone strike. This sort of thing is all over popular culture. If these sorts of dynamics bother you, then critique them wherever and whenever they are found. If you use them as a proxy for political or cultural divisions, then you merely fan the fires of tribalism. I will finally add that there is something very social Darwinist in the current vogue of disdain for cultural and economic “losers.” In the beginning, it may have had some sort of vaguely ironic intent, as if to mock the rhetoric of Reaganomics; but that is now long past, and what may have once been meant subversively has metamorphosized into uncritical acceptance of what is fundamentally a very right-wing perspective (in the right-libertarian sense).

Miller was pretty intense there, no doubt. But, I saw that guy before. He was much more nuanced on the Real News about a year ago. I didn’t agree with lots of what he had to say, but he was thoughtful and agreeable, then, and was looking for common ground with Paul Jay. Note how much more respectful he is towards Paul Jay. Now look at how he handles the Morning Joe crowd….all steel, no silk. I wonder if Trump encourages his guys to get out there and get tough with the media and get them all riled up. A couple of comments made after the clip seem to indicate as such. If so, Miller probably took it to heart and clearly overdid it (from our perspective). But, Trump seems happy. I really think the approach is to show no weakness and take no crap from the media under any circumstances. Morning Joe really needs the fainting couches. It was just an interview. Maybe they can work up some outrage for the starvation campaign underway in Yemen? After all, Miller hasn’t killed anyone….unlike our friends the Saudis. One more thing, I wonder if Miller might have been a bit nervous about getting on national TV for the Sunday talk shows and tried to cover it with more bluster and toughness. Trump’s approving tweets could then be seen as providing encouragement to a younger, somewhat inexperienced guy that he likes and has taken under his wing. Remember, Trump values LOYALTY above all. He knows he needs friends he can trust in Washington. He seems to trust Miller. With the intel agencies constantly trying to smear him, Trump’s focus on loyalty isn’t all that crazy. Reply ↓ JohnnyGL February 13, 2017 at 5:10 pm Again, I’ve commented in this vein before, but I think a lot of the media outrage is because they feel disrespected by Trump’s inner-circle. And check out the Real News clip, it’s interesting by itself, but moreso in context. Reply ↓ freedomny February 13, 2017 at 9:25 pm Hi JGL – yeah – took a look see at the Real clip.

Reply ↓ Katharine February 13, 2017 at 5:43 pm Miller’s record as an undergrad at Duke was apparently not very pretty: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Miller_(political_operative) I note also that he appears to have no law degree, though he has made those extravagant statements about the courts and some members of Congress whose knowledge and understanding are surely greater than his. And he is not quite ten years out of college, at an age when quite a lot of people might still question his judgment even if he were not so recklessly belligerent. If he was more moderate in tone before reaching his present position, it may be that this position has gone to his head. His boss may not have a problem with that, but his boss is not as independent as he supposes. Somewhat relevant to that last thought is an article someone showed me, on leadership, written for people in information security training but with broader application: http://misti.com/infosec-news-trends/leadership-lesson-from-the-orchestra Reply ↓ JohnnyGL February 13, 2017 at 6:48 pm ” If he was more moderate in tone before reaching his present position, it may be that this position has gone to his head.

He might have also been trying to play nice with Paul Jay to convince possible frustrated lefties that watch Real News that Trump was worth taking a chance on. I thought he came across as pretty sincere in making his case, though, and he was clear in his attempt to get to the left of Clinton on trade and foreign military interventions. That’s something that would interest the NC crowd, as he seems to have Trump’s ear.

The clip I posted was definitely edited to the “intense” bits for shock value. That being said, I do agree with Joe S assessment just by reason of the words that Miller chose and his demeanor. And the fact that he was all over the talk shows this past weekend. This is an authoritarian bone being thrown to push/see what they can get away with. Miller does not hide at all that this is an ideological war – he pretty much says it. We have 3 separate (but supposedly) equal branches of the government – but Trump is trying to exert the superiority of the Executive branch. And Bannon is evilly smart and will try to get around the checks and balances. I personally think this is going to go down very quickly. And, in terms of the “resistance”…..I read this morning that the organizers of the Woman’s March are now having a Billion March Love Revolution tomorrow (in honor of Valentines Day).

I am shamed to reveal how little money I was paid; it seemed like a good thing while I was raising young children to have some flexibility in my working life. But I continued the adjunct life for too long. The solution is, as it was then and still is, for adjuncts to give up their teaching jobs and do something else. Universities would certainly be in a bind and deservedly so. Unfortunately, now it’s even more difficult to get hired with those credentials in any different career track position. (Ph.D.? “overqualified!”) So I can understand why some adjuncts feel they have to cobble together a bunch of teaching jobs to survive. Still, adjuncting is a worthless endeavor with no long term prospects. And, really, if you can’t earn enough save for an emergency fund, much less a retirement account, then what in God’s name are you doing to yourself by continuing along that path? Reply ↓ nycTerrierist February 13, 2017 at 3:59 pm x1000! “adjuncting is a worthless endeavor with no long term prospects.” Unless they don’t mind being exploited, adjuncts need to unionize and/or strike. This systemic exploitation is far too convenient for universities. Adjuncts should not make it easy for universities to treat them like shi(take mushrooms). Nothing will change unless this excellent source of cheap labor is no longer available. Reply ↓ Ulysses February 14, 2017 at 12:07 pm “Adjuncts should not make it easy for universities…” Yes!! These adjuncts also deserve the kind of support shown here by tenure-track professors in the Ithaca College Chemistry Dept., who await as we speak the results of a strike vote taken by contingent faculty at I.C.: “We, the undersigned continuing full-time faculty in the Department of Chemistry, support our part-time and contingent colleagues across campus in their collective union efforts to forge a mutually beneficial contract with Ithaca College. We feel it is in the interest of our students to have all their instructors compensated and treated fairly.   We deeply appreciate our highly-qualified contingent faculty’s dedication to teaching and all their invaluable contributions to the student’s whole college. Ithaca College and our department depend on their work every semester and this need is not likely to diminish in the foreseeable future. We support the determination of part-time instructors to improve their wages and working conditions at the college and to achieve a reasonable level of parity with their colleagues.While we are hopeful that a mutually beneficial agreement can be reached without disruptions to our students’ education – we do understand the factors that are causing the newly formed contingent faculty union to consider the legal strike as a last resort. In that case we will respect their decision and continue to support their cause.” http://www.ithaca.edu/intercom/article.php/20170214095034993#.WKM2y4WcHIU http://www.localsyr.com/news/local-news/some-ithaca-college-staff-to-vote-on-possible-strike-today/655394687 Reply ↓ Katharine February 13, 2017 at 5:01 pm “Overqualified” is a joke. You’re not overqualified to eat. Maybe try temping, avoiding indefinite term assignments. You get to see what’s out there while earning something, and you may stumble on a company with a job that could hold your interest. Reply ↓ aab February 13, 2017 at 6:21 pm Yes, and then they will keep you for 18 months as a temp, and then replace you with another temp, while you are banned from that company for at least a year — you know, for the worker’s protection. At least, that’s how I understand it works out here in the glorious Democratic one-party state of California. But from what I read about adjuncting, that still might be an improvement financially. Reply ↓ AnnieB February 13, 2017 at 8:00 pm Perhaps I didn’t express this idea clearly–employers often dismiss candidates with advanced degrees as “overqualified.” But adjuncts often end up working in jobs that don’t require advanced degrees because they, of course, have to earn an income. The Berkeley Ph.D. taxi driver or the fashion store clerk with a M.A. are cliched examples. The suggestion for career change through temping is still worthwhile despite aab’s accurate example of the revolving 18 mo temp assignment.

Reply ↓ Foppe February 14, 2017 at 2:36 am Afaik, most adjunct make a de facto min wage; I think it’s more an issue of them preferring the atmosphere of academia over other places of employment, plus ‘sunk costs’. Reply ↓ aab February 14, 2017 at 2:57 am I’ve read some brutal analyses that indicate a lot of them get paid less than minimum wage, once you factor in travel time from school to school, grading, course prep, etc. It must be painful to feel like the career you trained so long for is just out of reach for no good reason (watching the new buildings go up and the new administrators added on a practically daily basis). And instead of being a member of the academy, you have to go temp? I was under the impression there aren’t even a lot of temp jobs available. Have I just been reading unnecessarily dour reports on office employment? Reply ↓ Foppe February 14, 2017 at 3:29 am What puzzles me most is that they don’t organize very much; though I suppose the workload doesn’t help there, nor does the absence of shared interests across tiers (the few “deserving” folks who — through what is structurally no more than luck, though they probably confuse with “ability” — attain tenured status not daring to look their gift horse in the mouth), etc. But this situation has been ‘terrible’ for at least 2 decades now. So how? Reply ↓ b1daly February 14, 2017 at 5:03 am It does seem like the adjuncts would have some market power now that occupy so many teaching spots.

Reply ↓ jsn February 13, 2017 at 2:46 pm With regards to Oroville, if you pause the video at the 8:45 mark and compare it to the Kurt H twitter diagram, you will notice what appears to be a level lot to the right of the damaged spillway: in the diagram its a third of the way up the spillway, in the video the spillway walls have deteriorated to no longer contain flow up to about a hundred yards above that point. In other words, the bottom third to half of the spillway is already washed out. It would be interesting to know the time it took for this to degrade to this state. In the video you can clearly see the earth, fill at the end of the intact spillway falling away on either side, brown areas with ochre streaks flanking the cataract where the water flow shifts to foam. To the extent the spillway is built on fill it will continue to erode so long as water is flowing under newly exposed fill and washing away its underpinning. The grouting going on at the 6:30 mark, as noted by Bob, appears to be an attempt to stabilize or strengthen the “emergency spillway” where absolute overflow would impact. This suggests there are doubts about the sub-surface conditions in that location. If I recall correctly concrete attains about half its design strength in the first day after it’s poured so there appears to be time for it to cure and the boulders are probably intended as breakwaters to disorganize the force of overflow before it hits whatever is vulnerable below the boulders and concrete. Without knowing the foundation conditions for the balance of the deteriorating main spillway, the time lapse of erosion to date or the conditions under the emergency one, its impossible to assess which is the greater risk. Reply ↓ MtnLife February 13, 2017 at 3:38 pm Concrete generally is at 40% of compressive strength on the day of initial set and 70% in 7 days. Reply ↓ AnnieB February 13, 2017 at 3:50 pm Here’s an article with some updates. If you watch the video halfway down the article there is an interview with a resident who lives below the dam. She talks about the panic during the evacuation. http://www.modbee.com/news/article132379669.html “The department [of water resources] issued the evacuation advisory around 4:40 p.m. Sunday, just four hours after holding a press conference where they said they didn’t anticipate such problems.” http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/02/12/live-updates-oroville-dam-spillway-is-in-danger-of-failing/ More updates on the spillway this morning http://www.kcra.com/article/water-stops-spilling-over-oroville-auxiliary-spillway/8736758 Reply ↓ Jim Haygood February 13, 2017 at 4:20 pm ‘There was an inspection of the spillway at first light (see here), but I can’t find information that gives the results.’ Not to be foily, but that’s probably intentional. A 100,000 cfs flow over raw ground is going to erode the hell out of it, whether it’s visible behind clouds of mist or not. Since overtopping the lip of the emergency spillway again means near-certain failure, they will just have let the main spillway rip for as long as it takes … or until something breaks. In the Colorado floods of 2013, my brother’s family were displaced for almost two months. FEMA handed out some emergency funds, but the amount was nowhere near enough to compensate for no work and temporary housing expenses (on top of mortgage payments or rent for unlivable homes). The reported 188,000 evacuees are going to be hurting and unhappy by the end of this week. Mother Nature’s in charge now. Reply ↓ jsn February 13, 2017 at 5:21 pm Looking at the KQED link with video apparently from today, it appears the failure on the main spillway is fairly static: main damage was documented back on the 7th and deterioration has not moved very far up the spillway from the initial point of failure. What’s down stream from the initial break is being systematically demolished but the failure is moving very slowly upstream. This does not look as dire as I thought. Still plenty scary, but if they manage the water level down to account for future flows without topping the emergency spillway it looks to me like there will be time to fix this. Reply ↓ Jim Haygood February 13, 2017 at 6:22 pm Lake Oroville needs 750,000 acre-feet of spare capacity (about 20 percent of its total capacity) for flood control, according to Wikipedia. To reach there from 100% full, they would need to get back to the bottom of this chart (i.e., about 2.75 million acre-feet): https://cdec.water.ca.gov/jspplot/jspPlotServlet.jsp?sensor_no=3379&end=&geom=small&interval=30&cookies=cdec01 With a week of rain forecast to start Thursday, it doesn’t appear they will have achieved nearly as much spare capacity as desired, when it starts filling up again. I would not want to be making the hydrological management decisions, much less the population management decisions. If residents return and then a catastrophic breach occurs, no public official wants to be on the hook for mass deaths. Their refusal to let residents return says that this deal could still go down.

Before Nafta, Mexican farmers generally kept their own country fed with a grain surplus. Nafta flooded heavily-subsidised US grain onto the Mexican market, forcing millions of agricultural workers to flee north in the ensuing depression. Replacing US grain with South American grain is a band-aid but no solution to a problem that was created by Nafta. Mexicans need jobs, not more imports. 2. The Mexican economy was already in freefall before Trump’s election, with the austerity imposed by ultra-neoliberal President Peña Nieto. The said austerity included privatising PeMex and hiking fuel prices by over 20%. So spare me the “ZOMG Trump Nafta!” hysterics when the problems pre-date Trump and were cheered all the way by the Monetarists at WSJ.

Protectionism should not be treated as some kind of unilateral American effort to achieve a one-sided China-style mercantilism for America against the world the way China has established a China-style mercantilism for China against the world. America should treat Protectionism as something to be applied equally by all for the equal benefit of all. Every country and economy should be free to develop behind its own Equal Wall of Protection. And then accept the necessary evil of just enough minimal trade between the Protectionised National Economies to allow Countries A and B to trade just only those things that really truly can not be made or grown by Countries B and A. Free Trade is the New Slavery. Protectionism is the New Abolition. But only if it is equal and reciprocal Protectionism for All. Reply ↓ Vatch February 13, 2017 at 2:51 pm Thanks for reminding us about the recommendation by Tom Perez on ways to smear Bernie Sanders. For those who haven’t seen it yet: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4429 3. I wish she would talk about the issues she cares about through the prism of more human stories. Logos, ethos, pathos. She has met so many people with so many gut wrenching stories of grit and determination, struggle followed by success. I wish there were more pathos, or more real stories behind her really sound policy proposals. Whenever I talk about ACA, I talk about through the prism of real people for whom the ACA saved their lives. The stories are incredible. In my HRC advocacy, I now say how these people dont have the time to wait for Senator Sanders to complete his quest for the perfect health care system, or the perfect immigration reform bill; it gets alot of good nods, especially when I talk about Kennedy McCain immigration and how Bernie opposed this, and immigrants are still suffering the consequences of inaction. … 6. Nevada is an opportunity to fight back on so many levels. First, the current storyline is that she does not connect well with young voters. Given that Nevada is far more demographically representative of America, I am confident that HRC can do well with all African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans (dont forget the sizeable population of Asian Americans in Nevada, including Filipinos.). Emmy and the team have a good plan to attract all minority voters. When we do well there, then the narrative changes from Bernie kicks ass among young voters to Bernie does well only among young white liberals– that is a different story and a perfect lead in to South Carolina, where once again, we can work to attract young voters of color. So I think Nevada is a real opportunity , and I would strongly urge HRC to get out there within a couple days of NH. He was very helpful. After helping Clinton to win the nomination, Tom Perez can also take some credit for her excellent performance in the general election Reply ↓ Lambert Strether Post authorFebruary 13, 2017 at 2:57 pm It has occurred to me that the South Carolina firewall = Booker 2020.

I thought for a while that he must actively want to run off the Berniecrats, but then he bumblingly came out and admitted the primary was rigged, indicating that he was trying to curry favor with the Bernie faction. Then he got screamed at by Hillbots and walked the admission back. That’s just a fail on so many levels. It suggests a level of incompetence far beyond not being good at winning elections. Did he really not understand that the Hillbot base takes it as an article of faith akin to transubstantiation that she won fair and square and Bernie is a racist demon? If he doesn’t even understand his own base, what good is he? Reply ↓ Darius February 13, 2017 at 4:11 pm This says to me that Perez may fatally weaken the whole DNC DCCC DSCC edifice.

It is acceptable to give money to individual Democratic candidates, but I recommend that people carefully vet any potential recipient of donations. For example, if a candidate was a Hillary Clinton superdelegate, that candidate probably does not deserve a donation. If a Democratic primary election candidate is opposing a Hillary Clinton superdelegate, then that primary candidate very likely is deserving of a political donation.

I’ve been popping over here today while doing very, very boring yet difficult paperwork. I need to get back to it. I’ll leap over to Way of the Bern in case someone there has it readily available, but if not, I’ll have to do this later. Perez is a remarkable combination of ineptitude, weakness, moral ugliness and, as far as I can tell, actual stupidity. At least, whatever he’s good at, it’s not this, and he presents as stupid. Is this the kind of guy that stood on the balcony for those late stage Soviet photo ops? He doesn’t even seem to rise to that level, but maybe that’s a function of me being older and better able to get a good look at him. Reply ↓ Anne February 13, 2017 at 5:43 pm I think he’s letting his own ambition get a little ahead of himself, to the point where I’ve started to mentally append the phrase, “yeah, that’s the ticket” to pretty much everything he says. It’s not that he has no experience, it’s just that it’s local, county council-type experience (he’s somewhat local to me – a couple counties south of me and more closely aligned with DC than with Baltimore City). He wanted to run for MD AG, but hadn’t practiced law in MD for the required 10 years, so was deemed ineligible. Eventually, Obama made him Labor Secretary. Maybe working his way into the DC culture eventually killed what had, at one time, looked like a progressive voice and spirit. I suppose what bothers me most is that he doesn’t seem to be inclined to break any new ground, to really shake things up, but build, instead on the same broken foundation that serves the old guard just fine, but isn’t going to put any Dems in office, much less the kind that are needed. I think having supposedly been in the running as a possible VP to Clinton, he may want this job as a launching pad to higher office; it’s not that I begrudge anyone an opportunity to keep moving up, but this shouldn’t just be a box to be checked on a resume/CV. If ever there was a time to put distance between the DNC and the Clintonites, I think it’s now – and I don’t see Perez being able to do that.

It’s not a pretty picture seeing how the “sausage gets made,” but someone has to do it, if you want to have a winning team. It’s politics, and the DNC is a political party. You can’t pretend that the individuals in the party are not going to have alliances and personal agendas. I feel like some posters here (generally speaking) think the problem is that the Democrats have had bad ideas. Bernie was good, because he had “good ideas.” Good ideas are a fraction of a penny a dozen. I child can come up with them. I didn’t think Sanders, ideas were all that great, but I voted for him in the primary because I supported his message, and the values it represented. Which has become sorely under-represented in the modern political discourse. The reason Bernie got to say his ideas, and get an audience, is because the man has real political skills, demonstrated over a lifetime of being an elected official. But even he knew he needed the resources of a major party behind him to stand a chance. The Democratic party didn’t owe him the slot. They the primary system is a competitive process, and the affinities of party insiders count, just as much, or more, as the voters. There is a tradeoff to being in a party. As it stands now, the Democrats are getting a lot of grief from the left for losing, but were all these left wing voters over the last 30 years? I’m still a amazed that progressives can pour out such contempt for the Democratic mainstream, yet can’t point to a single major political figure they support, outside of Sanders. Who supported Clinton, having a modicum of political sense. Why are there no progressive parties of substance in the US? The US does not have a progressive-left electorate. No such person has even come close to winning the presidency since, I don’t know, FDR? I mean, if your happy with Trump, if you’re happy with Pence, then fine, be happy. The Republicans have run the table in the US, with centrist Democrats cleaning up. Maybe the Dems can pull together an alliance to capitalize on anti-Trunp sentiment, but I don’t see that they can do a hard pivot to the left and beat the Republicans. They need to keep enough people in their camp to get the numbers they need. I think it’s very telling that the first President with a populist base is a hard-core, reactionary, right winger. I’m very frustrated. ps, I’m not trying to call you out specifically, these are just general thoughts I’m mulling over, and your comment made me think of them.

Reply ↓ foghorn longhorn February 13, 2017 at 3:04 pm For such a huge body of water this really appears to be a pretty crappy design. They have one broken spillway and an emergency spillway that couldnt handle 10,000 cfs. They are looking at 30 days at least of these outflows, this is really just getting started. Good luck gentlemen. Reply ↓ Jim Haygood February 13, 2017 at 4:43 pm Looks like the designers expected water overtopping the 1,300 foot long lip to run downhill in a smooth sheet. Engineers call it laminar flow. But no. Most of the overflow ran sideways down a slight lateral grade to concentrate at a low point, where it started excavating a deep hole. Controlling water: it’s like herding cats or something. A guy named P.A. Yeomans in Australia figured out how to do it. But it takes a lot of manicuring of slopes with carefully sloped contour lines called “keylines” to make it work. https://soilandhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/GoodBooks/The%20Keyline%20Plan.pdf Reply ↓ bob February 13, 2017 at 5:29 pm They knew all about those contours.The design of the now broken spillway shows this. The “teeth” in the spillway are set there to reduce both velocity, and direction. The set at the bottom is still there, but most of the water is exiting the spillway before it reaches them. The slope of the spillway also changes as water moves down it, when it’s intact. The still do have control over the main spillway, for what little good it does them. The control gates are at the top. The splllway being intact, somewhat, is a huge help. What worries me about the main spillway is the way that the force of the flow is trying to move right, closer to the main dam. The designers seemed to want excess flows going left, at all costs. Maybe, because- The main dam is also NOT concrete. They can’t have ANY flow over that. It will completely dissolve if they have any sustained flow over the dam That’s why the emergency spillway lip was built 20 (40? differing numbers being tossed out) feet below the lip of the main damn. I get a kick out of them saying that the “dam is sound” Yup, and the dam could still be sound, after the water goes around it. It won’t be doing anything, but it will be sound. Reply ↓ Jim Haygood February 13, 2017 at 5:47 pm Freelancer Jim Stone estimates using photos that the eroding edge of the main spillway has moved 300 feet toward the gates at the top: http://82.221.129.208/pages/goneinaweek.jpg A 100,000 cfs flow over bare ground excavates a lot of dirt. Stone estimates a week before the main spillway becomes too damaged to use. If the emergency spillway overtops again with the main spillway closed, it probably would collapse within a day or two. Reply ↓ bob February 13, 2017 at 7:28 pm There has to be substantial bedrock under the main spillway. You can see it in a few photos, where the soils have been removed. Although it seems today the press has moved on. It may also be that they stopped the circus and put some controls on flights in the area. Dunno. I’m still worried about the right. The way that “knob” is, to the right of the spilllway, if another few hundred feet of the main spillway disappears, the water could cut over the knob, and head toward the dam that they are doing everything in their power to keep dry. Is that bedrock at the same elevation as it heads left, toward the emergency spillway? Dunno. It looks like the bedrock was already “weathered” in the past, maybe an ice age ago. And, even bedrock can “give” if you put enough water to it. Reply ↓ allan February 13, 2017 at 10:22 pm “It may also be that they stopped the circus and put some controls on flights in the area. ” Indeed, the FAA put a Temporary Flight Restriction in effect as of today: Altitude: From the surface up to and including 4500 feet MSL Effective Date(s): From February 13, 2017 at 2330 UTC To May 13, 2017 at 2300 UTC The disintegration will not be televised. Reply ↓ VietnamVet February 13, 2017 at 10:20 pm The Oroville Dam crisis is frightfully engrossing. This is peak 21st century drama; Climate Change, Media Disinformation, Infrastructure Defects and Neo-Liberals placing profits before people. Plus, having vacationed in Feather River Valley makes it personal. The citation confirms that the main spillway collapse has move upstream to just below the power lines. The use, yesterday, of the emergency spillway for the first time indicates alarm about the integrity of the main spillway. Today helicopters were dumping rocks in holes in the ground next to the boat ramp parking lot indicating that the emergency spillway is undercut. They can’t use that again. California DWR must be running models of what happens if the cavitation continues uphill and undercuts the main spillway gates. It can’t be good. Reply ↓ foghorn longhorn February 13, 2017 at 7:37 pm They want the water to go left, but the lay of the land is to the right. The scouring beneath the emergency spillway looks, for lack of a better word, fatal. The main spillway is literally broken in half and appears from earlier photos to be scouring uphill and to the right. Cant utilize the powerplant outflow. Those boys have them a bit of a situation. Good luck Reply ↓ bob February 13, 2017 at 10:08 pm “The scouring beneath the emergency spillway looks, for lack of a better word, fatal.” They were working on the emergency spill way BEFORE they used it. Not just clearing the debris and tress, but reinforcing the areas indicated above with grout and boulders. They have never had to use it before. What the hell was wrong with it? Did it have to do with building the road across it? That road looked like an add on, after 20-30 years of never using the spillway. Why not build a road there? It’s so pretty here! That’s also the only “land” access they have to that side of the dam, where they need to be moving material into. Only one way to get to the left side- Over the dam, from the right. Also, USING the emergency spillway isn’t a CHOICE. Water reaches a certain level, and water flows out the emergency spillway. The hyrdo plant “flow” is no doubt, maxed out. But, they’re smaller pipes, they can’t move any more. They’d probably prefer to have more water moving thru the plant, as something to push the water from the spillway left, more. Downstream- The whole “canal” system in oroville looks to steer a flood out onto the flood plane. There’s a TON of floodplain out there, if it works, as I believe it was designed to. The smaller towns that are closer- underwater. Further downstream, the larger cites should be OK, but that assumes things go well, as designed, and this mess is proving you can’t really assume that.

Reply ↓ Left in Wisconsin February 13, 2017 at 4:14 pm I haven’t been called a labor insider for a long time. :) Yes, the notion of structure tests seems very useful.

I’m sure that people who get letters with the Verily logo at the top will be totally happy with whatever it is that they read. Look at this horrible corporate dreck: Verily is developing tools to collect and organize health data, then creating interventions and platforms that put insights derived from that health data to use for more holistic care management. We have three guiding product design principles: start with the user, simplify care, and lead on security and privacy. “Holistic care management.” Sounds terrific. Also “simplify care.” Seems to me to current system has been a raging success in terms of simplifying care; as the old programmers saying goes: “‘The cheapest, fastest and most reliable components of a computer system are those that aren’t there.” And then: It is easy to see why [problem child CEO Andrew]Conrad, a scientist and entrepreneur, caught the attention of Google co-founder Sergey Brin. His off-the-charts ambition and elite connections in Washington and scientific circles match Google’s grand plans for Verily, which Brin last year called “a huge undertaking” that he hoped would “transform the way we detect, prevent, and manage disease.” No red flags there, no sirree.

I sometimes have to present things for our “decision makers” in some of those high-up management forums, this is always terrible, even the air in there is dead, all energy is damped, sucked away, and always, just always, someone will stir at slide 23 to ask about a phrase or some wording on page 8.

They often write management decisions and even instructions festooned with meaningless plus-words with the (desired, the Swedes are no slouches when it comes to graft) effect that anyone can read almost whatever meaning they like to have from it. That way no-one needs to disagree on anything and everyone gets what they like. Harmony! Bit like some of the controversial parts of EU legislation. I have actually read good EU legislation.

Reply ↓ aab February 13, 2017 at 6:32 pm I don’t know, but California doesn’t have the money to do all sorts of necessary things, like patch up roads and educate children. Instead, we have Proposition 13, a glorious legacy of the Reagan Revolution, which allows The Walt Disney Company to pay the same property tax on Disneyland and all its other California holdings (and there are a LOT) that it paid in 1979. Same with every other large company. Same with Nestle. Same with Anheiser-Busch. Same with all the big agricultural companies. The oil companies. The resorts for the wealthy that line the shorelines. Same with every mansion in Santa Barbara that’s held in trust. If the property has not changed ownership since 1979, the property tax has not changed, even if the value of the property has increased exponentially. The Democratic Party has a super-majority in Sacramento. Oddly, the prison guards union is still quite powerful, Nestle still gets to remove our water and sell it at a MASSIVE mark-up (its sweetheart deal is startling), and somehow, giving the Democrats total control of government has not led to things like fixing spillways and correcting tax inequities. I’m trying to think of why that might be. It must be Bernie Sanders’ fault. Reply ↓ Dave February 13, 2017 at 11:38 pm We also have a growing portion of Mexico and Central America’s population relying on California taxpayers for Medi-Cal and Cal Fresh food stamp benefits. It gets kind of expensive. Proposition 13 passed in 1978. Reagan was elected in 1980. It is a crime that it is not limited to the owners primary residence only. It should never have been for commercial properties such as oil refineries or Disneyland. Reply ↓ aab February 14, 2017 at 1:08 am The Reagan Revolution started in California long before he was elected President. What’s outrageous to me is that our one party government has made no serious effort to even amend Prop 13. Because the Democrats are the party of the people, right? Although I keep forgetting that corporations are people, my friend. Do you have links to support your assertions about Medi-Cal and Cal Fresh? I don’t personally know how the programs are funded in toto, and what percentage of recipients are undocumented/illegal immigrants. If they’re living and working here, I strongly suspect they’re contributing to the system and California’s economy such that giving them basic health care and keeping their children from starving to death makes both economic and moral sense. You seem to be implying that people travel here for medical care and food and then return to Mexico. Is that what you mean? If so, I’d like to see hard data to back it up. Whole lotta illegal immigrants are probably working on Disney properties, and serving Disney executives in restaurants and in their homes. I kinda feel like getting Disney to pay up is more important that keeping little kids from getting apples and vaccinations.

Am I wrong to think that’s what tens of millions of Klinton Koolaid Kultists would have done? Am I wrong to think that the entire Democratic Leadership would have given Sanders the McGovern treatment in order to make him lose the election? The Democratic Party really needs to be hit over and over for the next few years with every sort of political radiation, antibiotics and chemotherapy which can be applied to it. The only way to deClintonize and de Obamafy the party is the functional equivalent of extermination against every Clinton cancer cell and Obama plague germ inside the Democratic Party leadership and followership. Klinton Koolaid Kult voters and Race Card Obamazoids really need to be driven into another political party which better suits them . . .whatever that party may be. Or else the Sanderbackers need to leave the Democratic Party.

Assuredly so. Would they have succeeded? I don’t think so, legislatively. Would he have been better able to evade the intelligence community soft coup currently being executed against Trump? I honestly don’t know. He actually is a leftist (at least in the colloquial sense), doesn’t have his own security team sweeping for bugs and such, etc. OTOH, he’s a skilled politician, legislator, and governing executive.

Something many people think they would like to do, but nerver actually manage. The human recruiter will want to talk a good deal about those so it is best if it is actually true – at least to the degree where one can talk realistically and honestly about practical details. Like “which tent did you use”, “did it hold up in the hard weather on XXX”. Practical details is what I always ask about details when interviewing – if I get generic answers, then it is not so good for the candidate. A good answer to “did it hold up … ” is either “well, some water … bla bla … did this to fix is ” or “I don’t know, It looked bad so I cheated and stayed in the inn that day”. All of this “search and selection stuff” is blatantly biased in favor of people with ressources. I happen to need honest and smart people. A person would certainly curry some favor with me by honestly saying: “I am sorry, I just filled these in with something because I heard that your robot filters away people with gaps”.

Versions of this meme, including this one, seem to repeat the same mistakes the smart people made during the campaign — misreading and underestimating Trump. They see him get batted down or opposed on a few things and immediately assume that Trump alone, unlike every other American, thought that he’d show up, wave a wand, and make things happen immediately according to his design; and therefore he now must be surprised or frustrated by clashes with other governing branches or institutions, or by unfawning press, or by “resistance” from the same 52 percent that didn’t vote for him to begin with, only now with knitted caps. Why should we think it upsets him if his first shots out of the gate get stymied? As far as I can tell, Trump so far is winning. Fighting what he can brand “the Establishment” is a win in itself (whether the judiciary, a bureaucracy, a recalcitrant liberal state, or the media). That’s what he was sent to do. So he’s not trying to learn the ropes? Plus column. And it’s reported as a impatience or impulsiveness, a blunder or miscalculation? Plus column. Makes the ones saying it and those reporting it seem like smug elitists, determined to enforce the Status Quo through Washington red tape. Really, everything the column insinuates as a problem for Trump seems quite the opposite. He’s ginned up a national hissy over his ill-conceived, godawful executive orders and, meanwhile, he’s managing to get confirmed a cabinet more radical and unqualified than any traditional Republican would dare to put up; he’s rolling roughshod over a supposed opposition so feckless he has to find a real adversary elsewhere (ie, the press corps). Dems obsess over every latest offense and announce “resistance” but find any moves or tactics worthy of the name really quite unseemly; they openly debate the relative merits of an “obstruction” strategy, which is the surest sign that even if they ever settle upon it, they won’t execute (republic obstruction of Obama is now taken as a given; but it was precisely because the Rs were serious and committed to the strategy that they never owned it or discussed it as a “thing” in real time … the play is to assume a posture of cooperation and then to be “disappointed” by the “extreme” positions of the President … announcing that one is obstructing is to do what Ds do all the time — prefigure their own failure in the framing of things from the get-go). What’s really irritating is that there may yet be something to this storyline, but it’s not that Trump is failing (or will fail) by his own standards or measuring stick if he can’t figure out and get along with Washington. It’s that Trump has no interest in figuring out or getting along with Washington — in fact, that’s the opposite of what he wants. He already has staked his political fortunes on a “win the crowd” strategy — which just worked, recently enough you’d think folks might remember. He doesn’t need a majority (already proved that) or any traditionally credible source on his side. I think we can expect 4 or more years of trench warfare between Trump and any other claim to democratic authority. He doesn’t need to deliver. He needs to keep enough Rs quiet/happy by letting them push through the horrors they’ve salivated over for decades (hiding or deferring the consequences for enough election cycles to deflect blame), and/or keep them scared enough of the base not to make waves, and he needs a face of the Establishment to blame for every stymied effort, which means the more cartoonish his initiatives the better, as the Establishment will be all too happy to oblige (and as a bonus, the Dems will peck about giddily and bask in I-told-you-sos, relieved over that time they almost questioned themselves, but then didn’t). Trump won’t suffer if he never masters the learning curve. The rest of us, the country, the world, very well might. We actually need things to work. Reply ↓ ChrisPacific February 13, 2017 at 8:47 pm Well summarized. I was discussing this with someone the other day. Trump is trying to paint a picture of obstructionist liberal/elite courts blocking him from doing his job of looking after the interests of the people. All the gloating memes and tweets about his Ninth Circuit defeat are just playing into his hands. The more the Democrats do it, the more out of touch they look, and the angrier Trump supporters get. In order to get past that dynamic they need to connect with real people and understand how to address their concerns. Sanders gave them a textbook illustration of how to do that. They didn’t just reject it, they seemed viscerally repulsed by the very idea. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef February 13, 2017 at 9:26 pm The gloating tweets, the fake charges…are they not false-flag attacks on Trump that generate genuine sympathy for the president? Though let’s not be too critical – perhaps some people are only Trump’s agents without knowing so themselves. Reply ↓ ChrisPacific February 14, 2017 at 3:21 pm Possibly in some cases, but some are coming from Hillary, and they are pretty consistent with her approach in the past. I think most Democrats are perfectly happy to play the game. Trump really riles up their base, which is probably good for fundraising purposes. The fact that it antagonizes Trump voters and further entrenches his support is only relevant if Democrats care about winning them back. So far they’ve shown no sign of that as they prefer to demonize them as racist bigots. Reply ↓ Lambert Strether Post authorFebruary 14, 2017 at 1:42 am I picked the USA Today link because it was the mildest version of this theme. There’s also some reality to it; it takes X number of people to run the government, and they have to have a basic skillset. I’ve been worried all along that Trump’s team is too small. (Of course, I said the same thing in the campaign, because I didn’t know about Kushner’s brilliant data operation in San Antonio.) I’m not all that worried about “actionable intelligence” not getting to Trump, because look at how massively the intelligence community has fucked up in the past, but there’s basic blocking and tackling that needs to be done. You need to get Executive Orders vetted by a competent lawyer, for example. Can the Trump team do it? And the larger question is, can any insurgent President run the government? Is that another way of saying that the ancien regime is too complex and broken to fix? If so, we’re Gordian knot territory…. Reply ↓ ambrit February 14, 2017 at 2:58 am “Gordian knot territory…” Yeah, but Alexander was ‘just passing through.’ Trump et. al. are here to stay, so, I’d suggest that the rise of Feudalism after the slow decay of Imperial Roman rule is more appropriate an analogy.

Reply ↓ manymusings February 14, 2017 at 8:36 am It didn’t quite come out in my rant — but I do think it matters if Trump and his small band of anarchists can’t or don’t want to run the government. Intelligence is one front, with a big scare factor (and an area where I don’t really know the intricacies to make sense of what we’re currently witnessing …. doesn’t seem good though!). But abdicating on the whole governing thing (treating it like the camel on your back), I think it will matter in a way that breathless day-to-day “reporting” isn’t going to capture, and not this soon, and especially not by the hack Beltway press who report only the visible dust-ups, and only as a political problem (or not) for Trump. A non-functional govt is a boring story on any given day but probably a big problem for us — for functional society. I wonder if we’ll ever get a real picture of the hollowing-out of government agencies (which seems unavoidable), and the toll it takes to lose experienced civil servants and/or the functions they carry out, any which one might seem trivial but it all adds up. I don’t think those EOs necessarily need to be vetted, they seem to be for show, really … but you do need folks who know how to write and vet a reg and run an inter-agency process and keep records and plan ahead. Sure that’s just bureaucracy, but it’s also what was once the quaint notion of good government. An insurgent Pres can run the government if s/he wants to … sure things don’t turn on a dime, they’re not supposed to, but there are processes in place for a new administration to implement its agenda, and the people running those processes in federal agencies serve the elected administration. They don’t stand there waiting for the magic word. I don’t doubt the existence of a Deep State, but just what are we talking about? “Running the government” covers a lot of things, and a lot of it is just regular people who are used to getting new marching orders. An insurgent who isn’t serious about implementing an agenda, but prefers to announce things as if that means they might happen immediately …. that’s a different story.

So a handy conversion to memorize: 640 acres = 1 square mile. Thus, 350,000 acre-feet of water in the Oroville reservoir means roughly 500 square-mile-feet, i.e. picture a cubic volume 1 mile on each side, filled to 500 feet (roughly 10% full) with water, thus around 0.1 cubic miles of water.

It is being republished in light of damage at the Oroville dam. http://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/water-and-drought/article132475584.html Apparently they’ve been aware of the problem with the dam since 2005, but the state and fed agencies decided there wasn’t enough population for it to be a political problem, so they wouldn’t spend the tens of millions of dollars needed to fix it.

(The tank is the Beltway, however.) Some links on Flynn: WHY ARE NINE SOURCES COMING FORWARD NOW ON FLYNN’S CONVERSATIONS WITH RUSSIA? EmptyWheel Michael Flynn Resigns as National Security Adviser NYT This to me is the important story, from (Kushner’s) Observer: In light of this, and out of worries about the White House’s ability to keep secrets, some of our spy agencies have begun withholding intelligence from the Oval Office. Why risk your most sensitive information if the president may ignore it anyway? A senior National Security Agency official explained that NSA was systematically holding back some of the “good stuff” from the White House, in an unprecedented move. For decades, NSA has prepared special reports for the president’s eyes only, containing enormously sensitive intelligence. In the last three weeks, however, NSA has ceased doing this, fearing Trump and his staff cannot keep their best SIGINT secrets. Since NSA provides something like 80 percent of the actionable intelligence in our government, what’s being kept from the White House may be very significant indeed. However, such concerns are widely shared across the IC, and NSA doesn’t appear to be the only agency withholding intelligence from the administration out of security fears. What’s going on was explained lucidly by a senior Pentagon intelligence official, who stated that “since January 20, we’ve assumed that the Kremlin has ears inside the SITROOM,” meaning the White House Situation Room, the 5,500 square-foot conference room in the West Wing where the president and his top staffers get intelligence briefings. “There’s not much the Russians don’t know at this point,” the official added in wry frustration. None of this has happened in Washington before. A White House with unsettling links to Moscow wasn’t something anybody in the Pentagon or the Intelligence Community even considered a possibility until a few months ago. Until Team Trump clarifies its strange relationship with the Kremlin, and starts working on its professional honesty, the IC will approach the administration with caution and concern. I previously warned the Trump administration not to go to war with the nation’s spies, and here’s why. This is a risky situation, particularly since President Trump is prone to creating crises foreign and domestic with his incautious tweets. In the event of a serious international crisis of the sort which eventually befalls almost every administration, the White House will need the best intelligence possible to prevent war, possibly even nuclear war. It may not get the information it needs in that hour of crisis, and for that it has nobody to blame but itself. So factions within the intelligence community have gone on strike (so much for “democratic norms”) A few things. 1) Chuck Schumer issued the same threat (“Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you. So even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he’s being really dumb to do this”). So we’re looking at, as it were, full spectrum dominance within the political class by the “intelligence community.” 2) So far as I can tell from the Schindler article linked above, Flynn fucked up, maybe on about the level of Petraeus or Democrat Sandy Berger, who hid classified documents in his pants and smuggled them out of the National Archive. (Of course, a lot of people in the Beltway were very happy to see Flynn fuck up, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t. And while we’re at it, can somebody please point me to a fully paid-up member of The Blob who isn’t crazy pants? Or corrupt? And isn’t the Logan Act a dead letter?) 3) To me, looks like a well-executed play in a game-plan that intelligence community slash Democrat factions have been running since at least mid-summer. (At this point we remember that “American statesman” Leon Panetta was Obama’s chief of state, head of DoD, and head of the CIA. So I would be very interested to know who appointed WaPo’s nine anonymous sources.) Clinton calling Trump a Russian stooge in the debates was one play, the 25-page “dodgy” dossier was another play (now, apparently, SIGNINT is “confirming” parts of it, so that’s still on the boil), the call for “faithless electors” to be briefed in the (farcically bad) JARA memo was another play, this is another play. No doubt impeaching Trump or getting him to resign by peeling off “moderate Republicans” would be a touchdown). 4) Note that Clinton made her charges of Trump treason in the debate in as direct a fashion as possible, so voters have aleady had the chance to take all this into consideration, at least at a high level (and since we can never see any of the intel, the high level is all we ever will see.) So, if the winning play in the gameplan is removing Trump from office, we’re seeing the intelligence community reversing an election result. 5) If the intelligence community can (a) vet a Presidential candidate after he is elected but before he takes office, and (b) can reverse an election result based on evidence the public cannot see, then the intelligence community is, in essence, a new fourth branch of government not accountable to the people in any way. Anybody who thinks the military will go back to the barracks after staging a coup is delusional. In the same way, anybody who thinks the intelligence community will go back to its SIGINT and HUMINT is delusional. Once they have achieved this change in the Constitutional order, it will never be undone. 6) It’s been amazing to see what liberals have been willing to throw away for Clinton’s sake. Apparently, having a vehemently pro-life Pence as President isn’t a problem for them. Nor is turning the intelligence community in a Praetorian Guard and giving them veto power over voters’ choice of a President a stumbling block. And it can’t be that they really believe Trump is a fascist, else for example Trump’s nominee to the VA wouldn’t be approved 100-0. So it’s all about their power and their rice bowls, plain and simple (and, I would argue, the war with Russia that The Blob wants, which amounts to the same thing). It would be wonderful to spot a good faith actor in this mess, but frankly, I’m stumped. 7) So this is what a legitimacy crisis looks like when liberal Democrats foment it. It would be entertaining if it weren’t so horrific and sad. 8) Of course, all the Democrat establishment really had to do was: a) Get 10 Democrats on the road doing Town Halls, just like Sanders is doing, talking about universal programs that deliver concrete material benefits, especially to the working class b) Make voter registration a core party function. That would do it. Boom, Senate 2018, Presidency 2020. Rather than do something simple that connects with voters, they’re fomenting a slow-moving soft coup and a change to the Constitutional order from inside the Beltway. Swell. Just swell. Reply ↓ Foppe February 14, 2017 at 2:57 am With Flynn gone, how many remain who are/were critical of the size/scope of the IC (as a place of well-paying employment for credentialed people)?

There is no going back if “they” get away with it. Of course, since the Journalism Profession abdicated it’s responsibilities, there was a power vacuum in the category of “Fourth Estate.” What could be more “natural” than that when the chroniclers of history self destructed, that the “makers” of history stepped in to fill the void? This is all beginning to look like Gangsterism. Reply ↓ Foppe February 14, 2017 at 3:45 am Well, that guy who ran the FBI like his personal fiefdom did get ousted. So 5 is probably not truly permanent. And I’m not quite sure that this mostly procedural mistake by Flynn is comparable to Petraeus’s (or Berger’s) actions. But then, why resign? It’s odd, to be sure. Wrt 6, I don’t really understand what the Ds stand to gain from a Pence presidency. I mean, war is good for business and all that, and the IC is a great employer, but what D-supporting sectors really benefit from war with Iran/Russia? Can it really just be the principle of it all? That said, with Flynn gone, is there much of a need to kick Trump out? I mean, he writes lots of EOs, but all that does is provide fodder / distractions; congress could just do its own thing in the meantime. I’d say it’s mostly a question of him being willing to indulge the idea of a war somewhere, to keep the need for the IC alive. Though perhaps ‘flare-ups’ will do, on the ‘terror prevention’ front — assuming they happen at the right moment(s). Reply ↓ VietnamVet February 14, 2017 at 4:12 am Yes, I agree. The Intelligence Community showed that it has vetting power over President’s staff. Anyone who crosses them is gone. This is very scary stuff; if for no other reason than now there is no way to negotiate a stand down from the Cold War 2.0. The President will only know what the spooks want him to know. Bankers hoard. Oligarchs loot. Government withers. From this day forward; the Praetorian Guard will know all, hold the nuclear weapons and profit from the endless wars.

WRT the Oroville dam, for once can we have just the engineers talk to the public rather than PR people? I don’t care if it’s too technical or they don’t have “people skills” (I hate that stereotype of engineers btw). There is a massive difference in civil engineering between “a hole in the dam” (as has been reported by some outlets) and a damaged primary spillway and heavy erosion or concerns of heavy erosion on the emergency spillway. Whether the situation is better or worse than reported I would rather hear the engineers explain the situation than the PR people.

I was struck by this recent New Yorker piece on Albert Woodfox, a committed Black Panther, who as a member of the Angola 3, had to rethink tactics in a suffocating and increasingly narrow sphere of action. Woodfox and King ultimately decided that their recommendation to other inmates not to violently resist strip-search and bodily invasion was the right choice. Why? I’m not sure, but maybe it’s the idea that non-violence allows a story, a narrative historicity, to develop. One’s continuing survival allows a community of memory to develop. This community is the legacy in a way — the gift. http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/16/how-albert-woodfox-survived-solitary Woodfox’s self-condemnation for the “no contest” he agreed to, even as innocent, seems unwarranted given all the suffering he endured. But I’m not going to judge. Principles are principles. “Resistance is the secret of joy.” Alice Walker Reply ↓ manymusings February 14, 2017 at 10:02 am Lumping “current and former staff” together for sourcing purposes isn’t shorthand, it’s cover for effectively having no credible source (and what authority are we supposed to ascribe to “others throughout the government”? might as well be the reporter’s neighbors and friends). There’s a big difference between current and former staff, and among former, there’s a big difference between those who might still have a clue what’s going on, and those who once briefly had a title and now like to try to use it to peddle influence. Anyone who is current (or former, but still plugged in well enough to have actual insight) is very, very unlikely to say anything, even on background, and if they do, it’s probably too caveated or hedged or boring to be usable, and if it’s not caveated/hedged/boring, it’s a calculated or even an authorized leak and therefore might be newsworthy, but shouldn’t be merely repeated with anonymous attribution. Beltway press seems to be falling over itself to report on the anatomy of a meltdown, but it seems more like ego-driven hacks getting other hacks to confirm their own imagined drama. It hasn’t been that long, and career civil servants don’t gossip like this, at least not so early. Lambert’s right to follow and parse the sourcing. And I’d add as a filter the truism that folks who might have credible perspectives are usually the least likely to talk (unless calculated or authorized), and least likely to spout what political reporters think is the good stuff.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Feb 13, 2017 at 11:47AM It's fair to say that Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was happy to close the chapter on 2016. The nation's third-biggest bank by assets was beset by scandal last year after it was revealed that thousands of employees in its branches had opened as many as two million fake accounts for customers in order to meet overly aggressive sales quotas. Throughout the last few months, I've tracked the fallout from the scandal on Wells Fargo's business. Below are three charts that help to illustrate its impact on the California-based bank. The Wells Fargo Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. 1. Account openings plummet One way Wells Fargo responded to the fake-account scandal was to eliminate product sales goals in its branches. Because these were the cause of the malfeasance in the first place, this should take care of that issue. But the decision doesn't come without a cost. Namely, without its employees pitching its products, the number of new account openings have plummeted. New checking account openings fell by 40% in December compared to the year-ago period. And credit card applications were down by 43%. Data source: Wells Fargo. Chart by author. Neither of these trends will have a meaningful short-term impact on Wells Fargo, as new accounts aren't massive revenue generators. Over time, however, the decrease in accounts is likely to throttle Wells Fargo's growth rate. 2. Brand value There's no question that Wells Fargo's reputation took a hit when people learned that its employees had been systematically defrauding customers for years by opening accounts in their names without the approval to do so. But intangible assets like reputation are hard to measure, so it's difficult to say just how much actual damage was caused. This is where Brand Finance comes in. It's a consulting company that helps to measure the value of brands around the world using the so-called royalty relief methodology, "which ranks firms based on the licensing rate that a third-party would need to pay to use that company's brand." Based on Brand Finance's latest estimate of bank brands, Wells Fargo fell from the top spot in the world last year down to second place, eclipsed by China's biggest bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. It's hard to say how much its fake-account scandal contributed to this, but it isn't a stretch to imagine that it was the primary reason for the decline. Data source: Brand Finance. Chart by author. 3. Profitability Finally, one of Wells Fargo's most impressive accomplishments since the financial crisis is that it's consistently been the most profitable multitrillion dollar bank in the country. But this, too, took a hit as a result of the scandal. In the fourth quarter of last year, Wells Fargo generated a 13.2% return on average tangible common equity. That was down from 14.1% in the first quarter -- i.e., before the scandal -- and it paved the way for JPMorgan Chase to claim the top spot among multitrillion dollar banks. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. Suffice it to say, 2016 was a challenging year for Wells Fargo. The good news for the bank is that the new focus on decreasing regulations and defanging the regulatory agencies will almost certainly contain further fallout from its missteps last year.

EMB built on its already considerable asset base with more than $425 million in new assets that joined the fray last week thanks to creation flows, and the fund has steadily rallied to its pre-Trump election levels. While EMB traded higher than a $115 handle just last September it is presently trading in the low $113’s and still has some work to do in order to recoup new highs (52 week high is $118.14). The fund is more than two times larger than the next largest alternative in the “Emerging Markets Bond” space which is PCY (PowerShares Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt Portfolio, Expense Ratio 0.50%, $3.7 billion in AUM). PCY has not quite seen the appetite for new assets that EMB (over $547 million in YTD) has had in 2017, but it has attracted more than $45 million in its own right during this time frame. EMLC (VanEck Vectors JPMorgan Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond, Expense Ratio 0.47%, $2.3 billion in AUM), which is the third largest fund in this segment, has also put together a strong 2017 thus far with $200 million in via creation flows. Some of the countries that are represented within the portfolio include Russia (#1 holding, 1.7%), Uruguay (1.03%), Hungary (0.93%), Peru (0.85%), and Argentina (0.84%) to name a few (there are three hundred thirty-nine individual bonds within the product currently). The iShares JPMorgan USD Emer Mkt Bnd Fd ETF (NYSE:EMB) was trading at $113.10 per share on Monday morning, up $0.09 (+0.08%). Year-to-date, EMB has gained 2.61%, versus a 4.06% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. EMB currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 22 ETFs in the Emerging Markets Bonds ETFs category.
