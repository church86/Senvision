Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website  +  one  =  2 Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Keith Fitz-Gerald I just spotted the next global "black swan." But I think it actually looks like a giant Pteranodon. I'm talking about so-called "death derivatives." The Lowdown on "Death Derivatives" After betting trillions on everything from liar loans to mortgages that never should have been issued in the first place, the big banks are back and they're betting on death – yours and mine. It seems that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE: DB) and others now want to help securitize "longevity risk" through a newly created derivatives market. I don't know whether to laugh or cry. Here's the deal. The banks want to collect billions in fees from pension funds and other institutions by issuing insurance that will manage the risks associated with living longer than the financial planners planned. What Wall Street is proposing is to package up the fees from these instruments into bonds that are then securitized and sold to investors via a secondary marketplace the banks themselves will effectively create – a "death derivatives" market. You might think this is farfetched, but the idea is actually far enough along that several financial institutions have already created mortality -rate indices that will be used to price and trade these death instruments. For example, David Blake, director of the pensions institute at the London-based Cass Business School, helped JPMorgan and Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE ADR: CS) develop mortality indices for the United States, Germany, the Netherlands and Wales in 2007. He told Bloomberg that this is to help buyers and sellers price derivatives more accurately and to boost confidence to create a more liquid market. In my mind's eye, I can see and hear the nightly business news report that would result: "The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 200 points in trading today, while the death-note index spiked another 53 points on news that the nation's new healthcare plan failed to prevent market-related heart attacks." Or how about this one: "In an effort to maintain profitability and meet future liabilities, the Dewey, Cheatem and Howe Insurance Co. late today bumped off another class of policyholders. This continues a recent trend that began due to pressure from some of Wall Street's leading investment banks." The conspiracy theorists are going to go nuts. While I can understand the desire these companies have to offset the financial risks of living longer, we need to take a step back here and remember that we've been down this path before. And that "path" abruptly ended at a sheer cliff. Right now, the worldwide derivatives market is valued between a "conservative" $600 trillion and a potential peak of $1.5 quadrillion dollars, according to the latest research – but nobody knows for sure because so much of the market is totally unregulated even at this stage of the game. You'd think global regulators would have figured out that these things are bad news. But that's not the case at all. As a result … well, here we go again. The bottom line: There literally isn't enough money on the planet to bail out this market if or (more accurately) when it goes bad. And the last thing we need is more self-dealing derivatives and yet another set of financial instruments banks can "trade" amongst themselves – with very little, if any oversight. I find it particularly troubling that these instruments are being designed from the get-go to be traded off bank balance sheets, meaning there will be virtually no capital-reserve requirements. Talk about playing with fire. The Death-Derivatives Dilemma What's happened here actually is very simple. Thanks to better medicine, better diets and simple science, people are living longer and the companies that are responsible for pension plans and insurance payouts didn't plan for this. So they've got hefty future payments to make up. Every year of additional life expectancy typically adds as much as 4% to future pension requirements, according to Dutch insurer Aegon NV (NYSE ADR: AEG). Aegon said last week that money set aside to cover policyholders in the Netherlands, who are living longer than expected, resulted in a 12% hit to its first-quarter profits. Enter death derivatives. With these new instruments, if retirees die sooner than expected, the investors who buy the "death notes" profit. If those retirees live longer, investors will have to cough up the additional money needed to pay them off. In the meantime, they're holding "bonds," for lack of a better term, that pay 5% to 8% a year for 20 years. But here's the thing: Insurance companies have to meet reserve requirements and the money that funds their policies has to come from somewhere. This is why these types of companies "reserve" a portion of their policy premiums and overall earnings against future capital needs. I call this the "death-note dilemma," and it is actually quite a fine line. If these companies put too much money into reserves, they blow their quarterly or annual earnings – and investors don't like that. If they put too little into their reserves – and end up being "underfunded" – their policyholders won't have the money available to them when they need and expect it. Enter Wall Street. By taking the "death notes" into the financial markets, the companies now shunt risk to the rest of us, while placing bets that have nothing to do with stocks, bonds or even national debt. In other words, instead of trading risks between the pension fund and its pensioners, these notes allow investors to speculate on individuals over whom they have no vested economic interest in keeping alive. This is like buying fire insurance on your neighbor's house. Instead of safeguarding that property – as you would your own – you have every incentive to burn it down so that you might collect your payout. What's more, by creating vehicles outside the system that are self-priced and self-regulated, there are no capital requirements, no regulated exchanges, and almost no laws capable of restraining (or even assessing) the risks being taken – that is, until the very same companies that stand to collect billions in fees by selling these things for the next 20 years blow up and the rest of us have to bail them out … again! Even at the government's pathetically understated and completely manipulated 2.9% core inflation rate, $17 trillion turns into $30 trillion in 20 years. At the more realistic 9% rate that we're all feeling in our wallets right now, that same $17 trillion turns into $95.27 trillion within the very same time frame. And once a pension fund or other financial institution purchases one of these ticking financial time bombs, they're on the hook for an instrument that they can't adequately value, probably can't sell and, at a time of crisis, almost assuredly won't be able to unwind. That makes the so-called "counterparty risk" even riskier. The industry and the banks maintain the risks are somehow low or manageable because insurance companies don't go bust. But they do – the collapses of American International Group Inc. (NYSE: AIG) and Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc. (PINK: LEHMQ) are tangible evidence of that reality. How to Solve the Death-Derivatives Dilemma So now what? The way I see it, regulators the world over need to act — and act quickly. The very same companies that have already taken the world on a white-knuckle ride that it neither signed up for nor deserved will do it again. The solution is actually very simple. Instead of trying to regulate entities or markets, the powers that be need to regulate businesses by function. In this case, it doesn't matter if you call the "death note" a swap, a policy, an option, a bond or a cumquat. If the payout is based on the probability of some event occurring, that's insurance by any other name and it needs to be regulated as such – with the appropriate level of reserves to back it up. Absent that, these Wall Street "players" (and I imbue that term with all the scorn that is warranted) will once again gorge themselves – gambling on conditions they can't quantify by using self-created instruments that have no transparently determinable economic value and no clearly defined risks … but for which the entire global economy has been conscripted without its knowledge. That's one bet I don't want to make based simply on my own mortality. And it's sure as hell a bet I don't want somebody making on me in the name of profits.

Derivatives are a zero sum game. Somebody's gotta win and somebody's gotta lose. A pension fund that buys longevity bonds will win if people live longer than expected; however, those winnings are simply to cover the "loss" of having to pay pensions for longer than you expected. But if people don't live longer than expected, they are only out the fees paid for owning the derivative. So this is not a bet that will cause insurance companies to croak. It's actually making them safer. So the question is who is on the other side of this bet? And how are they going to come up with the funds should people live longer than expected. And why would that not be pure speculation? If the counter parties are large institutions, this would be a problem because small changes in mortality can have huge impacts on its balance sheet. It would only work if those counter-parties somehow profit when people more rapidly than expected. Unfortunately, I can't think of a natural counter-party for this type of risk. Reply Rocco | May 24, 2011 Not surprised but still deserves a "Wow". So, do you think any regulation of the markets would be necessary if Government has not consistently proven to be the bail out king…if moral hazard was allowed to play a role and inflict the pain on these financial (or should I say Gambling) institutions that they should have felt would they even consider building these houses of cards? I understand the pension side of this but do you think they will look at betting on whole life insurance policies too? Reply Denise | May 24, 2011 Holy Cow! I can't believe that there are zero responses! Are people that detached from what's going on? I'm beyond concerned for the future of our country. Reply db | May 24, 2011 I'll short American Death & long African, essentailly betting that Americans will live too long & Africans die too quickly. Reply Jeff Pluim | May 24, 2011 Futurists have predicted that there are people alive today who will be alive 2,000 years from today. I have been following the advances in genetic medicine. When geneticists overcome a single challenge of extending the ends of the DNA strands, and I believe that they are very close, those futurists' predictions will all come true. Because such an advance in human longevity seems unlikely, to the uninitiated who have not followed these advances in DNA medicine, these new derivatives will have the issuers caught with their pants down, and the taxpayer will end up holding the bag again. Reply John O'Connell | May 24, 2011 You've hit it on the head: it's insurance, and there should be reserves to cover losses. There is already a reinsurance marketplace, and we don't need this. However, if there are people who want to do this stuff, and they may go broke, or cause others to go broke, then let them. Just keep them out of the government-supported universe of banks and insurance companies. And if they go broke, so be it. And if someone else invests in them, and loses money, that's fine, too, but we don't allow our government-supported/insured/subsidized banks and industries do that. Goldman Sachs and their ilk need to either stop doing things like this, or get off the public dole and do it on their own dime. Divest their FDIC-insured commercial banking business, so that if they go broke it's none of our business. Reply we | May 24, 2011 600 Trillionj????? who does your RESEARCH?? Reply Frank | May 27, 2011 So when it starts to unravel down the road, when morals are likely to be worse than they are now it will be profitable to 'get rid' of the problem. I wonder what tool they will use? GMOs perhaps. Reply Aussie Mick | May 28, 2011 Best bet would be to give control of death derivitives to J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Citibank and Wall St….look at how they manipulate the silver, gold, oil and other commodities markets..hate to see them miss out on a bit of 'extra' revenue…the boss would be upset (don't upset the Rockerfellers). Don't think their morals are likely to get worse…that is not possible. Reply David Mortimer | May 28, 2011 Thanks for this piece, Keith. You are a man of many parts. The article makes me very angry and fills me with frustration. I live in Australia and am too far from the action to have any effect on outcomes. We rely on the good old American common sense and values of what is right. Please bring these values to bear on the Vampire Squids. Reply norman cartmell | May 30, 2011 I think derivaties should be regulated otherwise in a few years time we are going to be in a mess again.All the greedy bankers care about are big profits they dont care about the ordinary guy in the street who are suffering because of there gambling. Reply Truth | October 24, 2016 This is why Trump is being brought in by the Vatican – his job is to make the 2008 crash look like storm in a tea cup! – this guy is being sent in by the Illuminati to release a 2008style megazilla Financial Tsunami – goodbuy first world USA, welcome third world USA.

(Reuters/Kim Hong-Ji) Share Written by Eshe Nelson October 24, 2016 The fallout from Samsung’s exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphones could go well beyond Samsung. The fiasco of the Korean company’s recall, replacement, and then recall again of the fire-prone phones could affect the entire country’s stock market. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the US, downgraded their position on Korean equities to underweight because of the Galaxy Note troubles, Jan Loeys, the firm’s chief market strategist, noted last week. Samsung makes up 18% of KOSPI, the Korean stock market, and so its relative size can influence investors’ perceptions of the whole market. Meanwhile, JPMorgan has upgraded its outlook for Taiwanese stocks—on the assumption that Apple will benefit from the demise of this challenger smartphone. (Many of the companies in Apple’s supply chain are based in Taiwan.) You can see the fortunes of the two countries’ stock markets diverging in the past month, in time with the changing prospects of Samsung and Apple. Samsung’s share price has dropped about 3% since Oct. 11, when the company said it was halting all sales of the phone, which many airlines have banned passengers from carrying. A recent regulatory filing suggests the disaster could cost Samsung $2.3 billion in lost profits. We will know more when the company reports third-quarter earnings later this week. For Apple, orders for new iPhones exceeded analysts’ expectations in September and pushed up the share price of the US tech company. The Taiwanese stock market could get another boost tomorrow (Oct. 25) when Apple reports its latest quarterly earnings. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

It could be investment banking giant Goldman Sachs. AT&T’s more than $85 billion deal — $107 billion if debt is included — for Time Warner will lead to big advisory fees for Wall Street firms. But Goldman Sachs was notably shut out of the deal. According to regulatory filings about the blockbuster merger, boutique media banking firm Allen & Co, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley advised Time Warner. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit and another smaller specialty investment bank, Perella Weinberg, were the advisers to AT&T. BofA and JPMorgan also provided $40 billion in loans to AT&T for the deal. The fact that many of Goldman’s rivals are taking part in the Ma Bell-Time Warner hookup is hurting the Vampire Squid in the latest rankings of investment banks. Before the AT&T-Time Warner announcement, Goldman Sachs was ranked first in the so-called league tables, which ranks investment bankers based on the value of the deals it is working on that have been announced so far this year. But once you add the AT&T-Time Warner deal to the mix, both Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase vault ahead of Goldman Sachs, according to figures from Thomson Reuters. Morgan Stanley is now working on deals in the U.S. worth more than $408 billion. JPMorgan Chase’s deal volume totals $393 billion. Goldman remains stuck at $383 billion. And BofA, which remained in fourth, is now less than $8 billion behind Goldman in deal volume. The league tables represent bragging rights for Wall Street bankers. Merger fees are also based partly on the size of deals too. Goldman often finds itself on top of these rankings — so that is good for both its image and bottom line.

By Ben White and Andrew Hanna 10/24/16 08:00 AM EDT AT&T-TIME WARNER DEAL DOOMED? — Via a D.C. lobbyist: “If history is any guide, millions of dollars will be spent on lobbying the WH, Congress & key committees to nudge the merger towards approval. But anyone paying close attention to recent mega-telecom match-ups will realize that the FCC has managed a very tight inter-agency process that has kept outside political influences at bay. “Sometimes in the past the announcement of a potential merger began what was essentially a negotiation with the FCC on pricing, public access, etc. That system no longer rules…… If the application itself is wanting, marketplace actions taken in contemplation of FCC approval will have zero impact on the government's deliberations. FCC commissioners and staff are no longer messing around.” Story Continued Below CAVEAT … It’s not certain the FCC will even get the chance to shut the deal down (more on this below). TRUMP TEAM SAYS NO WAY — WSJ’s Bob Davis: “AT&T Inc.’s blockbuster weekend bid to purchase Time Warner Inc. quickly turned into a election-year issue, with Donald Trump’s campaign vowing to block the deal as part of an effort to use antitrust law to make it harder for big corporations to deepen their control over information. “‘We need a new way of looking at mergers that go beyond traditional model of oligopoly effect on price, quantity and economic efficiency,’ University of California at Irvine economist Peter Navarro, a senior advisor to the Republican presidential candidate, said in an interview. Mr. Navarro said regulators also need to look at the ‘effects of oligopoly on freedom of thought and influencing narratives that influence political process in ways that promote the agendas of the media conglomerates’” Read more. KAINE ALSO HAS QUESTIONS — POLITICO’s Isaac Arnsdorf: “Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine said Sunday he's concerned about the proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner, suggesting a Hillary Clinton administration might be skeptical of the deal if she wins the election. ‘I share those concerns and questions. We've got to get to the bottom of them,’ the Virginia senator told host Chuck Todd on NBC's ‘Meet the Press.’ ‘Less concentration, I think, is generally helpful, especially in the media.’ “Clinton hasn't commented on the deal but has previously called for strong regulatory scrutiny of major mergers. … Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) said it ‘raises some immediate flags about consolidation in the media market.’ The $85.4 billion merger would increase consolidation in the telecom industry by combining AT&T’s phone and internet services with Time Warner’s media brands such HBO, CNN and Warner Bros.” Read more. SANDERS: HELL NO! — Bernie Sanders on Twitter: “The administration should kill the Time Warner/AT&T merger. This deal would mean higher prices and fewer choices for the American people” WHAT’S AT STAKE FOR WALL STREET — Bloomberg: “Wall Street banks are writing some of their biggest checks ever to fund AT&T Inc.’s takeover of Time Warner Inc. as they seek a bonanza of fees. But there’s a dose of concern that the $40 billion loan pledge may get caught up in a regulatory impasse. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has pledged $25 billion of the financing, with Bank of America Corp. providing the rest … That’s believed to be the most JPMorgan has ever promised for a deal … “The lending commitment gives the banks an advantage on bond offerings that would find willing buyers among yield-starved investors … At the same time the banks face the risk that the deal, along with a chunk of their balance sheets, would be tied up if regulators delay approving it.” Read more. GOLDMAN ON 2017 — Via Goldman’s “Weekly Kickstart” report: “Regardless of victor, we expect that the most likely economic policy outcomes of the US presidential election are increased fiscal spending and tax reform. … Our economists expect that Clinton’s tax plans will closely resemble those put forward by the Obama Administration in the FY 2017 budget, which proposed a one-time tax of 14 percent on previously untaxed foreign profits. “Mr. Trump has echoed the proposal by House Republican leaders, which also includes a repatriation tax holiday … Our recently rebalanced basket of 50 S&P 500 stocks with the highest earnings invested overseas … should benefit from an earnings repatriation holiday. Stocks in our High Overseas Earnings basket hold $1.7 trillion of permanently reinvested foreign earnings, equal to 70 percent of the $2.4 trillion held by all S&P 500 firms” HAPPENING TODAY: WEISS AT THE NYFRB — Via a Treasury official on Monday’s Treasury conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York: “Antonio Weiss is delivering one of a number of speeches and he plans to articulate a view on transparency in the Treasury market in the wake of the last week’s FINRA rule becoming final that will allow the official sector to start collecting Treasury cash market data in July.” Full agenda/webcast. CHINA ON A BUYING SPREE — Per new Bloomberg graphic showing “Chinese companies are buying up overseas assets at a faster pace than U.S. buyers for the first time on record.” Graphic. RYAN’S DAYS AS SPEAKER NUMBERED? — Stan Collender in Forbes: “Never mind the next Congress: It now looks like Ryan could be deposed or forced to resign this Congress in the lame duck session that begins a week after Election Day. In other words, Ryan may no longer be speaker about four weeks from now. “I say this after hearing from several highly reliable sources that the House Freedom Caucus is seriously considering doing to Ryan what it did to former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) by threatening him with a privileged motion to vacate the chair. If a majority of the House supported the motion, Ryan would be removed immediately as speaker.” Read more. TRUMP WIN COULD CRUSH MARKETS — POLITICO’s Ben White: ‘Wall Street is set up for a major crash if Donald Trump shocks the world on Election Day and wins the White House. New research out on Friday suggests that financial markets strongly prefer a Hillary Clinton presidency and could react with panicked selling should Trump defy the polls and deliver a shocking upset on Nov. 8. … “The new report suggests that the stock market is worth 11 percent more under a Clinton presidency than a Trump presidency. This is a highly unusual circumstance because markets historically prefer Republican policies on taxes, regulation and trade to those of Democrats. … Current market action is the direct reverse of what happened in 2012 when President Barack Obama was running for reelection against former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. When Romney clearly beat Obama in the first debate, markets rallied” Read more. GOOD MONDAY MORNING — Only 15 days to go!

CALL … FROM CITIGROUP — An eagle-eyed reader found this post from Trump on his Trump University web site: “It’s a familiar scenario to me, because one night at 3am, when I was more than $9 billion in debt, I was summoned to Citibank for a conference call with a bevy of international bankers to whom I owed money. “It was pouring rain and I couldn’t get a cab, so I had to walk to the bank, 15 blocks from Trump Tower. By the time I got there I was soaked. I felt then like I had reached my lowest point. But we worked things out, and the rest, as they say is history. They also say it’s darkest before the dawn. You know what I say: Never ever give up.” Read more. NEWS OF THE WEIRD — Iceland is on the cusp of being ruled by the Pirate Party. Not making this up. Read more. IF YOU WENT TO BED EARLY .. Ask someone about the Sunday Night Football game between Arizona and Seattle that ended in a 6-6 tie in incredibly bizarre fashion. ‘TRUST’ US — FT’s Matthey Garrahan: “AT&T faces an uphill battle to convince US regulators that its proposed $85.4bn purchase of Time Warner will not unfairly distort the media and communications industries after opponents of the deal said the combined entity would wield too much market power. “The purchase faces at least a year of regulatory scrutiny. In a joint statement, senators Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, said the deal ‘would potentially raise significant antitrust issues, which the subcommittee would carefully examine’.” Read more. MASSIVE SKEPTICISM — NYT’s Michael J. de la Merced: “Reaction to AT&T’s $85.4 billion purchase was swift — and, outside of Wall Street, full of skepticism. Much of the concern was rooted in how consumers have fared since Comcast bought NBCUniversal, a deal that provided a template for the consolidation of media and telecommunications. … [C]ombining a telecommunications company with a media company, in particular, raises questions about whether consumers would have less choice because the conglomerate both creates its own content and provides the pipes” … “In a statement, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee said they planned to hold a hearing on the deal. And even competitors like Disney quickly chimed in, urging regulators to pay close attention in their review. At issue is whether AT&T, with over 100 million subscribers across its wireless, broadband and DirecTV offerings, will somehow favor its own customers when it comes to HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. properties like the Batman and Harry Potter franchises” Read more. A LONG AND UPHILL BATTLE — FT’s Matthew Garrahan: “The purchase faces at least a year of regulatory scrutiny. In a joint statement, senators Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, said the deal ‘would potentially raise significant antitrust issues, which the subcommittee would carefully examine’. “‘I think AT&T is going into this knowing they have an uphill battle,’ said Amanda Wait, an antitrust partner at Hunton & Williams, a Washington law firm. ‘Any Clinton administration will take a tough look at it. The key issues here will be whether owning Time Warner content harms competition or whether it makes AT&T stronger.’” Read more. HOW IT COULD SUCCEED — WP’s Brian Fung: “[T]he FCC's involvement hinges on whether Time Warner sells certain assets to AT&T. If the FCC is excluded from the process, it could weaken regulators' ability to prevent harm to competition, said Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department antitrust official who is now president of the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. … “The FCC generally has a say in acquisitions that involve the sale of assets regulated by the agency. This may include, for example, TV stations owned by one of the two companies. But in Saturday's deal involving AT&T and Time Warner, no such assets may change hands. Time Warner owns just one Atlanta-based TV station, and it has not announced whether the station will be sold to AT&T. The station could be spun off and excluded from the deal — which would also eliminate any reason for the FCC to become involved” Read more. GAME OVER — WSJ’S Robert McMillan and Rory Jones: “The computerized attack that left more than 1,200 websites unreachable on Friday stemmed from efforts, years earlier, by players of online games to frustrate and slow their opponents, security experts say. “Several security experts say the computer instructions for the attack had been refined from code written by disaffected videogame players calling themselves Lizard Squad who launched attacks on Christmas Day 2014 against online-game services operated by Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp.” Read more. AIRBNB PUNCHES BACK — NYT’s Katie Benner Hours after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York signed a bill that would impose steep fines on Airbnb hosts who break local housing regulations, Airbnb filed a federal lawsuit contending the new law would cause it ‘irreparable harm.’” “The new law in New York allows authorities to fine hosts up to $7,500 if they are caught listing a property on a rental platform such as Airbnb.” Read more. MAY CALLS FAMILY MEETING — Reuter’s Kylie MacLellan: “Representatives of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments will get a chance to tell Brexit minister David Davis how they hope Britain's future relationship with the EU will work, under plans the government announced on Monday. “At a meeting on Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May will offer the leaders of the three devolved governments, which have varying degrees of autonomy, formal discussions on Brexit at least twice before the end of the year, her office said.” Read more. JUST CAPITAL — POLITICO’s Colin Wilhelm: “A top banking regulator is likely to include capital requirements for startups if it offers them a national charter, a decision that could discourage companies from pursuing the charter that several of them have long sought. “Industry stakeholders, as well as regulators themselves, say that a limited-purpose fintech charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will probably include some kind of capital requirements similar to what a bank would face.” Read more. RUSSIA TO MEET WITH OPEC — Reuter’s Rania el Gamal and Reem Shamseddine: “Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Sunday he had invited his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak to meet Gulf Arab energy ministers in Riyadh as part of efforts to cooperate with non-OPEC members to stabilize the oil market. “Falih said Novak had welcomed the invitation, ‘as a clear indication of sincere desire to continue cooperation and coordination with the oil producing and exporting countries for more stability in the market.’” Read more. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — WHAT TRUMP MEANS FOR BANKS — American Ian McKendry: “Despite more than a year of campaigning and discussing various issues … Trump remains a huge question mark when it comes to banking policies — making it unclear exactly what his priorities would be if he succeeds in seizing the White House. … “During the campaign, he's vacillated between populist views like calling for the return of Glass-Steagall and more traditional conservative ones like favoring a reduction in regulation. It makes it hard to gauge his real agenda, observers said.” Read more. COULD OBAMA TEAM STICK AROUND? — Via POLITICO’s Lorraine Woellert: “Meet the new boss: Same as the old boss? Hillary’s coattails are looking short, making it increasingly likely she’ll have to deal with a divided — and cranky — Senate. “To preserve political capital, she might want to skip a few confirmation battles, and a growing school of thought in Washington says she’ll ask some Obama people to stick around. HUD Secretary Julian Castro might be one of them. Housing is shaping up to be a low policy priority and there’s no burning need to make a strong political statement.” FIRST LOOK: NEW GSE REPORT — American Action Forum’s Douglas Holtz-Eakin has a new piece on Monday on the CBO’s recent analysis on the recap and release bill for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: “The best course forward is real GSE reform. But in the absence of that, the worst thing is to pursue faux reforms that enable turning back the clock.” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements.

Then early next year about 20 banks will put the Zelle name on their mobile apps and web pages. A Zelle app also will be offered to the public for connections through other institutions. The consortium is taking a series of steps in its attempt to bring more than 100 million customers of banks and credit unions into Zelle without disrupting people who already use other ways to send money with phones and computers. “This is about creating a wide, and inclusive, alternative to cash and checks for everyone,” said Finch, who was at the Money 20/20 payments industry conference in Las Vegas to promote Zelle for its bank owners. The moves come five years after three of the biggest banks -JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co – formed a joint-venture, initially called clearXchange, to make it easier to send money to accounts at different banks. But the banks were slow to bring other financial institutions into the fold and market the network and so lost momentum to technology company upstarts. Citigroup Inc did not agree to join until September. The banks only recently decided to use the name Zelle. In the meantime, Venmo appeared. In the three months through September, Venmo processed $4.9 billion of person-to-person payments, up 131 percent from a year earlier. Venmo, now part of PayPal Holdings Inc, built its following by social networking young adults ready to share dinner tabs and apartment rents with their phones. But the banks have larger bases of customers to connect as they try to make Zelle ubiquitous. JPMorgan’s Chase “Quick Pay,” for example, processed $7.4 billion in the three months ended September, up 36 percent from a year earlier, according to bank spokeswoman Rebecca Acevedo. The initial set of 19 banks to offer Zelle early next year has about 76 million customers using mobile banking apps and about 65 percent of U.S. checking and savings accounts, Finch said. Agreements in place with additional financial institutions, debit card networks and other payment companies, such as Fiserv Inc, will bring the portion of accounts to 90 percent to 95 percent, Finch said. The bank consortium owners decided that for Zelle to succeed it needs to look and work the same for everyone. But some banks already have made digital payment brand names, such as JPMorgan’s Quick Pay, familiar to many of their customers. Those banks will use the Zelle name prominently alongside their established names as Zelle catches on, Finch said.

Bethania Palma Oct 24, 2016 Share - - Claim: The Clinton Foundation suddenly transferred $1.8 billion to a bank in Qatar. false Origin:On 16 October 2016, the conspiracy-mongering fake new sites WhatDoesItMean.com, posted a story reporting that Hillary Clinton (or the Clinton Foundation, depending on whether one read the headline or the first paragraph) suddenly transferred $1.8 billion to the Qatar Central Bank. The story, posted by a blogger who uses the nom de plume Sorcha Faal, claimed the transfer was exposed by a report circulating in the Kremlin: An intriguing Ministry of Finance (MoF) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that elite Western bankers were “stunned/bewildered” a few hours ago after the Bank For International Settlements (BIS) registered a $1.8 billion transfer from the Clinton Foundation (CF) to the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) through the “facilitation/abetment” of JP Morgan Chase & Company (JPM) — and for reasons yet to be firmly established. According to this report, the Bank for International Settlements is the world's oldest international financial organization and acts as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; the Qatar Central Bank is the bank of that Gulf State nations government and their “bank of banks”; JP Morgan Chase & Company is the United States largest “megabank”; and the Clinton Foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the Russian mafia. The article linked to a number of news sites and blogs but conveniently failed to link to the alleged Kremlin report that would support its main claim. The lack of proof that such a financial transfer was made hasn't stopped other unscrupulous web sites, such MegynKelly.org (which despite using her name doesn't have anything to do with the Fox News journalist Megyn Kelly) and Liberty Alliance from posting the story as though it were a legitimate news item. RationalWiki describes Sorcha Faal's blog as an "eyesore" that is taken seriously only by its conspiracy theorist audience, and even then only marginally: Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of "reports" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it. Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish. As we have noted in the past, Sorcha Faal is a notorious poster of false information, but the Internet being what it is, such information gets picked up and spread by unwary readers. Previous yarns created by Faal contain headlines such as "Russia Names Hillary Clinton as 'Murder Suspect' in Death of Top UFO Researchers."

The venture, replacing an existing system called clearXchange next year, will be accessible to more than 76 million mobile banking customers when it starts, according to a statement Sunday from Early Warning, the bank-owned entity handling the project. The move is part of a tech upgrade and branding push by traditional financial firms eager to dispel their industry's image as slow, after past decades in which transferring funds between institutions often took days. Silicon Valley upstarts have been pushing into their turf with virtually instant payment systems such as PayPal's Venmo in recent years, even as a growing number of banks began matching their speed. Read more: • Crain's publishes list of largest commercial banks, thrifts • Homegrown banks grab more market share • Why overbanked Chicago has even more banks “The CEOs of these banks got together and said 'It's time to make this real,'” Paul Finch, chief executive officer of bank-owned Early Warning, said in a telephone interview. 'SPEED, AGILITY' Zelle is short for gazelle, which Finch said “conveys speed and agility.” The system lets consumers send money to one another using an e-mail address or mobile phone number registered with their financial institution. Users will be able to arrange real-time transfers online or, beginning next year, through Zelle's consumer mobile app. U.S. households made more than $1.2 trillion in person-to-person payments in 2014, according to Aite Group. About one-fifth of that was processed by non-banks like PayPal or Square Inc., Aite's research shows. Other firms set to use Zelle include Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, Capital One Financial, PNC Financial Services Group and BB&T. In the meantime, Finch says, the venture aims to build out the network to make it easier for additional regional and community lenders to join.

One of the big winners should the AT&T-Time Warner deal get done would be Morgan Stanley. The blockbuster $85.4 billion proposed unification of the two communications heavyweights pushed the investment bank to the top of the standings this year for U.S.-targeted mergers and acquisitions activity, according to Thomson Reuters figures updated Monday. In the largest deal of 2016, AT&T will pay $85.4 billion to acquire the media giant, should it get past significant regulatory hurdles. The deal has a total value of $108.7 billion when it includes Time Warner's net debt. M&A had been lagging in the U.S. and globally but has gotten some juice lately. The AT&T-Time Warner deal pushes the U.S. total to $1.23 trillion, lagging 2015's total of $1.61 trillion at the same juncture. Morgan Stanley has been in on 101 deals this year totaling $408.4 billion, lifting it from second place to first in the so-called league standings, ahead of JPMorgan Chase, which actually has done more total deals at 137 but for a value of $399.9 billion. Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The lift in revenue did little to boost the bank's share price, which was down slightly and trailing a broader market rally Monday. Other banks involved in the deal were JPMorgan, which moved up from third to second; Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which solidified its hold on fourth place; Citigroup, which moved from seventh to fifth; and Perella Weinberg Partners, which leaped from 32nd to 14th. Perella Weinberg, Bank of America and JPMorgan advised AT&T, with Bank of America and JPMorgan also offering bridge financing, while Sullivan & Cromwell and Arnold & Porter provided legal advice. Allen & Co, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisors to Time Warner, while Cravath, Swaine & Moore was its legal advisor. — Reuters contributed to this report.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Mo Money Mo Problems America’s Biggest Banks Unveil Their Venmo Killer Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Mo Money Mo Problems America’s Biggest Banks Unveil Their Venmo Killer It’s called Zelle. by Maya KosoffOctober 24, 2016 1:49 pm Email Facebook Twitter From Bloomberg/Getty Images. Four years after Venmo revolutionized the mobile-payments space by giving millennials an easy way to exchange small amounts of money, instantly—and three years after PayPal acquired Venmo owner Braintree for $800 million— America’s biggest banks are finally catching up. On Sunday night, financial risk management company Early Warning announced that it has partnered with 19 U.S. banks—including Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citi, Capital One, and JPMorgan—to offer Zelle, a money-transfer service designed to compete with Venmo, PayPal, and Square Cash. Zelle—named for the “speed and agility” of a gazelle, according to Early Warning C.E.O. Paul Finch—will let users send money to others online or using a mobile app, beginning early next year. Unlike Venmo, PayPal, and other money-transfer services, however, Zelle allows users to gain access to their funds immediately at no extra cost. (Square Cash, Square’s answer to Venmo, charges a fee for instant deposits, while Venmo doesn’t offer such a service, requiring users to wait 1-2 business days before mobile deposits turn up in their real-world accounts.) Early Warning says 76 million mobile-banking customers will be able to access Zelle, which replaces an earlier money-transfer service called clearXchange, founded five years earlier by JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. Zelle will have to make a compelling argument to millennials to get them to switch over from other services. Venmo still reigns as the quintessential millennial transaction platform, and it is still growing quarter-over-quarter. In the first three months of 2016, Venmo’s payment volume grew 154 percent, to $3.2 billion. PayPal ended 2015 with 179 million active customer accounts, growing its user base by 6.6 million in the last quarter of 2015. Several banks already have had their own digital payments services, like JPMorgan’s QuickPay, or Citibank’s PopMoney, but none have caught on widely. While it is unclear whether the Zelle name will simply paper over these banks’ existing brands and UX, creating a uniform experience, or whether the Zelle platform will supersede them entirely, Early Warning’s Venmo killer has one major advantage. It may not have the built-in cool factor that Venmo has cultivated over the years, but Zelle will benefit by being the default service provided automatically by many of the country’s biggest banks. While Venmo is already in wide use, it remains to be seen how loyal users will be once Zelle can provide instant transfers—an obstacle that third-party payments services haven’t been able to overcome.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) may need to change its timeline for an exit from the business of settling trades of U.S. government securities, Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell said on Monday. Powell said JPMorgan had publicly recognized the importance of not disrupting financial markets when it leaves the business. "The timeline set for a gradual transition over the next two years should be sufficient to avoid significant dislocations," Powell said in prepared remarks for a conference in New York on the structure of the U.S. Treasury market. "However, if unexpected complications arise, that timeline may need to be adjusted," Powell said. Currently, JPMorgan and Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) are the only two companies that provide settlement services for U.S. government securities. "Any disruptions to these critical market services could have serious consequences for financial stability," Powell said, adding that the Bank of New York Mellon will continue to be held to higher standards of resilience given its systemic importance.

Ogg October 24, 2016 11:50 am EST Print Email Tweet Shares of Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ARIA) were down handily on Monday. The drop follows news that JPMorgan downgraded the stock to Underweight from Neutral. The firm also set a $7 price target. What investors will care about here is that Ariad is not a typical downgrade stock. On top of that, Ariad just came under scrutiny for a drug price hike after Senator Sanders asked the company about the pricing of its blood cancer drug Iclusig. What is so different here from other cases in which drug price hikes have come under scrutiny is that Ariad is not yet profitable. Its shares fell as much as 15% in the past week or so when the Sanders query was made and on word of repeated and staggering price hikes. Reportedly, Ariad has raised its wholesale price of Iclusig as a therapy for a rare advanced form of leukemia four times over the course of a year. Bloomberg showed that its 30-day pack now costs over $16,000, for a cost of almost $200,000 per year. Iclusig sales almost doubled to $65 million in the second quarter of this year. Another word of caution came from RBC Capital Markets, which noted that Ariad’s estimates may be 20% too high as a result of the congressional inquiry into Iclusig. The fear is that even if nothing comes out bad against the company, Ariad will still have to make some form of concession. Even before the formal JPMorgan downgrade on Monday, the firm warned just last week that the pricing scrutiny made for a scenario in which the firm would not be surprised by some continued profit taking in the near term. Again, what stands out here on Monday is that the drug price hikes are against a company that is not even profitable. As of the end of 2015, the company’s accumulated deficit for retained earnings was −$1.445 billion. That figure was down to −$1.389 billion by the end of June. Another issue worth noting is that for the past four years, again while the company has been losing money, research and development has been the single largest expense on average and is generally more than 50% of its expenses. Ariad shares were trading at $13.07 on October 13, but they were down to $11.14 on October 14. Its stock has drifted lower almost every trading day since. After shares were down 3.7% to $10.38 on Friday, Monday’s initial trading was indicated down almost 4% at $9.97, but its shares were last seen down 7.5% at $9.60. While this stock is down 30% or so in the past month, share are still up about 50% so far in 2016. Ariad now has a consensus analyst price target of $13.33, according to Thomson Reuters. That is down from $10.43 just a month ago. Stay tuned. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

Wall Street banks are writing some of their biggest checks ever to fund AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner as they seek a bonanza of fees. But there’s a dose of concern that the $40 billion loan pledge may get caught up in a regulatory impasse. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has pledged $25 billion of the financing, with Bank of America Corp. providing the rest, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified without authorization to speak publicly. That’s believed to be the most JPMorgan has ever promised for a deal, the person said. The lending commitment alone would bring about $110 million to $130 million in fees for JPMorgan and Bank of America, according to estimates from consulting firm Freeman & Co. It also gives the banks an advantage on bond offerings that would find eager buyers among yield-starved investors. At the same time, the banks face the risk that the deal, along with a chunk of their balance sheets, would be tied up if regulators delay approving it. “This could be an especially lucrative deal for the banking industry; they’re going to make a lot of money if the deal gets done” said Bert Ely, a banking consultant at Ely & Co. “The numbers on the credit piece look big, but I’m sure the credit risk will be spread widely. The big uncertainty hanging over this will be the battle for regulatory approval and what lender protections are included if the deal fails.” T-Mobile failure A failed megadeal wouldn’t be the first for AT&T. In 2011, the company abandoned its takeover of T-Mobile USA because of regulatory hurdles. JPMorgan had lined up $20 billion to finance that deal. Taking on commitments to underwrite large deals helps JPMorgan maintain its top position in leading corporate debt deals in the U.S. JPMorgan has occupied the top spot for managing dollar bond sales from highly rated companies since 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank has been the top provider of similarly rated loans for each year since 2005, Bloomberg data show. To help finance this proposed deal, AT&T brought in Bank of America as its partner on Thursday, keeping the number of participants to a minimum until the announcement, the person said. JPMorgan intends in the coming weeks to syndicate most of the $40 billion loan to other banks that already lend to AT&T. Bridge loan The loan is structured as an 18-month bridge deal, a type of financing that a borrower repays by issuing debt in capital markets. In the case of AT&T, most of the deal will be replaced by high-grade bonds, with a potential portion in the form of term loans, the person said. AT&T said that it’s seeking to hang onto its investment-grade credit rating after the deal is completed. But the lenders themselves are taking on other risks by using their balance sheet resources, according to Charles Peabody, a bank analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading.  “That is dangerous because this deal could be hung up in antitrust wranglings for a long time,’’ he said. JPMorgan and Bank of America won’t be protected if credit markets swing and they can’t sell the debt for what they had anticipated, he said.  Jessica Francisco, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, and Thomas Rottcher, a Bank of America spokesman, declined to comment. AT&T, based in Dallas, didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail and calls on Sunday. The deal caps AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson’s vision to expand the company into media and entertainment as its wireless business matures. Gaining premium cable channels HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. studio means AT&T becomes a content owner rather than just a distributor of video. Yield hunger For the investors that would later be asked to buy bonds refinancing the bridge loan, the takeover means a juicy alternative to the more than $10 trillion of debt globally that’s yielding less than zero, driven down by easy-money policies from Europe to Japan. “The investor base is starved for yield,” said David Hendler, founder of Viola Risk Advisors and a veteran bank analyst. “This would be a good earning asset in a low yield world—which is very much in demand at the moment in the syndicate market. Banks are deposit-rich and looking to invest in loans.” The prospective deal has raised regulatory questions ahead of the U.S. election, as both the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees expressed suspicion of blockbuster deals. Hillary Clinton has been critical of big mergers and has called for “reinvigorating” antitrust enforcement while her opponent Donald Trump broke with Republican orthodoxy on Saturday by saying he would block the Time Warner acquisition, arguing that such deals leave too much power concentrated among too few companies. If AT&T’s deal doesn’t gain approval, it must pay a $500 million reverse break-up fee to Time Warner, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Bond trading Beyond collecting the fees that come from underwriting large takeovers, banks also benefit from trading that debt in the secondary market. CEO Brian Moynihan pointed to Bank of America’s debt underwriting business as a reason for his beat last week in estimates for third-quarter fixed-income trading revenue.  Wall Street’s biggest investment banks have been taking a greater percentage of their overall revenue from issuing new debt and trading fixed-income products, which includes corporate debt, sovereign debt, currencies and commodities. Debt underwriting made up 11.3% of U.S. investment banks’ third-quarter revenue, about a percentage point more than in the same period two years ago, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. U.S. banks relied on fixed-income underwriting and trading to propel 56 percent of their total investment banking business in the third quarter, a rise from 47% last year and 50% two years ago, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. “These guys are fairly anxious to generate fee income. This is an area where you can make money very quickly. And very big money,’’ said Compass Point’s Peabody.  Bank of America Corp.BankingWall StreetTechnologyFinanceInvestment Get Crain's Digital NY Alert Sign up for our FREE weekly Digital NY email newsletter.

He added, however, that the shares now reflect more than a healthy 2018, while underestimating the risks. Analyst Wertheimer downgraded the Machinery sector from Neutral to Negative, saying that valuation reflected “a relatively sharp rebound back to midcycle and trades even with multi industry in 2018…But cycle overhangs are larger than normal in every way.” Terex Wertheimer downgraded the rating on Terex Corporation (NYSE: TEX) from Equal-weight to Underweight, while maintaining the price target at $20. The new management team has been several positive changes in less than a year. The company’s balance sheet is now stronger, backed by asset sales. “What remains is a strategically well positioned Aerial Work Platform business, a cranes business that is struggling but which to be fair is now deeply cyclically depressed, and a very steady materials processing business of middling attractiveness.” The analyst noted, however, that the replacement cycle would likely be stepper and harder than is currently being anticipated. Actuant Wertheimer downgraded the rating on Actuant Corporation (NYSE: ATU) from Equal-weight to Underweight, while maintaining the price target at $19. Actuant has a dynamic new CEO, some high quality businesses and a few “straightforward paths to value creation.” Despite these positives, the challenges ahead for the company would likely be greater than the market is currently estimating, the analyst commented. WABCO Wertheimer upgraded the rating on WABCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE: WBC) from Equal-weight to Overweight, while maintaining the price target at $107. While the US downturn does not seem to have bottomed out, Europe would likely move downward for the next three to five years. The analyst added, “Wabco is, however, a high quality company with a clear and successful strategy, a path to outgrow tepid market growth across industrials, has a no-debt balance sheet, and trades under 16x our 2018 estimate.” Wertheimer believes that even in the absence of a supportive end market, Wabco’s growth would result in the stock being among the cheaper names in the group in a couple of years. Estimates already reflect weakness in the US and an EU downturn. While saying that there is potential for upside to growth, the analyst pointed out that Wabco’s balance sheet supports the possibility of acquisition, while other machinery companies have been repurchasing shares in recent years.

America's biggest banks are closing hundreds of branches Business Insider 10/24/2016 Tina Wadhwa © Provided by Business Insider   America's biggest banks are closing hundreds of branches. Quotes in the article Bank of America Corporation BAC ▼ 20.00 -0.08 -0.40% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 77.71 -0.31 -0.40% Citigroup Inc C ▲ 55.46 +0.01 +0.02% Wells Fargo & Co WFC ▲ 52.82 +0.33 +0.63% Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan shut 389 branches since the third quarter of last year.  Bank of America, which had over 6,000 branches before the financial crisis has now shrank to 4,629, according to third quarter accounts.  The bank has cut 112 financial centers from last year.  Paul Donofrio, CFO of Bank of America, said the closing of branches was part of a "shift to self-served digital channels, mobile, online, and ATM" in a 3Q earnings call transcript.  According to the 3Q earnings report, the bank has 21 million mobile banking active users and 18% of deposit transactions are completed through mobile devices. "That’s better for customers, it’s also better for our shareholders," said Donofrio. "It’s one-tenth the cost of walking into a branch." "So it’s a quality versus quantity and making sure we understand," said CEO Brian Monihyan on the earnings call. "I’d say we went from seven million visits probably four to five years ago to six to five. But those five are of a higher quality, and we think that’s important." There are less bank branches, but the ones that stand reflect changing customers' behaviors. As consumers opt to go online for transactional services like check deposits, bank branches now emphasize  more value added services that " you just have to do face to face" and are adding more mortgage and investment specialists.  They are becoming a place to come for advice according to life events - mortgages, investments, saving for college.  And the cuts aren't just in terms of bank branches but also in headcount. Bank of America indicated back in June that it planned to cut over 8,000 jobs from its consumer banking division. According to retail banking head and consumer banking co-head Thong Nguyen at a June conference, this is part of a broader cost-cutting and resource reallocation program to meet with consumers' changing banking habits. Bank of America isn't the only bank to restructure its branches. When Citigroup announced its third-quarter earnings last Friday, October 14, it revealed its branch count has shrunk 7% in North America from the third quarter of last year and is down 116 banks globally to 2,679. "We have spent the last several years reshaping our branch network, upgrading technology and deepening our focus on our core six markets, enabling us to grow revenues while reducing expenses and significantly improving the profitability of our retail bank," Citigroup CFO John Gerspach said on the 3Q earnings call. Earlier this year, Citi Global Perspectives and Solutions (GPS) produced a report that found that banks are quickly approaching their "automation tipping point," and they could soon reduce headcount by as much as 30%. "Banks' Uber moment will mean a disintermediation of bank branches rather than the banks themselves," the report said. "Specifically, it will mean the shift to mobile distribution being the main channel of interaction between customers and the bank," the report reads. © Provided by Business Insider   That means that there will be less need for bank branches, and the people who work inside them. JPMorgan has also been cutting back on the number of retail branches, with 161 less branches this quarter than the third quarter of last year. 3Q 2016 stores stand at 5,310, down from 5,471 in the same quarter last year.  According to JPMorgan CFO  Marianne Lake on the 3Q earnings call, new card account originations were up 35% this quarter, with more than three quarters of new accounts being opened through digital channels, and active mobile users were up 17% in 3Q.  JPMorgan is also focusing marketing efforts to millennial customers, who now compromise 57% of new checking account customers and are more likely to use mobile banking.  Major retail bank Wells Fargo historically hasn't cut branches as much as its peers and hasn't announced any major closures in light of its huge fraudulant account scandal. However, credit card applications, consumer loyalty and interactions between branch bankers and customers have declined sharply according to its 3Q earnings report last Friday, October 14. In the 3Q quarterly earnings report, the bank indicated a renewed shift to mobile, which they said "will allow us to review our branch footprint for consolidation opportunities." © Provided by Business Insider   Whether Wells Fargo realizes it or not, they're going to be closing 1,000 branches," CLSA bank analyst Mike Mayo told CNN Money. "It's a matter of when, not if." While traditional retail banks shift their focus to digital models, others not in the consumer space, like Goldman Sachs, are launching online only US savings account. Online only GS Bank launched this past April and Goldman's new consumer lending arm, Marcus, launched earlier this month.  "Digital technology is making large brick and mortar branches questionable," said Harit Talwar, head of Digital Finance at Goldman Sachs, in a podcast. "You don't need necessarily brick and mortar branch networks to get into consumer financial services. Why wait in line when I can do it in on the phone? The traditional distribution strengths that some of the large banks have, from distribution strengths have become legacy costs."

New figures released show that foot traffic to branches is also down, with "branch banker interactions" down 22 percent from 2015. The figures come in the wake of a sales practice scandal that triggered multiple lawsuits, an enormous $185 million fine and the resignation of the company's longtime CEO John Stumpf.

PHOTO: REUTERS Oct 24, 2016 12:40 PM [NEW YORK] By the end of December some US bank customers may begin to notice features of the new Zelle instant payments network appearing on their mobile phone and online banking apps as the financial industry tries to catch up to technology company rivals, such as Venmo. Paul Finch, chief executive of the bank network operator, Early Warning Services, said during the weekend that buttons on user screens for digital payments at some banks will gradually start to use a uniform procedure for individuals to send and receive money. Then early next year about 20 banks will put the Zelle name on their mobile apps and web pages. A Zelle app also will be offered to the public for connections through other institutions. The consortium is taking a series of steps in its attempt to bring more than 100 million customers of banks and credit unions into Zelle without disrupting people who already use other ways to send money with phones and computers. "This is about creating a wide, and inclusive, alternative to cash and checks for everyone," said Mr Finch, who was at the Money 20/20 payments industry conference in Las Vegas to promote Zelle for its bank owners. The moves come five years after three of the biggest banks -JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co - formed a joint-venture, initially called clearXchange, to make it easier to send money to accounts at different banks. But the banks were slow to bring other financial institutions into the fold and market the network and so lost momentum to technology company upstarts. Citigroup Inc did not agree to join until September. The banks only recently decided to use the name Zelle. In the meantime, Venmo appeared. In the three months through September, Venmo processed US$4.9 billion of person-to-person payments, up 131 per cent from a year earlier. Venmo, now part of PayPal Holdings Inc, built its following by social networking young adults ready to share dinner tabs and apartment rents with their phones. But the banks have larger bases of customers to connect as they try to make Zelle ubiquitous. JPMorgan's Chase "Quick Pay,"for example, processed US$7.4 billion in the three months ended September, up 36 per cent from a year earlier, according to bank spokeswoman Rebecca Acevedo. The initial set of 19 banks to offer Zelle early next year has about 76 million customers using mobile banking apps and about 65 per cent of US checking and savings accounts, Mr Finch said. Agreements in place with additional financial institutions, debit card networks and other payment companies, such as Fiserv Inc, will bring the portion of accounts to 90 per cent to 95 per cent, Mr Finch said. The bank consortium owners decided that for Zelle to succeed it needs to look and work the same for everyone. But some banks already have made digital payment brand names, such as JPMorgan's Quick Pay, familiar to many of their customers. Those banks will use the Zelle name prominently alongside their established names as Zelle catches on, Mr Finch said.

But there’s a dose of concern that the $40 billion loan pledge may get caught up in a regulatory impasse. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has pledged $25 billion of the financing, with Bank of America Corp. providing the rest, according to a regulatory filing. That’s believed to be the most JPMorgan has ever promised for a deal, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified without authorization to speak publicly. The lending commitment alone would bring about $110 million to $130 million in fees for JPMorgan and Bank of America, according to estimates from consulting firm Freeman & Co. It also gives the banks an advantage on bond offerings that would find eager buyers among yield-starved investors. At the same time, the banks face the risk that the deal, along with a chunk of their balance sheets, would be tied up if regulators delay approving it. “This could be an especially lucrative deal for the banking industry; they’re going to make a lot of money if the deal gets done” said Bert Ely, a banking consultant at Ely & Co. “The numbers on the credit piece look big, but I’m sure the credit risk will be spread widely. The big uncertainty hanging over this will be the battle for regulatory approval and what lender protections are included if the deal fails.” T-Mobile Failure A failed megadeal wouldn’t be the first for AT&T. In 2011, the company abandoned its takeover of T-Mobile USA because of regulatory hurdles. JPMorgan had lined up $20 billion to finance that deal. Taking on commitments to underwrite large deals helps JPMorgan maintain its top position in leading corporate debt deals in the U.S. JPMorgan has occupied the top spot for managing dollar bond sales from highly rated companies since 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank has been the top provider of similarly rated loans for each year since 2005, Bloomberg data show. To help finance this proposed deal, AT&T brought in Bank of America as its partner on Thursday, keeping the number of participants to a minimum until the announcement, the person said. JPMorgan intends in the coming weeks to syndicate most of the $40 billion loan to other banks that already lend to AT&T. Bridge Loan The loan is structured as a bridge deal, a type of financing that a borrower repays by issuing debt in capital markets. In the case of AT&T, most of the deal will be replaced by high-grade bonds, with a potential portion in the form of term loans, the person said. The interest on the loan will be tied to the company’s debt ratings, according to the filing. The margin will start at 100 basis points above the London interbank offered rate, plus a commitment fee. That’s based on the fact the company’s unsecured long-term debt has an A- rating from Fitch Ratings Ltd., the highest among the three biggest rating companies. There are additional duration fees scheduled. The facility also includes a covenant that AT&T must keep net debt under 3.5 times its consolidated Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to the filing. AT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said on a conference call today that the company is targeting 2.5 times leverage at the end of year one and seeking 1.8 times by the end of year four. The company doesn’t expect a credit-rating downgrade and is committed to its investment-grade metrics, Stephens said. But the lenders themselves are taking on other risks by using their balance sheet resources, according to Charles Peabody, a bank analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading.  “That is dangerous because this deal could be hung up in antitrust wranglings for a long time,’’ he said. JPMorgan and Bank of America won’t be protected if credit markets swing and they can’t sell the debt for what they had anticipated, he said.  Jessica Francisco, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, and Thomas Rottcher, a Bank of America spokesman, declined to comment. AT&T, based in Dallas, didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail and calls on Sunday. The deal caps AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson’s vision to expand the company into media and entertainment as its wireless business matures. Gaining premium cable channels HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. studio means AT&T becomes a content owner rather than just a distributor of video. Yield Hunger For the investors that would later be asked to buy bonds refinancing the bridge loan, the takeover means a juicy alternative to the more than $10 trillion of debt globally that’s yielding less than zero, driven down by easy-money policies from Europe to Japan. “The investor base is starved for yield,” said David Hendler, founder of Viola Risk Advisors and a veteran bank analyst. “This would be a good earning asset in a low yield world -- which is very much in demand at the moment in the syndicate market. Banks are deposit-rich and looking to invest in loans.” The prospective deal has raised regulatory questions ahead of the U.S. election, as both the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees expressed suspicion of blockbuster deals. Hillary Clinton has been critical of big mergers and has called for “reinvigorating” antitrust enforcement while her opponent Donald Trump broke with Republican orthodoxy on Saturday by saying he would block the Time Warner acquisition, arguing that such deals leave too much power concentrated among too few companies. If AT&T’s deal doesn’t gain approval, it must pay a $500 million reverse break-up fee to Time Warner, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Bond Trading Beyond collecting the fees that come from underwriting large takeovers, banks also benefit from trading that debt in the secondary market. CEO Brian Moynihan pointed to Bank of America’s debt underwriting business as a reason for his beat last week in estimates for third-quarter fixed-income trading revenue.  Wall Street’s biggest investment banks have been taking a greater percentage of their overall revenue from issuing new debt and trading fixed-income products, which includes corporate debt, sovereign debt, currencies and commodities. Debt underwriting made up 11.3 percent of U.S. investment banks’ third-quarter revenue, about a percentage point more than in the same period two years ago, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. U.S. banks relied on fixed-income underwriting and trading to propel 56 percent of their total investment banking business in the third quarter, a rise from 47 percent last year and 50 percent two years ago, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. “These guys are fairly anxious to generate fee income. This is an area where you can make money very quickly. And very big money,’’ said Compass Point’s Peabody.  Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

"So it’s a quality versus quantity and making sure we understand," said CEO Brian Monihyan on the earnings call. "I’d say we went from seven million visits probably four to five years ago to six to five. But those five are of a higher quality, and we think that’s important." There are less bank branches, but the ones that stand reflect changing customers' behaviors. As consumers opt to go online for transactional services like check deposits, bank branches now emphasize  more value added services that " you just have to do face to face" and are adding more mortgage and investment specialists.  They are becoming a place to come for advice according to life events - mortgages, investments, saving for college. REUTERS/ Brendan McDermid And the cuts aren't just in terms of bank branches but also in headcount. Bank of America indicated back in June that it planned to cut over 8,000 jobs from its consumer banking division. According to retail banking head and consumer banking co-head Thong Nguyen at a June conference, this is part of a broader cost-cutting and resource reallocation program to meet with consumers' changing banking habits. Bank of America isn't the only bank to restructure its branches. When Citigroup announced its third-quarter earnings last Friday, October 14, it revealed its branch count has shrunk 7% in North America from the third quarter of last year and is down 116 banks globally to 2,679. "We have spent the last several years reshaping our branch network, upgrading technology and deepening our focus on our core six markets, enabling us to grow revenues while reducing expenses and significantly improving the profitability of our retail bank," Citigroup CFO John Gerspach said on the 3Q earnings call. Earlier this year, Citi Global Perspectives and Solutions (GPS) produced a report that found that banks are quickly approaching their "automation tipping point," and they could soon reduce headcount by as much as 30%. "Banks' Uber moment will mean a disintermediation of bank branches rather than the banks themselves," the report said. "Specifically, it will mean the shift to mobile distribution being the main channel of interaction between customers and the bank," the report reads.

JPMorgan has also been cutting back on the number of retail branches, with 161 less branches this quarter than the third quarter of last year. 3Q 2016 stores stand at 5,310, down from 5,471 in the same quarter last year.  According to JPMorganCFO Marianne Lake on the 3Q earnings call, new card account originations were up 35% this quarter, with more than three quarters of new accounts being opened through digital channels, and active mobile users were up 17% in 3Q.  JPMorgan is also focusing marketing efforts to millennial customers, who now compromise 57% of new checking account customers and are more likely to use mobile banking.  Major retail bank Wells Fargo historically hasn't cut branches as much as its peers and hasn't announced any major closures in light of its huge fraudulant account scandal. However, credit card applications, consumer loyalty and interactions between branch bankers and customers have declined sharply according to its 3Q earnings report last Friday, October 14. In the 3Q quarterly earnings report, the bank indicated a renewed shift to mobile, which they said "will allow us to review our branch footprint for consolidation opportunities."

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images "Whether Wells Fargo realizes it or not, they're going to be closing 1,000 branches," CLSA bank analyst Mike Mayo told CNN Money. "It's a matter of when, not if." While traditional retail banks shift their focus to digital models, others not in the consumer space, like Goldman Sachs, are launching online only US savings account. Online only GS Bank launched this past April and Goldman's new consumer lending arm, Marcus, launched earlier this month.  "Digital technology is making large brick and mortar branches questionable," said Harit Talwar, head of Digital Finance at Goldman Sachs, in a podcast. "You don't need necessarily brick and mortar branch networks to get into consumer financial services. Why wait in line when I can do it in on the phone? The traditional distribution strengths that some of the large banks have, from distribution strengths have become legacy costs."

The 10-year notes may yield around 4.375 percent, said the person, who asked not to be named because the deal is private. That’s the lowest yield ever for a dollar debt offering from a U.S. company of that maturity and rating, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds will be used for purposes that include acquisitions and capital expenditures, Netflix said Monday. Netflix generates little or no profit and its programming budget is still burning through funds, but it has a market capitalization of $55 billion. With $1.3 billion in cash at the end of the third quarter, Netflix said during its Oct. 17 earnings call that it planned to borrow in the coming weeks. It plans to boost its original content offerings to 1,000 hours in 2017, up from 600 this year. Moody’s Investors Service rated the bonds B1, or four steps into junk, in a statement on Monday. S&P graded the company an equivalent B+. The Los Gatos company last tapped the bond market in February 2015, when it sold $1.5 billion of notes, $500 million more than it initially planned. The notes, which were issued at par, have since become a favorite with investors. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are managing the sale, the person said. Smartphones Blur added to iPhone camera Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus is getting a new camera capability — the blurring of backgrounds to focus attention on people or other objects in the foreground. Apple first announced the “portrait mode” feature in September but it wasn’t available until the company released its iOS 10.1 software update Monday. It replicates an effect typically limited to larger cameras known as SLRs. While SLRs accomplishes this by controlling how wide the lens opens, the iPhone uses software adjustments. Portrait mode requires an iPhone 7 Plus because it uses the phone’s two lenses to sense depth. Other iPhones have only one camera lens. The software update will still be available for other iPhones because it also comes with bug fixes and other improvements. Apple is calling this depth-effect feature a beta, which means it’s a work in progress. Huawei’s dual-lens P9 phone also has a similar feature. The update comes three days before Apple holds a product event in Cupertino, during which the company is expected to unveil new Mac computers. Separately, Apple announced Monday that a Nike edition of Apple Watch will come out Friday, starting at $369. The runner-focused watch was announced in September, but no specific date had been given. Earnings Visa beats Street forecast Visa Inc. on Monday reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $1.93 billion. The San Francisco company said it had net income of 79 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for pretax gains, came to 78 cents per share. The results topped Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 73 cents per share. The global payments processor posted revenue of $4.26 billion in the period, which also beat Street forecasts. Fourteen analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $4.24 billion. Visa shares have climbed nearly 8 percent since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 index has increased slightly more than 5 percent. In the final minutes of trading on Monday, shares hit $83.53, a rise of slightly more than 9 percent in the last 12 months, before closing at $83.17. T-Mobile tops expectations T-Mobile posted profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates, a sign that the third-largest U.S. carrier is managing to lure new customers with lower prices without punishing the bottom line. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization rose to $2.6 billion, the company said Monday. Analysts predicted $2.4 billion, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company added 969,000 total monthly subscribers, beating the 829,000 average of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The results show that T-Mobile’s maverick chief executive officer, John Legere, is finding a way to balance user growth with the costs required to keep customers coming. Shares closed at $51.19, up 9.5 percent. Through Friday’s close, T-Mobile had gained 20 percent this year. Some of T-Mobile’s customer wins in the quarter came at the expense of Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc., the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. wireless carriers. Verizon suffered its worst quarter of subscriber growth in more than six years, while AT&T reported an eighth straight quarter of net postpaid phone losses amid the increased price competition from T-Mobile and Sprint. AT&T had been scheduled to report results on Tuesday but instead released them less than an hour after announcing its acquisition of Time Warner Inc. over the weekend.

"I'd rather hear the sounds of construction in the morning than worry about the drug dealers and drug addicts and the possibility of my grandchildren getting hurt or me getting robbed." The Central Delaware Habitat for Humanity began demolishing two long-vacant homes on North New Street, including the building next to Turner's home, on Monday. Those two lots at 19 and 20 N. New St. and three others on the same block soon will become owner-occupied homes, a rarity on the downtown Dover street that is lined with dilapidated rental properties long been plagued by crime.

Created in 2014, the fund uses money secured from Delaware's mortgage settlements with JPMorgan Chase and other banks to support the acquisition, renovation and sale of vacant, abandoned and foreclosed properties. Another $85,000 will be provided by the state in the form of rebates through the Downtown Development Districts program, a year-old program that uses a relatively small amount of state money to attract larger investments by private residential, commercial and industrial developers. Dover, Wilmington and Seaford were the first districts chosen for the program, which has since expanded to five other towns. The New Street redevelopment effort was among the first projects eligible for a Downtown Development District rebate. Both the Strong Neighborhoods and the Downtown Development programs are administered by the Delaware Housing Authority. Gallo said the state funding went a long way to making the New Street project possible.

"Partnering with the DDD program also allowed us to bypass some of the permitting issues, the sewer fees and makes it so we can leverage some money through our partners, like M&T Bank and the construction company George & Lynch." Each of the new homes will be partially built by the families who will eventually occupy them. Habitat requires each adult family member to put in 225 hours of “sweat equity” before the family can purchase the roughly $130,000 to $160,000 homes with a zero-interest mortgage. To qualify, families must be first-time homebuyers who currently lack adequate housing and earn less than 60 percent of the median income in Kent County. Buyers also are required to undergo agency-run financial courses and must be debt free at the time of the purchase. Henry Wester is one of two veterans who will own a new Habitat home on North New Street come Christmas. The frame of his future ranch-style house was built on Legislative Mall last summer and signed by Gov. Jack Markell and other elected state officials. "I was moved to tears once I could see what it was actually going to be," the 58-year-old Air Force veteran said. "I never expected I would own my own home."

A resident of North New Street for just seven months, Walls said she's already seen a drastic improvement in the neighborhood. In early August, for instance, Dover police raided a home next door to Wester's future residence. Nine people were charged with various offenses, including possession of marijuana; crack cocaine; heroin; Oxycodone; and MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. Now, five new houses are being built, including one next door to Walls. "This is definitely a blessing," she said. "It's not perfect. But compared to where it was seven months ago, it's a big difference."

The new venture is dubbed Zelle and will be available both as a standalone app and as a new feature within banks’ own official apps and websites, offering virtually instant deposits across banks at no extra cost. Nineteen U.S. financial firms, including Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America as well as regional lenders and credit unions have signed up for Zelle. It will be accessible to more than 76 million mobile banking customers from the start, allowing them to send money to one another using an email address or mobile phone number. The move comes as traditional financial firms are eager catch up with Silicon Valley upstarts that have proven popular with consumers and to dispel their industry’s image as slow. To ensure funds are delivered instantly, banks are agreeing to back each other’s transfers, even if the actual funds haven’t formally settled on the back end. In contrast, Venmo transfers typically take a day or two to become available for withdrawal, although the company is partnering with Visa and MasterCard for instant transfers when using a debit card. Meanwhile, Square Cash offers instant deposits for a fee.

Powell, At The Evolving Structure Of The U.S. Treasury Market: Second Annual Conference, Federal Reserve Bank Of New York, New York, New York, October 24, 2016, Opening Remarks On Government Securities Settlement Date 24/10/2016 Watch live This panel will focus on the settlement infrastructure for U.S. government securities--a vital component of the Treasury market and one that is undergoing an important transition. This segment of the industry has been in a period of slow but steady consolidation for several decades now. Thirty years ago, there were six banks providing a full suite of settlement services for U.S. government securities. Due to mergers and exits, two firms, Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) and J.P. Morgan Chase (JPMC), have been the two dominant providers of these services since the 1990s. And soon there will be just one, given JPMC's planned exit. Given the importance of these services, the official sector has had a long involvement as the market structure has evolved. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Federal Reserve convened the private-sector Working Group on Government Securities Clearance and Settlement to recommend steps to mitigate risks to the financial system from a disruption to these services. That work led to the "NewBank" proposal.1 Although the proposal was ultimately put aside, NewBank would have been a dormant financial institution that could spring into action in the event of potential disruptions from an exit from this business by either of the clearing banks. Some of today's panelists were actively involved in that work. Of course, at that time, the business was roughly evenly split between the two providers. Today's situation is very different--BNYM now has over 80 percent market share, due mainly to consolidation among end users. The Federal Reserve has been working closely with the Department of the Treasury to ensure a smooth transition as JPMC prepares to exit. JPMC has said that it recognizes the need for, and its own interest in, ensuring that its exit does not disrupt the market. Indeed, JPMC will itself need to rely on these services going forward. The timeline set for a gradual transition over the next two years should be sufficient to avoid significant dislocations; however, if unexpected complications arise, that timeline may need to be adjusted. In the near term, this exit will leave BNYM as the sole provider of U.S. government securities settlement and triparty repo services for broker-dealers. We have been working intensively with BNYM in anticipation of this transition. We have long recognized that any disruptions to these critical market services could have serious consequences for financial stability, and have calibrated our supervisory expectations accordingly. To ensure financial stability, we expect the provision of U.S. government securities settlement services to be robust in nearly all contingencies. As BNYM becomes the sole provider, we will raise our expectations even higher. The bank has anticipated and welcomed this higher bar. BNYM is one of 8 U.S.-based systemically important banks. The bank is therefore subject to heightened capital and liquidity requirements and a resolution process that explicitly requires planning to ensure the continuity of critical services even in the event of a default. BNYM is unique in that it also plays the dominant--and soon the sole--role in government securities settlement and in the triparty repo market. These activities are comparable in their importance to those of the financial market utilities that have been designated as systemically important by the FSOC. Thus, BNYM will continue to be held to the high standards to which all U.S. bank SIFIs are held. And it will also be expected to operate in a manner that provides confidence that it is as resilient and robust as a systemically important financial market utility (FMU). Such FMUs are, of course, held to the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs).2 The PFMIs overlap with our banking regulation in many areas; for example, both emphasize the need for sound risk management and the importance of resilience and recovery. The PFMIs also emphasize a strong governance role in support of financial stability and the interests of market functioning, and this has been a focus of our work with Bank of New York Mellon regarding the transition. Although our current task is to establish appropriate expectations for Bank of New York Mellon as a sole operator, that focus should not be taken as an indication that the Federal Reserve or other public authorities have pre-judged what the longer-term landscape for government securities settlement should look like. In fact, we do not have a specific market design end state in mind. Rather, we recognize the systemic importance of these activities and the need to ensure their continued availability in nearly all states of the world, regardless of the firms that offer them or the specific market structure. The industry as a whole should play an important role in shaping the evolution of the settlement infrastructure. Other firms may seek to enter this market. There have also been discussions over time of a settlement utility, and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation is currently considering a new variant of such a model. Our focus is on the quality of the services offered--their safety, resilience, and support of the market--and not on the particular mechanism for offering them. If new proposals come forward that are consistent with our goals of a safe and resilient settlement system, then they will receive fair consideration. 1.

(KBRA) is pleased to announce the assignment of preliminary ratings to seven classes of JPMCC 2016-WPT. JPMCC 2016-WPT is a CMBS single borrower transaction that is collateralized by a $557.0 million floating rate loan that was originated by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association. The loan has an initial two-year term with three, one-year extension options. Proceeds from the mortgage loan, along with $259.0 million of mezzanine debt, $99.0 million of preferred equity, and $109.0 million of cash equity contributed by the loan sponsor, were used to acquire 108 office and industrial assets from Liberty Property Trust for $969.0 million. The loan is secured by the borrower’s fee simple and leasehold interests in 108 real estate assets. Of these, 93 buildings, representing 82.9% of the aggregate allocated loan amount (ALA), are clustered together within 12 business parks. The properties consist of 58 office assets representing 71.4% of the aggregate ALA and 50 flex properties (28.6%). The assets are located in 16 different submarkets in four states: Florida (40.6%), Pennsylvania (25.5%), Arizona (17.4%), and Minnesota (16.5%). The properties are leased to approximately 379 tenants with a weighted average lease term of 10.9 years, with only three tenants that account for more than 3.0% of total base rent. KBRA’s analysis of the transaction included a detailed evaluation of the portfolio’s cash flow using our CMBS Property Evaluation Methodology and the application of our CMBS Single Borrower and Large Loan Rating Methodology. The results of our analysis yielded a KBRA net cash flow (KNCF) of $68.0 million. To value the portfolio, we applied a blended capitalization rate of 9.65% to arrive at a KBRA value of $704.5 million and a KBRA Loan to Value (KLTV) of 79.1%. In our analysis of the transaction, we also reviewed and considered third party engineering, environmental, and appraisal reports, our own on-site inspections of the properties and legal documentation. For further details on KBRA’s analysis, please see our Pre-Sale Report, entitled JPMCC 2016-WPT, which was published today atwww.kbra.com. The preliminary ratings are based on information known to KBRA at the time of this publication.

 Italy's Monte dei Paschi set to approve business plan Reuters Oct. 24, 2016, 6:02 AM 33 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Monte dei Paschi di Siena bank logo is pictured at the bank's headquarters in Siena Thomson Reuters MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Monte dei Paschi di Siena prepared to unveil a capital-boosting and business plan on Monday under new chief Marco Morelli, as its shares extended a week-long rally buoyed by the prospect of an alternative rescue scheme. Morelli, the 54-year-old former Italy head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch , took over as CEO of the country's third-largest bank in mid-September, charged with winning investor support for a 5 billion euro ($5.4 billion) fundraising plan. Drawn up with the help of adviser JPMorgan , the plan also envisages the sale of 28 billion euros in bad loans to keep the bank afloat after it emerged as the weakest lender in Europe in the latest round of industry stress tests over the summer. "The key planks of the rescue plan should not change much," broker ICBPI said in a note. "We expect a smaller cash call ... thanks to an at least partial conversion of subordinated debt." Some investors are skeptical over the Tuscan bank's ability to carry out a third share issue in as many years at a time when banking stocks trade at a fraction of their book value as negative interest rates eat into profits. In a further complication, a referendum vote on Italy's constitutional reform on Dec. 4 risks undermining the government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, making investors reluctant to commit until the outcome is known. Shares in Monte dei Paschi are down 75 percent year-to-date despite a similar-sized rebound over the past week, triggered by the emergence of an alternative rescue package brokered by veteran Italian banker and former industry minister Corrado Passera. Passera's proposal involves a 2.5 billion euro capital increase reserved for private equity funds including Warburg Pincus and a 1 billion euro share sale to existing Monte dei Paschi investors. By 0454 EDT shares in Monte dei Paschi were up 11.5 percent. ($1 = 0.9190 euros) (Reporting by Valentina Za; Editing by David Holmes) Read the original article on Reuters. Copyright 2016.

Zelle, Banks' Venmo Alternative, Prepares to Make Its Debut By John Adams October 24, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related Bank of America Hires Utilities Executive for Tech Role M&T's Wilmers Throws Support Behind Tiered Regulation BlackRock Hires Former Evercore Analyst Andrew Marquardt How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue Early Warning's clearXchange P-to-P system will become "Zelle" in 2017 and will be embedded in the online and mobile banking channels of its network banks. A consumer app for mobile P-to-P payments will be also be released in 2017, the company announced Oct. 24 "The idea was to have a name that was a little more inspirational and approachable," said Paul Finch, CEO of Early Warning, adding the name derives from a gazelle, is meant to evoke speed, and is amenable to a verb — "Zelle me the money." Similar to Venmo, clearXchange lets customers of member banks send money to each other by inputting either an email address or mobile phone number. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo founded clearXchange, and hope to expand its services beyond P-to-P. The name Zelle, which resulted from market research and will be accompanied by a marketing and ad campaign, will also be the brand behind the increasing array of use cases beyond P-to-P such as disbursements, government payments and insurance payments, Finch said. ClearXchange has existed for several years, and was rolled into Early Warning—a risk management initiative owned by many of the same banks—to consolidate the two services in 2015. It's attracting users. ClearXchange handled 46 million transactions in the first quarter, or about $16 billion. That's a lot more than Venmo's $3.2 billion. The rebrand has been rumored for several weeks, and should make the service more familiar to consumers and help make the app attractive to merchants, according to consultants. "We suspect that more people will use it, and will use it more as they start to receive payments through Zelle," Finch said. ClearXchange does not include the social tools that Venmo does—the PayPal app's users can send messages in a group and use emoji, and Finch said that type of feature is not planned for Zelle at this time. The Zelle network covers an addressable market of 76 million mobile banking users and has been steadily expanding, recently getting a boost with the addition of Citigroup. The network currently includes Ally Bank, Bank of America, Bank of the West, BB&T, BECU, BNY Mellon, Capital One, Citi, FirstBank, Frost Bank, Fifth Third Bank, First Tennessee Bank, First Tech Federal Credit Union, JPMorgan Chase, PNC, Morgan Stanley, USAA, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo. Early Warning has also partnered with CO-OP Financial Services, FIS, Fiserv, Jack Henry, Mastercard and Visa to offer banks and credit unions multiple integration pathways onto the network as well as to increase the speed-to-market for new network members.

 A Chinese company on a buying spree just took a 25% stake in Hilton Portia Crowe Oct. 24, 2016, 8:20 AM 8,458 facebook linkedin twitter email print Scott Olson/Getty The Chinese tourism conglomerate HNA Group is buying a roughly 25% stake in Hilton. HNA is paying $26.25 a share — or about $6.5 billion — for the stake, which it is buying from the private-equity company Blackstone. Blackstone's stake will be reduced to about 21% after the transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017. HNA Group has spent more than $20 billion in acquisitions this year, according to Bloomberg, including a $10 billion deal earlier in October for CIT Group's aircraft-leasing business. Hilton had previously planned to spin off its Park Hotels & Resorts and Hilton Grand Vacations businesses. Evercore advised Hilton, while JPMorgan advised HNA. Hilton's stock was up 7% in premarket trading. Here's the full press release: MCLEAN, Va. & BEIJING & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) (“Hilton”), HNA Group (“HNA”) and Blackstone (NYSE: BX) announced today that HNA will acquire an approximate 25 percent equity interest in Hilton from affiliates of Blackstone, establishing a long-term strategic investment in Hilton and Hilton’s planned spin-offs of Park Hotels & Resorts (“Park”) and Hilton Grand Vacations (“HGV”). The transaction is valued at approximately $6.5 billion, or $26.25 per share in cash, reducing Blackstone’s interest in Hilton to approximately 21 percent. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017. Following Hilton’s previously announced spin-offs of Park and HGV, which are expected to occur on or about the end of the year, HNA will own approximately 25 percent of all three companies. As part of the transaction, HNA has entered into a stockholders agreement with Hilton, and into similar agreements with Park Hotels & Resorts and Hilton Grand Vacations, effective upon closing. The agreement allows HNA to appoint two directors (one HNA member and one independent member) to Hilton’s Board of Directors, bringing the total to ten members. Pursuant to the agreement, HNA has agreed to certain restrictions on its ability to sell any of its interest in Hilton for a two-year period, and to limitations on HNA’s ability to acquire more than 25 percent of Hilton’s outstanding shares, without Hilton’s consent. Furthermore, under the agreement, HNA will vote its shares in excess of 15 percent proportionally with other stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. Blackstone will continue to have two seats on Hilton’s Board, including Jon Gray who will remain chairman. “We are pleased to welcome HNA Group as a long-term investor and strategic partner,” said Christopher J. Nassetta, president and CEO of Hilton. “HNA Group has a broad portfolio of successful travel and hospitality businesses and a proven track record of creating value in this industry. We believe this mutually beneficial relationship will open new opportunities for our brands and guests around the world, particularly in light of HNA’s strong position in the fast-growing Chinese travel and tourism market, the largest outbound travel and tourism market in the world.” “Hilton is an iconic global hospitality company with an unmatched portfolio of high-quality brands and a reputation for operational excellence,” said Adam Tan, vice chairman and CEO of HNA Group. “This investment is consistent with our strategy to enhance our global tourism business, and we look forward to working together on new initiatives that leverage our respective strengths, expertise and tourism platforms to provide travelers more choice, value and world-class services.” “Since our initial investment in Hilton nine years ago, the company and its leadership team have delivered phenomenal results,” said Jon Gray, global head of real estate, Blackstone, and chairman of the Hilton Board of Directors. “We think the company’s future is bright, and this long-term investment from HNA Group only adds to its potential.” Evercore served as exclusive financial advisor and WilmerHale and Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell LLP served as legal advisors to the special committee of Hilton’s Board of Directors. J.P. Morgan served as exclusive financial advisor and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP served as legal counsel to HNA. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP served as legal counsel to Blackstone.

But things have changed so much, they need help Gloria Samayoa at SapientNitro’s Miami office has been surprised by the résumés she has received: An equal number of men and women are applying for the office’s return-to-work program. Cindy Krischer Goodman writes about workplace and work life issues. AL DIAZ MIAMI HERALD STAFF 1 of 3 i BY CINDY KRISCHER GOODMAN balancegal@gmail.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Gloria Samayoa at SapientNitro’s Miami office has been sifting through résumés as the New York-based digital marketing agency expands its new career return program to her office. The 12-week paid program for advertising professionals, which piloted in New York and Toronto, has spread to Chicago, Atlanta and London. It has led to full-time positions in some of those cities for people — particularly stay-at-home mothers — who had taken time off work and wanted to return. In Miami, Samayoa has been surprised by the résumés she has received: An equal number of men and women are applying for the office’s return-to-work program. “There are all kinds of reasons why the men took a pause from their careers,” she said. “It’s just as difficult for them to come back in where they left off.” Samayoa expects to launch with one or two returners by early next year: “We want find that right person so the experience is successful. Our long-term plan is for them is to get hired.” Even as the economy rebounded, people have continued to take breaks from the workforce for a variety of reasons, whether to start a family, care for a sick or elderly family member, travel or tackle an illness of their own. Unless they keep their skills up, re-entering the workforce with a résumé gap can be a challenge, particularly as technology has changed the modern workplace. Now, in South Florida and across the country, return-to-work programs are popping up in various industries providing mid-career internships for caregivers who have been out of the workforce for a few years or more. With most programs, mentoring support is provided to the returner. The concept of a “returnship” was pioneered by Goldman Sachs in 2008, who trademarked the term. It has been replicated by financial firms such as Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and JPMorgan and tech companies such as IBM and Paypal. Even as the economy rebounded, people have continued to take breaks from the workforce for a variety of reasons. There are about 108 active re-entry programs globally across industries, and more U.S. companies have committed to rolling out programs by year-end, according to a list compiled by iRelaunch, a New York/Boston company that works with employers and returning professionals. These individuals, typically in theirs 40s, have something unique to offer the employer who understands their value, said Carol Fishman Cohen, the chief executive and co-founder of iRelaunch. They bring more workplace experience and usually have moved past the stage of needing future career breaks, unlike their younger counterparts. Cohen said iRelaunch is the largest supplier of candidates to Wall Street re-entry programs and has drawn more than 25,000 people to its return-to-work conferences and workshops all over the country — about 7 percent of them men. In Miami, Akerman law firm is recruiting candidates for the office’s re-entry program that will launch in 2017 as part of a nationwide OnRamp Fellowship program. Ackerman already has brought on a lawyer in its New York office through the OnRamp program which matches experienced women returning from career breaks with law firms, legal departments and financial services firms. As of this month, 28 law firms and legal departments in the U.S. and Canada are participating in the OnRamp program, which says its goal is to fix the leaky pipeline in law with women who have the desire to return to the legal profession. With all the changes in digital, it was like everyone was speaking a whole new language, but the advantage of the program was that there was an onboarding process. Ellen Kalis at SapientNitro In Toronto, Ellen Kalis chose to leave her job in public relations to be home with her son who has cerebral palsy. At the time, she saw herself as confident and driven. But four years later when she decided to return to work, she began second-guessing her abilities. “I wondered how my résumé would even get into HR’s hands and assumed it would be tossed to the side as soon as they saw the gap in my career,” Kalis says. Fortunately, a family member led Kalis toward an emerging path back to employment: SapientNitro’s program. Similar to an internship, it paired Kalis with a buddy/mentor in the New York office who helped her transition into a permanent job as the public relations lead for SapientNitro in Canada and the Midwest. “With all the changes in digital, it was like everyone was speaking a whole new language, but the advantage of the program was that there was an onboarding process,” she said. Yet, as the concept of return to work programs took off, some career coaches have cautioned against taking that route back. In fact, Stacey Hawley, a Birmingham compensation and talent management expert, has made her argument on Working Mother Magazine’s website, WorkingMother.com. “Why put your self at a disadvantage and actually SUGGEST to your employer that you should be constantly scrutinized or that you might not be able to handle the job?” she wrote in 2012. “And if you aren’t hired full-time after the trial period is over, you need to start all over again. … Go after the right job, the first time.” Donald Chesnut, executive creative director at SapientNitro in New York, says even with compelling credentials, a résumé gap is difficult to overlook in a job candidate: “While we value their experience, if they had applied for these mid-level jobs they would not have made it in.” Chesnut says the return-to-work program at his firm offers one-on-one mentorship to help returners who have a gap in skills and experience to transition more smoothly. Sapient’s interest grew from conversation about the lack of female creative directors in the industry: “This is a way for us to bring diversity to our firm at the higher levels, and understand the value these people bring, even while they are learning on the job.” Some larger companies are starting return-to-work groups as large as 25 people at a time, and may bring in several cohorts throughout the year in multiple departments. The success rates for permanent hiring are as high as 90 percent, said Cohen of iRelaunch. In another example, what started as an internal initiative to increase the representation of women in technical roles at Return Path, a New York-based data provider, became so successful that the company spun off a separate nonprofit called Path Forward. The nonprofit helps corporations’ human resources departments set up mid-career internships. So far, online education platform Coursera, grocery delivery startup Instacart, as well as customer service software company Zendesk, marketing technology company Demandbase, and CloudFlare, a content-distribution network, all announced that starting this month, they will offer 18-week “returnships” to men and women through Path Forward. Donald Chestnut, executive creative director at SapientNitro in New York, says that even with compelling credentials, a résumé gap is difficult to overlook in a job candidate. With an estimated 2 million stay-at-home fathers, Simon Isaacs, co-founder of Fatherly.com, a New York-headquartered parenting resource site for fathers, expects to see more men who want to participate in these programs. For them, the transition back can be particularly daunting. Isaacs said they have fewer role models to turn to for help, and most of their former male counterparts who stayed in the workplace have risen to high-level positions. Along with return-to-work programs, Isaacs suggests working parents consider flexible jobs open to people with résumé gaps at companies participating in the sharing economy such as TaskRabbit and Lyft.

Tips from four female ‘career-returners’: 1. Carol Fishman Cohen of Boston returned to work at Bain Capital after 11 years out of the full-time workforce. She eventually founded iRelaunch.com, a firm that connects employers with returning professionals. Her advice: “Get clarity around what you want to do now at this point in your life. Once you know where you want to work, get to know the company you are applying to really well.” She also advises taking courses or refreshing skills before applying for full-time jobs or return-to-work positions. “Get into the mindset that you are open to training and the feeling you can do it.” 2. Amy Brenner Schaecter of Weston returned to work after more than a decade at home. First she went to a PR firm, then in-house at a multinational company. Her advice: “When you get back to work, make friends with a smart millennial. The synergy is awesome.” 3. Ellen Kalis participated in SapientNitro’s Returns Program after a four-year hiatus. Her advice: “You have to have confidence in your skills. If you go in and show your value right away, companies will see that. Even though I needed more ramp-up time than a millennial or someone who came from that position, hopefully I am adding value somewhere else.” Kalis is now a full-time public relations lead for SapientNitro, Canada and the Midwest. 4. When Carol Hansen returned to return to work in New York after 10 years as a stay-at-home mom, the industry she had left —marketing/advertising — was transformed. Hansen’s transition through SapientNitro’s return-to-work program had its challenges: It was her first time working with millennials, balancing work and family, and digital storytelling. Her advice: “Jump in and raise your hand to help with any project. In doing so, talk to people in all areas of the company,” she said. “Even if I didn’t make it past the returnship period, I knew I needed to learn more and make myself relevant. I saw areas where I was strong and got a reading on areas where I wasn’t.” Hansen is now a full-time senior user experience designer at SapientNitro in New York.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:20 PM, October 24, 2016 Updated: 4:00 AM, October 25, 2016 MILAN - Italy's Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> prepared to unveil a capital-boosting and business plan on Monday under new chief Marco Morelli, as its shares extended a week-long rally buoyed by the prospect of an alternative rescue scheme. Morelli, the 54-year-old former Italy head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch <BAC.N>, took over as CEO of the country's third-largest bank in mid-September, charged with winning investor support for a 5 billion euro ($5.4 billion) fundraising plan. Drawn up with the help of adviser JPMorgan <JPM.N>, the plan also envisages the sale of 28 billion euros in bad loans to keep the bank afloat after it emerged as the weakest lender in Europe in the latest round of industry stress tests over the summer. "The key planks of the rescue plan should not change much," broker ICBPI said in a note. "We expect a smaller cash call ... thanks to an at least partial conversion of subordinated debt." Some investors are skeptical over the Tuscan bank's ability to carry out a third share issue in as many years at a time when banking stocks trade at a fraction of their book value as negative interest rates eat into profits. In a further complication, a referendum vote on Italy's constitutional reform on Dec. 4 risks undermining the government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, making investors reluctant to commit until the outcome is known. Shares in Monte dei Paschi are down 75 percent year-to-date despite a similar-sized rebound over the past week, triggered by the emergence of an alternative rescue package brokered by veteran Italian banker and former industry minister Corrado Passera. Passera's proposal involves a 2.5 billion euro capital increase reserved for private equity funds including Warburg Pincus and a 1 billion euro share sale to existing Monte dei Paschi investors. By 0454 EDT shares in Monte dei Paschi were up 11.5 percent.

A busy weekend for M&A, British bankers threaten to leave, and Iraq not so keen on the OPEC deal. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today. M&A weekend AT&T Inc. has agreed to acquire Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion in a cash and stock deal. AT&T has arranged a $40 billion loan from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. to fund the purchase, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he would block the tie-up if he is elected. Elsewhere, TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. are to buy Scottrade Financial Services Inc. for $4 billion in cash and stock in a transaction that would combine two of the largest online brokers.  Bankers threaten to brexit Banks in the U.K. will start relocating before the end of the year, as worries about losing access to the single market increase, according to the head of the British Bankers Association. Should they leave, they will give Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond a budget headache as their exit would leave a hole in the country's tax base. The pound was struggling to hold last week's gain in trading this morning, and was worth $1.2243 at 6:20 a.m. ET. Spain to get a government There was better news on the continent, after the opposition socialist party agreed to abstain in the next vote on Mariano Rajoy's bid to become prime minister, paving the way for the formation of a new government for the first time since December 2015's election. European bonds are rallying this morning following the news. Also lifting markets in Europe are the latest Markit PMI figures, which show economic momentum in the euro area accelerating.  Markets higher Overnight, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.4 percent to reach a two-week high, while in Japan the Topix index added 0.2 percent ahead of a heavy week of earnings.  In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.5 percent higher at 6:14 a.m. ET, with banks leading the gains. S&P 500 futures added 0.5 percent. Iraq sticks on oil  Iraq threw some sand in the gears of OPEC's latest efforts to agree a deal to stabilize oil markets, saying it should be exempt from any deal to curb production as it is currently embroiled in a war with Islamic insurgents. A barrel of West Texas Intermediate for December delivery was trading slightly lower at $50.76 at 6:24 a.m. ET.  What we've been reading  This is what's caught our eye over the weekend.

Morelli, the 54-year-old former Italy head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, took over as CEO of the country's third-largest bank in mid-September, charged with winning investor support for a 5 billion euro ($5.4 billion) fundraising plan. Drawn up with the help of adviser JPMorgan, the plan also envisages the sale of 28 billion euros in bad loans to keep the bank afloat after it emerged as the weakest lender in Europe in the latest round of industry stress tests over the summer. "The key planks of the rescue plan should not change much," broker ICBPI said in a note. "We expect a smaller cash call ... thanks to an at least partial conversion of subordinated debt." Some investors are sceptical over the Tuscan bank's ability to carry out a third share issue in as many years at a time when banking stocks trade at a fraction of their book value as negative interest rates eat into profits. In a further complication, a referendum vote on Italy's constitutional reform on Dec. 4 risks undermining the government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, making investors reluctant to commit until the outcome is known. Shares in Monte dei Paschi are down 75 percent year-to-date despite a similar-sized rebound over the past week, triggered by the emergence of an alternative rescue package brokered by veteran Italian banker and former industry minister Corrado Passera. Passera's proposal involves a 2.5 billion euro capital increase reserved for private equity funds including Warburg Pincus and a 1 billion euro share sale to existing Monte dei Paschi investors. By 0854 GMT shares in Monte dei Paschi were up 11.5 percent.

(pichet_w/Getty Images/iStockphoto) BY Ben Chapman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, October 24, 2016, 4:00 AM A record-breaking 1,538 city students landed paid, private sector internships through the city’s Ladders for Leaders intern matchmaking program in summer 2016, de Blasio administration officials said. Ladders for Leaders, a competitive program for high-achieving high school and college students ages 16-21, managed 475 participants in 2014 and grew to 1,035 interns in 2015. De Blasio officials said the program prepares young adults for successful careers by giving them useful work experience at companies such as Time Warner, Deloitte and JPMorgan Chase. “The value of this experience cannot be understated,” de Blasio said. “We’re investing in the future of our workforce and inspiring students to cultivate and pursue their dreams at the same time.” NYC teachers getting full pay without full-time jobs down 21% Officials also said a record 475 companies offered paid internships in 2016, up from 191 companies in 2015. Officials hope to expand the program again in 2017. Pay varies by company. Ladders for Leaders is operated by the city’s Department of Youth and Community Development with support from the city’s Center for Youth Employment, which was founded in 2015 with funding from the Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City. De Blasio will celebrate the internship program’s record summer with a Monday night reception at Gracie Mansion that will be attended by business leaders, city educators and former Ladders for Leaders interns.
