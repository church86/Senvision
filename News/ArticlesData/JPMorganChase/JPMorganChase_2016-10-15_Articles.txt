(NYSE: JPM) reported third-quarter results last Friday, the bank’s chief financial officer said on the conference call that JPMorgan would “pull back” on auto loans with repayment periods of 84 months or more. The bank sees more risk from these very long-term auto loans, based on “where we are in the cycle.” The first-quarter average loan amount for a new car was $30,032, and the average term of a loan was 68 months. And the lower a buyer’s credit score, the longer the average loan term. Borrowers with higher credit scores take shorter term loans, while those with lower credit terms take longer term loans, according to a report from Experian published in August. The report also noted that the average loan rate on a $30,000 car loan in the first quarter was $4.79%. The advantage to the buyer of a longer term is a lower monthly payment. The disadvantage is that the borrower pays more in interest charges. Here’s a look at how much interest a car buyer pays on a $30,000 loan at 4.79% with the specified term: 36 months = $896/month for a total finance charge of $2,267 48 months = $688/month for a total finance charge of $3,025 60 months = $563/month for a total finance charge of $3,795 72 months = $480/month for a total finance charge of $4,577 84 months = $421/month for a total finance charge of $5,369 96 months = $377/month for a total finance charge of $6,173 As the borrower is paying off the loan, the value of the car depreciates. That means that it takes longer for the borrower to establish any equity in the vehicle. If the borrower defaults on a seven-year or eight-year loan, chances are higher that the car is worth less than the amount remaining to be repaid on the loan. Even JPMorgan can’t make money on a deal like that, and with record high new car buying, the number of used cars on the market is growing and lowering the value of used cars even more. It’s no wonder, then, that the bank wants out of the longest-term auto loan business, and it won’t be too surprising if other lenders follow suit. We looked earlier this year at whether a seven-year or eight-year loan was a reasonable option for a new car buyers and concluded that if the monthly payment on a five-year loan was a little too much for your budget, it might be wiser to look for a cheaper car than to take out a longer term loan. That still appears to be good advice.

Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the U.S. and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. “The retail sales numbers on the surface looked pretty good but when you dig into them they were not that great,” said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve. “It seems like every good report we get, we get an offsetting weaker report.” The Dow Jones industrial average, which had jumped as much as 162 points in the morning, finished up 39.44 points, or 0.2 percent, at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor’s 500 inched up 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.83 points to 5,214.16. Goldman Sachs was responsible for most of the Dow’s gains. It rose $3.10, or 1.9 percent, to $170.52 after Britain’s High Court threw out a $1 billion lawsuit against the company. Libya’s sovereign wealth fund had accused Goldman Sachs of duping the fund into making risky deals. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.80 percent from 1.75 percent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, and that allows banks to make bigger profits from lending. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results were better than investors expected. The reports may have raised investor hopes for companies that will report their results next week, like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock. “It was a good kickoff to earnings season” for banks, said Baele. “It was actually some decent revenue as well with both investment banking and trading.” Rising bond yields attracted investors’ attention, and they sold utilities, real estate investment trusts, and other stocks that pay large dividends as a result. Those payments are more appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields are low. PG&E Corp. fell 57 cents to $59.80 and Duke Energy slid 73 cents to $77.21. The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, which helped technology companies recover some of Thursday’s losses. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.42 while Intel rose 48 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.45 and Apple picked up 68 cents to $117.66. While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department’s report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online.

Wells Fargo is under pressure to keep its profit engine humming while dismantling the aggressive sales culture at the heart of its woes, since unlike JPMorgan and Citigroup it does not have a big trading arm. “We're prepared for things to get worse before they get better,” Chief Executive Tim Sloan, who took over as boss on Wednesday after John Stumpf, the bank's veteran leader, announced he was leaving amid a public furor over the scandal. Revelations that Wells' branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge to meet internal sales targets has shattered the bank's folksy image. Once a Wall Street darling for its ability to sell multiple products to individual customers, Wells Fargo said yesterday that new account openings had dropped sharply. New consumer checking accounts were 30 per cent lower than in August, and applications for consumer credit cards fell 30 per cent in September from the prior month. Wells Fargo's staff are in a period of flux after the bank scrapped sales targets for branches last month and in a note following Sloan's presentation, Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at KBW, said, “Management doesn’t know what the consumer bank will look like in the future.” The bank has said the scandal will minimally affect its wealth management business and was unlikely to alter its plans to return capital to shareholders. On Friday, the state of Ohio joined a growing list of municipalities to suspend business relationships with Wells Fargo. The bank makes less than 1 per cent of its revenue from working with local governments but Ohio's decision is a blow, coming days after Stumpf, a lightning rod for much of the criticism around the scandal, had departed. Sloan must navigate federal and state investigations in coming months. The scandal has renewed left-leaning lawmakers' attacks on Wall Street and bolstered their mission to introduce stricter oversight. JPMorgan momentum continues While Wells Fargo's overall profit dropped for a fourth straight quarter, net income in the third quarter topped estimates, helped in part by lower-than-expected loan-loss provisions. JPMorgan and Citi also beat expectations as bond trading roared back in the third quarter, boosted by Brexit-inspired volatility along with changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as money market reforms. Banks got a fillip from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, which moved to a seven-year high during the quarter as US money market funds scaled back holdings of short-term bank debt in advance of new US regulations. JPMorgan's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said the fourth quarter so far is showing positive signs. “The momentum that I just characterised as fairly broad and fairly consistent across the (third) quarter, has somewhat continued so far,” she told journalists. JPMorgan's after-tax income dropped 7.6 per cent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of US$2.2 billion (RM9.25 billion) a year earlier. But revenues and profits both topped analysts' estimates. Citigroup, the fourth-biggest US bank by assets, beat expectations for third-quarter net profit after trading revenue surged 35 per cent. While net income fell 11 per cent to US$1.24 per share, it exceeded the average estimate of US$1.16 per share. Total adjusted revenue fell 4 per cent to US$17.76 billion, but beat the average estimate of US$17.36 billion. The strong trading performance helped US financial stocks snap a three-day losing streak, with markets-focused bank shares such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley up 2 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, ahead of their results next week. Citigroup was up over 0.8 per cent in late trade after earlier rising as much as 3 per cent. JPMorgan tipped into negative territory after earlier gaining as much as 2 per cent. Wells Fargo was up 0.25 per cent. The S&P financial index gained 0.85 per cent. The British government's tougher line on immigration in the wake of the Brexit vote has bankers preparing for a scenario in which London loses access to the single market, meaning they would have to move parts of their operations elsewhere in Europe. “As a result, we will be starting to build out technology systems and operations in Europe,” JPMorgan's Lake said. ― Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Fintech association anticipates regional investments European stocks falter, euro hits 12-month dollar low Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Prospect of US interest rates hike weighs on ringgit With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Britney Spears, TInashe get down for a ‘Slumber Party’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) A Tribe Called Quest spit fire in ‘We the People’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Bloomberg Video: Resurrecting Jaguar’s legendary XKSS supercar Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Pollsters who predicted Trump win benefit from industry’s miss Wall Street elite stunned at Trump triumph (VIDEO) Trump’s Wall Street fans cheer as markets churn (VIDEO) Investors see no let up to market bloodbath if Trump wins presidency Trump’s chance of victory skyrockets in betting exchanges, online market Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Sweta Singh and David Henry Reuters Published Friday, Oct. 14, 2016 6:55AM EDT Last updated Friday, Oct. 14, 2016 10:08AM EDT Comments AA JPMorgan Chase & Co beat forecasts for revenues and profits on Friday as global bond and currency markets roared back to life in the third quarter following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. Brexit-inspired volatility along with changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as money market reforms boosted trading revenue by 21 per cent for JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, prompting pretax profit to jump by one-third. JPMorgan’s aftertax income dropped 7.6 per cent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of $2.2-billion a year earlier. Both revenues and profits topped analysts’ estimates. Earnings per share fell to $1.58 from $1.68 a year ago. Analysts, on average, expected $1.39, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan is the first big U.S. bank to report third-quarter results and its performance gave Wall Street a shot in the arm. The bank’s shares were up 1.6 per cent at $68.84 in premarket trading while markets-focused rivals, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citi also rose. Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc, the third and fourth biggest U.S. banks by assets, also reported results on Friday. Citi earnings per share and revenues topped estimates. Wells Fargo earnings beat expectations. Bank of America Corp, the second biggest, will report on Monday. In addition to a fillip from Brexit, banks got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300-trillion worth of financial products worldwide. Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations. JPMorgan’s total revenue rose 8 per cent to $25.51-billion, beating the average estimate of $23.99-billion. With interest rates at record lows, the banking sector has relied on growing its loan book to boost income. However, total provisions for bad loans rose 86.4 per cent to $1.27-billion. JPMorgan posted higher provisions for losses as it added loans and recorded charge-offs for oil and gas loans. Core loans in its commercial banking business grew 14 per cent. JPMorgan expects income from lending to be up modestly in the fourth quarter. The Fed last raised rates in December, by 0.25 percentage points, after keeping them near zero for almost a decade. At the start of the year, further rate hikes were widely expected, but now Wall Street expects just one increase in December and possibly one more in 2017 JPMorgan’s return on tangible common equity, a key performance measure, was 13 per cent in the latest quarter, compared with the bank’s longer-term target of about 15 per cent.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel US stocks ended little changed on Friday, losing ground late after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's comments on the economy unnerved investors. Financial shares finished up, giving the S&P 500 its biggest boost after stronger-than-expected bank results, but gave up most of their early gains. Healthcare shares led declines. Yellen, in a speech at a conference of policymakers and academics, laid out the deepening concern at the Fed that US economic potential is slipping - and may need aggressive steps to rebuild it. "In looking at the market, I think, yes, (Yellen's speech) had a dovish tilt to it if you took it literally," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said Yellen's speech could suggest the US central bank will stay accommodative for longer. Yellen did not address interest rates or immediate policy concerns directly. Traders have currently priced in a 67-percent chance of a rate hike in December. The S&P 500 financial index was up 0.5 percent. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup trounced third-quarter estimates. Wells Fargo & Co barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank. Shares of JPMorgan ended down 0.3 percent, however, while Citigroup ended up 0.3 percent and Wells Fargo was down 0.1 percent. Wells Fargo has been under pressure following recent revelations that branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge. The bank earnings somewhat helped shore up Wall Street's confidence on the outlook for third-quarter earnings after some disappointing results from industrial and healthcare companies. S&P 500 earnings for the quarter are still expected to have declined 0.4 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 39.44 points, or 0.22 percent, to 18,138.38, the S&P 500 gained 0.43 points, or 0.02 percent, to 2,132.98 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.83 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,214.16. For the week, the Dow was down 0.6 percent, the S&P 500 was down 1 percent and the Nasdaq fell 1.5 percent. Shares of Twitter fell 5.1 percent to USD 16.88 after Salesforce.com's chief executive ruled out bidding for Twitter. Salesforce.com shares jumped 5.2 percent to USD 74.27. HP Inc fell 4.4 percent to USD 14.48 after the company said it would cut about 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years. About 6.0 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, below the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 27 new highs and 80 new lows.

Her remarks could help explain why the Fed has been reluctant to raise U.S. interest rates. Speaking to an economic conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Yellen did not address the Fed’s timetable for rates. The central bank is widely expected to resume raising rates in December, a reflection of an improved economy. Yellen said sluggish worldwide growth would be likely to keep global interest rates low, making it harder for central banks to combat the next recession with rate cuts. U.S. retail sales rise despite signs of caution WASHINGTON — U.S. shoppers stepped up their spending in September, with sharply higher sales at auto dealers, restaurants and gas stations. But the government’s retail sales report released Friday also contained some evidence that spending might be slowing. For much of this year, consumers have spent at a solid pace as income gains have accelerated and the job market has improved. Last month’s overall retail sales gain was a decent seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent. Much of it, though, was due to higher oil prices, which increased how much people spent at gas stations but were not necessarily a sign of stronger consumer spending. JPMorgan quarterly earnings fall 8 percent NEW YORK — JPMorgan Chase’s third-quarter profit fell 8 percent as higher revenue in retail and investment banking was offset by money set aside to cover loans that might go bad. However, the results still beat Wall Street’s expectations. The largest U.S. bank by assets and revenue said it earned $6.29 billion in the quarter, or $1.58 per share, down from a profit of $6.80 billion, or $1.68 per share, in the same period a year earlier. The results beat the $1.39 per share analysts were looking for, according to FactSet. Citigroup’s profit declines 11 percent NEW YORK — Citigroup said Friday that its profit fell nearly 11 percent in its third quarter, but the results easily beat Wall Street expectations and its shares rose. The bank reported net income of $3.8 billion, or $1.24 per share, in the three months ending Sept. 30, compared with $4.3 billion, or $1.35 per share, in the same quarter the year before. That’s better than the $1.15 per share that Wall Street analysts expected, according to FactSet. Revenue fell 5 percent to $17.76 billion in the quarter, beating the $17.29 billion that analysts expected. Hershey’s CEO plans to retire next year NEW YORK — Hershey says CEO John Bilbrey plans to retire from the chocolate company next year. The news comes less than two months after Oreo cookie maker Mondelez ended talks to buy Hershey, in a deal that would have brought together some of the world’s best known chocolate and snack brands. Hershey makes Reese’s peanut butter cups, Kisses and other chocolates and candies. Bilbrey will retire on July 1, 2017, and stay on as a non-executive chairman.

PHOTO: REUTERS Oct 17, 2016 5:50 AM US stocks fell slightly last week after an unpleasant surprise in Chinese data, and investors could be in for another volatile week, even if earnings reports continue to impress. The fourth quarter is seasonally strong, largely because of the shopping splurge in the US. That still appears to be on the cards this year, but there are an unusually wide range of spoilers this time around. These include uneven earnings and growth data, the US presidential and suddenly wide-open congressional elections, Brexit and, of course, the Federal Reserve's promise to raise rates by the end of the year. So far, it's been a mixed earnings season, with a report from Alcoa that was more of a shock than a disappointment as the aluminium giant said even its "fast-growing" businesses processing materials for aircraft and other applications slowed down in the latest quarter. Alcoa's report weighed on other commodities producers. Elsewhere, earnings were better, hinting that the third quarter could be the first of the year so far to see aggregate profit growth. "There is a very real chance the earnings recession could be over with a small gain in Standard & Poor's 500 earnings the third quarter," said Ryan Detrick, senior investment strategist for brokerage LPL Financial. Some of the nation's biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, posted earnings in excess of expectations. The gains in the financial sector were dulled by fallout from ethics controversies at Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo which has claimed Wells Fargo's chief executive and left Deutsche on the brink of a liquidity crisis. In a good sign for consumer spending, Winnebago saw strong growth in demand for the camper vans and trailer tents economists rank as among the most discretionary big-budget items for middle class Americans. The strength of the consumer was echoed by Amazon.com which said it was hiring 20 per cent more temporary workers for its warehouses to fill orders for the holiday season. This week, a cavalcade of earnings from companies ranging from fast-growing streaming service Netflix to cellphone carrier Verizon and from industrial conglomerate General Electric to software maker Microsoft will be among the biggest influences on the stock market. The big shock last week was the reported drop in Chinese exports. "That really was not so much about China. . .that was interpreted as a commentary on global growth," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. Another crisis that has the potential to cause flare-ups of volatility is the ongoing Brexit saga. Last week saw Brexit hit home for the first time, as Tesco's, one of the largest supermarket chains in the United Kingdom, temporarily cleared its shelves of Marmite, a popular sandwich spread. Unilever, which makes Marmite and a host of other consumer products for Tesco and others, had pushed for a slate of price increases to compensate for the lower value of earnings in sterling. Tesco pushed back by pulling Marmite and other products from its shelves and its website. The value of sterling has fallen to the lowest level in history against a basket of currencies, adjusted for trade. Sterling at US$1.22 for the first time since the 1980s may help manufacturers in the UK compete globally on prices, but it also sets the table for an inflation spiral, as illustrated by the Marmite Wars. The outrage on British social media over the jars of vegetable extract would be nothing compared to the response a spike in petrol or milk prices could cause. For sectors such as health care, the biggest variable remains the outlook for the November elections. After a cartoonish series of scandals, Donald Trump looks almost certain to lose to Hillary Clinton. What Mrs Clinton called his "exploding" campaign has caused collateral damage for Republicans running for the House and Senate. Were the balance of power to change in these houses of Congress, both currently controlled by Republicans, it could have a more profound effect on the stock market than the identity of the next president. "With three weeks left until the US Presidential election, politics continue to trump policy and this persists as the key theme of our current trading views," said foreign-exchange analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in a note to clients. Meanwhile, traders continue to send markets hither and thither based on their readings of tea leaves for the next Federal Reserve meeting. The disappointing data in China was read as making a hike this year slightly less likely. Still, odds on Fed Funds futures markets for a hike in December are still greater than 50 per cent. "Next week, there's a clutch of housing market that becomes important because we need to see the housing market continue to do well and also create jobs," said Ms Krosby. Recent falls in mortgage applications suggest that the housing rebound, one of the most successful elements of the Fed's programme to stimulate growth with interest rates, may wane once the Fed's support is removed. Analysts at brokerage Barclays warn that another source of support for the bull market in stocks - the "financial engineering" that has led to a record wave of buybacks and dividend increases - could also give way if rates begin to rise much further. All this means that the bar is set much higher for companies in the earnings season this year, said Ms Krosby.

Donald Trump And Hillary Clinton Policy On Taxes Explained By Lydia O'Neal @LydsONeal On 10/16/16 AT 10:08 AM Close As part of a larger plan for middle class tax cuts, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton promised Tuesday to double the child tax credit to $2,000 for families with kids aged four or younger, the Wall Street Journal reported. But what about Trump’s tax policy proposals? Read on, so you can know the tax plan you’re voting for. InsideGov | Graphiq Hillary Clinton pledges to help middle and lower income families. Clinton’s campaign site promises that the former secretary of state “will call for imposing a four percent ‘Fair Share Surcharge’ on two out of every 10,000 taxpayers making more than $5 million per year” and will propose broadening the pool of earners impacted by the “Buffet Rule.” Named for investor and billionaire Warren Buffett and proposed by President Barack Obama in 2011, the policy would apply a minimum tax rate of 30 percent on individuals making more than $1 million annually. The “Buffett Rule” isn’t exactly a liberal triumph: It was rejected as a Senate bill in 2012 and not present in Obama’s 2013 budget proposal, as the White House dubbed it more of a “guideline” than a piece of legislation. Time will tell whether Clinton, if elected, takes a more aggressive position. Clinton’s campaign site also promises she will close loopholes allowing derivative traders to hide their funds in low-tax havens, such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. But leaks of the so-called Panama Papers last spring showed that the world’s biggest tax haven—the “New Switzerland,” so to speak—is actually the U.S. Which, for many liberal voters, begs the question: Are Clinton’s tax plans aggressive enough? Her donors are big banks, businesses and billionaires. Clinton’s donor list carries some big names. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs are her third, fourth and fifth biggest funders, with each donating nearly $1 million, according to OpenSecrets. Microsoft Corp., Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Google parent company Apple also make the top 20. Her super PAC donor list tells a similar story. InsideGov | Graphiq Though her plans include a “risk fee” on liabilities for banks with more than $50 billion in assets, many wonder how much influence the megabanks would have on her policies as president. After all, some reports hint that her financial services industry backers may have had a hand in keeping Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren off of the vice president ticket. Trump’s tax policies are surprisingly similar—on the surface. His current tax plan, the third and most moderate iteration, borrows generously from a June House Republican tax proposal. He promises to “reduce taxes across the board,” and pledges to favor “working and middle-income Americans” by giving them a “massive tax reduction,” according to his campaign site. But independent groups have found that middle- and lower-income groups would actually see their tax burdens increase under Trump's plan, CNN Money reported. For example, his simplification of the tax code, reducing the number of income brackets from seven to three, would raise the percentage of income tax paid by earners in the lowest bracket from 10 percent to 12 percent.  Trump also promises to “reduce the cost of childcare by allowing families to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes”—not unlike his opponent’s recent proposal. But where do they really differ? Clinton pledges to go after the so-called “one percent,” while Trump would lower the corporate tax from its current 35 percent level to 15 percent, according to his campaign. Related Stories YouTube Draws 124 Million For Second Debate Buffett Urges Trump To Release Tax Info Another major divide is the Estate Tax, also known as the “death tax,” in which heirs pay the government a large portion of a deceased person’s inheritance before it can be handed down. Clinton wants rates to rise with the dollar value of the estates, to as much as 65 percent, while Trump wants to abolish it altogether, according to their campaign sites. They also differ on the issue of capital gains taxes, which investors pay when making money off of their trades. Clinton’s campaign site says she hopes to raise the rate and close loopholes, while Trump wants to maintain the existing structure, with a cap at 20 percent.

Brandon Montoya recently opened his own independent financial advising firm. He strictly charges annual as opposed to transactional fees, which falls in line with a recent Department of Labor ruling designed to protect investors from wasting their hard-earned money on exorbitant fees. By Max Efrein Originally Published: October 16, 2016 6 a.m. Share Tweet mefrein Brandon Montoya has held positions within each of America’s three largest banks (J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America and Wells Fargo). When he was a banker at Wells Fargo several years ago, he said the aggressive sales tactics previously encouraged within the company’s business model was ever-present. “It was the reason my tenure there was kind of short,” Montoya said. “I saw what was happening and definitely felt the pressure.” When he moved to J.P. Morgan Chase and later Bank of America, he worked on the investment banking side. As he became more familiar with the industry, he found there were practices in place at each company that he believed restricted his ability to serve his clients. “What I kept finding was I really am passionate about servicing people really well, and time and time again, some part of the system of working for this large corporation would get in the way of me doing that,” Montoya said. So he recently decided to open his own firm in Prescott called Montoya Wealth Management. This decision came not too long after the Department of Labor (DOL) finalized a fiduciary rule that aims to protect investors by adding an extra layer of regulation to how financial advisers do business. The rule essentially focuses on fee structures, specifically increasing the amount of liability a firm takes on when it decides to accept commissions or revenue sharing for financial transactions. It states that starting next April, advisers administering such fees will be required to have their clients sign a best interest contract exemption (BICE). This contract puts in writing that the adviser will act in the client’s best interest at all times and only earn “reasonable” compensation for services rendered. The adviser must also disclose in the BICE what fees the client will be facing and whether or not there are any conflicts of interest involved. If investors feel this agreement is not upheld, then they may sue their advisers over the matter. However, several lawsuits have been brought against the ruling. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez has publicly expressed confidence that it will withstand the court challenges. Montoya didn’t want to touch this, mainly because he was already on board with the decision laid out by the DOL. “There are some dinosaurs in the industry that are not going to be able to change with the ways the regulation is changing, but it’s the right thing to do,” Montoya said. Therefore, Montoya only charges annual fees. On average, financial advisement firms charge an annual fee of about 1 percent to manage an account, said Scott Sandell, Phoenix Chapter President of the Foundation for Personal Financial Education. This 1 percent of a person’s total account will be divvied up among various entities within a firm. In Montoya Wealth Management’s case, a slice goes to TD Ameritrade, which is handling the firm’s record keeping and generating statements; a slice will go to whichever investment manager Montoya chooses to hire on the client’s behalf based on the client’s investment preferences; and the remainder goes to the firm itself. Montoya makes sure to spell out this fee structure clearly on each client’s contract in an effort to be as transparent as possible. Sandell said any and all fees should be presented in this way. “It should be very clean, cut and dry,” Sandell said. “It should not be hard to understand and it should be in writing.” If an investor asks what their fee is and an advisor gives a convoluted answer, Sandell said the investor should consider another adviser.

J2M 1 month ago There are some local and national large privately held financial companies that already exist and have existed that do in fact do what's in the best interest of their clients. I know because I am one. My financial advisor has kept me well informed about this DOL before and after it was finalized. I was with one of the 3 mentioned in this article & was unhappy so a friend referred me to their FA they've been with since 80's. It was light & day how I was treated the new Financial Advisor and his staff, they cared about what I wanted. I wish Brandon Montoya the best of luck in his new adventure as looking out for the clients best interest is the right choice. Investors should not be lured by scare tactics of other firms but as stated in this article if you have a company who will not put your best interest 1st look elsewhere.

Right. But that does not include the perks and commissions they receive for including favored stocks, annuities and mutual funds in your account. And your financial planner will take his or her 1% quarterly whether they make money or lose money for you. Spend a little time educating yourself and doing research on available investments. In most cases you do not need a financial advisor.

The contractors on the new Little Caesars Arena in Detroit were fined for failing to hire an adequate number of Detroit residents for construction jobs. Educators and trades leaders say the issue is related to a broader skilled trades shortage and education gap. The tower crane operators, electricians, masons and iron workers constructing Little Caesars Arena in downtown Detroit are statistically less likely to reside in the city. This fact has cost the contractors hired to build the future home of the Detroit Red Wings roughly $500,000 in fines, as was reported widely last week. The contractors signed an agreement with city officials, in exchange for $250 million in tax-exempt bonds and other incentives, to maintain an employment base consisting of 51 percent residents of Detroit. They failed to reach the benchmark. And it's no surprise: The arena construction worker talent gap is a symptom of the city's bigger workforce affliction. Civic and business leaders acknowledge that Detroit's workforce problems pose one of the greatest threats to the region's prosperity. "There are thousands of skilled trades jobs open in Michigan and Detroit, but they can't find the skilled labor they need in Detroit," said Dave Meador, vice chairman and chief administrative officer at DTE Energy Co. and member of the Detroit Workforce Development Board. "Paying fines and penalties isn't going to fix that." Only 29 percent of workers in the city as a whole are Detroit residents, according to an April report by the Detroit-based Corporation for a Skilled Workforce and funded by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. The reason is as simple as it is disturbing. The jobs in the city more often than not require more skills than Detroiters possess. For instance, 38 percent of jobs in Detroit are considered high-skill, requiring at least an associate degree, while 63 percent of working Detroiters possess no more than a high school diploma, according to the study. This gap is becoming more pronounced as the skill levels needed increase as the construction advances from basic ground clearing to operating tower cranes and electrical work, said Lisa Katz, executive director of the Detroit-based Workforce Intelligence Network for Southeast Michigan. "Early on, it was pretty reasonable to expect (contractors) to find Detroit workers for cleanup and other basic jobs, but as they started getting into installing multi-ton trusses and increased use of heavy equipment or advanced electrical work, the skills needed go up, too," Katz said. "Considering the scale of the project, it's not surprising they can't find the skills needed in Detroit." For Barton Malow Co., one of the lead contractors for Little Caesars Arena, there's a lack of skills in construction in every market, but especially in Detroit, said CEO Ryan Maibach. "In our industry as a whole, there's a declining and aging workforce," Maibach said, declining to discuss specific problems with employment at the arena site other than saying the issue won't be fixed by the time the arena opens. "There are shortages everywhere," he said. "Workforce issues becomes a topic when there's a lot of work going and we're fortunate to have that problem right now, but it makes it really difficult to scale all those efforts when there's such a tremendous need for workers. Especially here in Detroit." An estimated 30 percent of all construction workers left the field during the last recession, which decimated the ranks of homebuilders, according to the National Association of Homebuilders. The ratio of U.S. construction job openings to hiring is at its highest level since 2007, according to U.S. Department of Labor statistics, at more than 200,000. It's much worse locally. Since 2010, Detroit has seen a construction boom, yet fewer people work in construction. Since 2010, overall construction employment has risen 11 percent in the city, but the concentration of construction workers per capita in Detroit is 44 percent below the national average, according to figures provided by WIN. Photo by Olympia Entertainment Inc. A welder works on the future home of the Detroit Red Wings this month. Welders, electricians and other skilled trades workers are in short supply. Further, construction workers in Detroit earn $3 to $4 more per hour than their elsewhere, according to WIN data. "Even though we're paying more, we're not getting the workers," Katz said. "This is evidence there's just not enough laborers in the city." "Everybody is fighting for a small pool," said Douglass Diggs, managing director of real estate development consulting firm Heritage Development Services LLC. "We've had contractors say they can't pull from (workers) from one project to put on the arena project." Heritage has been contracted by arena developers Olympia Development of Michigan to steer the arena job efforts and workforce initiatives. Olympia itself has made efforts to get city residents connected to contractors, such as six job fairs held in Detroit in April and May 2015. From those events and other outreach, Olympia has registered 13,000 city residents interested in arena construction jobs through Detroit Employment Solutions Corp., the administrative and fiscal agent for workforce solutions for the city, Diggs said. "We knew going into this we would have to work with the city and unions to get additional Detroiters into the skilled trades," Diggs said. "It takes a while to get people into the queue." Take, for example, A. Randolph Technical High School on Hubbell Avenue, which at one point had about 700 students, Meador said. Today, the school, the only one in Detroit Public Schools that offers skilled trade certificates and paid internships, only has about 100 students. "There are deep, systemic issues here, and there is not a quick fix," Meador said. "The average reading level is ninth grade. Average math level, seventh grade. Half have been in prison once. Half do not have transportation." Randolph's decline in enrollment stems from declines in funding. If a student left his or her regular high school to attend classes at Randolph, which occupies roughly two hours of a student's day, funding gets shifted from that school to Randolph, Meador said. "This created situations where principals weren't releasing students to go to Randolph," Meador said, as well as pointing out that charter school and Education Achievement Authority students also could not attend the school. "Families, teachers and advisers weren't necessarily advising students to go there either. Because apprenticeships were lacking, students were asking themselves, 'If I went to Randolph, would I get into an apprenticeship program at all?'" There are about 400 organizations in Detroit providing workforce development services — youth development, work readiness, mental health, literacy and financial literacy services, for example — and while many of them are doing good work, it's a scattershot approach that sometimes does not produce the needed results, Meador said. The workforce development board is a broad coalition of executives and others from the private, nonprofit, education and other sectors. Katz said the lack of soft skills in the industry prove even more challenging for employers like contractors, which have strict requirements for safety. "You can't just pull people off the streets," Katz said. "Many Detroiters are facing basic soft skills challenges that eliminate them from participating in a major construction project, such as higher-than-average drug use." International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 58 represents 90 percent of electricians in the city of Detroit and is the lead local for the arena project. Michael Richard, business manager for the local, said the union successfully enrolls only 4 percent to 6 percent of applicants each month into an apprentice program, largely due to the skills gap. "Either they haven't prepared their (high school) transcripts, can't meet the math requirement or pass the drug test," Richard said. "Every one of our members is working, and we can't just create electricians overnight. It's frustrating." IBEW Local 58 journeymen earn $38.83 per hour, coupled with a benefits package worth $23.39, Richard said. Apprentices, who are in a five-year program, earn $17.43 per hour with the same benefits. Over the past four years, the local has spent $1 million on recruitment, including hiring teachers to help potential electricians meet the math requirements for the apprenticeship program. "An apprentice earns more than $200,000 just in benefits alone," Richard said. "We're banging our head against the wall to get applicants and get them in the program. We have the work." The roughly $500,000 in fines to the contractors are going to skilled trades training, not into the general fund, said Jeff Donofrio, the city of Detroit's director of workforce development. Much of that focus is on soft skills, he said. Part of the city's curriculum is construction basic skills training, which includes reading and math to meet construction requirements, Donofrio said. The city is committed to training even in the ebbs and flows of construction projects, said Portia Roberson, director of the city of Detroit's office of human rights, which monitors and enforces the hiring requirement for the project. "We're training for the next jobs, not just this one," Roberson said.

Delta Air Lines Inc. will extend its modest capacity growth of 1 per cent in the fourth quarter to all of 2017, with Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian citing “the weakest revenue environment in recent memory.” Given that the U.S. economy continues to expand, albeit sluggishly, the meagre seat growth anticipated next year is reminiscent of the industry’s capacity slowdown after the 2008 financial crisis. For several years, U.S. carriers checked their growth as they manoeuvred through the shoals of recession, high oil prices and a wave of mergers. Keeping a tight grip on seat capacity is an airline’s key to boosting airfares and overall financial returns. If the trend begun by Delta is writ large across the U.S. industry, 2017 capacity growth of about 3 per cent will be the tightest in three years, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Jamie Baker wrote on Thursday in a client note. U.S. carriers are keen to reverse almost two years of declines in an industry metric known as passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM), a trend driven by capacity expansion and a profusion of low fares — a seat mile is one seat flown one mile, the standard capacity gauge. Delta’s choice of a slow-growth 2017 will “turn up the heat on American and United to demonstrate similar conviction” to reverse unit revenue declines, Baker wrote. Delta shares have declined more than 21 per cent this year, a steeper drop than those of its domestic rivals. The broader Bloomberg US Airlines Index has slipped nearly 10 per cent this year. Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research said Delta’s quarterly report on Thursday was “the first of a few positive earnings season data points we expect where network airlines guide to capacity growth of less than 2 per cent next year. That is the core of the entire bull case on the sector.” Article Continued Below Atlanta-based Delta closed up 74 cents, to $40.01 U.S. ($52.52 Canadian), on Thursday in New York trading. With sales adjustments over the summer, Delta said it has already begun seeing fares rise for so-called “close-in bookings” made 21 days or sooner before travel. The widespread collapse of fare rules for tickets sold shortly before a flight — which are predominantly the domain of business travellers — has been one of the chief culprits in the industry’s sliding unit revenues. The airlines also need higher fares as they confront new pressures in 2017 on their two biggest costs: fuel and people. Crude oil now trades around $50 per barrel, twice the price of just eight months ago. Delta and other carriers are expecting to pay even higher prices in the future. On top of that, several carriers will probably have higher wage costs if labour groups approve pending deals. Delta and its pilots recently concluded negotiations for a new four-year contract, with a 30 per cent raise, Bloomberg News reported. Pilots at Southwest Airlines Co. are voting on a new agreement with a 29 per cent pay hike, while pilots at United Continental Holdings Inc. have a contract provision that ties their income to whether their peers at Delta achieve more. Also this summer, Southwest and United reached tentative deals with flight attendants. For passengers, more storm clouds may be gathering next week, when American and United report their quarterly results and are likely to preview capacity plans for 2017.

The future of job interviews might horrify you. It horrified Jake Rosen. A recent graduate of UCLA, Rosen was applying to be a page at NBC when he learned he wouldn't be going to an office to talk to a human being about his skills. Instead, he interviewed by webcam, on a laptop. So Skype, right? Nope, nothing as personal as that. He recorded his answers and sent them back to a hiring manager at NBC for review at the company's convenience. It's the robo-interview, and it goes something like this. In the more humane experience, a hiring manager, who also isn't all that practised in the art of digital video, delivers taped questions. Or, if it's truly Mr Roboto, a question pops up on the screen. You have a limited amount of time to answer. You talk to your computer, record the responses, and send them back to the company. Sometimes there's a practice question to get prospective employees used to talking to a camera. Sometimes there isn't. Often, at the end, you have the chance to re-record your answers. For shy people, it may be a dream come true. No firm handshake needed, and sure, you smell fine. And wouldn't we all love the redo option after making up an answer and mumbling it, too? For everyone else, it's awkward at best. It's a pretty slick encounter, a little like FaceTime, except you're forced to stare at your big, nervous face as you wax on about why you want to work at the company. It feels more like performing for an invisible audience than having a conversation, because that's essentially what it is. Not used to being on camera, Rosen felt flustered from the first question, which coloured the rest of his interview, he said. "I'm not a YouTube star, obviously," he said. "It's such a weird experience talking to a camera. It honestly was pretty horrible." Jamie Black, who suffered through the video interview experience for a job at a school, said it felt "more like a game show than an interview". For many of us, the experience will soon be unavoidable. The human-free video job interview is on the rise. HireVue, one of a handful of companies making video interview software, works with 600 large organisations, including Deloitte, JPMorgan Chase, Under Armour, and most of the major US airlines. This year, the company will do 2.5 million interviews, up from 13,000 five years ago. Nearly 90 per cent of those are "on demand" interviews, with nobody live at the other end. Continued below. Related Content Mental health help wait times for youth patients 'appalling' Cartoon: Uncle Sam is 'well and truly impaled' The best workplace in New Zealand named For a hiring manager, the draw of the video interview is mainly efficiency. "Companies want to get to know way more people," said Mark Newman, the founder of HireVue. A recruiter can only get through so many 30-minute conversations in a day. And that doesn't take into account time lost to scheduling or on bad candidates. With a video interview, human resources staff members only have to review the answers, and can do so on their own schedule, without having to travel for on-campus recruiting. Using HireVue, Hilton got its hiring cycle down to 4.5 days, almost 20 days shorter than the average interview process. All of this saves companies money. Cigna has cut travel expenses for recruiters from US$1m year, in some cases, to under US$100,000. For the job candidate, the benefit of robo-recruiting is convenience-and that's about it. Generally, a company will give an interviewee a day or two to complete the interview, which can happen anywhere. That might sound like another plus, but for Rosen it only added to his stress. "You start to think about things you wouldn't normally think about in interviews. I started thinking about my surroundings," Rosen said. "I had to find a blank wall to sit in front of. ... Should I put a bookshelf behind me? A plant?" Recruiters say they don't judge candidates on their performance, appearance, or locale. "Judging is an interesting word," said Heidi Soltis-Berner, the managing director for talent at Deloitte. "I would say the on-demand interview is truly for fact sharing." Other recruiters said they do evaluate people on their communication abilities and eye contact. Even if hiring managers are instructed not to make decisions on how well a potential new employee can perform in front of a camera (which is a bit hard to believe), the whole setup can be trying. "You just see yourself and a stopwatch ticking down," said Black, who said his answers often got cut off by the timer. If and when he has to do it again, Black said, he would practice in front of a mirror with a stopwatch before the interview. Rosen said it might help to have someone sit behind the computer, as the interview happens, so it's like talking to a person instead of a screen. Just look at the camera so your focus isn't off. The best advice might be to just relax. "It's OK to come across as uncomfortable in front of the camera, because everyone is," said Scott Mitchell, a recruiter for American Wedding Group, which uses video interviews to prescreen the 1900 independent contractors it works with. "We all assume you're going to be uncomfortable. We're putting you in an uncomfortable position." The robo-interview hasn't replaced human interaction completely. Many companies use it as a replacement for first-round screening interviews, followed by more traditional one-on-ones. But for interviewees who would rather go back to the old way ... that's not happening. Organisations can look at more people, and a more diverse set of people, with the video interviews, and save money on top of that. "Candidates will generally say, 'I would have preferred an in-person interview to this,' but that's not the right comparison," HireVue's Newman said. "The alternative is no interview at all." - Bloomberg Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

As many as 119 companies were part of the placement process this season, and 364 students were recruited, marking an overall increase in job offers. A highlight of the season was the participation by esteemed companies like Airtel, Boston Consulting Group, E&Y, HUL, ITC, JP Morgan Chase, KPMG, Microsoft, Mahindra, Nestle, Godrej, Goldman Sachs, TAS, and Vodafone, according to a statement released here on Saturday. New recruiters formed 45 per cent of the participating companies. Amul, Britannia, CEB, Credit Suisse, Colgate Palmolive, DE Shaw, Directi, IndiaMART, Kohler, Mytrah, Novartis, Piramal Group, Saint Gobain, Sun Pharma, and TAFE were the new recruiters. The average stipend continued its upward trend, and the highest stipend offered was Rs.2.5 lakh. Students were also offered positions abroad. Interestingly, students opted for niche roles in the fields of digital marketing, social media analytics, and research and development. “In its 20 years of service, IIM-Kozhikode has provided the industry with thought leaders and business front runners in the making. With the successful close of the summer placement season, we yet again prove our calibre and reset benchmarks,” Prof. Kulbhushan Balooni, Director (In-Charge), IIM Kozhikode, said. The 20th batch was the biggest till date, and the institution saw the fastest closure of placements, indicating the faith of recruiters in IIM-K students. The sales and marketing vertical saw the highest number of recruiters, with 45 per cent of the batch opting for this sector. The other top segments based on roles offered were finance (17 per cent), and consulting and general management (24 per cent). Priya Nair Rajeev, Chairperson, Placements at IIM-Kozhikode, said: “The IIM-K brand has grown tremendously over the years which is reflected in the faith that recruiting partners, both new and old, have in our students.” More In: Kozhikode Tweet Please Wait while comments are loading...

A trio of Wall Street’s biggest bulls say don’t worry. (Photo: Detroit News file art) A gloomy beginning to earnings season sent U.S. stocks to a second week of losses. A trio of Wall Street’s biggest bulls say don’t worry. It was a week of twists as the S&P 500 Index alternated between gains and losses, a rarity during the bull market but one that’s now happened four times this year as sentiment is swinging on everything from central-bank policy to the U.S. election and perceptions on the economy’s strength. Earnings took a turn in the spotlight in the latest week, as a profit miss from Alcoa Inc. rattled the market before signs of life from the largest banks buoyed optimism. For Thomas Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors, the latest gyrations are just turbulence on a ride that will leave the market higher by 9 percent come 2017. RBC Capital Markets LLC’s Jonathan Golub and Bank of Montreal’s Brian Belski, with Lee among the bull market’s biggest cheerleaders, say the rocky start to earnings matters little. They’re declaring the longest profit recession since the financial crisis over, clearing the path for equities to rally into the new year. “While we are disappointed in the weak equity market performance month to date, we still see stocks strengthening through 3Q16 results and ultimately seeing equities rise into year-end,” Lee wrote in a note to clients Friday. The S&P 500 ended the five days lower by 1 percent at 2,132.98, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 102.11 points, or 0.6 percent, to 18,138.38. The reporting season started with a thud, as the S&P 500 tumbled the most in four weeks on Tuesday after Alcoa’s profit miss and companies including Illumina Inc. warned of disappointing results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. helped the benchmark eke out a gain on Friday as results topped forecasts. “For the week, the markets got queasy because of Alcoa and that set the tone,” said Diane Jaffe, group managing director at TCW Group, which oversees $195 billion. “But big money banks have reported, and things are looking better. All of a sudden, everyone’s valuation work looks attractive because earnings are growing.” A rebound in corporate profits would help check valuations that by some measures indicate stocks are near the most expensive in two decades. The currentprice-earnings ratio for S&P 500 stocks is 19 percent higher than the 10-year average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “Deteriorating levels of earnings growth had been a major thorn in the market’s side over the past year,” Belski, who estimates S&P 500 profits rose by 15 percent last quarter, wrote in a note to clients Friday. “However, the environment is set to change in a big way for the 3Q reporting period.” When S&P 500 profit grows by 10 percent or more in a quarter, the index gains an average of 2.7 percent for the calendar quarter, according to BMO data. A jump the size Belski predicts could enable the S&P 500 to reach his year-end target of 2,250, a level 5.5 percent above Friday’s close. The average forecast among 19 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg is 2,171, implying a gain of just 1.8 percent through the end of the year. To Golub, valuations don’t have to fall for stocks to power to his year-end target of 2,225. He says price-earnings ratios can rise further, listing companies’ ability to turn profits into cash flow among the reasons. “With multiples well within a normal band, the current swing higher appears far from over,” he wrote in a note to clients Thursday. While the group of strategists is persistently bullish — they’ve called for gains in the equity market 82 percent of the time during the past decade — history shows that breaks in earnings slumps that have reached five quarters usually precede some of the stock market’s strongest periods. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey predict net income fell by 1.4 percent last quarter, though the expected rate of decline is so small that it will almost certainly evolve into a gain when companies are done beating estimates. An end to the profit recession would also stabilize a market preoccupied with the path and timing of Federal Reserve interest rate increases. Rising odds for a December hike have pushed U.S. stocks lower amid data showing steady but slow growth. Companies whose fortunes are more closely tied to the economy fared worst in the week, with health-care stocks and raw-material producers leading declines.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, Oct 16, 2016 - Page 14　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp European shares rebound as Chinese data ease worries Bloomberg European stocks on Friday rebounded after three days of declines as better-than-expected Chinese data helped ease investor concerns over global growth and the health of the world’s second-biggest economy. The STOXX 600 Index climbed 1.3 percent at the close of trading, its biggest gain since Sept. 22. The equity gauge rose 0.1 percent this week, halting a two-week losing streak. Friday’s increase pushed it above its 100-day moving average after it dipped below in the past two days. Gains were helped as forecast-beating results from Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co alleviated some concerns about the strength of US earnings. Italian banks led lenders to the biggest advance on the STOXX 600, with Banco Popolare SC and Banca Popolare di Milano Scarl rising 6.1 percent or more on optimism that shareholders will this weekend back their merger. Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd contributed the most to gains among miners. Anglo American PLC added 1.6 percent after people with knowledge of the matter said Apollo Global Management LLC and Xcoal Energy & Resources LLC are poised to buy its Australian metallurgical coal assets. “The fall yesterday [Thursday] was a little too vigorous, so we are getting a bounce back,” said Frances Hudson, a global thematic strategist at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh. “Following the data on producer prices, we are getting a strong performance from miners today. At a market level, we seem to be traveling optimistically with regards to earnings in Europe.” Data on Friday showing that China’s producer prices rose for the first time since 2012, as well as higher-than-estimated inflation, offered a more encouraging outlook for the country. European stocks have yet to fully recover from a slide at the start of the year precipitated by anxiety over a Chinese slowdown. Anxiety about the health of corporate Europe has also weighed on equities. More than 150 members in the STOXX 600 are reporting earnings this month, with analysts forecasting a profit decline of 4.2 percent this year for the index’s constituents.

services   Trading boosts banks' results 14 Oct 2016 Profit fell at some of the U.S.' biggest banks, but strong trading results helped lift JPMorgan Chase's and Citigroup's revenue past estimates. Fred Katayama reports. Video Transcript Strong trading results overshadowed weaker bottom lines at some of the U.S.' biggest banks. JPMorgan Chase saw fixed income revenue spike nearly 48 percent. It benefited from the volatility spurred by Britain's vote to exit the European Union and changing expectations for monetary policy. Also contributing: investment banking, which was driven by higher debt and equity underwriting fees. JPMorgan's profit dropped because of higher tax expenses, but earnings and revenue crushed estimates, sending its shares higher in early trading. Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said, "JPMorgan Chase had an excellent quarter which we think casts further doubt on skeptics' views that bank earnings are somehow frail and fragile." Profit also dropped at Citigroup and Wells Fargo amid the low interest rate environment. But Citi's trading revenue rose sharply, and overall revenue breezed past Wall Street's estimates, sending shares higher. Wells Fargo's profit fell for the fourth straight quarter. The bank set aside funds for potential legal expenses stemming from the scandal in which employees opened 2 million fake accounts to meet aggressive sales targets. more from equities   Multimedia gallery Obama's last tour of Europe gallery Inside the restored Capitol dome gallery Los Angeles Auto Show gallery The Islamic State destruction of Nimrud VIDEO Saudi Arabia committed to using less oil for power- oil minister VIDEO Confusion surrounding Trump's talks with foreign leaders Advertisement Most Popular Videos Saudi Arabia committed to using less oil for power- oil minister 1 day ago - Reuters Videos The ancient city of Nimrud lies in dust 2 days ago - Reuters Videos Airplane ticket prices to fall in 2017 2 days ago - Reuters Videos Advertisement About zawya Contact us Copyright © 2016 Zawya.

Better-than-expected results from three big banks spurred buying. So, too, did news of a rebound in retail sales in September. Fed chair Janet Yellen expressed concern that U.S. economic potential is slipping and may need aggressive measures to reverse it. Rob Lutts of Cabot Wealth Management interprets Yellen's message to Wall Street: SOUNDBITE: ROB LUTTS, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CABOT WEALTH MANAGEMENT, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "I think it means lower interest rates longer. That's the message." Twitter shares dropped after Salesforce.com's CEO said he won't bid for the microblogging company. Salesforce shares shot higher. Profit fell at JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. But a big spike in fixed income trading helped JPMorgan and Citigroup breeze past profit forecasts. Smaller-than-expected loan loss provisions helped Wells Fargo's profit top estimates. Analysts had cut profit forecasts because of the bank's fake accounts scandal. Microsoft shares rose after Cowen & Co raised its price target on the stock by $2. Hershey up after the chocolate maker said CEO John Bilbrey will retire in July. In Europe, a rally in bank stocks drove European shares higher.

 Banking vacancies have plummeted since Brexit — but job openings in other sectors are growing rapidly Thomas Colson Oct. 15, 2016, 3:21 AM 1,207 facebook linkedin twitter email print Canary Wharf, London REUTERS/Russell Boyce Job vacancies in the banking sector have dropped by 18% since the UK voted to leave the EU, according to new figures. The data, released by recruitment site Reed, shows that banking saw the biggest annual contraction of job listings out of any sector following the Brexit vote. It suggests employers are holding off recruitment until prime minister Theresa May makes it clear whether she will end financial passporting rights as part of a "Hard Brexit." Financial passporting allows banks and financial services companies to operate across Europe using their local licences, rather than being regulated in each market it operates in across Europe. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said earlier this year that 5,500 companies with a combined turnover of £9 billion rely on passporting rights. Goldman Sachs could relocate 2,000 jobs to elsewhere in Europe if it loses passporting rights and UBS and JPMorgan have both warned of similar job moves. However, Reed's overall job figures are more positive. The number of jobs advertised on the site — the UK's largest — between July and September increased by 9% on the same quarter last year to 280,000. That figure is the highest since the financial crash and recession of 2008. Industrial sectors, including motoring & automotive (+27%) and manufacturing (+24%), saw some of the strongest growth. That could be because the collapsing pound makes UK exports cheaper for those purchasing goods from abroad. The manufacturing industry has surprised many by remaining resilient since the Brexit vote. James Reed, chairman of Reed, said that the overall outlook is positive. "The UK jobs market is continuing to show resilience in the face of ongoing uncertainty over what Brexit will actually look like," he said in an emailed statement. "We’ve seen a record number of new jobs available on reed.co.uk this week after strong annual growth throughout the third quarter. "Clearly, British businesses have held firm and continued with their plans to recruit. The biggest growth has been seen in the motoring & automotive, manufacturing and retail sectors, perhaps driven by the lower exchange rate," he added. "However, banking and finance continue to decline and this is having an effect on growth in London and the South East. It’s essential the government now gives greater clarity on its negotiating position for Brexit to underpin confidence in the jobs market. Business leaders are already working hard to counter the potential impact of leaving the EU and they must know that the government is listening."

It has no name or official membership list, and it meets only once a year, in locations such as Switzerland's Lake Lucerne, Connecticut's Litchfield County and, this year, Versailles. The attendees are top in-house lawyers for some of the world's most powerful banks — people who sit at the table for decisions that can shape multibillion-dollar litigation tabs for the likes of Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. For this year's meeting, in late May, the lawyers descended on Trianon Palace Versailles, a luxury hotel less than 1.3 miles from the palace of Louis XIV and adjacent to the royal park. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The gatherings, which were described by several people familiar with them who asked not to be identified, tend to feature discussions of nuts-and-bolts issues such as managing relationships with the board and whether compliance personnel should receive stock incentives. This year, according to two of the people, some attendees arrived at the marble and gilded hotel primed to focus on a common scourge: class-action lawyers who seek billions of dollars from top banks for alleged market manipulations and related bad behavior. Eric Grossman, chief legal officer at Morgan Stanley, implored his confederates to hang together and resist the temptation to settle quickly. Months before, Citigroup Inc.'s general counsel, Rohan Weerasinghe, had made a decision that essentially forced several of the world's biggest banks to pay a total of $1.9 billion to settle a class action over credit-default swaps. Investors, including the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association, claimed the banks had worked together to limit competition in the market, allowing them to earn extra profits. When multiple banks are sued in a class action, it's common for them to share information and coordinate their defenses. But after years of practice, class-action lawyers have figured out a way to fracture these alliances. They reach a settlement with one bank, then ratchet up pressure on the others. Each bank knows that the last to settle will probably pay the heftiest price. That's because of a legal theory called joint and several liability, in which a company found in court to be even partially to blame can end up on the hook for all the damages. In the swaps case, Citigroup broke first, agreeing in the summer of 2015 to pay $60 million. Others followed, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. settling last for $595 million. Looming over the banks was the possibility of an antitrust investigation of the swaps market by the European Union, which could have uncovered evidence that would then be available to the class-action plaintiffs. In the end, the EU closed its case, so the banks might have been better off waiting. Citigroup's decision to settle highlighted the need for a conversation on the matter, according to the people familiar with the May meeting. Weerasinghe was there, but in keeping with the group's collegial atmosphere, there was no direct criticism of him for deciding to cut a deal, the people familiar with the event say. "They realize they are stronger when they stick together than when they splinter," says Dan Brockett of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a lead plaintiffs' attorney in the swaps case. "But each general counsel has a fiduciary duty. Each bank will act in its own interest." The annual gathering, whose existence hasn't previously been reported, is the brainchild of lawyer Robert Mundheim. » Next page...

Bank stocks rose on Friday on the back of stronger-than-expected quarterly results from three major U.S. banks. The SPDR S&P 500 Bank rose more than half a percent, ending a three-day losing streak, its longest since August. Before the bell on Friday, banking giants JPMorgan Chase , Wells Fargo and Citigroup all posted better-than-expected quarterly results, beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines. "I think we're seeing a big sigh of relief from investors that the banks are not imploding here," said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. "You had a bit of very-short-term panic yesterday." The financials sector was the best performing segment in the S&P on Friday, with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley outperforming shares of JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. "I think it was a good quarter for JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. But, if you really dig in, the real gains were in fixed income sales and trading," said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities. "That tends to be a stronger percentage of gains for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley than other banks. I think that's why you're seeing those two outperform." Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are scheduled to report quarterly results next week. DISCLOSURE: JMP Securities makes a market in both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

Earnings are expected from about 80 S&P companies, including Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, McDonald's and American Express. According to Thomson Reuters, earnings for the S&P 500 companies are expected to be nearly flat for the third quarter — down just 0.4 percent after a year of negative earnings reports. Data in the coming week includes industrial production Monday, the Fed's beige book on Wednesday, but most importantly CPI consumer inflation data on Tuesday, after producer prices perked up more than expected in September. Stocks in the past week were lower, with the S&P 500 down nearly 1 percent at 2,132, the Dow down 0.6 percent at 18.138, and the Nasdaq off 1.5 percent at 5,214. In the past week, the market became vulnerable for the first time to the idea that Donald Trump's controversial behavior and sparring with Republicans could hurt GOP Congressional candidates. While traders give it low odds, there was speculation in the past week that Democrat Hillary Clinton could sweep in with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. The conventional thinking is that Clinton will win and Republicans will hold one if not two houses. Markets prefer gridlock over one party control, especially Democratic control since they are viewed as more likely to adopt stiffer regulations and less favorable tax policy. Trump has fallen in the polls since the revelation of a tape where he was making lewd and aggressive remarks about women. The final presidential debate is scheduled for Wednesday night. "If Clinton looks like she's going to win, the market likes it. If Clinton's party looks like it wins, the market doesn't like it. That's one of the oddities we've got going," said James Paulsen, CIO for Wells Capital Management. "The election will create volatility short-term but I don't think it will matter over the next year, unless one party gets triple power." Stocks should respond to earnings in the week ahead. Major banks reported profits Friday, and earnings for JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC came in above expectations. "I think we're going to see earnings momentum," said Paulsen, adding it's likely earnings comparisons will be positive for the first time in five quarters. He also expects to see global economic growth pick up. "I think that's coming together. … I'm not saying rapid growth, but just enough that shows we turned the corner in the global recovery, and that would be just at a time when earnings are coming through." Paulsen said if earnings and the economy do pick up, so should stocks. "I think we're breaking north. It's our next big move. It might have to be after the election," he said. Fed speakers will also be of interest in the coming week, after traders took comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen Friday to suggest she would like to hold rates low for even longer. Yellen said there could be benefits to a "high-pressure economy," which was taken to mean the Fed could hold off on rate hikes, and let inflation pickup to stimulate the economy. The market is anticipating a December rate hike, particularly after the Fed's minutes from its September meeting showed a divided Fed with a number of members eager to raise rates. After Yellen's dovish comments Friday, New York Fed President William Dudleyswung the market's view another way when he told The Wall Street Journal that he expects a rate hike this year. He also said the 10-year Treasury yield seems low and was not reflecting the economy's pace of growth, The 10-year yield rose after his late afternoon remarks, ending the week near 1.80 percent, a level it reached this past week for the first time since early June. Dudley will speak again in the coming week, but Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer also speaks, at the Economic Club of New York on Monday. Fischer, along with Dudley and Yellen, is seen as a critical member at the dovish core of the Fed. "Any views around inflation risks will be important to see how comfortable these core members feel about a near term hike," said Emanuella Enenajor, senior North America economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Enenajor said Yellen was misunderstood Friday. "I don't think she was sending the signal the markets interpreted," she said. "She's not suggesting that as a potential policy course. … She mentioned it as an academic question." Even aside from Fed speakers, inflation will be an important topic, with CPI Tuesday. "We're looking for 0.3 percent headline. Core up 0.1 percent. We had a strong reading of 0.3 last month. The health care piece was unusually strong. There's a couple of places where we could have a reversal, some payback. That's why we're in the camp of 0.1 on core," said Enenajor. She expects CPI inflation at a 1.5 percent year over year pace in September. Inflation is one of the Fed's two mandates, and it has targeted a 2 percent level. The Fed's favorite inflation measure is the PCE deflator, running at about 1.7 percent, but the Consumer Price Index shows core inflation has been running above 2 percent, even if headline inflation is lower. Enenajor said by the time November CPI is reported, the headline number could be 2 percent just based on the fact that oil prices were so low last year. "The big push from oil comes in February. We think it could get to a high 2 percent. It's temporary but it's confirmation that a lot of the weakness we had in inflation was driven by energy," she said. Besides the Fed, the European Central Bank will be of interest. It holds a rates meeting Thursday and ECB President Mario Draghi speaks after the meeting. Also in the coming week, CNBC's "Fast Money Halftime Report" is celebrating its five-year anniversary, featuring an all-star lineup with some of the biggest names in investing. At noon on Monday, David Tepper, Carl Icahn and Jeffrey Gundlach join the show. Other guests during the week include Marc Lasry, Nelson Peltz and Jim Chanos.

It horrified Jake Rosen. A recent graduate of UCLA, Rosen was applying to be a page at NBC (yes, yes, just like Kenneth) when he learned he wouldn't be going to an office to talk to a human being about his skills. Instead, he interviewed by webcam, on a laptop. So Skype, right? Nope, nothing as personal as that. He recorded his answers and sent them back to a hiring manager at NBC for review at the company's convenience. It's the robo-interview, and it goes something like this. In the more humane experience, a hiring manager, who also isn't all that practiced in the art of digital video, delivers taped questions. Or, if it's truly Mr. Roboto, a question pops up on the screen. You have a limited amount of time to answer. You talk to your computer, record the responses, and send them back to the company. Sometimes there's a practice question to get prospective employees used to talking to a camera. Sometimes there isn't. Often, at the end, you have the chance to re-record your answers. For shy people, it may be a dream come true. No firm handshake needed, and sure, you smell fine. And wouldn't we all love the redo option after making up an answer and mumbling it, too? For everyone else, it's awkward at best. It's a pretty slick encounter, a little like FaceTime, except you're forced to stare at your big, nervous face as you wax on about why you want to work at the company. It feels more like performing for an invisible audience than having a conversation, because that's essentially what it is. Not used to being on camera, Rosen felt flustered from the first question, which coloured the rest of his interview, he said. “I'm not a YouTube star, obviously,” he said. “It's such a weird experience talking to a camera. It honestly was pretty horrible.” Jamie Black, who suffered through the video interview experience for a job at a school, said it felt “more like a game show than an interview.” For many of us, the experience will soon be unavoidable. The human-free video job interview is on the rise. HireVue, one of a handful of companies making video interview software, works with 600 large organisations, including Deloitte, JPMorgan Chase, Under Armour, and most of the major US airlines. This year, the company will do 2.5 million interviews, up from 13,000 five years ago. Nearly 90 percent of those are “on demand” interviews, with nobody live at the other end. Efficiency For a hiring manager, the draw of the video interview is mainly efficiency. “Companies want to get to know way more people,” said Mark Newman, the founder of HireVue. A recruiter can only get through so many 30-minute conversations in a day. And that doesn't take into account time lost to scheduling or on bad candidates. With a video interview, human resources staff members only have to review the answers, and can do so on their own schedule, without having to travel for on-campus recruiting. Using HireVue, Hilton got its hiring cycle down to 4.5 days, almost 20 days shorter than the average interview process. All of this saves companies money. Cigna has cut travel expenses for recruiters from $1 million a year, in some cases, to under $100 000. For the job candidate, the benefit of robo-recruiting is convenience—and that's about it. Generally, a company will give an interviewee a day or two to complete the interview, which can happen anywhere. That might sound like another plus, but for Rosen it only added to his stress. “You start to think about things you wouldn't normally think about in interviews. I started thinking about my surroundings,” Rosen said. “I had to find a blank wall to sit in front of. ... Should I put a bookshelf behind me? A plant?” Recruiters say they don't judge candidates on their performance, appearance, or locale. “Judging is an interesting word,” said Heidi Soltis-Berner, the managing director for talent at Deloitte. “I would say the on-demand interview is truly for fact sharing.” Other recruiters said they do evaluate people on their communication abilities and eye contact. Trying Even if hiring managers are instructed not to make decisions on how well a potential new employee can perform in front of a camera (which is a bit hard to believe), the whole setup can be trying. “You just see yourself and a stopwatch ticking down,” said Black, who said his answers often got cut off by the timer. If and when he has to do it again, Black said, he would practice in front of a mirror with a stopwatch before the interview. Rosen said it might help to have someone sit behind the computer, as the interview happens, so it's like talking to a person instead of a screen. Just look at the camera so your focus isn't off. The best advice might be to just relax. “It’s OK to come across as uncomfortable in front of the camera, because everyone is,” said Scott Mitchell, a recruiter for American Wedding Group, which uses video interviews to prescreen the 1 900 independent contractors it works with. “We all assume you're going to be uncomfortable. We're putting you in an uncomfortable position.” The robo-interview hasn’t replaced human interaction completely. Many companies use it as a replacement for first-round screening interviews, followed by more traditional one-on-ones. But for interviewees who would rather go back to the old way ... that's not happening. organisations can look at more people, and a more diverse set of people, with the video interviews, and save money on top of that. “Candidates will generally say, 'I would have preferred an in-person interview to this,' but that's not the right comparison,” HireVue's Newman said. “The alternative is no interview at all.” BLOOMBERG Hungry for more business news?

Stocks inch up as banks rise, drugmakers fall U.S. stocks gave up large gains and finished barely higher Friday. Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the United States and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. The Dow Jones industrial average inched up 39.44 points, or 0.2 percent, at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 added 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.83 points to 5,214.16. Sales up 0.6%, but spending could slow U.S. shoppers stepped up their spending in September, with sharply higher sales at auto dealers, restaurants and gas stations. But the government's retail sales report released Friday also contained evidence that spending might be slowing. For much of this year, consumers have spent at a solid pace as income gains have accelerated and the job market has improved. Last month's overall retail sales gain was a decent seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent. Much of it, though, was because of higher oil prices, which increased how much people spent at gas stations but were not necessarily a sign of stronger consumer spending. Chinese nationals get prison for fraud Federal authorities say two Chinese nationals who defrauded Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. out of $1.5 million in a kickback scheme have each been sentenced in Ohio to more than two years in prison. Authorities say Xin Franco Fan and Rex Xu Yu earlier pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and honest services wire fraud. They were sentenced Thursday in Akron to 27 months in prison and ordered to repay the $1.5 million. Affidavits say Akron-based Goodyear contacted the FBI in February about the men, who worked for a Singapore-based subsidiary that acquires $1 billion a year in rubber for Goodyear. Macy's flagship debuts Apple shop Macy's has launched an Apple shop at its Herald Square store in New York, the first U.S. department store with a hub devoted to the brand. The shop features a range of products including iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and the new Nike-branded Apple watch. Staffed by Apple associates, it's on the main floor in the heart of the busy cosmetics and fragrance area. Macy's is also rolling out a digital watch area in 180 locations that includes Apple watches, Fitbits and other smart watch brands in time for the holiday rush. The Apple partnership comes as Macy's is collaborating with other brands to create almost a mini-mall. It's trying to create more excitement in the stores as shoppers have moved away from department stores and are buying more online. — Wire reports More Business Cozy retirement?
