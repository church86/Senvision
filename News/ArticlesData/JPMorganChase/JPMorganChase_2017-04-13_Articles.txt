Gone were borrowers with anything much less than pristine credit ratings. The cost of managing delinquent accounts and the threat of huge legal penalties were written off as not worth the risk. Better instead to focus on wealthier customers who wanted jumbo-sized loans that are beyond the reach of government housing finance agencies. But there was a problem: Chase was leaving behind many of its mass market customers who were going to competitors for the conventional and government-guaranteed loans they wanted. Now, the bank’s management team, led by Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, is working fiercely to change course – hoping to not only bring back customers, but influence what could be a reshaping of U.S. mortgage finance policy for the first time in a generation. Customers will soon start seeing signs of this effort. Next month, Chase plans to launch advertising featuring Drew and Jonathan Scott, stars of the popular reality “Property Brothers” shows. In addition to TV spots, the campaign will feature cardboard cutouts of the telegenic twins in Chase branches. Chase is also in the process of boosting its mortgage lending force by 10 percent, upgrading its loan-making software and jazzing up its smartphone app with more mortgage account tools. At the moment, fewer than one in 10 Chase customers with home loans got them directly from Chase, a situation consumer banking chief Gordon Smith recently described as "terrible." “It is time to go after the opportunity we have with our own customers,” Mike Weinbach, the bank's mortgage chief, said in a recent interview with Reuters. JPMorgan Chase is not the only major bank that is restless after having stepped back from the U.S. mortgage market in the aftermath of the housing crisis last decade. At Bank of America Corp, executives say they are no more content with fewer than two in 10 of their customers with mortgage loans having borrowed from their bank. Mortgage companies such as Quicken, Caliber and loanDepot.com scooped up much of the business from battered banks. (tmsnrt.rs/2orqDzB) JPMorgan's $31 billion cost of 13 mortgage-related legal settlements was second only to Bank of America’s $71 billion, according to data collected by bank analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Still, JPMorgan's mortgage retreat stands out because the bank has used its scale and financial strength to gobble up market share in many other businesses, from credit cards and deposit-taking to commercial lending and Wall Street banking. In backing away, JPMorgan saw its market share of conventional mortgages that are small enough to be resold to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fall by half, according to data from Inside Mortgage Finance. Its share of all mortgage loans made directly by lenders fell to 2.8 percent last year from 12.6 percent in 2011. Logically, it should be close to Chase's 8.3 percent of share of retail deposits, said Guy Cecala, CEO of Inside Mortgage Finance. JUMBO MISSES Chase opted to go after better-off borrowers who took out so-called jumbo loans in excess of the Fannie and Freddie limit, which then was $417,000 in most parts of the United States. Last year, jumbos were 49 percent of all loans Chase made, up from 14 percent in 2013. But jumbos account for only 18 percent of U.S. mortgages. By turning from bigger parts of the market, JPMorgan was hurting its wider consumer franchise. That could be costly if it persists. Customers without Chase mortgages are twice as likely to leave as those who have them from the bank, Weinbach said. And, checking and savings account customers who get their home loans from Chase tend to add to their deposits. Management’s effort to swing back may already be bearing some fruit. JPMorgan said on Thursday that it made $9 billion of home loans directly to customers in the first quarter, 3 percent more than in the same period a year earlier. Chase’s shift comes amid crosscurrents in the mortgage market. The latest wave of loans for refinancing is abating as interest rates rise. That has reduced revenue across the industry. But bank executives also see other conditions improving. Federal housing agencies have been loosening policies to help middle America get access to more credit. The millennial generation has also begun reaching the nesting age, leading to a new crop of home buyers. The GSEs have already adjusted some rules to be less financially threatening to lenders. For instance, they dropped a demand that banks take back loans that default after three years unless there has been fraud. Dimon sees a chance to get more relief from the government. This month he used four pages of his annual letter to shareholders to outline more changes he wants to see. He expressed particular concern about a bank’s costs and liability when loans it underwrites default. Current rules have made lenders so cautious that they have not funded an additional $300 billion to $500 billion of loans for home purchases in each of the last five years, JPMorgan analysts estimate. The cost to the economy, they believe, has been one third of a percentage point of annual growth. “If that number is right, shame on us,” Dimon told reporters on the bank's post-earnings conference call on Thursday. “We should have done something about that. And, it can be done very quickly.” (Reporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Bill Rigby) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles Next In Funds News WRAPUP 5-Loan growth stalls despite profit, trading gains at some U.S. banks NEW YORK, April 13 Big U.S. banks revealed more evidence of a slowdown in loan growth in their earnings reports on Thursday, though executives assured there is still healthy demand from borrowers and no reason to worry about the state of the economy.

JPMorgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon said that the rest of the year will likely be a “sausage-making” period for President Trump’s business-friendly agenda and that he didn’t expect the process to be easy. “You all should expect as a given that, when you have a new president and they get going, that the nine months after the first 100 days are a sausage-making period,” he said during a Thursday analyst call discussing the bank’s first-quarter earnings. “To expect there to be smooth sailing, that would be silly,” said Dimon, who’s also the head of the Washington lobbying group Business Roundtable. The comments came after JPMorgan reported a 17 percent rise in profit for its first quarter, driven primarily by more trading. The Wall Street bank made $6.45 billion in profit from January to March, or $1.65 a share. That was better than the $1.52 a share that analysts had predicted. Shares of JPMorgan, amid a broader market sell-off, fell 1.2 percent, to $84.40. Citigroup reported a 17 percent boost in profit, to $4.09 billion, or $1.35 a share, beating expectations. Analysts had expected $1.24. The profit increase at Michael Corbat’s bank came thanks to a boost in bond trading, spurred by a rise in interest rates. Revenue came in at $18.1 billion, compared with the $17.8 billion Wall Street expected. Citi’s shares slipped 47 cents, to $58.04. At Wells Fargo, customers have still not returned after a 2016 phony account scandal singed its reputation. The scandal-ridden bank admitted Thursday that it saw drastic declines in new applications for credit cards and checking accounts, two key products that were at the center of Wells’ cross-selling controversy. Credit-card applications plunged by 42 percent, to 200,000, during the first three months of the year, the bank said in its earnings release. New checking account applications fell by 35 percent, to 400,000. Wells on Thursday reported a profit of $5.46 billion, or $1 a share, about flat with last year. It beats forecasts of 97 cents. The tepid results sent shares tumbling 3.3 percent, to $51.35.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Apr 13, 2017 at 4:06PM The nation's biggest bank by assets kicked off first-quarter earnings season for banks on Thursday with a bang. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) reported a 17% increase in profits for the three months ended March 31 compared to the year-ago quarter. "We are off to a good start for the year with all of our businesses performing well and building on their momentum from last year," said Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. "U.S. consumers and businesses are healthy overall and with pro-growth initiatives and improving collaboration between government and business, the U.S. economy can continue to improve." JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase's performance was bolstered by an easy year-over-year comparison. It was in the first quarter of 2016 that oil prices dropped below $30 a barrel, increasing the risk of default among companies in the energy industry and thereby prompting banks to raise their loan-loss provisions. This weighed on earnings, as provisions impact income in the same way expenses do. It was also in the first quarter of last year that the United Kingdom announced it would hold a referendum on whether to secede from the European Union. This increased uncertainty, which translated into lower income from trading, as institutional investors were reluctant to leave the sidelines. (The U.K. voted in favor of Brexit in June.) JPMorgan Chase saw a meaningful improvement in both areas in the first quarter of this year. Its provision expense fell 28%, or $500 million, while its trading income climbed 34%, or $903 million. These alone are more than enough to explain the $928 million increase in the bank's net income. Metric 1Q17 Year-Over-Year Change Net revenue $24.7 billion 6% Provision for credit losses $1.3 billion (28%) Noninterest expenses $15.0 billion 9% Net income $6.5 billion 17% Source: JPMorgan Chase. The bank benefited, as well, from the Federal Reserve's decisions to raise interest rates in December and March, hiking the fed funds rate by a combined 50 basis points. This increased the amount JPMorgan Chase earned from its $2.2 trillion worth of interest-earnings assets by 11 basis points compared to the final quarter of last year. All told, the New York City-based bank earned $6.5 billion in the quarter. To put that in perspective, Apple is the only company that generates more net income than JPMorgan Chase. That translated into an 11% return on equity for the bank. And if you use a more restrictive measure of capital, as banks are inclined to do nowadays, JPMorgan Chase's return on tangible common equity was 13%. These are far from the returns that banks earned before the financial crisis nine years ago. Yet, double-digit returns on equity like these are easier said than done in such an inhospitable operating environment, given the still-ultralow interest rates and heightened compliance burden brought on by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. In short, JPMorgan Chase's first-quarter earnings showed a consistently improving bottom line, bolstered by gradually abating industry headwinds.

U.S. banks reporting their first earnings under Donald Trump’s presidency showed a stark split: Wall Street businesses are faring better than many of those serving Main Street. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., the two largest U.S. trading firms, posted first-quarter results that beat analysts’ estimates as revenue from buying and selling stocks, bonds and other instruments outpaced expectations. Wells Fargo & Co., which focuses more on more traditional forms of banking to consumers and businesses, reported sluggish results and said total loans fell from the fourth quarter. The figures show how Wall Street businesses criticized during the presidential campaign are thriving as Trump sets out to reshape policy and the Federal Reserve embarks on interest-rate hikes. Political turmoil and changing central bank policies spurred interest-rate trading in the quarter while the threat of higher borrowing costs drove corporations to issue debt, which gave a boost to credit trading. Rising U.S. equities also fueled trading desks. Financial stocks surged after the November election as investors speculated that Trump would sideline Wall Street’s sharpest critics, dismantle regulation and pursue policies that spur inflation and lift long-term interest rates. He reversed course this week on some other key parts of his campaign rhetoric -- backing off protectionist policies and praising the Federal Reserve’s Janet Yellen -- in a sign he’s listening more to moderate advisers from finance, including former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President Gary Cohn. ‘Healthy’ Trading After a relatively slow start to the year, markets improved in March, JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said Thursday on a call with analysts. That helped her bank post a fourth straight quarter of increased trading revenue, the longest streak in at least a decade. “The competition is back and healthy,” she said. JPMorgan’s fixed-income trading revenue rose 17 percent to $4.22 billion, driven by rates trading linked to central bank actions, improved credit trading and upcoming elections in Europe. The firm also showed a surprise increase in equity trading, which rose 2 percent to $1.61 billion. At Citigroup, fixed-income traders posted their best quarter in three years, with revenue jumping 19 percent from a year earlier to $3.62 billion. Equities desks boosted revenue 10 percent to $769 million, within a percentage point of what analysts predicted.

The nation’s two biggest trading firms -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. -- posted surprisingly strong revenue Thursday from buying and selling securities in the first quarter, when political turmoil prompted clients to adjust holdings. Wells Fargo & Co., which focuses on more traditional banking to consumers and businesses, reported sluggish results and said total loans fell from the end of last year. The picture painted by senior bankers contained some irony: They’re hearing excitement and optimism from business leaders over Trump’s sweeping pledges for pro-growth policies. But some corporate clients are now delaying big decisions to see how his proposals take shape -- and whether his administration can actually turn them into laws. “There’s a lot of people with ideas, with expansion ideas, deal-type of notions, that are waiting to act, waiting for some sort of clarity,” Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told Bloomberg Television. Companies are poised to proceed once “the broad business regulatory landscape is well understood, when tax reform is understood, maybe when health care is understood.” JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who’s voiced support for many of Trump’s plans to stoke the economy, cautioned analysts not to overreact to slowing growth in commercial and industrial lending. Consumers and businesses are healthy. Some companies are tapping capital markets instead. And even if new policies take awhile, they can unleash broad benefits, he said. “When you have a new president and they get going, the nine months after the 100 days is going to be a sausage-making period,” he said. “There will be ups and downs, wins and losses, stuff like that. But it is a pro-growth agenda.” Read more: JPMorgan beats on strong trading For now, political turmoil in the U.S. and Europe, as well as changes in Federal Reserve policy, are stoking the type of Wall Street operations that faced criticism during the presidential campaign. One bright spot cited by banks was interest-rate trading. The threat of higher borrowing costs also drove corporations to issue debt, which boosted credit trading. And rising U.S. equities helped stock traders. JPMorgan’s fixed-income trading revenue rose 17 percent to $4.22 billion. The firm also showed a surprise increase in equity trading, which rose 2 percent. Companywide, net income jumped 17 percent to $6.45 billion. At Citigroup, fixed-income traders posted their best quarter in three years, with revenue climbing 19 percent from a year earlier to $3.62 billion. Equities desks boosted revenue 10 percent. Net income climbed 17 percent to $4.09 billion. “Whenever you have tectonic shifts in financial markets like we’ve had, that creates activity on Wall Street because clients have to react,” said Marty Mosby, an analyst at Vining-Sparks IBG.

Sign Up Financial stocks surged after the November election as investors speculated that Trump would sideline Wall Street’s sharpest critics, dismantle regulation and pursue policies that spur inflation and lift long-term interest rates. The industry got further reassurance this week when he reversed course on other key parts of his campaign rhetoric -- backing off protectionist policies and praising the Federal Reserve’s Janet Yellen. Those were seen as signs he’s listening more to moderate advisers from finance, including former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President Gary Cohn. Three more big banks -- Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley -- are set to disclose their quarterly results next week. Wells Fargo, meanwhile, reported revenue on Thursday that missed analysts’ estimates as the lender’s embattled community bank weighed on results. The firm has had trouble attracting new retail-bank customers while grappling with a bogus-account scandal and as fewer customers take out loans. Read more: Wells Fargo falls as revenue misses estimates Wells Fargo was the worst performer in the S&P 500 Financials Index of 65 companies, declining 3.3 percent on Thursday in New York. “Loan growth was certainly muted,” said Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays Plc. “While the administration has certainly talked a pro-growth agenda, they haven’t yet executed on it. But to the extent that they implement policies that actually improve the economy, we’d expect loan growth to follow.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported big jumps in first-quarter net income compared with the same period of last year, while Wells Fargo continued to feel the effects of a fake accounts scandal and reported flat profits, missing analyst estimates for revenues. But in a sign of sluggishness at all three banks, loan growth was weak, especially in some key areas such as corporate loans, which can serve as a proxy on broader economic activity. "The economy is still what the economy was, it's a slow-growth economy" Citigroup chief financial officer John Gerspach said on a conference call with reporters. "It's not a robust economy yet." But he added, "I do believe that there is optimism that it will continue to grow and get better." Gerspach said Trump's election and the expectations of tax cuts and other measures had boosted optimism for stronger growth, but "we haven't seen concrete changes yet in policies." Shares of Citigroup fell 0.8 percent to $58.04, while JPMorgan lost 1.2 percent to $84.40, and Wells Fargo tumbled 3.3 percent to $51.35. Banking shares had rallied strongly on Trump's election amid expectation that he would ease of regulations and promote other growth measures that would help their business. But the sector has cooled considerably on Wall Street as Trump's policies have yet to materialize. The S&P 500 financials index is down 0.3 percent so far in 2017. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon described US consumers and businesses as "healthy overall," but said growth could accelerate sharply if overly-constraining regulations were eased. Dimon declined to estimate the chances Trump will be able to enact such changes. "I don't want to put odds on it, but I think you have a lot of people working on it to get it done," he told reporters on a conference call. - Fewer energy defaults - JPMorgan said results were boosted by big jumps in trading of bonds and other financial products, as well as the benefit of higher interest rates. Net income rose 16.8 percent to $6.5 billion. Citigroup also highlighted strong trading results, especially in interest rate-related products. Net income rose 16.8 percent to $4.1 billion. Both banks also benefited from lower reserves compared with the January-March period last year, when they set aside hundreds of millions of dollars to protect against the possibility of energy defaults due to the oil industry slump. Wells Fargo also benefited from improvements in the energy sector, which permitted it to release $200 million in reserves. However, the bank's expenses for salaries and other non-interest costs rose by nearly four times that amount due to higher legal costs and greater spending on compliance programs. Earnings were $5.5 billion, the same as the year-ago level. The bank experienced a 35 percent drop in the opening of new checking accounts and a 42 percent tumble in credit card applications. Wells Fargo chief executive Timothy Sloan said those consumer trends likely will worsen in the second quarter, but should rebound after that. The company has established a "rebuilding trust office" that includes staff dedicating 100 percent of its time to implementing the consent decrees with regulators. "Right now, the most important job of this company is rebuilding trust," said Sloan said on a conference call with analysts. Wells Fargo's results came three days after the bank released a report on the factors that led to scandal over the opening of about two million deposit and credit card accounts without the customers' approval or knowledge. The report pointed blame especially at former chief executive John Stumpf and former community banking chief Carrie Tolstedt, who have been forced to pay back a total of $136 million in compensation due to the debacle. Among the reforms, Wells Fargo has addressed a "siloed" corporate structure that meant the problems in retail banking were not scrutinized more broadly. "We centralized our enterprise activities," Sloan said. "The primary reason we did that was so that we had a more appropriate escalation of risk and a more timely escalation of risk."

But when it comes to rolling back regulations on the financial industry, executives from big U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup  (C) say they remain hopeful that relief is on the way. "A lot of people are working hard to get it done, and so I'm comforted by that fact," JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said Thursday on a conference call with reporters. The bank continues to support "rational changes" to the Dodd-Frank Act, passed after the financial crisis of 2008 to address perceived financial-industry abuses, CFO Marianne Lake added. "We are supportive of keeping the dialogue open," Lake said. "The tone is that people are serious about wanting to make appropriate change to the regulatory environment." Shares of large U.S. banks have surged 35% over the past 12 months on investor optimism that Trump's surprise election in November would lead to a rules rollback, not to mention the economic boost that would theoretically come from his pledged tax cuts and higher spending on pipelines, bridges and other infrastructure improvements. That rally has faded in recent months, as Trump's high-profile failure to replace former President Barack Obama's healthcare law exposed feuds within the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress.   Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like First Horizon National: Cramer's Top Takeaways Brian Jordan, CEO of First Horizon National, tells Jim Cramer, he hopes for deregulation and lower taxes.

 Jamie Dimon says something shameful is going on with the mortgage market Alex Morrell Apr. 13, 2017, 11:04 AM 21,591 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jamie Dimon says many disadvantaged Americans are being left out in the cold when it comes to homeownership.REUTERS/Dylan Martinez Multitudes of would-be first-time homebuyers have been stymied in their pursuit of an iconic piece of the American dream in recent years. JPMorgan top boss Jamie Dimon finds the whole thing unsettling. JPMorgan had plenty to crow about during its first-quarter media call Thursday, in which the company beat earnings and reported some record numbers. But during the call, Dimon took the opportunity to air some concerns. In an impassioned speech, he said there was dysfunction in the mortgage market that he thought had cut lending by up to $500 billion a year, boxing out many of the Americans who would benefit the most. His comments were based on a March 31 report from JPMorgan's fixed-income strategy team saying "under an early 2000s lending regime, another $500bn of new purchase loans could have been extended in 2016." "If that number is right, shame on us" for not doing something about it, Dimon said. A primary culprit, in his eyes, has been government regulation in reaction to the financial crisis. Dimon's message Thursday echoes his letter to investors released in early April. In the letter, Dimon described homeownership as the "embodiment of the American Dream," and he lamented a slow housing recovery, which he blames in part on mortgage credit restrictions. He acknowledged that after the financial crisis his firm "needed to create a safer and better-functioning mortgage industry," but he said the response was excessive and created new problems. Dimon described the complex web of government oversight that dampened banks' willingness to lend: "Seven major federal regulators and a long list of state and local regulators have overlapping jurisdiction on mortgage laws and wrote a plethora of new rules and regulations appropriately focused on educating and protecting customers. While some of the rules are beneficial, many were hastily developed and layered upon existing rules without coordination or calibration as to the potential effects. "The result is a complex, highly risky and unpredictable operating environment that exposes lenders and servicers to disproportionate legal liability and materially increases operational risks and costs." The result, Dimon said, has been more expensive mortgages for consumers and less access to people without a sterling credit history. He cited the following charts in his shareholder letter as evidence that lending had dried up for borrowers with lower credit scores: JPMorgan JPMorgan And in a not-so-subtle jab at pro-regulation pushers, Dimon notes that the people they're trying to protect have lost the most from the industry's heightened governmental scrutiny. He wrote: "It's noteworthy that those who lost access to mortgage credit are the very ones who so many people profess to want to help – e.g., lower income buyers, first-time homebuyers, the self-employed and individuals with prior defaults who deserve another chance."

New York-based JPMorgan on Thursday also cited fixed-income trading in reporting its own 17% jump in profit. "We had good engagement from clients," Citigroup CFO John Gerspach said on a conference call with reporters. The lender fell 47 cents to $58.04 in New York trading on Thursday, widening this year's losses to 2.3%. Citigroup's fixed-income markets unit, which includes bond-trading as well as foreign exchange, posted a revenue increase of 19%, with gains from government as well as corporate bonds. The bank's stock-trading unit raised revenue by by 10%.  Such gains were in line with estimates from Deutsche Bank that Wall Street's total trading revenue would increase by an average of 15% from a year earlier.  Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like First Horizon National: Cramer's Top Takeaways Brian Jordan, CEO of First Horizon National, tells Jim Cramer, he hopes for deregulation and lower taxes.

But in the wake of its fake accounts scandal, Wells Fargo's net income was flat, also reflecting the bank's smaller presence in trading and investment banking, which buoyed results for the other two banks. "The momentum we saw across many of our businesses towards the end of last year carried into the first quarter, resulting in significantly better overall performance than a year ago," Citigroup chief executive Michael Corbat said. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon said the results reflected the fact US consumers and businesses were "healthy overall." At Citigroup, net income for the quarter ending March 31 rose 16.8 percent from the same three-month period last year to $4.1 billion. At JPMorgan net income for the quarter ending March 31 was $6.5 billion, also up 16.8 percent. At Wells Fargo, net income came in at $5.5 billion, the same as the year-ago level. JPMorgan cited higher debt and equity underwriting fees and gains in trading revenues tied to fixed income and the trading of other products. Citigroup also pointed to strength in investment banking and trading. All three banks benefited from a decline in reserves set aside to cover bad energy loans compared with the year-ago period, when low oil prices threatened petroleum producers. Wells Fargo's results came three days after the bank released a report on the factors that led to scandal over the opening of about two million deposit and credit card accounts without the customers' approval or knowledge. Wells Fargo chief executive Tim Sloan said the bank has "continued to make meaningful progress" in rebuilding trust with customers and other important stakeholders," according to a press release. "We have taken significant actions throughout the company to date and we are committed to building a better bank as we move Wells Fargo forward." Shares of JPMorgan rose 0.3 percent to $85.68 in pre-market trading. Citigroup lost 0.3 percent to $58.33 and Wells Fargo fell 2.3 percent to $51.90. 13 Apr 2017 Previous Back to summary Next Newsletter AFP Subscribe to our newsletter AFP's worldwide network The global network of Agence France Presse covers 150 countries Find out more Find out more Contact us If you have news to share or a question, comment or suggestion, contact us via...

Suppliers IBD STAFF 4/13/2017 Reprints Loading the player... The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite tested key support levels amid geopolitical tensions and concerns about President Trump's agenda. United Airlines (UAL) suffered a PR fiasco, and Apple (AAPL) buzz roiled iPhone suppliers. Tesla (TSLA) became the most valuable U.S. automaker, briefly. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) headlined big bank earnings, while Wal-Mart (WMT) is making physical stores an asset in its online battle against Amazon (AMZN). Stocks Undercut 50-Day The Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all fell below their 50-day moving averages on Wednesday. Investors worried about tensions with Syria, North Korea and Russia, while President Trump said tax cuts will have to wait on health reform. Steel, mining and other infrastructure-related stocks kept falling. Many chips fell on Apple uncertainty, while fiber-optic stocks rebounded Thursday on blowout preliminary earnings figures from Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI). JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) fell after reporting earnings. Wal-Mart stepped up its battle with Amazon, with both retail stocks in buy zones. The 10-year Treasury yield continued to slide, hitting its lowest level since November. United Airlines Tries To Repair Brand United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz apologized multiple times after a video of Chicago police dragging an elderly Asian man off an overbooked flight sparked outcry on social media. Weibo users in China questioned if the incident was racially motivated and called for a boycott of the airline. In an earlier a memo to employees, Munoz blamed the passenger for being "disruptive and belligerent" and said that United had "followed established procedures." In March, the carrier came under fire for turning away two teenagers for wearing leggings while flying under a special friends-and-family ticket. United Airlines shares fell 2.55% for the week, not much more than the airline stock group. RELATED: United CEO Apologizes After Racism Claims Sparked China Backlash Delta Upbeat On Q2, Defends Overbookings Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported mixed first-quarter results but forecast positive Q2 unit revenue, an important efficiency metric Wall Street has long wished would improve. As airlines confront higher fuel and labor costs, Delta said that it expected "the entirety of our 2017 margin pressure" to have occurred during Q1. The carrier said the roughly 4,000 flight cancellations that resulted from thunderstorms around Atlanta would cost it $125 million in Q2 pretax income, but it said it was not understaffed. In light of the forcible removal of a passenger from a packed United Airlines flight, Delta said extra regulation wasn't needed and that it handled overbookings better than rivals. Delta shares rose 4% intraday Wednesday but reversed to close slightly lower, and continued to slide Thursday, closing at their lowest levels since Nov. 9. RELATED: Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook Strong Apple Chips Unsettled Apple's internal chip development efforts grabbed the spotlight, raising investor worries that some iPhone suppliers could be phased out after a report said the Dow-industrials tech giant will replace power management devices made by Germany's Dialog Semiconductor with in-house technology, possibly as soon as 2019. The Dialog report followed U.K.-based Imagination Technologies' warning to investors that Apple could replace its graphics chips in iPhones. A Pacific Crest analyst said Apple is unlikely to develop its own radio frequency or audio chips for iPhones. Shares in Qorvo (QRVO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) sold off. In a countersuit, Qualcomm (QCOM) claimed Apple covered up how iPhone 7s equipped with its chips outperformed those with Intel (INTC) chips. Qualcomm also alleged that Apple lied to regulators to spur investigations of the wireless chipmaker. Apple on Jan. 20 filed a lawsuit vs. Qualcomm over its technology licensing practices. RELATED: Apple In-Sourcing Hit List To Spare Cirrus, Skyworks: Analyst Apple iPhone Chip Report Hits Dialog, Rattles Supply Chain Qualcomm: Apple Misled On Intel Chip Performance In iPhone 7 Wal-Mart Offers Pickup Discount Dow component Wal-Mart will begin offering price discounts for 10,000 goods picked up at a store location, expanding to one million items by the end of June. It's the latest evidence the discount giant is driving e-commerce innovation under new online chief Marc Lore, leveraging its brick-and-mortar locations vs. Amazon.com. Wal-Mart will offer varying discounts, using technology developed by Jet.com, which Lore sold to Wal-Mart last year for $3.3 billion. Heavy but inexpensive items will get bigger price cuts. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart began offering free two-day shipping with $35 minimum orders and also set up curbside pickup for online grocery orders. Whole Foods (WFM) spiked 10% on Monday after Jana Partners disclosed an 8.3% stake, hinting that it wants the natural-foods grocery giant to pursue a sale. Amazon reportedly had mulled buying Whole Foods last year, Bloomberg reported. RELATED: Wal-Mart Will Pay You To Pick Up Your Online Orders; Your Move, Amazon This Stock Is Up On News That Amazon Even Thought About Buying It Whole Foods Jumps On Jana Stake As Private Equity Eyes Grocers JPMorgan, Citigroup Earnings Top JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup both reported first-quarter earnings well above analyst estimates, with revenue also better than expected. Wells Fargo modestly topped Q1 EPS views but fell short on revenue. JPMorgan and Citigroup reversed from early gains to fall about 1%. Wells Fargo tumbled 3.3% to its worst levels since November. In addition to its mixed results, Wells was hurt by news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) is selling 9 million shares to keep its Wells stake below 10%. Bank stocks have been under pressure as Treasury yields have fallen and flattened. RELATED: JPMorgan, Citigroup Beat Q1 Views; Wells Fargo Revenue Misses Oil Prices Rally U.S. crude oil futures rose 1.8% for the week to $53.18 a barrel, helped by a seven-day winning streak through Tuesday. OPEC reported lower production in March and signs grew that the cartel and some nonmembers would extend production cuts past midyear. OPEC's production fell by 153,000 barrels per day in March, according to secondary sources in the cartel's monthly oil market report. Saudi Arabia said its production fell to 9.9 million barrels per day, but secondary sources said its output actually rose. The International Energy Agency said global crude supplies are nearly balanced due to the OPEC-led cuts. The Energy Information Administration said weekly U.S. oil stockpiles unexpectedly fell, but U.S. production hit a 20-month high. Looking ahead, the EIA expects gasoline to average $2.46 per gallon during the peak summer driving season vs. $2.23  last year. The EIA lowered its 2017 and 2018 outlook on crude prices and raised its forecast on U.S. output.

As Tesla gains moderated, however, GM regained its status. Tesla overtook Ford (F) on April 3. Meanwhile, a group of institutional investors want more independent directors on Tesla's board to avoid "groupthink" members that sign off on all of CEO Elon Musk's plans. Musk, Tesla's top shareholder, suggested that investors who aren't happy should buy Ford instead.

Dow component Disney (DIS) movies, Adidas (ADDYY) sneakers and Apple (AAPL) iPhones, among other things, according to Piper Jaffray's semiannual teen survey. Disney flicks took four spots on the list of nine most-anticipated films in the upcoming year, though Universal Pictures' "Fate of the Furious" topped the ranking. Nike (NKE), another Dow stock, remains dominant by share, but Adidas is the fastest growing in popularity; Under Armour (UAA) topped the list of downtrending brands among upper-income teenage boys. But Apple is only growing its lead: More teens than ever (81%) expect their next phone to be an iPhone.

AT&T paid 95.63 per share, a near 160% premium. The companies anticipate a closing within 12 months, subject to Federal Communications Commission review. Straight Path owns spectrum in the 40 largest markets across the U.S., including New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and Atlanta.

The combined Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings will trade as KNX. Swift and Knight shares soared on Monday, then gave up much of their gains. Meanwhile, Hub Group (HUBG) warned that it expects Q1 earnings per share of 30-32 cents vs. current views for 36 cents, citing "a soft pricing environment due primarily to excess truck capacity and extraordinarily aggressive intermodal pricing."   Share this: Related news Trump Surprises Sink Fed Expectations And Bank Stocks 4/13/2017 President Trump's stalled policy agenda and shift on Fed chief Janet Yellen have hit bank stocks and rate-hike expectations. 4/13/2017 President Trump's stalled policy agenda and shift on Fed chief...

Twin brothers Jay and Neil Canell, along with Justin Dembo joined JPMorgan in New York City, where they will operate under the name the Canell Group. Morgan Stanley is the largest U.S. securities brokerage by sales force with more than 15,700 advisors. JPMorgan Securities has roughly 420 financial advisers who manage $110 billion in client assets, according to the firm. JPMorgan Securities went through a leadership shakeup last month when Chris Harvey was named the new chief executive. His predecessor Greg Quental will retire at the end of the year. Quental had led the boutique wealth management firm since joining from Bear Stearns in August 2010. Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Christine Jockle confirmed that the advisers had left but declined to comment beyond that. Neil Canell said his group was drawn to JPMorgan's banking services, like mortgages and customizable loans, which are useful for their high net worth client families. "We believe that we will be able to make their experience just as personal as it has always been, but now with greater speed, better tools and platforms as well as more bank offerings," Canell said in an email.

But in the wake of its fake accounts scandal, Wells Fargo's net income was flat, also reflecting the bank's smaller presence in trading and investment banking, which buoyed results for the other two banks. "The momentum we saw across many of our businesses towards the end of last year carried into the first quarter, resulting in significantly better overall performance than a year ago," Citigroup chief executive Michael Corbat said. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon said the results reflected the fact US consumers and businesses were "healthy overall." At Citigroup, net income for the quarter ending March 31 rose 16.8 percent from the same three-month period last year to $4.1 billion. At JPMorgan net income for the quarter ending March 31 was $6.5 billion, also up 16.8 percent. At Wells Fargo, net income came in at $5.5 billion, the same as the year-ago level. JPMorgan cited higher debt and equity underwriting fees and gains in trading revenues tied to fixed income and the trading of other products. Citigroup also pointed to strength in investment banking and trading. All three banks benefited from a decline in reserves set aside to cover bad energy loans compared with the year-ago period, when low oil prices threatened petroleum producers. Wells Fargo's results came three days after the bank released a report on the factors that led to scandal over the opening of about two million deposit and credit card accounts without the customers' approval or knowledge. Wells Fargo chief executive Tim Sloan said the bank has "continued to make meaningful progress" in rebuilding trust with customers and other important stakeholders," according to a press release. "We have taken significant actions throughout the company to date and we are committed to building a better bank as we move Wells Fargo forward." Shares of JPMorgan rose 0.3 percent to $85.68 in pre-market trading. Citigroup lost 0.3 percent to $58.33 and Wells Fargo fell 2.3 percent to $51.90.

Bob Casey By ANNA PALMER (anna@politico.com; @apalmerdc) and JAKE SHERMAN (sherman@politico.com; @JakeSherman) with DANIEL LIPPMAN (daniel@politico.com; @dlippman) 04/13/17 06:46 AM EDT Driving the Day Listen to the Playbook Audio Briefing http://bit.ly/2o99gTi ... Subscribe on iTunes http://apple.co/2eX6Eay ... Visit the online home of Playbook http://politi.co/2f51Jnf WEST WING WHIPLASH -- Before: Trump said NATO is obsolete. Now: Trump said NATO is a “great alliance.” Before: Trump said it would be great if the U.S. and Russia could get along. Now: Trump says the U.S. and Russia are not getting along, and Rex Tillerson says “There is a low level of trust between our countries.” The president intimated that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad consulted Russia before launching a chemical attack on its people. Before: The Trump administration’s foreign policy mantra was “America First." The U.S. wouldn’t promote regime changes in places like Syria. Trump criticized U.S. involvement in the Middle East. Now: Trump is involved in the Middle East, and depending on who you talk to, the U.S. government would like to topple Assad … Story Continued Below … Before: China is a currency manipulator and could easily convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. Now: China is not a currency manipulator, and its relationship with North Korea is complicated. Before: The Export-Import Bank has to be eliminated. Now: The Export-Import Bank is important. … Before: Trump says he’s moving on from health care. Now: He says there will be a vote to repeal and replace Obamacare. THE REALITY: This is governing on the fly. Gone is the ardent post-election populism -- for now. After weeks of bruising headlines and backlash over some of his administration’s more conservative positions, Trump is embracing policy and people that are much more mainstream. **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh FIRST IN PLAYBOOK -- HUMA ABEDIN, the longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, is considering offers to write a book, according to multiple people familiar. She has been approached by people interested, but has not made a decision. JEWISH INSIDER SCOOP -- IVANKA AND JARED AT THE FOUR SEASONS IN WHISTLER FOR PASSOVER -- by Jacob Kornbluh: http://bit.ly/2pwnMVw THE BANNON-IS-DONE NARRATIVE -- JEREMY PETERS and MAGGIE HABERMAN on A13 of the NYT: “Mr. Bannon, [President Trump] has told one person, is ‘not a team player.’ … Mr. Bannon’s allies have already begun discussing a post-White House future for him. On Friday, his main political patron, Rebekah Mercer, the daughter of Robert Mercer, a major Trump donor, holed up in her office at Cambridge Analytica in New York, discussing possibilities for Mr. Bannon should he leave, according to two people briefed on the meeting. Mr. Bannon served on the data-mining firm’s board until last summer.” http://nyti.ms/2pbO3cw -- PHIL RUCKER, ASHLEY PARKER and BOB COSTA talk to 21 sources for this WaPo story: “The man not long ago dubbed the ‘shadow president’ -- with singular influence over Trump’s agenda and the workings of the federal government -- is struggling to keep his job with his portfolio reduced and his profile damaged, according to interviews Wednesday with 21 of Trump’s aides, confidants and allies. Some colleagues described Bannon as a stubborn recluse who had failed to build a reservoir of goodwill within the West Wing.” http://wapo.st/2nHAC73 IT’S NOT JUST BANNON… -- “The best people? Trump’s personnel picks haunt him,” by AP’s Julie Pace: “The tales of Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort and Carter Page -- none of whom still work for Trump -- have created a steady drip of allegations that have clouded [Donald] Trump’s early presidency and raised persistent questions about his judgment. At worst, Trump’s personnel picks appear to have left his campaign -- and perhaps his White House -- vulnerable to the influence of foreign powers. At best, they expose the long-term implications of his understaffed and inexperienced campaign organization and undermine his promises to surround himself with top notch talent.” http://apne.ws/2oqy5Lt JOSH DAWSEY and BEN WHITE on “CEOs gaining power in Trump’s White House”: “Wall Street titan Stephen Schwarzman has recently taken on a new, informal job: counselor to the president. The CEO of Blackstone Group, who has known Trump for years, has become so close to the president that the two sometimes talk several times a week, covering everything from Chinese trade to tax policy to immigration. “White House and New York business officials say Schwarzman was critical to Trump keeping the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as the Dreamers program, with Trump making the decision after a call with the hedge fund billionaire. “The two also recently chatted at Mar-a-Lago about a possible reorganization of the White House, two people familiar with the meeting say, though the conversation didn’t include specific names. Schwarzman’s growing influence in Trump’s circle is welcome news to New York business leaders and moderate Republicans, who want the president to abandon his nationalist positions and embrace a more non-ideological White House amid lagging poll ratings and infighting dominating the West Wing.” http://politi.co/2p9r6te THE SHIFTS -- “Trump Reversals Hint at Wall Street Wing’s Sway in White House,” by NYT’s Alan Rappeport: “President Trump made three startling economic policy reversals on Wednesday, stepping away from pledges he made as a candidate and even policies he supported only days ago. The shifts confounded many of Mr. Trump’s supporters and suggested that the moderate financiers he brought from Wall Street are eclipsing the White House populist wing led by Stephen K. Bannon, the political strategist who is increasingly being sidelined by the president. “In a series of interviews, Mr. Trump said he no longer wanted to label China a currency manipulator -- a week after telling The Financial Times that the Chinese were the ‘world champions’ of currency manipulation. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the president said he no longer wanted to eliminate the Export-Import Bank. And he said that he might consider reappointing Janet Yellen as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve when her term ends next year.” http://nyti.ms/2nHC7lL ****** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Tax reform, skills and workforce development and infrastructure investment are some of the keys to unlocking inclusive American economic growth. Learn more in JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon’s Annual Shareholder letter http://politi.co/2oaMj4Q ****** THE WALL STREET JOURNAL INTERVIEW -- DIPLOMACY: NOT AS EASY AS YOU’D THINK! -- “Mr. Trump said he told his Chinese counterpart he believed Beijing could easily take care of the North Korea threat. Mr. Xi then explained the history of China and Korea, Mr. Trump said. ‘After listening for 10 minutes, I realized it’s not so easy,’ Mr. Trump recounted. ‘I felt pretty strongly that they had a tremendous power’ over North Korea,” he said. ‘But it’s not what you would think.’” http://on.wsj.com/2nHAeFu … Excerpts http://on.wsj.com/2o9JE7S … TOP TWEETS -- Daniel Dale (@ddale8): “Here, side by side, is the information provided by the American president and the Chinese president about the same phone call.” http://bit.ly/2p9qSlR … @margbrennan: “If you’re wondering why the US press doesn’t have pictures of Secretary Tillerson at the Kremlin, that’s because he ditched his press pool” THE MOSCOW MEETING -- “Tillerson meets with Putin amid deepening tensions over U.S. missile strikes in Syria,” by WaPo’s Carol Morello and David Filipov: “The rift between the United States and Russia was laid bare Wednesday when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson held his first direct talks with Russia’s president. Their discussions failed to ease deepening tensions over Syria and Washington’s demands that Moscow abandon its main Middle East ally…. “The only concession that Tillerson appeared to have extracted from the Russians was that Putin offered to restore a hotline aimed at avoiding accidents in the air over Syria. Russia had suspended that effort after U.S. missile strikes on a Syrian air base following an April 4 chemical weapons attack on a village in rebel territory. Even this tiny success was conditional; Lavrov said the deal would apply only if the United States and its allies targeted terrorists -- not Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s ­forces.” http://wapo.st/2nHRIBq FROM 30,000 FEET -- “Suburban G.O.P. Voters Sour on Party, Raising Republican Fears for 2018,” by Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns, with an Alpharetta, Georgia, dateline on A1 of the NYT: “A gray mood has settled over conservative-leaning voters in some of the country’s most reliably Republican congressional districts, as the party’s stumbles in Washington demoralize them and leave lawmakers scrambling to energize would-be supporters in a series of off-year elections. … “Interviews with Republican-leaning voters in four suburban districts -- in Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota and New Jersey -- revealed a sour outlook on the party. These voters, mainly white professionals, say they expected far more in the way of results by now, given the Republican grip on power in the capital. In opinion polls, they consistently give Mr. Trump mediocre approval ratings, even as he remains solidly popular with lower-income whites.” http://nyti.ms/2p9hq1Z -- ABOUT GEORGIA: We’re hearing that Republicans are feeling better about their ability to hold Democrat Jon Ossoff to under 50 percent. -- ATLANTA JOURNAL CONSTITUTION: “Nearly $14M in ads have flooded Georgia’s Sixth for special election,” by Greg Bluestein. http://on-ajc.com/2oCjbUx CAMPAIGN PROMISE TURNS TO REALITY -- “Trump administration moving quickly to build up nationwide deportation force,” by WaPo’s David Nakamura: “The Trump administration is quickly identifying ways to assemble the nationwide deportation force that President Trump promised on the campaign trail as he railed against the dangers posed by illegal immigration. An internal Department of Homeland Security assessment obtained by The Washington Post shows the agency has already found 33,000 more detention beds to house undocumented immigrants, opened discussions with dozens of local police forces that could be empowered with enforcement authority and identified where construction of Trump’s border wall could begin. “The agency also is considering ways to speed up the hiring of hundreds of new Customs and Border Patrol officers, including ending polygraph and physical fitness tests in some cases ... But these plans could be held up by the prohibitive costs outlined in the internal report and resistance in Congress, where many lawmakers are already balking at approving billions in spending on the wall and additional border security measures.” http://wapo.st/2oqGQ8x TOP-ED -- GEORGE WILL: “What the Freedom Caucus stands for.” http://wapo.st/2oqzQIr PLAYBOOKERS on the Hollywood Reporter’s just-published list, “The 35 Most Powerful People in New York Media”: Jesse Angelo, Joe and Mika, Dean Baquet, Anderson Cooper, Jeff Fager, James Goldston, Peter Hamby, Ben Smith, Rachel Maddow, Megyn Kelly, Lester Holt, Andy Lack, Noah Oppenheim and Phil Griffin, Don Lemon, Matt Lauer, Savannah Guthrie, Adam Moss, David Remnick, David Muir, David Rhodes, Charlie Rose, Norah O’Donnell, George Stephanopoulos, Jeff Zucker.

The ads, which will air on CNN, Fox News and on TV stations in Fresno, California, home to a large Sikh community, make no mention of the more than 300 hate crimes reported by Sikhs in the U.S. since the 2001 terrorist attacks. Rather, they feature Sikh families explaining how the world’s fifth-largest religion, founded in India, aligns with American values.” http://apne.ws/2pbWV1G FIRST LOOK – The two ads, part of the million-dollar ad campaign, include “Proud” and “Neighbors,” which start airing on national cable on Friday.

Specially trained agents from the Justice Department’s F.B.I. provide constant protection for [Jeff] Sessions and James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director. Mr. Sessions usually flies on a private government-provided plane as well. At the C.I.A., highly trained and carefully selected agency officers protect its director with a constant presence, even setting up quarters within or near the director’s home. Like the attorney general, the director travels on a government-provided jet. And at the Defense Department, special agents from the Army’s Criminal Investigation Command ensure that the secretary, Jim Mattis, is kept safe domestically and as he travels the world visiting bases and installations.” http://nyti.ms/2o8tGMh ABOUT TRUMP’S HEALTH CARE PLANS -- “Trump dangles Obamacare payments to force Dems to the table,” by Dan Diamond and Josh Dawsey: President Donald Trump wants to use a key Obamacare subsidy program as leverage to draw Democrats to the negotiating table on health care, three administration officials with knowledge of Trump's thinking told POLITICO. Trump could deliver an immediate and fatal blow to the Obamacare marketplaces if he scraps the subsidy program, worth an estimated $7 billion this year. These cost-sharing subsidies, which help insurers pay medical bills for low-income customers, have been the subject of a long-running lawsuit that the White House could drop at any time. … “Two administration officials said the HHS rebuttal was personally ordered by an incensed Trump, who feared that the Times story hurt his negotiating position. Trump took the unusual step of calling HHS Secretary Tom Price to dictate a blistering statement that challenged the story and swiped at Democrats, one senior administration official said.” http://politi.co/2pbuKQp ****** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: “It is now more important than ever for the business community and government to come together and collaborate to find meaningful solutions and develop thoughtful policies that create economic growth and opportunity for all.” Learn more in JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon’s Letter to Shareholders: http://politi.co/2oKtc2G ****** THIS SEEMS… INTERESTING -- MANAFORT WATCH -- “After Campaign Exit, Manafort Borrowed From Businesses With Trump Ties,” by NYT’s Mike McIntire: “Aug. 19 was an eventful day for Paul Manafort. That morning, he stepped down from guiding Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign ... But behind the scenes, he was busy with other matters. Papers were recorded that same day creating a shell company controlled by Mr. Manafort that soon received $13 million in loans from two businesses with ties to Mr. Trump, including one that partners with a Ukrainian-born billionaire and another led by a Trump economic adviser. “They were among $20 million in loans secured by properties belonging to Mr. Manafort and his wife. The purpose of the loans is unstated in public records, although at least some of them appear to be part of an effort by Mr. Manafort to stave off a personal financial crisis stemming from failed investments with his son-in-law. “The transactions raise a number of questions, including whether Mr. Manafort’s decision to turn to Trump-connected lenders was related to his role in the campaign, where he had agreed to serve for free. They also shine a light on the rich real estate portfolio that Mr. Manafort acquired during and after the years he worked in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort, often using shell companies, invested millions of dollars in various properties, including apartments and condos in New York, homes in Florida and Virginia and luxury houses in Los Angeles.” http://nyti.ms/2oC6Lw6 OOPS -- “Republican congressional candidate has attacked foreign worker program his companies used extensively,” by CNN’s Nathan McDermott and Andrew Kaczynski: “Bob Gray, who is running in a tight race to fill Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price’s vacant seat in Georgia’s 6th congressional district, has said in multiple interviews that the H1-B visa was frequently abused by companies. The visa is meant to allow employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations when there is a shortage of qualified Americans. Yet three companies where Gray has been an executive have applied for and received H1-B visas, according data provided by the Department of Labor. Two of them, Keane and NTT Data Corporation, requested and obtained hundreds of H1-B visas for foreign employees. The third, Maine Point, employed two H1-B employees.” http://cnn.it/2nHONc3 WATCH OUT PALM BEACH! -- “Undercooled meat. Dangerous fish. Health inspectors zing Trump’s Mar-a-Lago kitchen,” by Jose Lambiet in the Miami Herald: “Just days before the state visit of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump’s Palm Beach private club, Florida restaurant inspectors found potentially dangerous raw fish and cited the club for storing food in two broken down coolers. Inspectors found 13 violations at the fancy club’s kitchen, according to recently published reports — a record for an institution that charges $200,000 in initiation fees. Three of the violations were deemed ‘high priority,’ meaning that they could allow the presence of illness-causing bacteria on plates served in the dining room.” http://hrld.us/2pbFUoo MEDIAWATCH -- “Anchor Roundtable: Savannah Guthrie, Jake Tapper and More on Fake News, Fairness and When Trump Calls Your Phone,” by Hollywood Reporter’s Marisa Guthrie: http://bit.ly/2nHuk7i -- “Bill O’Reilly cuts back his schedule,” by Hadas Gold: “Bill O’Reilly’s future with Fox News may still be unclear, but the star of the channel’s prime time line up -- and the host with its with the highest ratings -- has quietly made one major change recently: he is now hosting four days a week, instead of five. The 67-year-old O’Reilly has only hosted his program twice on Friday nights over the last five months. And a person familiar with the matter said a new Friday-night spinoff of O’Reilly’s show called ‘Friday Factor’ had been planned but not yet announced, with a rotating group of hosts filling his Friday slot.” http://politi.co/2nHruiE -- “Bret Stephens leaves Wall Street Journal for New York Times,” by Hadas Gold: “One of the loudest voices against President Donald Trump from The Wall Street Journal’s editorial pages is decamping for the competitor across town.

Ogg April 11, 2017 10:45 am EDT Print Email Tweet Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY) is one of the better pharmaceutical stocks, as far as performers in 2017 top picks at JPMorgan. Its shares were last seen up 17% year to date. Now the pharma giant was reiterated with an Overweight rating at JPMorgan. More importantly, the firm raised its price target to $100 from $85 in Tuesday’s call. What investors should know is that this is not the only positive analyst call from recent days and weeks. Eli Lilly’s closest competitor in year-to-date performance is Abbott Labs at 4%, and rival performance was seen as follows: Johnson & Johnson up 8%, Merck up 7%, Pfizer up almost 6% and Bristol-Myers Squibb down 7% so far. According to JPMorgan, Eli Lilly has a brighter future than in the past couple of years after drugs experienced patent expirations. The firm has a more bullish sales outlook for new Eli Lilly drugs. Positives include diabetes drugs Jardiance and Trulicity, and the firm talked up two drugs that are expected to be on the market quite soon: baracitinib as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and abemaciclib as a treatment for breast cancer. Tuesday’s report called Eli Lilly one of pharma’s best positioned stocks in its coverage universe. The broad scale of recently launched drugs and more later-stage pipeline assets are all adding up to an expected margin expansion for Eli Lilly. 24/7 Wall St. recently saw several other analysts and market pundits act positively toward Eli Lilly. The Thomson Reuters consensus analyst target price from sell-side analysts was listed as $85.85 at the end of January, though it was up in the $90s for most of 2016. Just last week Barclays gave positive comments to support its Overweight rating, and the firm raised its price target to $90 from $85. Two drivers were an expected FDA approval for Eli Lilly’s rheumatoid arthritis drug and the coming Phase 3 data from a cancer study due in June. Morgan Stanley talked up Eli Lilly’s Trulicity as rapidly gaining share in the GLP-1 category with the category gaining 27% year over year, but with Trulicity having growth at over 100% with a rising market share. That share price was last seen at 31%, compared with the following from peers: Novo Nordisk’s Victoza share at 47% AstraZeneca’s Byetta/Bydureon at about 17% GlaxoSmithKline’s Tanzeum at about 5% Sanofi’s Soliqua at about 1% Jim Cramer on CNBC has been positive on Eli Lilly as well, more or less noting that it was the go-to pharma stock that investors put capital into after any pullback in its share price. Back on March 9, 2017, Jefferies reiterated its Buy rating and raised its target price up to $97 from $95. Shares of Eli Lilly were last seen trading up 0.5% at $85.86 on Tuesday morning. Its 52-week range is $64.18 to $86.72, and the consensus analyst price target was $88.30. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

US$21.8 billion) for the first quarter of 2017. The company had previously announced on March 22 that sales had doubled in 2016 and that it is now one of China's three leading property developers. Driven by the impressive sales results, the stock closed at HK$7.60 (approx. US$0.90) on April 11 [th] , up 5.4 per cent over the previous day's close.  Country Garden delivered industry-leading growth in sales during the first two months of this year, thanks to the overall stability of the housing market, the company's balanced business portfolio, the improvement of its product competitiveness and its proactive marketing strategy, which included staying open and continue to provide products and services during the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, among other favorable factors. The world's leading banks, including Citi, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have taken note and issued positive reviews of the Chinese property developer's sales performance. Citi released a research report on April 7 [th] in which the bank maintained its "buy" rating on Country Garden. Prior to the issuing of the report, Citi had upgraded its rating on Country Garden from "hold" to "buy" based on the developer's financial results for 2016. Citi believes that Country Garden is "one of the game-changing companies". Citi said in the report that Country Garden is the first company to benefit in large measure from the fast-growing Chinese housing market. The bank also stated that it upgraded the rating on Country Garden to "buy" in view of the fact that the developer's financial statements have proved robust and the stock has been buoyed by the company's strong sales performance and its stock repurchase plan. Deutsche Bank published a report on April 6 [th] in which the bank provided separate rankings of what it considered the best performing publicly-traded Chinese companies in terms of cash flow, degree of leverage, number of orders in the pipeline, capital expenditure plans and dividend payout based on their year-end 2016 financial statements. Country Garden was included in the report's cash flow and leverage rankings, evidencing that the developer's financial situation remains healthy. Deutsche Bank previously released a study in which the bank lifted the target share price of Country Garden by 3.3 per cent to HK$7.72 (approx. US$0.90) after the developer announced its financial results for last year. In addition, the bank forecast Country Garden's sales in 2017 to exceed the developer's original sales target of 400 billion yuan (approx. US$58 billion), suggesting that sales would reach 420 billion yuan (approx. US$60.9 billion). The more than positive confirms the bank's strong confidence in the developer's sales growth.   On March 27, JPMorgan said in its research report that the bank maintains an "Outperform" rating for Country Garden, considering the developer's "strong cash flow growth, a declining net gearing ratio, steady performance in the second half of 2016 and decreased financing activities". JPMorgan noted that Country Garden is the only listed real estate company in China that continues to develop large real estate projects in and around first- and second-tier cities, an approach that the bank considers as having low policy-related risks and is consistent with China's new urbanization policy that is a part of the country's economic development strategy as outlined in the 13th Five-Year Plan. Country Garden is also one of the few real estate companies to have a well thought-out and reasonable incentive system, with headquarters trusting regional branches on land acquisitions, ensuring the profitability of projects. In addition, Nomura, in a research report issued on March 27, expected to see Country Garden's earnings growing by more than 30 per cent this year. It raised Country Garden's target price from HK$6.11 to HK$7.90 per share, and maintained a "Buy" rating. Chinese banks are especially bullish about Country Garden. On March 23, BOC International raised Country Garden's target price from HK$7.25 to HK$9.00 per share in its research report. On March 23, CICC upgraded its rating for Country Garden from "Neutral" to "Recommend", and raised the target price from HK$3.79 to HK$8.58, more than doubling the original projection. The management of Country Garden was calm when commenting on the strong sales performance of the first quarter. On the day when the company announced sales for the first quarter of this year, Country Garden chairman Yang Guoqiang (who formally spells his name Yeung Kwok Keung), delivered words of encouragement to the company's more than 100,000 employees when he said: "Keep the spirit of the dedicated craftsman in your heart while learning from prior experience: Play to your strengths. Learn from your mistakes in order to avoid repeating them. Let's keep marching down the road that lies ahead of us!" Country Garden has set 2017 as its Quality Management Year. Yang has stressed many times the need to emulate the spirit of dedicated craftsman as the distinguishing characteristic of the company's core competitiveness.

Keep me logged in I forgot my password No Thanks Equity Markets Global markets remained muted Monday as investors kept a close eye on events in the Middle East and North Korea. The spectre of the start of U.S. earnings season also tempered trading at the start of a holiday-shortened week. Wall Street futures, which had been mixed for much of the morning, turned modestly higher just before 9 a.m., signalling a flat start to the trading day. “U.S. equities look firm and while traders will be keeping an eye on the relations between Russia, the U.S. and any subsequent moves from Bashar al-Assad, (first quarter) earnings will play a larger role for traders too,” IG chief market strategist Chris Weston said in a note. “JPMorgan and a number of other financial companies kick-off proceedings on Wednesday…and we subsequently get 4 per cent of the S&P 500 market capitalization reporting this week.” Overseas, Tokyo’s Nikkei gained 0.7 per cent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dipped slightly and the Shanghai composite lost 0.5 per cent. In Europe, London’s FTSE 100 was up 0.1 per cent just after 5 a.m. (ET). Germany’s DAX and the Paris CAC 40 were down by between 0.1 and 0.5 per cent. Commodities Brent crude edged toward $56 (U.S.) Monday in the wake of a shutdown of Libya’s largest oilfield and continued concerns about the geopolitical situation in Syria. On Sunday, Libya’s Sharara was shut down after a group cut off a pipeline linking it to an oil terminal. U.S. crude edged above $52 in the early going. In Canada this week, the two-day Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers Scotiabank investment symposium kicks off in Toronto on Tuesday. Topics up for discussion include the future of Canada’s energy industry as the U.S. sector begins to increase production. In other commodities, gold steadied off a five-month high and silver slipped modestly after touching its highest level since late February on Friday. In London, copper prices slid as the U.S. dollar found support in expectations of future Federal Reserve tightening, although tight supply helped limit the declines. Currencies and bonds The Canadian dollar was little changed early Monday. Traders will be looking ahead to the Bank of Canada rate decision and release of the central bank’s latest monetary policy report. Although the Canadian economy has been showing signs of strength recently, there’s little expectation of a rate move. Economists will instead be looking for an indication of the weight given to recent reports suggesting the Canadian economy has found its footing. “For now, the odds are that the bank will continue to wax dovish to lean against potential (Canadian dollar) strength,” Bipan Rai, executive director of macro strategy at CIBC World Markets, said in a morning note. The U.S. dollar moved higher against world currencies after hawkish comments from New York Federal Reserve president William Dudley pointed to continued interest rate hikes. Fed chair Janet Yellen was also due to speak at the University of Michigan on Monday afternoon. Markets will be watching for any further hint on the timing and number of rate hikes for the rest of the year. Elsewhere, Reuters reports that France’s bond yield spread over Germany hit 72 basis points in early trading on Monday, its highest since Feb. 27 as investors worried about the rise of far-right candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon in the polls ahead of this month’s French presidential vote. Stocks set to see action Shares of Barclays Bank PLC could come under pressure on Monday on news regulators are investigating CEO Jes Staley and the bank over attempts to uncover the identity of the author of a letter in a whistleblowing incident. The bank says it has reprimanded Staley but will support his reappointment at the bank’s annual meeting in May. U.S. bank stocks may start to move as the start of earnings season kicks off this week. Citigroup Inc. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. are all set to report results on Thursday. On average, analysts expect the six biggest U.S. banks to see a profit increase of 4.7 per cent compared to the prior year, according to Reuters data. Wells Fargo shares were modestly higher in premarket trading following the release of a report on an internal investigation into abusive sales practices. The report laid a large part of the blame on former head of the retail division, Carrie Tolstedt and her team.

"March housing starts were at their highest level since September 2007, " CMHC's chief economist Bob Dugan said in the report. “Stronger residential construction at the national level is reflected by a rising trend in single-detached and multi-unit starts in Ontario and continued growth of new rental apartments in Quebec."

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Funds News | Thu Apr 13, 2017 | 7:04pm EDT WRAPUP 5-Loan growth stalls despite profit, trading gains at some U.S. banks By David Henry | NEW YORK, April 13 NEW YORK, April 13 Big U.S. banks revealed more evidence of a slowdown in loan growth in their earnings reports on Thursday, though executives assured there is still healthy demand from borrowers and no reason to worry about the state of the economy. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc posted higher first-quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations on large gains in trading revenue. Wells Fargo & Co, which relies more on traditional lending and less on markets-related businesses, reported a slight dip in profit due to a slowdown in mortgage banking. See Breakingviews column: The results underscored concerns expressed recently by analysts and investors that higher interest rates, combined with uncertainty about geopolitical events, could hurt economic growth - and therefore crimp lenders' bottom lines. But on conference calls to discuss results, top bank executives dismissed those concerns, citing strong demand from borrowers with impressive credit quality. "I wouldn't overreact to the short term in our loan growth with so many things that affect it," said JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. The bank's core loan portfolio averaged $812 billion during the first quarter, up 9 percent on an annualized basis. But that growth rate has ticked down from 12 percent in the previous quarter and 17 percent a year ago. Wells Fargo's annual loan growth rate of 4 percent has also been slowing over the past year. Citigroup's loan book has been skewed by divestitures and its acquisition of a credit-card portfolio. Adjusting for those matters, Citi's core loan book grew 5 percent in the first quarter, executives said. But management's outlook for loan growth has nonetheless been tempered. "There was probably just some modest reduction in our expectation for loan growth ... compared to the earlier guidance, certainly following the first-quarter performance," Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said. Across the banking industry, loans fell slightly during the first three months of the year, according to Federal Reserve data. John Conlon, chief equity strategist at People's United Wealth Management, who invests in bank stocks, said he is still concerned about loan growth after seeing the reports and listening to the executives' comments. "There's a great deal of optimism," Conlon said, "but there's still uncertainty." Wells Fargo's shares were down 2.6 percent at $51.75, while Citigroup's stock was down 0.7 percent at $58.12 and JPMorgan fell 0.6 percent to $84.88. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index fell 0.8 percent. The mortgage business is putting particular pressure on loan growth. The recent uptick in interest rates has crushed a wave of mortgage refinancing that kicked off in 2010, leading to big declines in mortgage banking revenue. Other areas of lending have also slowed. For instance, some big corporate borrowers have been opting to issue bonds rather than take out traditional loans, JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said. And, in areas where banks are finding growth, like credit-card lending, they are doling out fat rewards and cutting interest rates to lure customers from one another. Even so, bank executives sounded optimistic on Thursday about the outlook for lending. Higher rates allow banks to earn more money from the loans they make, as well as the idle cash they have invested in low-risk securities like Treasury bonds. JPMorgan expects to add another $400 million to its net interest income in the second quarter. That metric is important because it shows the difference between what banks pay for funds and what they earn from using them. Additionally, they said, signals that lawmakers and the White House want to spur the economy bode well for loan growth. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said first-quarter lending reflects some waiting by borrowers for Washington to act. "We haven't seen concrete changes yet in policies," Gerspach said. "When we get tax reform when the administration is successful in implementing some of what they have been talking about - hopefully that will spur the economy on."

If United is so hopeless, why has its stock tripled in 5 years? © Ron Antonelli/Bloomberg/Getty Images    Shares of Wall Street titan JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) are being unceremoniously dumped by investors on Thursday despite reporting better-than-expected quarterly results. After an initial early session surge to test resistance at the 20-day moving average, JPM stock has reversed lower and is in risk of breaking out of a three-month support range. Quotes in the article JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 84.40 -1.00 -1.17% If it does that, it would hit lows not seen since January.© Provided by InvestorPlace JPM stock chart view 1 JPM is falling further away from its 50-day moving average, marking the most significant pullback for the stock since early 2016. And it sets up a possible test of the 200-day MA, not touched since last summer, which would be worth a near 11% decline from here. First, the good news: JPMorgan reported earnings of $1.65 per share on revenues $25.6 billion vs. estimates of $1.51 and $24.6 billion respectively. Now, the bad news: Average core loans increased 9% over last year, missing estimates for 10% growth and fueling economy-wide concerns about slowing loan demand. As investors actually dug into the results from JPM’s competitors, more bad news emerged: Negatives like surging credit card charge-offs, lower mortgage originations, and tighter net interest margins. 7 High-Yield Stocks That Could Wreck Your Retirement In fact, Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) reported mortgage applications fell by 23% quarter-over-quarter to just $59 billion, below the nadir hit in 2014 to return to financial crisis lows. It also reported auto lending down $1.9 billion, personal loans and credit lines down $539 million, credit cards down $2 billion, and first mortgage loans down nearly a billion. You’ll be unsurprised to learn that WFC stock is off by a couple percentage points today. Edge Pro subscribers are preparing for further downside extension in bank stocks generally and JPM specifically with a new position in the April $84.50 JPM puts, which are trading near 60 cents.

Morgan Chase and Citigroup posted earnings well above expectations on Thursday, the two bank stocks joined Wells Fargo on its 2 percent slide lower following an earnings disappointment. J.P. Morgan closed over 1 percent lower, while Wells Fargo closed over 3 percent lower. Shares of Citigroup were down almost 1 percent at Thursday's close. Barclays managing director and senior equity analyst Jason Goldberg said on CNBC's Power Lunch Thursday that J.P. Morgan and Citi shares were negative because sentiment in the financial sector has started to run out of steam. "The agenda that the administration laid out that the group ran up on is just taking time to come to fruition," Goldberg said. Coupled with the slow political action, Goldberg said the interest rate environment is holding investors back, but "the rate hikes we've seen should actually be a bigger benefit in the next three quarters." If the Trump administration's deregulation and tax reform policies never get through, Goldberg said: "As long as the U.S. economy continues to expand we think [shareholder] downside is fairly limited."

REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Big U.S. banks revealed more evidence of a slowdown in loan growth in their earnings reports on Thursday, though executives assured there is still healthy demand from borrowers and no reason to worry about the state of the economy. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc posted higher first-quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations on large gains in trading revenue. Wells Fargo & Co , which relies more on traditional lending and less on markets-related businesses, reported a slight dip in profit due to a slowdown in mortgage banking. The results underscored concerns expressed recently by analysts and investors that higher interest rates, combined with uncertainty about geopolitical events, could hurt economic growth - and therefore crimp lenders' bottom lines. But on conference calls to discuss results, top bank executives dismissed those concerns, citing strong demand from borrowers with impressive credit quality. "I wouldn't overreact to the short term in our loan growth with so many things that affect it," said JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. The bank's core loan portfolio averaged US$812 billion during the first quarter, up 9 percent on an annualized basis. But that growth rate has ticked down from 12 percent in the previous quarter and 17 percent a year ago. Wells Fargo's annual loan growth rate of 4 percent has also been slowing over the past year. Citigroup's loan book has been skewed by divestitures and its acquisition of a credit-card portfolio. Adjusting for those matters, Citi's core loan book grew 5 percent in the first quarter, executives said. But management's outlook for loan growth has nonetheless been tempered. "There was probably just some modest reduction in our expectation for loan growth ... compared to the earlier guidance, certainly following the first-quarter performance," Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said. Across the banking industry, loans fell slightly during the first three months of the year, according to Federal Reserve data. John Conlon, chief equity strategist at People's United Wealth Management, who invests in bank stocks, said he is still concerned about loan growth after seeing the reports and listening to the executives' comments. "There's a great deal of optimism," Conlon said, "but there's still uncertainty." Wells Fargo's shares were down 2.6 percent at US$51.75, while Citigroup's stock was down 0.7 percent at US$58.12 and JPMorgan fell 0.6 percent to US$84.88. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index fell 0.8 percent. The mortgage business is putting particular pressure on loan growth. The recent uptick in interest rates has crushed a wave of mortgage refinancing that kicked off in 2010, leading to big declines in mortgage banking revenue. Other areas of lending have also slowed. For instance, some big corporate borrowers have been opting to issue bonds rather than take out traditional loans, JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said. And, in areas where banks are finding growth, like credit-card lending, they are doling out fat rewards and cutting interest rates to lure customers from one another. Even so, bank executives sounded optimistic on Thursday about the outlook for lending. Higher rates allow banks to earn more money from the loans they make, as well as the idle cash they have invested in low-risk securities like Treasury bonds. JPMorgan expects to add another US$400 million to its net interest income in the second quarter. That metric is important because it shows the difference between what banks pay for funds and what they earn from using them. Additionally, they said, signals that lawmakers and the White House want to spur the economy bode well for loan growth. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said first-quarter lending reflects some waiting by borrowers for Washington to act. "We haven't seen concrete changes yet in policies," Gerspach said. "When we get tax reform when the administration is successful in implementing some of what they have been talking about - hopefully that will spur the economy on."

With the drop on the day, the major averages added to the losses posted in the two previous sessions. The major averages saw further downside going into the close, ending the session at their worst levels of the day. The Dow slid 138.61 points or 0.7 percent to 20,435.25, the Nasdaq fell 31.01 points or 0.5 percent to 5,805.15 and the S&P 500 dropped 15.98 points or 0.7 percent to 2,328.95. The decreases on the day pulled the Dow and the S&P 500 down to their lowest closing levels in two months. For the holiday-shortened week, the Dow slumped by 1 percent, while the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 tumbled by 1.2 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. The lower close on Wall Street came following comments by President Donald Trump, who told the Wall Street Journal he thinks the U.S. dollar "is getting too strong." Trump also told the Journal he likes a low interest rate policy and noted he has not decided whether to reappoint Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. On the U.S. economic front, a report released by the Labor Department showed a modest decrease in producer prices in the month of March. The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand edged down by 0.1 percent in March after rising by 0.3 percent in February. Economists had expected prices to come in flat. The report also said core producer prices, which exclude food and energy prices, came in unchanged in March following a 0.3 percent increase in February. Core prices had been expected to rise by 0.2 percent. The Labor Department also released a report showing an unexpected drop in first-time claims for unemployment benefits in the week ended April 8th. The report said initial jobless claims dipped to 234,000, a decrease of 1,000 from the previous week's revised level of 235,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to rise to 245,000. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan released a report showing an unexpected improvement in consumer sentiment in the month of April. The report said the consumer sentiment index rose to 98.0 in April from 96.9 in March, while economists had expected the index to edge down to 96.6. Trading were also reacting to earnings news from financial giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). While JPMorgan and Citigroup both reported first quarter results that beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines, Wells Fargo reported better than expected first quarter earnings but on weaker than expected revenues. Sector News Energy stocks showed a significant move to the downside on the day even though the price of crude oil for May delivery inched up $0.07 to $53.18 a barrel. Reflecting the weakness in the energy sector, the Philadelphia Oil Service Index slumped by 2.5 percent, while the NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index tumbled by 2.1 percent and the NYSE Arca Oil & Gas Index fell by 1.7 percent. Considerable weakness was also visible among steel stocks, as reflected by the 2.3 percent drop by the NYSE Arca Steel Index. The index slid to its lowest closing level in almost five months. Banking, transportation, and chemical stocks also moved to the downside on the day, while notable strength was visible among biotechnology stocks. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly lower during trading on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slid by 0.7 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index edged down by 0.2 percent. The major European markets also moved to the downside on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index fell by 0.6 percent, the German DAX Index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index dipped by 0.4 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries showed a strong upward move after ending the previous session roughly flat. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, slid by 6.4 basis points to 2.232 percent. Looking Ahead Following the holiday weekend, next week's trading may be impacted by reaction to reports on retail sales and consumer prices due to be released while the markets are closed on Friday. Reports on housing starts, industrial production, regional manufacturing activity and existing home sales may also attract attention. The earnings season also picks up steam next week, with Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), IBM (IBM), Yahoo (YHOO), Morgan Stanley (MS), American Express (AXP), and General Electric (GE) among the companies due to report their quarterly results. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Unhappy Campers: The 10 Most Miserable Nations on Earth Feeling Groovy: The 10 Countries With the Best Health Care The Ten Largest Economies In Africa Next Story More Top Stories China GDP Growth Likely To Stabilize In Q1 House Democrats Call For Suspension Of Jared Kushner's Security Clearance Samsung Reportedly Working On Foldable Phone Choppy Trading Remains Visible On Wall Street - U.S. Commentary Analyst Speculates About Apple/Disney Merger Trump Says NATO "No Longer Obsolete" Company Spotlight: Incyte Stocks Showing A Lack Of Direction In Morning Trading - U.S. Commentary U.S. Consumer Sentiment Unexpectedly Improves In April U.S. Producer Prices Unexpectedly Dip 0.1% In March U.S. Weekly Jobless Claims Unexpectedly Edge Down To 234,000 Stocks May See Further Downside In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Wells Fargo Q1 Profit Tops View, But Revenue Misses Citigroup Q1 Profit Up 17%, Results Beat View JPMorgan Q1 Results Top Estimates <<Previous        72 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Wells Fargo Q1 Profit Tops View, But Revenue Misses Citigroup Q1 Profit Up 17%, Results Beat View JPMorgan Q1 Results Top Estimates Microsoft Hardware Event On May 2, But No Surface Phone Cathay Pacific CEO Ivan Chu To Step Down After First Loss In 8 Years Food Delivery Robots Debut In San Francisco Lawsuit Claims CEO Said App 'Only For Rich People' Uber PR Head Leaving Vodafone Scraps Roaming Charges In 40 Countries Google Details Pay Methodology To Answer Charges Of Gender Discrimination United Airlines CEO Says Deplaned Passenger Was "disruptive And Belligerent" FCC Looks To Keep In-Flight Call Ban Gainers & Losers Of Apr.12: ADPT, NBIX, NOVN, PLX, ALBO...

After an initial early session surge to test resistance at the 20-day moving average, JPM stock has reversed lower and is in risk of breaking out of a three-month support range. If it does that, it would hit lows not seen since January. JPM is falling further away from its 50-day moving average, marking the most significant pullback for the stock since early 2016. And it sets up a possible test of the 200-day MA, not touched since last summer, which would be worth a near 11% decline from here. First, the good news: JPMorgan reported earnings of $1.65 per share on revenues $25.6 billion vs. estimates of $1.51 and $24.6 billion respectively. Now, the bad news: Average core loans increased 9% over last year, missing estimates for 10% growth and fueling economy-wide concerns about slowing loan demand. As investors actually dug into the results from JPM’s competitors, more bad news emerged: Negatives like surging credit card charge-offs, lower mortgage originations, and tighter net interest margins. In fact, Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) reported mortgage applications fell by 23% quarter-over-quarter to just $59 billion, below the nadir hit in 2014 to return to financial crisis lows. It also reported auto lending down $1.9 billion, personal loans and credit lines down $539 million, credit cards down $2 billion, and first mortgage loans down nearly a billion. You’ll be unsurprised to learn that WFC stock is off by a couple percentage points today. Edge Pro subscribers are preparing for further downside extension in bank stocks generally and JPM specifically with a new position in the April $84.50 JPM puts, which are trading near 60 cents.

Photograph: iStock         JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest US bank by assets, reported a 16.8 per cent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday as the bank made more loans and racked up additional revenue from increased trading. The bank’s net income rose to $6.45 billion (€6bn) in the first quarter ended March 31st from $5.52 billion (€4.9bn) a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to $1.65 from $1.35. Jonathan Sugarman: Ireland has destroyed the lives of whistleblowers Irish Nationwide mortgage holders to lose on tracker refund Central Bank finds weak regulatory controls at some IFSC banks Analysts had expected earnings of $1.52 per share, according to Thomson Reuters. It was not immediately clear if the reported results were comparable. Trading increased across Wall Street over the past year as investors changed their positions around the Brexit vote, the US elections and the Federal Reserve’s hikes in interest rates. Customers also borrowed more as the economy expanded, though the pace of loan growth has slackened somewhat recently.

Continue Reading Below Shares of the nation’s biggest bank by assets rallied more than 1%, before falling back with the broader market, after the company reported a 17% jump in net income to $6.45 billion from a year ago with earnings per share up 22% to $1.65 – topping Wall Street expectations for $1.52 a share. Revenue rose 6% during the first three months of the year to $25.57 billion, easily topping forecasts for $24.88 billion. CEO Jamie Dimon, in a statement, said the company was “off to a good start” for the year as momentum in all of the bank’s businesses built on gains made in 2016. “U.S. consumers and businesses are healthy overall and with pro-growth initiatives and improving collaboration between government and business, the U.S. economy can continue to improve,” he said, pointing to growth in consumer loans and card sales volume. Recent figures on the health of the U.S. economy – including a preliminary reading Thursday on April’s consumer sentiment gauge from the University of Michigan, which rose further from a lofty reading in March, show Americans remain confident about their economic prospects. Indeed, the bank saw an 11% rise in average core loans and a 15% jump in credit card sales volume as consumers felt optimistic about taking on new debt.  Though confidence levels remain high, traditional retail players like Macy’s (M), Sears (SHLD), Ralph Lauren (RL) and a host of others, continue to suffer from changing shopping habits as consumers gravitate to e-commerce platforms rather than bricks-and-mortar stores to make purchases. Both Dimon and JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, though, downplayed the chances that those habits could spill over and meaningfully hurt the bank’s business. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Lake likened the switch in shopping preferences to the transition consumers made several years ago to online banking, which sparked a move by many of the biggest banks to slim down their bricks-and-mortar banking business portfolios. “The way consumers engage with retailers is changing. It doesn’t mean they’ll stop engaging with retailers. It will be very specific with respect to location and tenant and it doesn’t mean retail will be in as much potential trouble as people are talking about,” she said during a conference call following the release of the bank’s quarterly results, reiterating that while JPM is watching the tumult in the industry carefully, it remains “cautiously optimistic.”  To that end, Dimon said the retail business has always been “violent and volatile” with individual players in the industry coming and going depending on fickle consumer preferences. He said, however, JPM is “very careful” with its exposure, and he expects the bank to weather the storm in retail the way it navigated the plunge in oil prices back in 2014. “It won’t be a big deal,” he said.  He added that despite recent setbacks within the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s administration, the commander-in-chief’s pro-growth agenda of tax reform, infrastructure investment and regulatory reform would benefit not just Wall Street, but all Americans. “You all should expect as a given that when you have a new president and they get going, the nine months after the 100 days is going to be a sausage-making period,” Dimon said. “There will be ups and downs, wins and losses.” Helping JPMorgan’s first-quarter results was a jump in market activity in the months since the November election as investors have remained optimistic about Trump’s fiscal policy agenda. Trading revenue at the bank jumped 13%, helped by a 17% rise in the fixed-income trading.   Related Content Walmart Extends Online Discounts, Cuts More Jobs Amid Pricing War with Amazon An Activist at the Whole Foods Table: What it Means for WFM's Turnaround Chances As Traditional Retail Struggles, Wall Street Cheers Canada Goose's Prospects Retail Socks March Job Gains, Jobless Rate Drops to ’07 Low Neiman Marcus Sees Experiences, Tech as Way Forward Amid Retail Slowdown Ralph Lauren to Cut Jobs, Shutter 5th Avenue Polo Store in NYC What do you think?

U.S. mega-banks are all dressed up with few places to grow. Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo kicked off the year with results that exceeded expectations. Some of the investor exuberance over possible tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks has abated, however. Loan growth is slowing and credit costs may soon rise. Valuations have further to fall. First-quarter earnings on Thursday helped justify some of the momentum. JPMorgan generated annualized return on equity of 11 percent and Wells Fargo's clocked in at 11.5 percent. That's at the top end of what they have been delivering for a couple years. There's little evidence yet of any Donald Trump or Janet Yellen effect. Both lenders, along with Citigroup which also reported profit that beat consensus estimates, unveiled yet another decline in how much money it projects losing because of borrowers not being able to pay. These credit costs are now exceptionally low and will, as JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon puts it, soon "normalize."

JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc posted higher first-quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations on large gains in trading revenue. Wells Fargo & Co , which relies more on traditional lending and less on markets-related businesses, reported a slight dip in profit due to a slowdown in mortgage banking. See Breakingviews column: The results underscored concerns expressed recently by analysts and investors that higher interest rates, combined with uncertainty about geopolitical events, could hurt economic growth - and therefore crimp lenders' bottom lines. But on conference calls to discuss results, top bank executives dismissed those concerns, citing strong demand from borrowers with impressive credit quality. "I wouldn't overreact to the short term in our loan growth with so many things that affect it," said JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. The bank's core loan portfolio averaged $812 billion during the first quarter, up 9 percent on an annualised basis. But that growth rate has ticked down from 12 percent in the previous quarter and 17 percent a year ago. Wells Fargo's annual loan growth rate of 4 percent has also been slowing over the past year. Citigroup's loan book has been skewed by divestitures and its acquisition of a credit-card portfolio. Adjusting for those matters, Citi's core loan book grew 5 percent in the first quarter, executives said. But management's outlook for loan growth has nonetheless been tempered. "There was probably just some modest reduction in our expectation for loan growth ... compared to the earlier guidance, certainly following the first-quarter performance," Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said. Across the banking industry, loans fell slightly during the first three months of the year, according to Federal Reserve data. John Conlon, chief equity strategist at People's United Wealth Management, who invests in bank stocks, said he is still concerned about loan growth after seeing the reports and listening to the executives' comments. "There's a great deal of optimism," Conlon said, "but there's still uncertainty." Wells Fargo's shares were down 2.6 percent at $51.75, while Citigroup's stock was down 0.7 percent at $58.12 and JPMorgan fell 0.6 percent to $84.88. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index <.BKX> fell 0.8 percent. The mortgage business is putting particular pressure on loan growth. The recent uptick in interest rates has crushed a wave of mortgage refinancing that kicked off in 2010, leading to big declines in mortgage banking revenue. Other areas of lending have also slowed. For instance, some big corporate borrowers have been opting to issue bonds rather than take out traditional loans, JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said. And, in areas where banks are finding growth, like credit-card lending, they are doling out fat rewards and cutting interest rates to lure customers from one another. Even so, bank executives sounded optimistic on Thursday about the outlook for lending. Higher rates allow banks to earn more money from the loans they make, as well as the idle cash they have invested in low-risk securities like Treasury bonds. JPMorgan expects to add another $400 million to its net interest income in the second quarter. That metric is important because it shows the difference between what banks pay for funds and what they earn from using them. Additionally, they said, signals that lawmakers and the White House want to spur the economy bode well for loan growth. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said first-quarter lending reflects some waiting by borrowers for Washington to act. "We haven't seen concrete changes yet in policies," Gerspach said. "When we get tax reform [and] when the administration is successful in implementing some of what they have been talking about - hopefully that will spur the economy on."

Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), which relies more on traditional lending and less on markets-related businesses, reported a slight dip in profit due to a slowdown in mortgage banking. See Breakingviews column: The results underscored concerns expressed recently by analysts and investors that higher interest rates, combined with uncertainty about geopolitical events, could hurt economic growth - and therefore crimp lenders' bottom lines.But on conference calls to discuss results, top bank executives dismissed those concerns, citing strong demand from borrowers with impressive credit quality."I wouldn't overreact to the short term in our loan growth with so many things that affect it," said JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.The bank's core loan portfolio averaged $812 billion during the first quarter, up 9 percent on an annualised basis. But that growth rate has ticked down from 12 percent in the previous quarter and 17 percent a year ago. Wells Fargo's annual loan growth rate of 4 percent has also been slowing over the past year.Citigroup's loan book has been skewed by divestitures and its acquisition of a credit-card portfolio. Adjusting for those matters, Citi's core loan book grew 5 percent in the first quarter, executives said. But management's outlook for loan growth has nonetheless been tempered. "There was probably just some modest reduction in our expectation for loan growth ... compared to the earlier guidance, certainly following the first-quarter performance," Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said.Across the banking industry, loans fell slightly during the first three months of the year, according to Federal Reserve data.John Conlon, chief equity strategist at People's United Wealth Management, who invests in bank stocks, said he is still concerned about loan growth after seeing the reports and listening to the executives' comments. "There's a great deal of optimism," Conlon said, "but there's still uncertainty." Wells Fargo's shares were down 2.6 percent at $51.75, while Citigroup's stock was down 0.7 percent at $58.12 and JPMorgan fell 0.6 percent to $84.88. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index .BKX fell 0.8 percent. The mortgage business is putting particular pressure on loan growth. The recent uptick in interest rates has crushed a wave of mortgage refinancing that kicked off in 2010, leading to big declines in mortgage banking revenue.Other areas of lending have also slowed. For instance, some big corporate borrowers have been opting to issue bonds rather than take out traditional loans, JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said. And, in areas where banks are finding growth, like credit-card lending, they are doling out fat rewards and cutting interest rates to lure customers from one another.Even so, bank executives sounded optimistic on Thursday about the outlook for lending.Higher rates allow banks to earn more money from the loans they make, as well as the idle cash they have invested in low-risk securities like Treasury bonds. JPMorgan expects to add another $400 million to its net interest income in the second quarter. That metric is important because it shows the difference between what banks pay for funds and what they earn from using them.Additionally, they said, signals that lawmakers and the White House want to spur the economy bode well for loan growth. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said first-quarter lending reflects some waiting by borrowers for Washington to act."We haven't seen concrete changes yet in policies," Gerspach said. "When we get tax reform [and] when the administration is successful in implementing some of what they have been talking about - hopefully that will spur the economy on."

 STOCKS FALL: Here's what you need to know Elena Holodny Apr. 13, 2017, 4:00 PM 2,022 facebook linkedin twitter email print Markets Insider Stocks fell on Thursday amid reports the US bombed an ISIS target in Afghanistan. All three major indices finished down in the red by the end of the day. First up, the scoreboard: Dow: 20,453.25, -138.61, (-0.67%) S&P 500: 2,328.95, -15.98, (-0.68%) Nasdaq: 5,805.15, -31.01, (-0.53%) US 10-year yield: 2.232%, -0.064 WTI crude oil: $53.13, +0.02, +0.04% 1. Consumers have not been this bullish about the US economy since 2000. The preliminary results of the University of Michigan's April survey showed that overall consumer sentiment index jumped to 98 from 96.9 in March, while the current economic conditions index rose to 115.2 — a 17-year high. 2. COOPERMAN'S OMEGA: "There is a sizable risk" to the stock market. The failure to pass the American Health Care Act on the first attempt puts the administration's ability to pass corporate tax reform in doubt, Omega founder Lee Cooperman and vice chairman Steve Einhorn wrote in a letter last week to investors. That represents a risk, as strategists have assumed reform is coming in their S&P 500 earnings models, Cooperman and Einhorn said. 3. JPMorgan beat, and its investment bank had a record quarter. JPMorgan reported first-quarter net income of $6.4 billion, or $1.65 a share. The performance was driven by strong gains in corporate and investment banking and commercial banking, with both posting record income. Consumer and community banking profits dropped.  4. Wells Fargo beat on earnings, but missed slightly on revenue. The bank reported earnings of $1.oo per share, higher than the $0.97 that analysts were expecting. Additionally, the bank said it generated revenue of $22.0 billion, just below analysts' projections of $22.3 billion. 5. Jamie Dimon said something shameful is going on with the mortgage market. His comments were based on a March 31 report from JPMorgan's fixed-income strategy team saying "under an early 2000s lending regime, another $500bn of new purchase loans could have been extended in 2016." He said: "If that number is right, shame on us" for not doing something about it. 6. Tesla spiked after Elon Musk tweeted a semi-truck is coming. Shares rose by about 2% in the afternoon. Tesla has been on a roll lately, touching an all-time high of $313.73 on April 10, briefly becoming the most valuable car company in America. 7. Snap slid below $20 after Instragram's Snapchat clone said it has more users. The Facebook-owned Instagram announced on Thursday that Stories has more than 200 million daily users, ahead of the 161 million reported by Snapchat.    8. Initial jobless claims fell. Claims, which count the number of people who applied for unemployment insurance for the first time in the past week, fell to 234,00 from an upwardly revised 235,000. ADDITIONALLY: Trump's Wall Street faction is starting to win him over. Wall Street legend Howard Marks said one phone call changed his life and shaped how he invests. Why the dollar could defy Trump and keep marching higher. Wall Street analysts might as well "pick a number on the roulette wheel" for their year-end stock targets. Why the Bank of Canada won't do the most obvious thing it can to pop the housing bubble. Brooklyn homes continue to sell like hotcakes. Bond traders are crushing it.

JPMorgan Chase's strong first-quarter numbers put CEO Jamie Dimon in a good mood on Thursday. But the air almost went out of the room on the bank's earnings conference call when the CEO, whose overseen a double in JPMorgan's stock price over the last five years, joked about joining the Trump administration. When asked by Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Burnell during a conference call about the number of open positions inside the White House, specifically those relevant to regulating banks, Dimon interrupted: "I said I'm not interested." Dimon's name was thrown around for a White House position, including Treasury secretary, following President Donald Trump's presidential victory. "I'm kidding," Dimon added. show chapters Dimon: Dollar fluctuates for many reasons    18 Hours Ago | 02:38 The Trump administration has struggled to fill a number of key positions, including Labor secretary. Andrew Puzder, Trump's first nominee for the post, withdrew from consideration in late January. Current nominee Alexander Acosta's vote was still pending as of Thursday. But Dimon didn't sound worried at all, reiterating his faith in Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Trump Chief Economic Adviser Gary Cohn, both Goldman Sachs alums. "They want to find the right people for those jobs," Dimon said. "I gather they are talking to lots of people. But even after they announced it, remember they need to be vetted and confirmed, and that ... can take 90 days. So the sooner the better, but I think getting the right people is equally important." Dimon did get serious at one point during the call, saying current regulations are crippling many consumers' ability to achieve the American dream and take out a mortgage, a problem he thinks needs addressing. "I could care less [if] banks, the nonbanks do it," he said. "My point about that was how it's hurting the growth of America."

JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> and Citigroup Inc <C.N> posted higher first-quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations on large gains in trading revenue. Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N>, which relies more on traditional lending and less on markets-related businesses, reported a slight dip in profit due to a slowdown in mortgage banking. The results underscored concerns expressed recently by analysts and investors that higher interest rates, combined with uncertainty about geopolitical events, could hurt economic growth - and therefore crimp lenders' bottom lines. But on conference calls to discuss results, top bank executives dismissed those concerns, citing strong demand from borrowers with impressive credit quality. "I wouldn't overreact to the short term in our loan growth with so many things that affect it," said JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. The bank's core loan portfolio averaged $812 billion during the first quarter, up 9 percent on an annualized basis. But that growth rate has ticked down from 12 percent in the previous quarter and 17 percent a year ago. Wells Fargo's annual loan growth rate of 4 percent has also been slowing over the past year. Citigroup's loan book has been skewed by divestitures and its acquisition of a credit-card portfolio. Adjusting for those matters, Citi's core loan book grew 5 percent in the first quarter, executives said. But management's outlook for loan growth has nonetheless been tempered. "There was probably just some modest reduction in our expectation for loan growth ... compared to the earlier guidance, certainly following the first-quarter performance," Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said. Across the banking industry, loans fell slightly during the first three months of the year, according to Federal Reserve data. John Conlon, chief equity strategist at People's United Wealth Management, who invests in bank stocks, said he is still concerned about loan growth after seeing the reports and listening to the executives' comments. "There's a great deal of optimism," Conlon said, "but there's still uncertainty." Wells Fargo's shares were down 2.6 percent at $51.75, while Citigroup's stock was down 0.7 percent at $58.12 and JPMorgan fell 0.6 percent to $84.88. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index <.BKX> fell 0.8 percent. The mortgage business is putting particular pressure on loan growth. The recent uptick in interest rates has crushed a wave of mortgage refinancing that kicked off in 2010, leading to big declines in mortgage banking revenue. Other areas of lending have also slowed. For instance, some big corporate borrowers have been opting to issue bonds rather than take out traditional loans, JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said. And, in areas where banks are finding growth, like credit-card lending, they are doling out fat rewards and cutting interest rates to lure customers from one another. Even so, bank executives sounded optimistic on Thursday about the outlook for lending. Higher rates allow banks to earn more money from the loans they make, as well as the idle cash they have invested in low-risk securities like Treasury bonds. JPMorgan expects to add another $400 million to its net interest income in the second quarter. That metric is important because it shows the difference between what banks pay for funds and what they earn from using them. Additionally, they said, signals that lawmakers and the White House want to spur the economy bode well for loan growth. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said first-quarter lending reflects some waiting by borrowers for Washington to act. "We haven't seen concrete changes yet in policies," Gerspach said. "When we get tax reform [and] when the administration is successful in implementing some of what they have been talking about - hopefully that will spur the economy on."

By AndreaRiquier Corrects story to reflect that Quicken Loans was threatened with a fine. Getty Images Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, -1.17%   on Thursday reported earnings and revenue that beat expectations, with trading and investment banking revenues contributing the most during the quarter. But the company’s CEO used his annual letter to push for a different business line, one which has fizzled in recent years. “It is no surprise the financial crisis, which was caused in part by poor mortgage lending practices and which caused so much pain for American families and businesses, led to new regulations and enhanced supervision,” Jamie Dimon wrote. “We needed to create a safer and better functioning mortgage industry. However, our housing sector has been unusually slow to recover, and that may be partly due to restrictions in mortgage credit.” Dimon then devoted about 1,400 words to a discussion about the regulations put in place since the subprime crisis. An overly onerous regulatory burden, he argued, has reduced mortgage lending by about $300 billion annually — or the equivalent of about 3 million home loans since the crisis. “Our economists think that $1 trillion of loans could have increased GDP, in each of those five years, by 0.5 [percentage points],” he wrote. Dimon is especially critical of the Federal Housing Administration, the government mortgage-buying agency that stepped up in the depths of the crisis when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were still on their knees. The FHA has drawn fire because of its aggressive use of the False Claims Act, legislation that was intended to protect the government from fraud, but which many industry participants say has been used to wring money from banks. That’s caused banks to flee from FHA lending, leaving “non-banks” as its primary lenders. And even some non-banks aren’t happy with the situation: Quicken Loans sued the government after being threatened with a fine. Also read: An old fear returns as new mortgage market players rise “A first step to increasing participation in the FHA program could be the communication of support for only using the FCA, as originally intended, to penalize intentional fraud rather than immaterial or unintentional errors,” Dimon wrote. He also calls for uniform standards for servicing mortgages, noting that “new mortgage rules and regulations total more than 14,000 pages and stand about six feet tall.” Treasury could take the lead on this effort, Dimon writes, as it did when it developed initiatives to help homeowners in distress. In particular, he notes the enormous costs associated with servicing a troubled mortgage: $2,386, or more than 13 times the $181 it costs to service a healthy loan, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data. That’s keeping all lenders from extending credit to borrowers who don’t have pristine credit histories. Wells Fargo WFC, -3.33%   and Citi C, -0.80%  , both of which also announced earnings Thursday, said their mortgage servicing businesses declined 46% and 64% compared to a year ago, respectively. At J.P. Morgan, it’s up 7% compared to the same period a year ago, however. Dimon’s proposals aren’t new, though it may be the first time someone of his stature has taken such a formal opportunity to argue for them. But it’s worth pointing out a few other post-crisis developments which may also be keeping a lid on mortgage lending: skittishness about homeownership, pricey rents that make it hard to save up a down payment, scant inventory that’s pushing home prices higher, and more.

Pedestrians walk under signage at a Citigroup Inc. bank branch in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Friday, Jan. 13, 2017. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Citigroup's March-end quarter profits walloped expectations. The New York bank's quarterly profit jumped to $4.1 billion from $3.5 billion in the same period a year ago, above forecasts of $3.48 billion. Earnings per share came in at $1.35 from $1.10 a year earlier. Analysts expected $1.23. Strong results were driven by trading and banking. Fixed income trading rose 18% as interest-rate products, bonds, and loans saw more activity. However, the bank's loan book only grew 2% to $629 billion. Net interest revenue dropped 3% to $10.9 billion, which the bank said reflected more companies wanting to hold assets in cash. "The momentum we saw across many of our businesses towards the end of last year carried into the first quarter, resulting in significant better overall performance than a year ago," said Citi CEO Michael Corbat in a statement. Citigroup shares spiked on earnings news, but have fallen 0.14% to about $58.43 on Thursday. Sandler O'Neill + Partners' Jeffery Harte, who has a $68 price target on the stock, explains: Credit metrics remained strong. Management under-provided by $77M ($0.02ps benefit) and NPLs declined by 5% Q/Q. NCOs of $1.7B increased 1% Q/Q which was 5% above our forecast. Solid, yet unspectacular results. Positives include capital markets related revenues, modestly better than expected loan growth and continued expense discipline. The outlook for NII will be a key topic for management to address on the call given the above mentioned NIM contraction. The earnings call is still in progress but CFO John Gerspach said: I would say that for the core book, we would expect NIM to be may be up slightly year-over-year and on hedging that, only because we have seen a lot of growth in the cash balances, you can see in that cash is almost 10% of our balance sheet at this point in time.

Dimon has been a vocal proponent of Trump’s agenda to boost infrastructure spending, curtail banking regulations and cut corporate taxes — all three of which he’s said would be “good for Americans.” Later in the call, Dimon got testy after an analyst asked about the bank’s exposure to the crumbling brick-and-mortar retail business sector. “You’re way out of line here,” Dimon told Glenn Schorr, analyst at Evercore ISI. While Dimon acknowledged the company has exposure to the declining fortunes of retail companies and their real estate, he said the bank has been preparing for it and “it won’t be a big deal.” “The retail business has always bene violent and volatile. You can look back in history and half are gone after 10 years,” he added. The comments came after JPMorgan reported a 17 percent rise in profit for its first quarter, driven primarily by more trading. The Wall Street bank made $6.45 billion in profit from January to March, or $1.65 a share. That was better than the $1.52 a share that analysts had predicted. JPMorgan shares rose 0.4 percent to $85.71 in mid-day trades Thursday. Trump’s legislative agenda was upended last month after Republicans failed to pass a replacement for Obamacare. The President has said that he will make substantial cuts to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulatory bill, which was passed in the wake of the financial crisis.

The major averages are posting modest gains in mid-day trading after closing lower in the two previous sessions. Currently, the Dow is up 2.97 points or less than a tenth of a percent at 20,594.83, the Nasdaq is up 11.63 points or 0.2 percent at 5,847.79 and the S&P 500 is up 1.39 points or 0.1 percent at 2,346.32. The choppy trading on Wall Street comes as traders digest comments by President Donald Trump, who told the Wall Street Journal said he thinks the U.S. dollar "is getting too strong." Trump also told the Journal he likes a low interest rate policy and noted he has not decided whether to reappoint Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. On the U.S. economic front, a report released by the Labor Department showed a modest decrease in producer prices in the month of March. The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand edged down by 0.1 percent in March after rising by 0.3 percent in February. Economists had expected prices to come in flat. The report also said core producer prices, which exclude food and energy prices, came in unchanged in March following a 0.3 percent increase in February. Core prices had been expected to rise by 0.2 percent. The Labor Department also released a report showing an unexpected drop in first-time claims for unemployment benefits in the week ended April 8th. The report said initial jobless claims dipped to 234,000, a decrease of 1,000 from the previous week's revised level of 235,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to rise to 245,000. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan released a report showing an unexpected improvement in consumer sentiment in the month of April. The report said the consumer sentiment index rose to 98.0 in April from 96.9 in March, while economists had expected the index to edge down to 96.6. Trading are also digesting earnings news from financial giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). While JPMorgan and Citigroup are both moving higher after reporting first quarter results that beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines, Wells Fargo has moved lower after reporting better than expected first quarter earnings but on weaker than expected revenues. Sector News Most of the major sectors are showing only modest moves on the day, although considerable strength is visible among biotechnology stocks. Reflecting the strength in the biotech sector, the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index is up by 1.4 percent. Immunogen (IMGN) and Verastem (VSTM) are turning in two of the biotech sector's best performances in mid-day trading. On the other hand, oil service stocks have come under pressure, dragging the Philadelphia Oil Service Index down by 1.4 percent. The weakness in the sector comes amid a modest decrease by the price of crude oil. Significant weakness is also visible among steel stocks, as reflected by the 1.1 percent drop by the NYSE Arca Steel Index. The index has fallen to its lowest intraday level in well over four months. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly lower during trading on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slid by 0.7 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index edged down by 0.2 percent. The major European markets also moved to the downside on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index fell by 0.6 percent, the German DAX Index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index dipped by 0.4 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries have pulled back off their early highs but continue to see notable strength. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by 4.1 basis points at 2.255 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Unhappy Campers: The 10 Most Miserable Nations on Earth Feeling Groovy: The 10 Countries With the Best Health Care The Ten Largest Economies In Africa Previous Story Next Story More Commentary -Global China Shares Figure To Remain Rangebound Taiwan Stock Market May See Renewed Consolidation Malaysia Bourse May Extend Thursday's Losses Rally May Stall For South Korea Stock Market Major Averages Close Lower For Third Consecutive Session - U.S. Commentary European Markets Pull Back Ahead Of Easter Holiday Stocks Showing A Lack Of Direction In Morning Trading - U.S. Commentary Stocks May See Further Downside In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Sensex Drops 182 Points On Weak Macro Data; Nifty Ends At 9150 Wall Street May See Cautious Start; Bank Earnings Hold Key European Shares Retreat On Trump Talk Asian Shares Mixed After Trump Comments European Shares Poised For Weak Start As Trump Talks Down Dollar Sensex, Nifty Drop In Early Trade; Rupee Rises Sensex, Nifty Seen Lower After Weak Data <<Previous        56 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Wells Fargo Q1 Profit Tops View, But Revenue Misses Citigroup Q1 Profit Up 17%, Results Beat View JPMorgan Q1 Results Top Estimates Microsoft Hardware Event On May 2, But No Surface Phone Cathay Pacific CEO Ivan Chu To Step Down After First Loss In 8 Years Food Delivery Robots Debut In San Francisco Lawsuit Claims CEO Said App 'Only For Rich People' Uber PR Head Leaving Vodafone Scraps Roaming Charges In 40 Countries Google Details Pay Methodology To Answer Charges Of Gender Discrimination United Airlines CEO Says Deplaned Passenger Was "disruptive And Belligerent" FCC Looks To Keep In-Flight Call Ban Gainers & Losers Of Apr.12: ADPT, NBIX, NOVN, PLX, ALBO...

JPMorgan Chase & Co's retail brokerage arm, JPMorgan Securities, has hired a team of advisers from its bigger wealth management rival Morgan Stanley, where the team managed $1 billion in client assets, the bank said late Wednesday. Twin brothers Jay and Neil Canell, along with Justin Dembo joined JPMorgan in New York City, where they will operate under the name the Canell Group. Morgan Stanley is the largest U.S. securities brokerage by sales force with more than 15,700 advisors. JPMorgan Securities has roughly 420 financial advisers who manage $110 billion in client assets, according to the firm. JPMorgan Securities went through a leadership shakeup last month when Chris Harvey was named the new chief executive. His predecessor Greg Quental will retire at the end of the year. Quental had led the boutique wealth management firm since joining from Bear Stearns in August 2010. Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Christine Jockle confirmed that the advisers had left but declined to comment beyond that. Neil Canell said his group was drawn to JPMorgan's banking services, like mortgages and customizable loans, which are useful for their high net worth client families. "We believe that we will be able to make their experience just as personal as it has always been, but now with greater speed, better tools and platforms as well as more bank offerings," Canell said in an email.

Follow @GillianTan Facebook Twitter Email Print Share April 13, 2017 11:48 AM EDT JPMORGAN CHASE & CO -1.00 At Closing, April 13th 84.40 USD WELLS FARGO & CO -1.77 At Closing, April 13th 51.35 USD Bank investors can breathe a sigh of relief. Three of the biggest banks in the U.S. reported first-quarter results on Thursday, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. posting respectable numbers and Wells Fargo & Co. paling slightly by comparison. While none pulled an alarm bell, they were clear there is still some uncertainty about public policy despite confidence in the economy. Fixed-income trading revenue shined (as it has in recent quarters) once again, and consumer lending continued to show small signs of weakness. But perhaps more notable is the fact that at least one key executive allayed fears about the potential re-introduction of the Glass-Steagall Act, which would require banks to separate their consumer and investment banking arms. JPMorgan, the nation's biggest lender by market value and likely the most vulnerable to such re-regulation, is simply shrugging off its feasibility. My take on comments from Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake is that she isn't losing sleep over it, despite calls in Washington for its return. "The diversification of our business has been and was a source of strength not just for us but also for financial markets during the crisis," she argued on the bank's conference call with analysts, adding that such a move doesn't feel consistent with other objectives of the Trump administration, including its pro-growth agenda and calls for a "level playing field."  By the Numbers Three of the U.S.'s biggest lenders reported first-quarter results on Thursday and beat consensus analyst expectations for the most part Source: Company reports, Bloomberg Even if "re-regulation," deregulation or tax reform, or all three, don't materialize, banks are living up to the belief that they'll be able to thrive in a healthier economic environment. (This even goes for Wells Fargo, despite its struggles to attract new retail customers in the wake of its fake-accounts scandal that has led to higher-than-forecast expenses.)   Slow Grind The average profitability of U.S. banks is climbing toward pre-crisis levels but is expected to remain below the 20-year average of less than 17% in the near term Source: Bloomberg Intelligence And although JPMorgan's net charge-offs, which reflect loans on which a lender doesn't expect to collect, climbed to 0.79 percent, in part because of a write-down in student loans and its growing credit-card business, it's still at an extremely benign level when compared with historical averages. The same goes for Wells Fargo at 0.34 percent and Citi at 1.58 percent. No Sweat, Yet First-quarter results reiterate that credit quality remains relatively high, though this is expected to turn in a cycle Source: Bernstein *Bernstein estimates reflecet a mix of commercial & industrial, commercial real estate, mortgage, card and other loans All three lenders also reported a slight uptick in their core Tier 1 equity ratios, giving them each a stronger case to seek approval from bank regulators to return additional capital to shareholders, a move that would buoy their respective share prices.  Buybacks and Dividends Ahead? The three banks that reported Thursday have ample excess capital. If they're permitted to give more of this to shareholders, returns will improve Source: Company reports *Includes buffer above regulatory minimum Their results not only bode well for Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which report next week, but provide comfort that bank stocks aren't overheated. With future interest rate increases already priced in and policy changes still very much unknown, investors should take a minute before sending them on another tear.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. Also, the fact that Wells Fargo's CEO Tim Sloan admitted that he sometimes spends 100 percent of his day dealing with the fallout of the sales scandal is ... not ideal.

Find him on Twitter: @dhwebber1. Corporate lobbyists at the Business Roundtable — led by JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon — are heralding an effort to sharply limit the ability of investors to have a say in their companies through shareholder proposals. If successful, it will reduce stockholders’ ability to shape the companies they own and hold corporate managers accountable. As with political voting rights, these corporate voter-suppression efforts demonstrate that even the most basic rights need constant vigilance to protect them. Shareholder proposals — governed by the Securities and Exchange Commission — allow shareholders to suggest ideas to be voted on by their peers at the annual meeting. As with voter-suppression tactics generally, the Business Roundtable would not eliminate shareholder proposal rights. Tactically, that would be too crude. Instead, it would interpose a series of technical requirements that would have the same effect as a ban. Most notably, the Roundtable would drastically raise the ownership threshold needed to file a proposal. But shareholder proposals are effectively tools for significant corporate change, akin to ballot initiatives that have played such an important role in American democracy. In recent years, shareholder proposals have called for better assessment and disclosure of climate change risks and for improved diversity in hiring. Consider the saga of another shareholder right: proxy access. Historically, shareholders could run their own candidates for a corporate board seat, but they could not get their candidates’ names on the ballot — or proxy. In a blatant effort to thwart challengers, companies would circulate proxies with only their own hand-selected candidates, forcing any opposition to incur the enormous costs of printing and circulating their own ballots. That’s one reason almost all board elections have been unopposed. Shareholders finally won the proxy access right they had been fighting for since the 1940s under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, only to see it overturned a year later by a three-judge panel of Republican appointees in a lawsuit co-led by the Business Roundtable. But New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer — using the same rights that Dimon and the Business Roundtable now seek to suppress — filed shareholder proposals seeking to restore proxy access at scores of companies on behalf of the New York City pension funds he oversees. Stringer’s proposals won approval overwhelmingly. These victories were so decisive that many companies surrendered and adopted the rule on their own. A recent SEC study shows that New York City’s efforts led to a total increase of $10.6 billion in shareholder value at targeted companies. But under the rules the Roundtable put forth, the New York City pension funds would have lost the power to file their own proposals. Other long-thwarted shareholder initiatives found success through the proposal process, such as majority voting rules that require a candidate to obtain more than 50 percent of the vote before being seated as a director and the cohering of corporate board election cycles, so that the whole board is elected every time and is therefore more responsive to shareholder demands. Even when unsuccessful, shareholder proposals can become important mechanisms for registering discontent and helping companies adjust policy. In 2012, Dimon himself barely survived a proposal to strip his JPMorgan chairmanship after his bank suffered the $6 billion trading loss known as “the London Whale” debacle. That proposal — filed by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees fund — was supported by 40 percent of shareholders . It might have attracted more had JPMorgan revealed the full scale of the nightmare earlier, before many of the company’s shareholders had voted. Dimon survived, but the board cut his pay. As with prior efforts to expand voting rights, shareholder proposals have been derided as political or worse, particularly when brought by individual “gadfly” investors. But last year, five environmental proposals at Fortune 500 energy companies crossed the 40 percent threshold of shareholder support, mostly focusing on climate change or greenhouse gas emissions. Shareholder proposals mainstreamed diversity as an investment issue, recently pounced on by State Street — a traditional investment house with $2.5 trillion in assets under management — which adopted a new voting policy favoring women board members, symbolically underscored by the company’s commission of the “Fearless Girl” sculpture on Wall Street. None of this is to say that shareholder proposal rules are perfect. Certain revisions might be worth considering. But nothing justifies the stratospheric threshold that Dimon and the Roundtable are backing. Apparently, they’re not interested in protecting shareholders — only in protecting themselves.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) beat expectations and shares are climbing. Wells Fargo (WFC) is another story. This morning, the third-largest bank in terms of assets, reported flat profits due to higher expenses and weaker mortgage banking revenue. Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Costs increased 6% to $13.8 billion in the March-end quarter from $13 billion from the year ago period. The bank indicated that costs are expected "remain elevated due to regulatory and compliance initiatives." While earnings per share of $1 beat expectations for 97 cents, according to Thomson Reuters, revenue of $22 billion came under Street estimates for $22.32 billion. Gains from higher interest rates were offset by "lower income from trading assets and mortgages held for sale, higher deposit and long-term debt balances, and lower income from variable sources" the company said in its earnings release. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) sold a portion of its stake in Wells Fargo yesterday. Buffett's company unloaded 9 million shares, but it wasn't for any reason except to keep Berkshire's position in the company from breaching 10%. It wasn't a prescient move, but it was a good one all the same. Wells Fargo stock has fallen 1.32% to $52.41.

The bank's net income rose to $6.45 billion in the first quarter ended March 31 from $5.52 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to $1.65, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.52 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. (http://bit.ly/2nHTfHJ) JPMorgan's shares were up 1.3 percent at $86.35 in premarket trading. Trading increased across Wall Street over the past year as investors changed their positions around the Brexit vote, the U.S. elections and the Federal Reserve's hikes in interest rates. Customers also borrowed more as the economy expanded, though the pace of loan growth has slackened somewhat recently. "We are off to a good start for the year with all of our businesses performing well and building on their momentum from last year," Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement. "U.S. consumers and businesses are healthy overall and with pro-growth initiatives and improving collaboration between government and business, the U.S. economy can continue to improve," Dimon said. Net revenue rose 6.24 percent to $25.59 billion, compared with the estimate of $24.88 billion. Markets revenue increased 13.9 percent, led by a 17 percent rise in fixed-income revenue. Net interest income rose 6 percent to $12.4 billion, primarily driven by loan growth and the net impact of higher rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates by 0.25 percentage points in December and again in mid-March, its second and third hikes after keeping them near zero for seven years. Higher interest rates are usually good for banks, allowing them to charge higher rates on loans. Investment banking revenue was up 34 percent at $1.65 billion, helped by higher debt and equity underwriting fees reflecting strong underlying issuance activity and share gains. Fees for global investment banking services, which include M&A advisory and capital markets underwriting, increased 26 percent over last year and was the strongest opening period for fees since 2007. JPMorgan's non-interest expenses rose 8.5 percent to $15.02 billion. Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc are also scheduled to report results on Thursday. Up to Wednesday's close, JPMorgan's had gained 22 percent since the presidential election on hopes of simpler regulation and tax cuts under the Donald Trump administration. The rally in bank stocks, however, has lost momentum lately as investors scale back some of those expectations.

The nation’s largest bank by assets reported net income of $6.45 billion, or $1.65 per share, compared with net income of $5.52 billion, or $1.35 a share from a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected the bank to earn $1.51 a share. As expected, JPMorgan’s bottom line benefited directly from the Federal Reserve’s push to raise interest rates over the past year. Net revenue on a managed basis were $25.59 billion compared with $24.08 billion in the same period a year earlier. Interest income rose $12.39 billion compared with $11.67 billion a year ago. Wells Fargo and Citigroup, who also reported their quarterly results on Thursday, also reported higher interest income in the first quarter. White House ends hiring freeze, mandates workforce, mission restructuring Advertisement The bank also reported solid loan growth in the quarter across both its consumer and business lending businesses. “We are off to a good start for the year with all of our businesses performing well and building on their momentum from last year,” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a prepared statement. JPMorgan’s investment banking division also did well, reporting net income of $3.24 billion compared with $1.98 billion in the same period a year earlier. Investment banking revenue rose 34 percent from year earlier, while JPMorgan’s trading division saw a 14 percent rise in revenues from a year earlier, helped especially by bond trading. One area that investors will watch in coming months is JPMorgan’s credit card business. In recent months, JPMorgan has introduced new products and executives have talked openly about “opening up the credit box,” which is banker talk for lending money to people with lower credit scores. It opens JPMorgan to issue credit cards to potentially more customers, but at the same time, exposes the bank to more risk. Average credit card loans at JPMorgan rose to $137.2 billion in the first quarter, compared with $127.3 billion from a year earlier. Meanwhile the bank’s charge-off rate for credit cards rose noticeably, from 2.62 percent to 2.94 percent. However, the bank said that increase in charge-offs was in line with expectations. JPMorgan’s stock rose $1.17, or 1.4 percent, to $86.54 in early trading. What makes the 2017 CR the worst yet for Defense?

 Bond traders are crushing it Matt Turner Apr. 13, 2017, 9:05 AM 3,716 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon at his company's corporate center in Bournemouth, England. Thomson Reuters Bond traders are enjoying a strong start to 2017. Both JPMorgan and Citigroup announced first-quarter earnings on Thursday and posted better-than-expected trading revenue. At JPMorgan, markets and investor services revenue, at $6.5 billion, was up 13% year-on-year, with the fixed income, currencies, and commodities business enjoying a strong start to the year. Revenue in that business was up 17%, with the bank citing strength in securitized products, rates, and credit. In February, the bank had said it expected only a modest bump in trading revenue. On a call with the media, CFO Marianne Lake said that while January had been strong, February was quiet with very low levels of volatility. "That changed to a degree in March," she said. At Citigroup, fixed-income revenue totaled $3.62 billion, up 19% year-over-year, ahead of the expectation for $3.52 billion. That's the highest level of fixed-income revenue in three years. Citigroup cited strength in both rates and currencies and spread products. The results set the scene for a strong year for fixed income, currencies, and commodities. That business has struggled through the past few years in a period of increased regulation and reduced volatility. But 2016 saw a rebound in industry revenue. It looks as if 2017 may continue that trend. NOW WATCH: A penthouse owned by Trump's trust is on the market for $35 million — here’s a look inside Loading video...

The nation's largest bank by assets reported net income of $6.45 billion, or $1.65 per share, compared with net income of $5.52 billion, or $1.35 a share from a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected the bank to earn $1.51 a share. As expected, JPMorgan's bottom line benefited directly from the Federal Reserve's push to raise interest rates over the past year. Net revenue on a managed basis were $25.59 billion compared with $24.08 billion in the same period a year earlier. Interest income rose $12.39 billion compared with $11.67 billion a year ago. Wells Fargo and Citigroup, who also reported their quarterly results on Thursday, also reported higher interest income in the first quarter. The bank also reported solid loan growth in the quarter across both its consumer and business lending businesses. "We are off to a good start for the year with all of our businesses performing well and building on their momentum from last year," JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a prepared statement. JPMorgan's investment banking division also did well, reporting net income of $3.24 billion compared with $1.98 billion in the same period a year earlier. Investment banking revenue rose 34 percent from year earlier, while JPMorgan's trading division saw a 14 percent rise in revenues from a year earlier, helped especially by bond trading. One area that investors will watch in coming months is JPMorgan's credit card business. In recent months, JPMorgan has introduced new products and executives have talked openly about "opening up the credit box," which is banker talk for lending money to people with lower credit scores. It opens JPMorgan to issue credit cards to potentially more customers, but at the same time, exposes the bank to more risk. Average credit card loans at JPMorgan rose to $137.2 billion in the first quarter, compared with $127.3 billion from a year earlier. Meanwhile the bank's charge-off rate for credit cards rose noticeably, from 2.62 percent to 2.94 percent. However, the bank said that increase in charge-offs was in line with expectations. JPMorgan's stock rose $1.17, or 1.4 percent, to $86.54 in early trading. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg JPMorgan reported $6.45 billion in profits or $1.65 per share for its March-end quarter, up from $5.52 billion or $1.35 per share in the period a year ago. Analysts expected earnings of $1.52. Adjusted revenue came in at $25.6 billion, up 6.2%; analysts expected $24.9 billion. "The consumer businesses continue to grow core loans at double digits, outperform the industry in deposit growth, and we once again had very strong card sales volume growth this quarter..." said Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon  in a statement on financial results. Recent base rate hikes should expand profit margins for banks. Net interest income rose 6% in the March-end quarter to $12.1 billion driven by loan growth and higher interest rates. The bank expects net interest income to be up $4.5 billion for 2017. Shares of the New York bank has gained 0.56% to around $86 on the news. Neither the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) nor the SPDR S&P Bank ETF(KBE) are seeing a lift. The XLF has declined 0.65% and the KBE, 1.41%.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 4/4 By Lewis Krauskopf Major U.S. stock indexes fell on Thursday for a third straight day as investors weighed earnings reports from big U.S. banks and geopolitical tensions, while the tech sector fell for a tenth consecutive session. Wells Fargo (WFC.N) shares fell 3.3 percent, pulling down the S&P 500, after the bank reported a drop in mortgage banking revenue. Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) also disclosed late on Wednesday that it had cut its stake in the bank. JPMorgan (JPM.N) fell 1.2 percent and Citigroup (C.N) slipped 0.8 percent, even as those companies reported better-than-expected quarterly profits. Banks revealed more evidence of a slowdown in loan growth in their reports. The S&P 500 banks index .SPXBK closed at its lowest point since early December. Investors have sought safe-haven assets throughout the week due to geopolitical tensions in Syria and North Korea. News of a massive bomb being dropped by the United States in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday added to uncertainty. Kate Warne, principal investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said a dip in bond yields put pressure on stocks ahead of a holiday weekend in the United States. "What we've seen is investors from the rest of the world putting more money in U.S. Treasuries" due to geopolitical concerns, Warne said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 138.61 points, or 0.67 percent, to 20,453.25, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 15.98 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,328.95 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 31.01 points, or 0.53 percent, to 5,805.15. The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed 8.9 percent since President Donald Trump's Nov. 8 election, supported by his planned economic agenda of tax cuts and economic stimulus. But the rally has stalled the past six weeks as some investors question Trump's ability to enact his proposals. There is "some concern among investors that there is now a shift going on in Washington to international and away from a domestic policy," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. The S&P 500 financial index .SPSY dropped 1.3 percent, its fifth straight day of losses. Energy shares .SPNY were the worst-performing group, falling 1.8 percent. The technology sector .SPLRCT fell 0.4 percent, marking its longest losing streak since May 2012. The results from banks kicked off what is expected to be a strong first-quarter U.S. reporting season. S&P 500 companies are expected to post a 10.4 percent rise in earnings for the period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We could have double-digit earnings growth; we haven’t seen that in some time," said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. "Investors are going to be impressed with that." A report from the University of Michigan showed that U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly strengthened in April as consumer optimism on current economic conditions climbed to its highest level since November 2000. About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.56-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 51 new lows.

Shares of JPMorgan and Citigroup rose about 0.4 percent premarket after the two banks reported quarterly profits that beat analysts' expectations. However, Wells Fargo slipped 1.2 percent at $52.49 after reporting a slight drop in quarterly profit. The results come after a frenetic rally in bank shares that started in November on bets that President Donald Trump would rein in banking regulations and introduce other business friendly policies. "Investors will (be) faced with another day of market uncertainties as bank earnings, geopolitical worries and Trump's comments on the greenback are being reflected in the volatility index that is flashing trouble ahead," Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial, wrote in a note. The dollar, already suffering from a risk-off mood in the market amid geopolitical tensions, hit its lowest level this month after Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that the currency "was getting too strong" and that he would like to see interest rates stay low. Gold, which has become the preferred asset this week as investors sought safe havens, was up 0.11 percent and continues to trade at its highest level since November. Dow e-minis were down 31 points, or 0.15 percent at 8:30 a.m. ET, with 32,649 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were down 5.5 points, or 0.23 percent, with 226,755 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 9.75 points, or 0.18 percent, on volume of 36,779 contracts. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are due to report results next week. Shares of Applied Optoelectronics jumped nearly 23 percent to $50.15 after the company said it expected first-quarter earnings to exceed its forecast. Trading volumes could be lower than usual on Thursday ahead of the Good Friday holiday.

(NYSE: JPM) reported its first-quarter financial results before the markets opened on Thursday. The company posted $1.65 in earnings per share (EPS) and $25.59 billion in revenue, versus consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters of $1.52 in EPS and revenue of $24.88 billion. The same period of last year reportedly had EPS of $1.35 and $24.08 billion in revenue. During the quarter, net interest income was $12.4 billion, up 6%, primarily driven by loan growth and the net impact of higher rates. Noninterest revenue was $13.2 billion, up 6%, primarily driven by the Corporate & Investment Bank, largely offset by Card new account origination costs and lower MSR risk management results. Also the provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, down from $1.8 billion, due to net reserve releases. Also average core loans were up 11%, with average deposits of $623 billion. Record average loan balances were $118 billion, up 7%, and record average deposit balances were $159 billion, up 5%. Over the course of the quarter, JPMorgan repurchased $4.6 billion worth of stock. There was $2.8 billion of net repurchases and a common dividend of $0.50 per share. Book value per share was up 6% to $64.68, and tangible book value was up 6% at $52.04. The Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.4%, totaling $184 billion. Jamie Dimon, board chair and chief executive, commented: We are off to a good start for the year with all of our businesses performing well and building on their momentum from last year. The consumer businesses continue to grow core loans at double digits, outperform the industry in deposit growth, and we once again had very strong card sales volume growth this quarter – reflecting our commitment to providing our customers the innovative products and services they want. Shares of JPMorgan closed Wednesday at $85.40, with a consensus analyst price target of $91.22 and a 52-week trading range of $57.05 to $93.98. Following the release of the report, the stock was last seen up 0.5% at $85.84 in early trading indications Thursday.

Posted 13 Apr 2017 18:55 Updated 13 Apr 2017 21:15 FILE PHOTO -People walk by the JP Morgan & Chase Co. building in New York, U.S. on October 24, 2013. REUTERS/Eric Thayer/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: JPMorgan Chase & Co reported a 17 percent jump in quarterly profit on Thursday, topping analyst expectations as higher interest rates fueled trading activity and helped the largest U.S. bank earn more from lending. The Federal Reserve's decision to hike rates in March for the second time in three months led investors to reposition portfolios, as did elections in Europe and news about Britain's progress in leaving the European Union. That increased activity boosted first-quarter revenue in JPMorgan's markets-related businesses, particularly fixed-income trading. The bank also reported growth in loans and deposits and was able to earn more from lending as interest rates ticked higher. However, its pace of loan growth, much like in the broader U.S. banking industry, has slackened recently. Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc also reported results on Thursday, with Citi showing similar gains in trading and Wells Fargo hurt by a slowdown in mortgage lending. Overall, JPMorgan earned US$6.4 billion in the first quarter, or US$1.65 per share, up from US$5.5 billion, or US$1.35 per share a year earlier. The bank's total net revenue rose 6 percent to US$24.7 billion from US$23.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected earnings of US$1.52 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan shares rose 0.5 percent to US$85.79 in premarket trading. JPMorgan's corporate and investment banking division, which includes the trading business, reported a 17 percent rise in revenue to US$9.5 billion, the biggest gain among its four major business lines. Weaker advisory fees were more than offset by gains in revenue from underwriting, securitized products, interest rate-related products, prime brokerage and corporate derivatives. On a conference call with journalists, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said some customers decided to borrow by issuing bonds rather than taking out loans. Mortgage borrowing was a dark spot in the bank's results, with mortgage fees and loan servicing revenue tumbling 39 percent to US$406 million from US$667 million. Higher interest rates have dissuaded borrowers from refinancing, and JPMorgan executives had said in February they expected non-interest mortgage revenue to fall throughout the year. Even so, the bank managed to grow its core book of loans by 9 percent on an annual basis and nearly 1 percent from the prior quarter. Its net interest income, an important measure of profitability that shows the difference between a bank's cost of money and how much it receives for the funds, rose 6 percent. In a statement, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said U.S. consumers and businesses are "healthy overall" and that the economy could further improve if the government pursues pro-growth initiatives.

Net income for the quarter ending 31 March was $6.5 billion, up 16.8% from the year-ago period. Revenues were $25.6 billion, up 6.2%. Earnings growth was driven in large part by JPMorgan's corporate and investment banking business due to higher debt and equity underwriting fees and gains in trading revenues tied to fixed income and the trading of other products. This division also benefited from a favourable comparison to the year-ago period, when JPMorgan set aside large reserves in case of defaults in the oil and gas business following a slump in oil prices at the time. But net income in consumer and community banking fell, due in part to a write-down of the student loan portfolio. That resulted in provisions in case of loan losses of $1.4 billion, which was less than in the year-ago period, but above the level in the prior quarter. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon gave a generally positive outlook, saying, "US consumers and businesses are healthy overall and with pro-growth initiatives and improving collaboration between government and business, the US economy can continue to improve." Net income translated into $1.65 per share, compared with the $1.52 expected by analysts. Shares rose 1% to $86.25 in pre-market trade.

Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell: JPMorgan Chase — The bank reported quarterly profit of $1.65 per share, beating estimates of $1.52 a share, with revenue also beating forecasts. JPMorgan benefitted from better lending results, among other factors. Citigroup — Citi earned $1.35 per share for the first quarter, 11 cents a share above estimates. Revenue was also above forecasts. An improvement in fixed-income trading was among the factors helping Citi's results. Wells Fargo — The bank reported quarterly profit of $1 per share, three cents a share above estimates. Revenue came in below forecasts, however. Wells Fargo directors are likely to receive the support of key shareholder Berkshire Hathaway, according to The Wall Street Journal. The bank's annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for April 25, and it's expected to be contentious in light of last year's sales practices scandal. PNC Financial — PNC came in 13 cents a share above estimates, with quarterly profit of $1.96 per share. Revenue also beat Street projections. The bank was helped by increased loan volume, as well as improved expense management. Apple — The company has a secret group of engineers working on sensors to monitor blood sugar levels. The project was said to have been originally conceived by CEO Steve Jobs before his death in 2011. Walt Disney — RBC Capital analyst Steven Cahall said investors have been increasingly speculating that Disney could become a takeover target for Apple, if tax laws are changed to allow easier repatriation of overseas cash. Goldman Sachs — Goldman's bid to narrow a gender bias lawsuit was rejected by a U.S. District Court judge in Manhattan. Goldman is accused of discriminating against women in the areas of pay and promotion, which it denies, and said it is continuing to "contest this matter vigorously." Tesla — Tesla is embroiled in some controversy, with a group of shareholders urging the automaker to add two independent directors to its board who do not have any ties to CEO Elon Musk. Musk did not take kindly to the idea, tweeting that those investors should buy stock in Ford instead. Pier One Imports — Pier One forecast a steeper-than-expected current-quarter loss, pressuring its shares in after-hours trading. The retailer's 2017 profit fell 24 percent as it closed stores, although its profit margins did improve. Hostess Brands — Hostess announced that a secondary stock offering was priced at $15.25 per share, compared to Wednesday's close of $15.65 a share. The shares are being sold by a number of funds with stakes in the snack maker, and the company will not receive any of the proceeds of the sale. Adobe Systems — Adobe saw its credit rating upgraded to "A" from "A-" by Standard & Poor's, which said the software maker is likely to achieve continuing operating performance growth. It maintained its evaluation of Adobe's outlook at "stable." Separately, Adobe was rated "buy" in new coverage at Guggenheim Securities, which believes that Adobe can continue to outperform expectations because of strength in digital marketing. Hanesbrands — Hanesbrands increased its first-quarter financial guidance, with the underwear and activewear maker saying 2017 was off to a strong start. Separately, it announced that Chief Financial Officer Richard Moss would retire at the end of this year. SeaWorld, Six Flags — SunTrust likes both theme park operators, starting coverage on both stocks with a "buy" rating. It said the dramatic overhaul at Six Flags since its 2010 bankruptcy has accelerated growth and margins, while saying SeaWorld is in the early stages of a turnaround.

(Justin Lake, EPA) (Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA) 85 CONNECTTWEET 20 LINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORE JPMorgan Chase reported strong first-quarter results, topping Wall Street's forecasts for earnings and revenue handily, and the bank's CEO Jame Dimon gave an upbeat assessment of U.S. consumers and businesses. The nation's largest bank by assets reported a 17% rise in net income of $6.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.65, beating analysts forecast of $1.52 by 13 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenues also came in stronger than expected at $25.6 billion, up 6% from last year's first quarter and above estimates of $24.9 billion. "We are off to a good start to the year," Dimon said in an statement, adding that all of the bank's business segments were "building on their momentum from last year." In early trading, the bank's shares were up $1.33, or 1.6%, to $86.73, outpacing a flat start to the day for the broad U.S. stock market. The stock, which surged 23% from Election Day to the end of 2016, has traded flat so far this year and started Thursday's session off 1% in 2017. JPMorgan's results and those of other big banks reporting Thursday, such as Wells Fargo and Citigroup, were being closely watched by Wall Street, as their results will set the tone for the entire first-quarter earnings season. In a statement, Dimon issued a positive outlook on the state of the U.S. consumer. “U.S. consumers and businesses are healthy overall and with pro-growth initiatives and improving collaboration between government and business, the U.S. economy can continue to improve," Dimon said. JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, reacted favorably to the bank's results and Dimon's bullish comments on his broad client base, which bodes well for the economy's ability to resume faster growth after slowing in the first three months of the year to a roughly 1% pace. "CEO commentary is one of the most important parts of earnings season," says Kinahan. "Dimon's positive tone and his stressing that all businesses are doing well gives investors hope that the stock market rally can continue." The bank reported that loan activity at the consumer level rose 11% and that credit card sales volume was up 15%, a sign that consumers feel confident enough to take on new debt and use credit cards to make purchases.The bank did set aside an additional $380 million for potential future credit losses, but downplayed that move, saying it was in line with its expectations. "The consumer businesses," Dimon wrote, "continue to grow core loans at double digits," adding that "we once again had very strong card sales volume this quarter." Both Dimon and chief financial officer Marianne Lake, said the impact of a weak retail sector, especially bricks-and-mortar retailers like Payless and Sears which recently announced store closings due to falling profits, would not impact the bank's results in a meaningful way. "Nothing dramatic," Dimon said. Lake said the bank will benefit from additional rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, but pointed out that future hikes are likely to come later in 2017, so the benefits to the bank's bottom line will also be pushed out. Higher rates boosts bank profits because it improves its so-called "net interest margins -- the difference between the interest banks make in loans and what they pay out in interest to depositors. JPMorgan's first-quarter results were also boosted by market activity, with its overall markets-related trading revenue up 13%, driven largely by a 17% rise in its fixed-income, or bond, business. In a conference call with Wall Street analysts this morning, both Dimon and chief investment officer Marianne Lake, said they are still hopeful that President's pro-growth proposals, despite not getting implemented as quickly as hoped, will eventually be enacted. Trump's proposals to reduce regulations and slash corporate taxes is viewed as positive for JPMorgan's future profits. The president's growth-friendly agenda, however, is currently in a holding pattern as the Trump administration has suffered a setback on its plans to repeal and replace Obamacare. But Dimon says that it's not unexpected for new administration's to suffer "ups and downs in the sausage-making period" when new laws and economic policies are being negotiated. He added that Trump's growth-friendly policies will benefit the economy when they are eventually enacted. Trump's proposals are "pro growth," Dimon said. "Tax reform. Spending on infrastructure. Regulatory reform. That will help all Americans." JPMorgan also reported record revenue of $2 billion in its commercial banking business. 85 CONNECTTWEET 20 LINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2oqKWxa

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:55 PM, April 13, 2017 Updated: 9:10 PM, April 13, 2017 JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> reported a 17 percent jump in quarterly profit on Thursday, topping analyst expectations as higher interest rates fueled trading activity and helped the largest U.S. bank earn more from lending. The Federal Reserve's decision to hike rates in March for the second time in three months led investors to reposition portfolios, as did elections in Europe and news about Britain's progress in leaving the European Union. That increased activity boosted first-quarter revenue in JPMorgan's markets-related businesses, particularly fixed-income trading. The bank also reported growth in loans and deposits and was able to earn more from lending as interest rates ticked higher. However, its pace of loan growth, much like in the broader U.S. banking industry, has slackened recently. Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N> and Citigroup Inc <C.N> also reported results on Thursday, with Citi showing similar gains in trading and Wells Fargo hurt by a slowdown in mortgage lending. [nL3N1HL4BF ] Overall, JPMorgan earned $6.4 billion in the first quarter, or $1.65 per share, up from $5.5 billion, or $1.35 per share a year earlier. The bank's total net revenue rose 6 percent to $24.7 billion from $23.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.52 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan shares rose 0.5 percent to $85.79 in premarket trading. JPMorgan's corporate and investment banking division, which includes the trading business, reported a 17 percent rise in revenue to $9.5 billion, the biggest gain among its four major business lines. Weaker advisory fees were more than offset by gains in revenue from underwriting, securitized products, interest rate-related products, prime brokerage and corporate derivatives. On a conference call with journalists, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said some customers decided to borrow by issuing bonds rather than taking out loans. Mortgage borrowing was a dark spot in the bank's results, with mortgage fees and loan servicing revenue tumbling 39 percent to $406 million from $667 million. Higher interest rates have dissuaded borrowers from refinancing, and JPMorgan executives had said in February they expected non-interest mortgage revenue to fall throughout the year. Even so, the bank managed to grow its core book of loans by 9 percent on an annual basis and nearly 1 percent from the prior quarter. Its net interest income, an important measure of profitability that shows the difference between a bank's cost of money and how much it receives for the funds, rose 6 percent. In a statement, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said U.S. consumers and businesses are "healthy overall" and that the economy could further improve if the government pursues pro-growth initiatives.

The report, which sent shares higher in early trading, is the first to show how much money the biggest U.S. banks made from helping clients trade bonds and stocks. Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said in February that while markets revenue would be modestly higher in the first quarter, the firm would probably suffer from a difficult comparison to a strong performance in 2016. JPMorgan Chase Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake. The 17% gain in fixed-income trading revenue, to $4.22 billion, was the smallest in a year. JPMorgan reported a surprise increase in equity trading, which rose 2% to $1.61 billion. Bank shares have climbed since the November U.S. election in part on expectations the Federal Reserve would buoy bank profits with higher interest rates. That appears to be starting, as JPMorgan’s net interest margin — the difference in what it charges borrowers and pays depositors — rose 11 basis points from the preceding quarter to 2.33 percentage points, the first increase in a year. That beat the 4-basis-point estimate of KBW analysts. Companywide revenue rose 6% to $25.6 billion, compared with the $25.2 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank said noninterest expenses rose 9% to $15 billion, topping analysts’ $14.6 billion estimate. Net income rose 17% to $6.45 billion, or $1.65 a share, from $5.52 billion, or $1.35, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings were $1.57 a share, beating the $1.52 average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. JPMorgan shares dropped 1% this year through Wednesday, the second-best performance among the six biggest U.S. banks. They climbed 1.7% to $86.86 in early trading at 6:46 a.m. in New York.

Markets improved in March, helping the biggest U.S. bank post a 17 percent gain in fixed-income trading revenue to $4.22 billion and a surprise increase in equity trading, which rose 2 percent to $1.61 billion, the New York-based firm said Thursday in a statement. Trading revenue rose for a fourth straight quarter, the longest streak in at least a decade. The results, which drove JPMorgan shares higher, exceeded analysts’ $4.02 billion estimate for bond trading and $1.45 billion for equities. The bond gains were fueled by rates trading linked to central bank actions, improved credit trading and upcoming elections in Europe. Bank shares have climbed since November’s U.S. election in part on expectations the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases would buoy profits. That appears to be starting, as JPMorgan’s net interest margin -- the difference between what it charges borrowers and pays depositors -- rose 11 basis points from the preceding quarter to 2.33 percentage points, the first increase in a year and the highest since the first quarter of 2013. KBW analysts predicted a jump of 4 basis points. “With pro-growth initiatives and improving collaboration between government and business, the U.S. economy can continue to improve,” Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in the statement. The better-than-expected net interest margin is “the most important read-through to other stocks,” Oppenheimer & Co.’s Chris Kotowski said in a note to clients. The Fed’s last two rate increases “are having a bigger effect than the December 2015 lift did.” Companywide revenue rose 6 percent to $25.6 billion, compared with the $25.2 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Noninterest expenses climbed 9 percent to $15 billion, more than analysts’ $14.6 billion estimate. Net income jumped 17 percent to $6.45 billion, or $1.65 a share, from $5.52 billion, or $1.35, a year earlier, according to the statement. Adjusted earnings were $1.57 a share, beating the $1.52 average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. JPMorgan shares climbed 1.2 percent to $86.38 at 10:47 a.m. in New York and are little changed this year.

Profit from consumer and community banking fell 20 percent to $1.99 billion as the provision for credit losses rose 36 percent to $1.43 billion because of a writedown in the student-loan portfolio and higher credit-card write-offs. Revenue was $10.97 billion, down 1 percent from a year earlier. JPMorgan has taken share from competitors in fixed income and equities trading in 2015 and 2016, Lake told analysts in a conference call Thursday. “You can’t expect us to continue to gain share at those kinds of levels,” she said. “We will defend that share, but the competition is back and healthy.” (An earlier version of this story corrected analysts’ trading estimates.)

The nation's largest bank by assets reported net income of $6.45 billion, or $1.65 per share, compared with net income of $5.52 billion, or $1.35 a share from a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected the bank to earn $1.51 a share. As expected, JPMorgan's bottom line benefited directly from the Federal Reserve's push to raise interest rates over the past year. Net revenue on a managed basis were $25.59 billion compared with $24.08 billion in the same period a year earlier. Interest income rose $12.39 billion compared with $11.67 billion a year ago. Wells Fargo and Citigroup, who also reported their quarterly results on Thursday, also reported higher interest income in the first quarter. The bank also reported solid loan growth in the quarter across both its consumer and business lending businesses. "We are off to a good start for the year with all of our businesses performing well and building on their momentum from last year," JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a prepared statement. JPMorgan's investment banking division also did well, reporting net income of $3.24 billion compared with $1.98 billion in the same period a year earlier. Investment banking revenue rose 34 percent from year earlier, while JPMorgan's trading division saw a 14 percent rise in revenues from a year earlier, helped especially by bond trading. One area that investors will watch in coming months is JPMorgan's credit card business. In recent months, JPMorgan has introduced new products and executives have talked openly about "opening up the credit box," which is banker talk for lending money to people with lower credit scores. It opens JPMorgan to issue credit cards to potentially more customers, but at the same time, exposes the bank to more risk. Average credit card loans at JPMorgan rose to $137.2 billion in the first quarter, compared with $127.3 billion from a year earlier. Meanwhile the bank's charge-off rate for credit cards rose noticeably, from 2.62 percent to 2.94 percent. However, the bank said that increase in charge-offs was in line with expectations. JPMorgan's stock rose $1.17, or 1.4 percent, to $86.54 in early trading. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Bruno Iksil, a.k.a. the “London Whale,” lost $6.2 billion placing risky bets on financial instruments while working for JPMorgan, and has yet to be tried. (Simon Dawson/Bloomberg) By Renae Merle By Renae Merle April 13 at 3:35 PM Follow @renaemerle Bruno Iksil achieved Wall Street notoriety with one of the worst trades in history. He lost $6.2 billion — more than three times the yearly budget of the Securities and Exchange Commission — placing risky bets on complex financial instruments while working for JPMorgan Chase. Iksil’s big losses earned him the nickname the “London Whale,” and set off an intense investigation into the way JPMorgan handles such sophisticated trades. The bank ultimately paid $920 million in fines to U.S. and British regulators, and its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, offered several humbling apologies for the episode. But five years later, Iksil, who is reportedly living with his family in France, has yet to be tried. After striking a deal with federal prosecutors to avoid criminal prosecution more than three years ago, the Wall Street Journal reported this week that the Federal Reserve is backing off plans to file a complaint against Iksil. The case is turning into the latest example of how U.S. regulators and prosecutors struggle to hold individuals responsible for corporate wrongdoing. Facing criticism of its record on prosecuting white collar crime, the Obama administration in 2015 announced that it would pursue more cases against individual company executives, not just corporations. Sally Yates, deputy U.S. attorney general at the time, called the policy “one of the most important documents within the Justice Department community.” But it remains unclear how the Trump administration plans to proceed with such cases. One test, said some legal experts, could come from the Justice Department’s handling of Wells Fargo’s admission last year that it had fired 5,300 employees over a five-year period for opening bank accounts that customers didn’t authorize. The bank announced this week that it would strip an additional $75 million in compensation from two senior executives, including former chief executive John Stumpf, after an internal investigation found the abusive sales practices were going on much longer than initially disclosed. “The Wells Fargo case may be an early test of this administration’s resolve to hold corporations responsible for crimes,” said Brandon L. Garrett, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law. “They have said they don’t want to regulate businesses and banks, and that doesn’t bode well for corporate crime enforcement.” While not addressing any case in particular, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has “noted the importance of individual responsibility,” Trevor McFadden, the deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department’s criminal division, said in a February speech. “Indeed, our partnerships with foreign authorities are increasingly allowing us to ensure that even individuals living abroad are held accountable for their actions,” he said. Finding individuals to prosecute in the London Whale case has been particularly difficult. Iksil assembled a huge portfolio of investments designed to hedge JPMorgan against other risky bets the bank was making. But in 2012, Iksil’s quasi-insurance policies started to cost the bank money. Initially, JPMorgan estimated the losses from Iksil’s trade would amount to $2 billion, but eventually the firm disclosed the figure was even bigger — $6.2 billion. Regulators and lawmakers pummeled the bank and accused Dimon of being less than forthright with regulators as he learned about the botched trades. (Dimon initially dismissed the incident as a “tempest in a teapot,” but as the losses grew, he called it “the stupidest and most embarrassing situation I have ever been a part of.”) As prosecutors began to build cases against the bank, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan announced in 2013 that the office had entered into a “nonprosecution agreement” with Iskil for cooperating with prosecutors. “Although I don’t think you could call him blameless, he did sound the alarm more than once,” former U.S. attorney Preet Bharara said at the time. In 2015, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority announced it was dropping its investigation into Iksil. Now, it appears the Federal Reserve, which declined to comment, may not be filing charges either. In letters to several media outlets, including Bloomberg News, Iksil said he was not to blame for the episode. Iksil said he warned his superiors about the potentially huge losses, but was instructed to carry out the trades anyway. The government’s decision to not prosecute shows that he is not culpable, Iksil wrote. “Publicity surrounding the losses sustained by . . . JPMorgan typically refers to ‘the London Whale’ in terms that imply that one person was responsible for the trades at issue,” he said. “In fact the losses . . . were not the actions of one person acting in an unauthorized manner. My role was to execute a trading strategy that had been initiated, approved, mandated and monitored by . . . senior management.” Iksil’s attorney could not be immediately reached for comment. Two of Iksil’s colleagues, Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout were charged with wire fraud and other offenses. But their cases have yet to go to court. Spain has reportedly refused to extradite Martin-Artajo, a Spanish national, and Grout, who is from France, has also not returned to the United States. The Department of Justice declined to comment on the issue. Grout’s attorney, Edward Little, has complained about the deal Iksil struck to avoid prosecution, calling it “astonishing.” “The government’s strategy — letting Iksil escape responsibility in exchange for incriminating Mr. Grout — exposes the weakness of the charges and can only be explained by the political pressure put on the Department of Justice to bring a criminal case in the ‘London Whale’ affair,” Little said in a 2013 statement. business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

The bank's net income rose to $6.45 billion in the first quarter ended March 31 from $5.52 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to $1.65 from $1.35. [http://bit.ly/2nHTfHJ ] Analysts had expected earnings of $1.52 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear if the reported results were comparable. Trading increased across Wall Street over the past year as investors changed their positions around the Brexit vote, the U.S. elections and the Federal Reserve's hikes in interest rates. Customers also borrowed more as the economy expanded, though the pace of loan growth has slackened somewhat recently. Wells Fargo &amp; Co and Citigroup Inc are also scheduled to report results on Thursday.

The banking giant's trading revenue totaled $6.515 billion, easily topping expectations. Average core loans rose 9 percent year over year. Fred Imbert | @foimbert 19 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters JPM beats Street on top and bottom line    20 Hours Ago | 02:03 JPMorgan Chase reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that easily topped estimates, lifted by better-than-expected loan growth and trading sales. "We are off to a good start for the year with all of our businesses performing well and building on their momentum from last year," CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement. "U.S. consumers and businesses are healthy overall and with pro-growth initiatives and improving collaboration between government and business, the U.S. economy can continue to improve," he said. EPS: $1.65 versus $1.52 expected by Thomson Reuters analysts' consensus Revenue: $25.586 billion versus $24.877 billion expected by Thomson Reuters analysts' consensus Trading revenue: $6.515 billion versus $5.51 billion expected by StreetAccount analysts' consensus Average core loans: up 9 percent year over year versus an expected uptick of 2 percent Laura McDermott | Bloomberg | Getty Images Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan reported earnings per share of $1.35 on sales of $24.08 billion in the year-earlier period. The company's shares rose more than 1 percent in the premarket after the results were released. "The investment banking business was very strong year over year and up slightly from the fourth quarter" of 2016, said Ken Leon, global director of industry and equity research at CFRA. He also recognized the company's loan growth remains strong. "There really weren't any major blemishes in this report." The company's trading revenue was largely bolstered by strong sales in its "markets" segment, which rose 13 percent. Trading revenue totaled $6.515 billion in the first quarter, more than a billion above StreetAccount's estimate. Bond trading was also one of the main drivers behind the results, rising 17 percent from the same quarter a year ago. "Rates improved, with increased market activity, particularly in Europe in advance of upcoming elections and in reaction to central bank actions," JPMorgan said in a statement. The banking giant's stock has surged more than 20 percent since the election amid hopes for a revamp of financial regulations and lower corporate taxes coming from Trump administration policies. JPMorgan shares are down 1 percent for the year, however, as investors see the implementation of such moves as being further off. Dimon said in his annual letter to investors that businesses are being weighed down by regulations, adding high U.S. corporate taxes are making companies less competitive. The U.S. had one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world last year at 40 percent. Dimon also said "too big to fail" fears have been eradicated, lessening the need for current regulations like Dodd-Frank.

Bank earnings galore: Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo will report first quarter earnings on Thursday. Banking stocks soared following the election of President Trump, but they began to lose momentum in March. Still, analysts say banks should be in line to benefit from rising interest rates. Last week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon struck an optimistic note in his annual letter to shareholders, bragging about his bank's monster balance sheet. Wells Fargo, meanwhile, is still feeling the effects of its fake accounts debacle. The $110 million settlement with wronged customers agreed in March might help it move beyond the scandal. 2. China trade grows: China posted stunning growth in trade last month, beating analyst expectations by a mile. "The latest trade data point to buoyant external demand but suggest that domestic demand may have started to cool," said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics. Exports grew 22% in yuan terms over the previous year in March. Imports also grew by 26%, but that was actually slower than the 34% average increase posted in January and February. 3. OPEC keeps cutting: New data from the International Energy Agency show that OPEC countries are sticking with an agreement reached with other producers aimed at cutting production. The oil cartel is now working on a proposal to extend the production cuts beyond June. "At half time in the six-month deal, OPEC achieved an average 99% of its target after Saudi Arabia -- along with Kuwait, Qatar and Angola -- cut by more than agreed," the agency, which monitors energy trends for the world's richest countries, said in its report. Oil dropped 0.4% to just below $53 per barrel. 4. Global market overview: U.S. stock futures were lower Thursday ahead of the long weekend. U.S. markets are closed Friday. The dollar and U.S. Treasury yields dropped Wednesday after President Trump told the Wall Street Journal that the dollar was "getting too strong." The dollar continued to fall early Thursday. European markets opened lower, while Asian markets ended the session mixed. The Japanese yen and gold, seen as safe haven assets by investors, both strengthened. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.3% lower on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 shed 0.4% and the Nasdaq declined 0.5%. 5. Economics: Initial U.S. jobless claims for the week of April 8 will be reported at 7:30 a.m. ET. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release its producer price index reports for March at 8:30 a.m. ET. The University of Michigan will release its consumer sentiment data for April at 9 a.m. ET. 6.

China trade grows: China posted stunning growth in trade last month, beating analyst expectations by a mile. “The latest trade data point to buoyant external demand but suggest that domestic demand may have started to cool,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics. Exports grew 22% in yuan terms over the previous year in March. Imports also grew by 26%, but that was actually slower than the 34% average increase posted in January and February. 3. OPEC keeps cutting: New data from the International Energy Agency show that OPEC countries are sticking with an agreement reached with other producers aimed at cutting production. The oil cartel is now working on a proposal to extend the production cuts beyond June. “At half time in the six-month deal, OPEC achieved an average 99% of its target after Saudi Arabia — along with Kuwait, Qatar and Angola — cut by more than agreed,” the agency, which monitors energy trends for the world’s richest countries, said in its report. Oil dropped 0.4% to just below $53 per barrel. 4. Global market overview: U.S. stock futures were lower Thursday ahead of the long weekend. U.S. markets are closed Friday. The dollar and U.S. Treasury yields dropped Wednesday after President Trump told the Wall Street Journal that the dollar was “getting too strong.” The dollar continued to fall early Thursday. European markets opened lower, while Asian markets ended the session mixed. The Japanese yen and gold, seen as safe haven assets by investors, both strengthened. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.3% lower on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 shed 0.4% and the Nasdaq declined 0.5%. 5. Economics: Initial U.S. jobless claims for the week of April 8 will be reported at 7:30 a.m. ET. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release its producer price index reports for March at 8:30 a.m. ET. The University of Michigan will release its consumer sentiment data for April at 9 a.m. ET. 6.

It comes as investors piled into safe haven assets such as gold and bonds after President Trump's interview with the Wall Street Journal in which he appeared to backtrack on his initial policies for China, NATO and the economy.   Meanwhile on Wall Street shares in JP Morgan and Citigroup rose after the two banks reported better-than-expected quarterly profits. However, Wells Fargo slipped as it reported a big drop in mortgage banking revenue. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are due to report results next week.  Citi, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo all reported results today  Click here to view if you are using a This is Money phone app.  Camilla Canocchi Host commentator Mark Shapland Host commentator Auto-update 16:37 FTSE CLOSE: FTSE 100 finishes down 21.4 points at 7,327.5 Have a good Easter, back on Tuesday for more.  16:22 BOND NEWS: Saudi Arabia's first ever Islamic bond sale raises $9billion In its first international issuance of sukuk, or an Islamic bond, Saudi Arabia has raised $9billion. The bond sale comes as the kingdom looks to reshape its oil-dependent economy. Saudi Arabia issued bonds worth $17.5billion in 2016, tapping international and domestic markets to help finance a budget deficit that is expected to reach $53billion this year. The deficit ballooned to a record $98billion in 2015 but narrowed last year to about $79billion as the government introduced austerity measures, cutting spending and subsidies. Saudi Arabia is also preparing what may become the world’s largest initial public offering of state oil company Saudi Aramco. The IPO is also expected to help manage the budget shortfall. 15:26 Wall Street flat as bank earnings kick in US stocks were unchanged as investors assessed the first rush of bank earnings and President Donald Trump's remarks on the dollar's strength and interest rates. Shares of JP Morgan and Citigroup rose about 1 per cent after the two banks reported better-than-expected quarterly profits. However, Wells Fargo slipped 2.5 per cent after reporting a big drop in mortgage banking revenue. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are due to report results next week. The earnings reports come in the wake of a frenetic rally in bank shares that started after Trump's election as US president on hopes that he would rein in banking regulations and introduce other business friendly policies. The Dow Jones was flat at 20,591.28. Trump told the Wall Street Journal last night that the dollar 'was getting too strong' and that he would like to see interest rates stay low. 14:30 And there in .........JP Morgan and Citigroup boosted by fixed income trading Citigroup has reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as the bank's fixed-income trading was boosted by clients adjusting their positions following rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and changes in the forex and credit markets. The company reported a 17 per cent jump in quarterly profit to $4.09billion, or $1.35 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.24 per share. Wells Fargo, which has been mired in litigations stemming from a sales scandal, posted a nearly flat first-quarter profit, hurt by lower mortgage banking revenue and higher expenses. Total revenue fell about a percent to $22billion and missed the average estimate of $22.32billion. JPMorgan reported a 17 per cent jump in quarterly profit, topping analyst expectations as higher interest rates fueled trading activity and helped the largest US bank earn more from lending. The Federal Reserve's decision to hike rates in March for the second time in three months led investors to reposition portfolios, as did elections in Europe and news about Britain's progress in leaving the European Union. That increased activity boosted first-quarter revenue in JPMorgan's markets-related businesses, particularly fixed-income trading. 13:07 Banks to crack down on credit card borrowing Banks are cutting back on credit card lending because of concerns that the economy is deteriorating and workers' ability to repay might be hit, new official figures suggest. Banks and building societies will make it harder for households to take on credit as they expect to ‘significantly’ tighten the credit scoring criteria for people asking for loans and especially for credit cards in the second quarter. The latest credit conditions survey by the Bank of England shows that the amount of unsecured credit made available to households in the first quarter has already decreased - and they expect it to diminish further in the second quarter. Read the full story here.  12:36 FTSE 100 lower after faith in Trump falls to a fresh low The FTSE 100 was clocking up losses ahead of the Easter holiday as US banks prepared to report earnings. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was off 40 points at 7,308.3 at lunch, on track to post a loss for the week. Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Standard Chartered and Barclays all fell by 1 percent to 1.6 percent, as investors anticipated earnings releases from their US counterparts later in the day. Energy stocks were also lower. BP and Royal Dutch Shell both were down around 1.4 percent as the price of oil headed south. Primark-owner Associated British Foods jumped 3.4 per cent to its highest level since the beginning of January after Jefferies raised its rating on the stock to a 'buy', citing continued strength in sugar and a turn in Primark margins. Precious metals miners were also in demand, with Fresnillo and Randgold Resources both gaining more than 1.2 per cent. The underlying price of gold hit a five-month peak as investors sought safe-haven assets amid rising geopolitical tensions over US relations with Russia and North Korea. 11:41 And the fallers, led down by the banks and oil majors 11:39 Here are the top risers so far this session 11:25 UK banks feeling the pinch this session before their American cousins unveil results The sell-off in bond yields following Trump’s comments on the dollar and preference for low interest rates have knocked banks. On top of this there’s some nervousness ahead of today’s earnings reports from Citigroup, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, analysts have said. The last few months have seen a sharp downturn in US commercial and industrial loan growth which is now at its lowest level since 2011, along with a slumps in real estate and consumer loans. HSBC down 1.7 per cent Royal Bank of Scotland off 1.5 per cent Barclays lower by 1.1 per cent 11:19 Traders starting to question whether Trump has a coherent view or whether he makes it up on the hoof David Cheetham, analyst at XTB, said: 'As US President Donald Trump approaches three months in office, the mountain of evidence suggesting that he doesn’t have a clearly defined strategy and is susceptible to a change of tack on a dime continues to grow. 'The recent actions in Syria are a clear contravention of his views expressed through a series of tweets aimed at the prior administration in 2013, during which he stated: “to our foolish leader, do not attack Syria - if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the US gets nothing”. 'The irony of this, considering his recent actions, is clearly lost on Trump now that he occupies the Oval Office. 'US-Russia relations continue to deteriorate as the Kremlin must surely be starting to regret their open joy expressed at Trump’s unexpected victory as the two nations’ relationship threatens to grow increasingly hostile.' 10:35 The Trump U-turn has fully kicked in and it is a big worry for investors A major interview yesterday with the Wall Street Journal marked a turnaround in a host of issues, including China, NATO and economic policy. Having spoken out against a weak dollar and the Fed’s policies, it looks like someone in Washington has laid out the facts for President Trump. As a result, markets are continuing to unwind the rally that has dominated in stocks since November, while the US dollar is in retreat across the board. It is, of course, folly to try to work out policy from the President’s statements, but the shift to safe havens goes on, with low volumes ahead of a long weekend amplifying the moves. 10:08 BOND NEWS: German Bund yields hit 2017 low as prices rise German borrowing costs hit the lowest level of the year as investors piled into risk-free assets amid rising geopolitical tensions and US President Donald Trump's comments about low interest rates last night. Yields on 10-year German bunds, which move the other way to prices, fell 3 basis points in early European trading to 0.17 per cent, the lowest level of the year. Two-year bund yields, known as schatz, were also on the move, falling 3 basis points to -0.88 per cent. Global bond markets have been in the spotlight this week amid rising tensions in Asia and the Middle East, notably in relation to threats from North Korea and a standoff between Russia and the United States over last week's airstrikes in Syria. That helped push 10-year Treasury note yields to a November low of 2.23 per cent, extending a rally that is set to deliver the biggest one-week fall in yields since last June.  The moves were given further force yesterday after Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he felt the dollar is 'getting too strong' and that he hoped the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates low as a result.  09:56 What can we expect from the big US banks this afternoon, not a lot say the experts Big US lenders are expected to report another round of uninspiring quarterly results this week, which analysts said could dampen a 'Trump rally' in bank stocks fueled by expectations the new president would lighten financial regulation and boost the economy. The season kicks off today, when three of the country's biggest lenders, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, report first-quarter results. Rivals Bank of America Corp, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley report the following week. On average, analysts expect the six biggest US banks to see a net income increase of 4.7 percent compared to the prior year. While that may sound like a big gain, the year-ago quarter was an awful one for the banking sector, which saw capital markets activity and loan growth dry up amid mounting macroeconomic concerns. Several analysts lowered earnings estimates last week, citing loan weakness as well as sharp declines in revenue from stock trading, where commissions have come under pressure from a new regulation in Europe and broader troubles for active asset managers. Big banks have been struggling to earn decent returns on shareholder equity for some time. In recent years, they have been spending billions of dollars to settle legal claims and comply with new regulations and capital requirements. They have also launched massive cost-cutting programs and revenue-boosting initiatives. 09:41 Royal Mail investors cheer closing of company pension plan, no doubt employees are less impressed Royal Mail will close its final salary pension scheme next year as it faces costs ballooning to more than £1billion a year. The company has said it cannot afford to keep the pension plan open, and will close it at the end of March 2018. Royal Mail shares are up 3.3p at 422.5p. Nicholas Hyett, at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'Shares in Royal Mail are up this morning after the group finally announced it will be shutting its existing pension plan. Despite the scheme currently running a surplus, an impending review of company contributions has been hanging over the group for some time. 'Royal Mail’s current contributions to this scheme alone are about 10 per cent of total salary costs, including wages of staff who are not members of the scheme. These were expected to more than double to over £1billion in 2018, equivalent to around 25 per cent of the group’s entire 2015/16 UK wage bill. 'However, with a highly unionised workforce, which has in the past shown itself willing to flex its muscle in defence members’ rights, introducing an alternative plan is likely to prove costly. Whether those costs will be in the form of chunky employer contributions to a new defined contribution scheme or lost revenue from industrial action remains to be seen.' 09:20 HSS Hire boss to step down The boss of troubled tool rental firm HSS Hire is to step down after eight years at the company and 19 months in the top post. The announcement of John Gill’s departure comes a week after HSS posted losses before tax of £17.4million last year, higher than losses of £13.8million in 2015 and £8.5million in 2014. Shares in the small cap company fell more than 5 per cent in early trading to then recoup some ground and trade 2.3 per cent, or 1.5p lower at 62.50p. Read the full story here.  09:01 BONDS NEWS: US Treasuries took a tumble last night on Trump comments Treasury yields headed lower last night after US President Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal he favoured lower interest rates. The dollar also slumped, falling to a five-month low against the yen, after US President Donald Trump helped accelerate its recent decline by saying the currency was too strong. US Treasury yields slid to 2.232 per cent, just slightly above a five-month low of 2.221 hit earlier in the session. 08:38 Some company updates and results for those still stuck in the office Sainsbury plans to convert 60 Argos general merchandise stores to a digital format and open more in-store Habitat outlets over the next year, it has said. Tool and equipment rental firm HSS Hire announced that chief executive John Gill will step down once a successor is appointed. British recruitment company Hays forecast full-year profit at the top end of market expectations after reporting record third-quarter net fees as international hiring offset weakness in the UK market following the Brexit vote. 08:27 Today is all about US bank earnings JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo will all release results later this afternoon. Forecasts are for both Citi and JP Morgan to increase revenues by 4 per cent and 9 per cent respectively, while the Wells Fargo accounts scandal will likely draw a dark cloud over the bank and cause a 4 per cent decline in revenue. 08:24 FTSE 100 of 36 points at 7,312.8 heading into the Easter holidays {"id":"4407886","channel":"/money","pageUrl":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-4407886/US-bank-earnings-set-dominate-quiet-session.html","status":"running","greenBox":{"body":""},"modifiedOrder":1} 0 0 Share or comment on this article e-mail 5 shares I got a brand new 12-sided £1 coin in my change but it's...

Through TASP, the Center for Community Progress (Community Progress), a national nonprofit, will help local governments and other stakeholders break new ground in their efforts to address property vacancy, abandonment, and deterioration.   The three recipients were chosen through a competitive process, which included a written application round followed by an in-person site assessment for five finalists. Proposed projects are reviewed on a range of criteria, including the potential for innovation from which other cities can learn, demonstrated leadership to implement reform, overall scale of vacancy challenges, and need for outside assistance.   “Albany, Huntington, and Memphis have each demonstrated a commitment to strengthening their revitalization work to benefit local residents,” said Tamar Shapiro, president and CEO of the Center for Community Progress. “We are excited to work in each of these places to pioneer strategies that will not only help these communities, but also other places that will learn from these efforts.”   Each city will receive up to 400 hours of assistance from a team of national experts over eight months between April and November 2017. Assistance may include a diagnosis of the most pressing problems, evaluation of current systems and strategies, and recommendations on solutions that involve key government decision-makers, residents, and other stakeholders. Grant funding from JPMorgan Chase provides the program’s support.   “Addressing blight is one of the most impactful ways to improve neighborhoods and local economies,” said Janis Bowdler, Head of Community Development at JPMorgan Chase. “By arming city leadership with technical assistance through the Center for Community Progress, we are giving them the tools they need to drive inclusive economic growth in a highly tactical and productive way.”   HUNTINGTON, West Virginia In Huntington, technical assistance will help the Huntington Urban Renewal Authority and other local and statewide stakeholders unpack the costs that vacant and abandoned properties impose on municipal government and residents. This work will focus on delinquent tax enforcement systems, public safety, and neighborhood stabilization. The goal is to raise awareness among rural communities seeking to better understand the costs of, and solutions for, vacancy and abandonment in West Virginia and beyond.     “We are honored to be a recipient of a technical assistance scholarship from the Center for Community Progress. We have been innovative in addressing our vacant and abandoned properties, and we intend to set a standard that others will follow,” said Mayor Steve Williams. “The Center for Community Progress is a leading advocate on addressing distressed properties and has been an active partner with the City of Huntington. We look forward to expanding that relationship further.”   ALBANY, New York In Albany, technical assistance will strengthen the partnership between the Albany County Land Bank and the Albany Community Land Trust. Land banks and community land trusts are each critical tools in the work to address vacancy and abandonment, but around the country, their efforts have rarely intersected. This innovative partnership will demonstrate how, by working together on tangible projects, land banks and community land trusts can strengthen each other’s efforts in support of improved community outcomes.   “This honor from the Center for Community Progress highlights the good works done by the Land Bank and its progress toward renewing our community,” said Albany County Executive Daniel P. McCoy. “It also confirms that our investment in the Land Bank is bringing returns for potential home buyers and the taxpayers.”     MEMPHIS, Tennessee In Memphis, technical assistance will assess the legal systems pertaining to receivership and property tax enforcement. It will identify reforms that will support the transfer of clear, marketable title to the Blight Authority of Memphis (BAM). This project will be an innovative, tangible example of how receivership can work alongside property tax enforcement and land banking to support clear, marketable title for properties.   "Our administration is focused on reducing blight -- both to aid our core city’s renaissance and to simply give every Memphian a neighborhood they can be proud of,” said Mayor Jim Strickland. “We’re grateful for this assistance from the Center for Community Progress, which we think will only further amplify what we’re doing in Memphis.”   Since its founding in 2010, the Center for Community Progress has provided technical assistance to more than 200 communities across 30 states. Community Progress launched TASP in 2014 in response to two needs: first, the need to develop fresh approaches to problem properties that could become models for cities to replicate, and second, the need to provide individual cities with affordable, high-quality guidance in the fight to remediate vacant, abandoned, and deteriorated properties.   This is the fifth round of the Technical Assistance Scholarship Program.

Everbright plans to offer 560 million new shares at between HK$5.18 and HK$5.90 each, according to a filing to the stock exchange, valuing the company at up to HK$11.8 billion. That would make Everbright the biggest IPO by an alternative energy company in Hong Kong since 2009, when Longyuan Power Group Corp.’s US$2.6 billion offer, according to Bloomberg data. “People were initially concerned that the green technology business in solar and wind projects will require a lot of investment and as a result cause very volatile returns,” said UOB Kay Hian’s strategist Hannah Li. “But the plans were already mostly priced in by the market previously, while the decision to spin off the greentech business may actually help improve Everbright International’s valuations in the medium to long term.” Everbright International’s core businesses in environmental protection and waste treatment are actually viewed quite positively, Li said. The plans were already mostly priced in by the market previously, while the decision to spin off the greentech business may actually help improve Everbright International’s valuation in the medium to long term Hannah Li, strategist, UOB Kay Hian Proceeds from the IPO could be used to finance Greentech’s investments in projects that use agricultural and forest by-products to generate electricity, according to a preliminary prospectus. Greentech’s projects are mainly located in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces. Everbright’s chief executive Chen Xiaoping had said in February that the company had decided to delay the timing of the IPO of its greentech operations from late last year so that “both existing and new shareholders will have a chance to appreciate the 2016 results and the prospect of the 2017 operations.” The business is expected to benefit from Chinese policies to fight environmental degradation. China’s answer to ‘An Inconvenient Truth’ sparks rush for shares in green-tech companies The company posted a better than expected 33 per cent rise in annual profit and raised its dividend payout. It obtained 44 new projects worth 14.4 billion yuan last year - both historical records. Net profit rose for the eighth year in 2016, advancing 33.6 per cent to HK$2.78 billion. Everbright’s shares fell as much as 2.6 per cent amid a declining market following the company’s spin-off announcement, the biggest intraday decline in four months, before paring its losses to 1.5 per cent to HK$10.72.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 April 2017 by Military News Dow Jones Industrial Average Sinks 138 Points as U.S. Strikes Afghanistan Shutterstock photo After clawing its way to modest gains at midday, the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)  took a sharp turn lower on news the U.S. had dropped a ” MOAB ” — or „Mother of All Bombs” — on an Islamic State tunnel target in Afghanistan. This only added to the geopolitical jitters that have kept stocks in check this week, and sent the CBOE Volatility Index ( VIX ) spiking to its highest perch in five months. Financial shares were also on the radar, as  big banks welcomed in first-quarter earnings season. Amid mixed results for JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, the Dow closed south of its 10-week moving average for the first time since the U.S. presidential election. Continue reading for more on today’s market, including: The 7 top stocks for bullish contrarian traders. Options traders are taking a defensive stance on United stock ahead of earnings. 3 energy stocks that got whacked by analysts. Plus, VIX call buyers vanish; a surging mining stock; and a glimmer of hope for SeaWorld. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA – 20,453.25) closed at its session low, down 138.6 points, or 0.7% — bringing its weekly deficit to 1%. Chevron stock’s 2.6% drop paced the 28 Dow decliners. Disney and Visa were the two gainers, adding 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. The  S&P 500 Index (SPX – 2,328.95)  gave back 16 points, or 0.7%, while the Nasdaq Composite (COMP – 5,805.15) shed 31 points, or 0.5% — also at their session lows. For the week, the SPX and COMP shed a respective 1.1% and 1.2%. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX – 15.96)  topped out at a session high of 16.22, before closing up 0.2 point, or 1.2%. On a weekly basis, the market’s „fear gauge” surged 24%. 5 Items on Our Radar Today In a series of tweets today, Tesla CEO Elon Musk set a September reveal date for the company’s electric semi truck, noting it was „Seriously next level.” Plans for the semi truck were first hinted at in Part 2 of Musk’s ” master plan ,” released last summer.   (TechCrunch) Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said the bank expects the fees related to last year’s account scandal to range between $70 million and $80 million per quarter for „several quarters.” This is more than the estimate of $50 million to $60 million the bank gave back in February.  (Bloomberg) VIX call buyers vanished ahead of the recent volatility spike. Hecla Mining stock surged amid a broader commodities boom, bringing its one-month gain north of 30%. SeaWorld received an upbeat „buy” initiation today, which gave the troubled stock a much-needed boost.

Reuters Published Monday, Apr. 10, 2017 9:46AM EDT Last updated Monday, Apr. 10, 2017 9:46AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s main stock index fell on Monday as financial and gold mining shares lost ground, offsetting gains for the energy group as oil prices rose. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was down 8.23 points, or 0.05 per cent, at 15,658.90, shortly after the open. Five of the index’s 10 main groups were lower. U.S. stocks opened little changed on Monday as investors prepared for big banks to kick off the first-quarter earnings season later in the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 13.73 points, or 0.07 per cent, at 20,669.83, the S&P 500 was up 1.52 points, or 0.064529 per cent, at 2,357.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.04 points, or 0.1 per cent, at 5,883.86. JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Thursday and could throw light on the U.S. banking industry’s performance after a strong finish in the fourth quarter. Investors are keenly watching the quarterly results to justify lofty market valuations following a post-election rally, sparked off by bets that President Donald Trump would introduce pro-growth policies. Earnings of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 10.1 per cent in the first three months of the year, the most since the fourth-quarter of 2014. The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “It looks like the start of a quiet holiday week after an underwhelming Friday, where much could have happened but didn’t,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, NJ. “Unless there is a significant headline to derail what looks to be a quiet morning, I think the focus is going to be on earnings and what the companies say.” Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak in Michigan after markets close. Investors will be looking to clues on the central bank’s plans to trim its $4.5 trillion balance sheet after recent comments from Fed officials. Muted trading volumes across many financial assets on Monday and the dollar rising to a three-week high underscored investor caution against making big bets in the face of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the Korean peninsula. The U.S. dollar inched higher drawing support from U.S. rate hike expectations while global stocks, reaching the point where some see them as expensive, were stuck in neutral ahead of U.S. earnings season this week. European stocks were off 0.1 per cent with industrials and energy sectors the biggest drags. Shares of mining major BHP Billiton were up more than 3 per cent, however, after activist hedge fund Elliot Management urged the company to pursue a spin-off of its U.S. business. The company, in a statement, said the costs involved with Elliott’s proposals outweigh their benefits. The increased geopolitical risks continued to spur investors to move into safer assets such as government debt. Top aides to U.S. President Donald Trump differed on Sunday on where U.S. policy on Syria was headed after last week’s attack on a Syrian air base, while U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned the strikes were a warning to other nations, including North Korea. “Given that geopolitical tensions escalated last week, it is reasonable to expect a shift in favor of the US dollar, at least in the short-term,” analysts at Rabobank said in a note. The euro edged lower and France’s borrowing costs hit their highest level over Germany in six weeks as investors fretted over the rise of far-left candidate Jean Luc Melenchon in polls before this month’s presidential vote. Mr. Melenchon’s emergence over the past week has raised the possibility that he will square off against far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the decisive second round in May, making the final result far more unpredictable. France’s bond yield spread over Germany hit 70 basis points in early trading on Monday, its highest since Feb. 27 ,. “The market is focusing a bit too much on the extreme possibilities, but I guess with the elections coming up so soon some nerves are inevitable,” said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk. “But at the end of the day I think (the second round) will be Macron versus Le Pen.” Global stocks have traded flat over the past month after the 10 percent rise since last November’s lows took valuations above long-term averages. The MSCI AC World index trades at 16 times forward earnings, compared to a 15-year average of about 14 times. In commodities, oil prices rose nearly 1 percent supported by strong demand and uncertainty over the conflict in Syria and another shutdown at Libya’s largest oilfield. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were up 55 cents at $55.79 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 50 cents at $52.75 a barrel.  Report Typo/Error Also on The Globe and Mail Carrick Talks Money: Four personal finance books millennials should read (The Globe and Mail)   JPM-NJPMorgan Chase & Co Latest Price$84.40 -1.00 (-1.17%) C-NCitigroup Inc Latest Price$58.04 -0.47 (-0.80%) WFC-NWells Fargo & Co Latest Price$51.35 -1.77 (-3.33%) CL-FTCrude Oil Front Month Futures Latest Price$52.91 -0.20 (-0.38%) GC-FTGold Front Month Futures Latest Price$1,286.30 +11.00 (+0.86%) TSXS&P/TSX Composite Latest Price15,535.48 -112.92 (-0.72%) DJIADow Jones Industrials Latest Price20,453.25 -138.61 (-0.67%) SPXS&P 500 INDEX Latest Price2,328.95 -15.98 (-0.68%) COMPNASDAQ NMS COMPOSITE INDEX Latest Price5,805.15 0.00 (0.00%) Updated April 13 4:00 PM EDT. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

Olivia Oran, Sinead Carew and Chuck Mikolajczak Reuters Published Monday, Apr. 10, 2017 11:27AM EDT Last updated Monday, Apr. 10, 2017 11:27AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Big U.S. lenders are expected to report another round of uninspiring quarterly results this week, which analysts said could dampen a “Trump rally” in bank stocks fueled by expectations the new president would lighten financial regulation and boost the economy. Of particular concern is a recent slowdown in loan growth, driven partly by an uptick in interest rates that dissuaded consumers and companies from refinancing loans. In February, outstanding loans across the U.S. banking industry declined for the first time in more than three years, according to Federal Reserve data. Loans fell slightly for the first quarter overall. Analysts and investors said the lending slowdown came as a surprise, and appeared related not only to declines in mortgage refinancing and corporate borrowing but also to uncertainty about U.S. policy and economic growth. “The loan metric doesn’t fit with the optimistic tone we’ve seen from the banks,” said Patrick Kaser, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global in Philadelphia who invests in bank stocks. The Fed lifted its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points in March, marking the second such hike in three months. But the recent climb in short-term rates has been accompanied by a drop in longer-term rates, bringing the two closer together. When yields flatten in that manner, it is not helpful to bank earnings either. The season kicks off on Thursday, when three of the country’s biggest lenders, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co, report first-quarter results. Rivals Bank of America Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley report the following week. On average, analysts expect the six biggest U.S. banks to see a net income increase of 4.7 per cent compared to the prior year, according to Reuters data. While that may sound like a big gain, the year-ago quarter was an awful one for the banking sector, which saw capital markets activity and loan growth dry up amid mounting macroeconomic concerns. Several analysts lowered earnings estimates last week, citing loan weakness as well as sharp declines in revenue from stock trading, where commissions have come under pressure from a new regulation in Europe and broader troubles for active asset managers. Fewer deals in the first quarter also imply lower revenue from M&A banking. Altogether, the weak points are expected to outweigh small gains anticipated in businesses like fixed-income trading and wealth management. Evercore ISI bank analyst Glenn Schorr described the quarter as “OK” but “definitely not the gangbusters quarter everybody was hoping for.” Big banks have been struggling to earn decent returns on shareholder equity for some time. In recent years, they have been spending billions of dollars to settle legal claims and comply with new regulations and capital requirements. They have also launched massive cost-cutting programs and revenue-boosting initiatives. When November’s U.S. election installed Donald Trump in the White House and business-friendly leadership in Congress, investors tended to think tough regulations would be eased and the economy would strengthen. Bank stocks were the biggest beneficiary of the so-called Trump rally, with the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index rising 32 per cent from Nov. 7 to a peak on March 1. Banks were also the biggest contributors to gains in major blue chip indexes. But since then bank stocks have lost some of their shine, falling 6 per cent in the last month even as the broader market remained mostly flat. With the U.S. Congress unable to pass laws on issues more pressing than financial deregulation, analysts said uncertainty around U.S. polices including trade, taxes and spending may weigh on the economy in the near term. “Expectations were high coming into the year and while 1Q is by no means a bad quarter, revenues are probably less strong than market moves would have implied,” said Macquarie analyst David Konrad.

JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc posted higher first-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ expectations on large gains in trading revenue. Wells Fargo & Co, which relies more on traditional lending and less on markets-related businesses, reported a slight dip in profit due to a slowdown in mortgage banking. The results underscored concerns expressed recently by analysts and investors that higher interest rates, combined with uncertainty about geopolitical events, could hurt economic growth - and therefore crimp lenders’ bottom lines. But on conference calls to discuss results, top bank executives dismissed those concerns, citing strong demand from borrowers with impressive credit quality. “I wouldn’t overreact to the short term in our loan growth with so many things that affect it,” said JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. The bank’s core loan portfolio averaged US$812 billion (RM3.2 trillion) during the first quarter, up 9 per cent on an annualised basis. But that growth rate has ticked down from 12 per cent in the previous quarter and 17 per cent a year ago. Wells Fargo’s annual loan growth rate of 4 per cent has also been slowing over the past year. Citigroup’s loan book has been skewed by divestitures and its acquisition of a credit-card portfolio. Adjusting for those matters, Citi’s core loan book grew 5 per cent in the first quarter, executives said. But management’s outlook for loan growth has nonetheless been tempered. “There was probably just some modest reduction in our expectation for loan growth ... compared to the earlier guidance, certainly following the first-quarter performance,” Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said. Across the banking industry, loans fell slightly during the first three months of the year, according to Federal Reserve data. John Conlon, chief equity strategist at People’s United Wealth Management, who invests in bank stocks, said he is still concerned about loan growth after seeing the reports and listening to the executives’ comments. “There’s a great deal of optimism,” Conlon said, “but there’s still uncertainty.” Wells Fargo’s shares were down 2.6 per cent at US$51.75, while Citigroup’s stock was down 0.7 per cent at US$58.12 and JPMorgan fell 0.6 per cent to US$84.88. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index fell 0.8 per cent. The mortgage business is putting particular pressure on loan growth. The recent uptick in interest rates has crushed a wave of mortgage refinancing that kicked off in 2010, leading to big declines in mortgage banking revenue. Other areas of lending have also slowed. For instance, some big corporate borrowers have been opting to issue bonds rather than take out traditional loans, JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said. And, in areas where banks are finding growth, like credit-card lending, they are doling out fat rewards and cutting interest rates to lure customers from one another. Even so, bank executives sounded optimistic yesterday about the outlook for lending. Higher rates allow banks to earn more money from the loans they make, as well as the idle cash they have invested in low-risk securities like Treasury bonds. JPMorgan expects to add another US$400 million to its net interest income in the second quarter. That metric is important because it shows the difference between what banks pay for funds and what they earn from using them. Additionally, they said, signals that lawmakers and the White House want to spur the economy bode well for loan growth. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said first-quarter lending reflects some waiting by borrowers for Washington to act. “We haven’t seen concrete changes yet in policies,” Gerspach said. “When we get tax reform when the administration is successful in implementing some of what they have been talking about — hopefully that will spur the economy on.” — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Bank Negara said to mull enforcing foreign insurer ownership cap Ringgit opens higher on buying sentiment Village Grocer buys up Ben’s Independent Grocer Apple considers bidding for Toshiba's chip business Bursa opens lower on lack of fresh leads Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Village Grocer buys up Ben’s Independent Grocer Malaysian-based I Synergy puts expansion plan in place Petronas pitches RM4.4b offshore gas project stake to oil firms, sources say Demand for Malaysian palm oil set to rebound, says Council Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: SUVs take over New York auto show Reuters Video: United passenger suffered concussion, broken nose, says lawyer Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Bloomberg Video: Former ambassador surprised by fast Trump Syria decision Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines Related Articles Hopes fade for US bank earnings despite rally in financial shares US whistleblower wins US$5m and job back JPMorgan said in talks for Dublin office as Citi weighs EU unit Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan suspend YouTube ads over offensive videos (VIDEO) More Wells Fargo customers may be affected by sales scandal Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login A Ray of Light from the Big Banks Posted on April 13, 2017 by Brad Hoppmann The equity markets have been mired in uncertainty this week, as geopolitical hotspots Syria, North Korea and Afghanistan all have caused a bit of a risk-off trade in stocks. Then there are the homegrown policy concerns still plaguing Wall Street, including healthcare reform and corporate tax reform. After saying he would pivot to tax reform following the recent Congressional failure on healthcare, President Trump now appears to be renewing his efforts on the healthcare front. While the geopolitical and policy uncertainty abroad and in Washington are weighing down stocks here, what we really need to start seeing is a return to good earnings to let us know what’s next for markets. Thursday, we got the first salvo in the Q1 earnings bombardment, and we got it in the form of earnings from several key financial bellwethers. For those wanting to see positive hard data start to back up the recent positive sentiment indicators, today was a pretty good day. Three of the four major financials reporting today bested estimates, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and PNC Financial Services Group (PNC). So, is this ray of earnings light from these banks enough to illuminate the way forward for the bulls? In the case of JPM, it reported EPS of $1.65 on revenues of $25.6 billion in Q1. This easily bested expectations. On the revenue front, JPM saw a 34% year-over-year gain to $1.65 billion in its investment banking operation. That’s an upbeat sign for the economy and markets going forward. JPMorgan’s high-profile CEO Jamie Dimon also made some upbeat comments about the quarter, and about the future of the bank and the economy in the firm’s earnings release. "U.S. consumers and businesses are healthy overall and with pro-growth initiatives and improving collaboration between government and business, the U.S. economy can continue to improve … We will be there to do our part, strong and steadfast in good times and bad, and working every day to support our clients and our communities." Dimon also noted that the bank’s consumer businesses continued to grow. The bank saw $622.9 billion in deposits, up 11% year-over-year. Loans also increased by 5% to $466.8 billion. "The consumer businesses continue to grow core loans at double-digits, outperform the industry in deposit growth, and we once again had very strong card sales volume growth this quarter — reflecting our commitment to providing our customers the innovative products and services they want." The JPM loan metrics are encouraging, as they somewhat contradict the recent data we presented in Tuesday’s Afternoon Edition, "How Come Nobody Wants to Borrow Money?" As for the other financials reporting Thursday, there were good metrics from Citigroup (C), which bested estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The company reported quarterly profits were up 17% from the same quarter a year ago, driven by higher revenue and the lower cost of credit. C’s top line increased 3% to $18.1 billion, beating estimates of $17.8 billion. On the bottom line, EPS roared in at $1.35 vs. estimates calling for just $1.24. PNC Financial Services Group (PNC) also posted an earnings beat, with EPS of $1.96 vs. estimates for just $1.84. Revenue for the quarter also was strong at $3.88 billion, a 6% rise year over year, and better than the $3.77 billion analysts were anticipating. The only financial stock that didn’t knock it out of the park was embattled money center bank Wells Fargo (WFC). Not surprisingly, the phony account scandal took its toll on the bank’s top and bottom lines. Still, Q1 profit managed to come in flat even though revenue fell short of estimates. The bottom line here is that this first round of bank earnings is encouraging. And despite the noise of geopolitical tensions and Washington policy concerns, hard economic data might actually be OK for Q1. At least, that’s what the bulls are hoping for. *** Gold bulls sure are having a party right now. And Sean Brodrick, our resident small-cap mining expert, says the party hasn’t even gotten started in earnest! Mining for Money This Gold Party Ain’t Started Yet By Sean Brodrick You know who hates this market right now? Every investor who hasn’t bought gold and miners, thinking the rally this year is just a flash in the pan. I see "sour grapes" stories in the mainstream media all the time, talking about how gold is doomed. Doomed! DOO-OOMED! Ha! I welcome their hatred of this rally. Their bitterness. They’ll change their minds eventually. And you know what? Plenty of ’em, when they finally go long, will STILL make money. That’s because this gold rally hasn’t even really started yet. Let me show you a long-term chart of gold. Permalink This chart shows the last big bull market in gold, and the subsequent 5-year-long bear market, and the new bull market. Wait! No! It doesn’t show a new bull market at all. Even though I’m certain gold entered a new bull market at the beginning of 2016, chart-wise, that rally isn’t enough to break the big bearish trend that has been in place for six long years! That’s right. The downtrend started before the official bear market began. Gold has trended lower for six years! So could the bears be right? Could gold’s doom be nigh? Well, sure. If every darned fundamental that I’ve been hammering about didn’t exist. Peak gold. Rising inflation. The ballooning Asian middle class. The cyclical nature of gold. And more! But those bullish forces DO exist. The tide in gold has turned. And we are getting closer to a big breakout. And let me tell you this: Every investor who is long gold and miners should stand up and give President Trump a standing ovation. He’s the force behind the recent gold rally. First he bombed Syria. Then he threatened North Korea. Then he dropped all talk of China being a "currency manipulator." Then the Prez told the Wall Street Journal that the U.S. dollar is "too strong." Result: The U.S. dollar looked back over its shoulder wistfully, then did a nose-dive off the roof. And as the greenback tumbled lower, gold jumped higher. That’s the "seesaw of pain" I keep telling you about. Then today, Mr. Trump bombed an ISIS target in Afghanistan. And gold gleamed even more. Sure, I expect that what Trump giveth, he can taketh away. If and when things smooth over with North Korea, we’ll see a pullback in gold. Likewise, he talked the dollar down one week, so he can talk it up the next. And there is still plenty of bearish sentiment lately. That’s why many miners have been laggards. Investors do not believe it. Heck, mining companies don’t believe it. French investment and bullion bank Natixis tells BullionVault that producers are selling gold into the current surge. Why? I’ll tell you why! Because a five-year bear market has crushed their hopes. They see a six-year downtrend looming dead ahead, and they are panicking. But downtrends are made to be broken. Oh boy, are they. The fact is, gold is making higher highs and higher lows. We HAVE hit peak gold production. Gold is so cyclical it should be in the Tour de France. And those cycles are gearing up. Way up. Let me show you one more chart before I go. Showing that you haven’t missed the boat. It’s a chart of gold’s daily price action through Wednesday. Permalink Sure, gold bulled through overhead resistance at $1,260. That resistance is now support. But there is even bigger resistance at $1,309. Now, we might get there quickly. Recently, I told you just how quickly gold can fill an overhead gap in volume. But gold might also zig-zag. The market causes the maximum amount of pain to the maximum number of investors — you know that. We could even see gold zag downward to test its recent uptrend before it really breaks you. You know, in your gut, that such a dip would be a heck of a buying opportunity. But too many will listen to the sour grapes of Wall Street. It’s very hard to buy that kind of dip. But if such a dip happens, those who do buy it could position themselves very nicely for gold’s next big bull move. And when that happens, I have a select group of smaller gold and silver stocks. They’re overlooked by Wall Street. And they should shine very brightly indeed. And that big rally is coming. Sour grapes be damned. Best, Sean *** I want to know what you think, so if you have a comment or question about today’s Afternoon Edition topic, or any of the topics we cover, just leave me a comment on our website or send me an e-mail. *** The Dow fell 138 points (-0.7%) after the U.S. dropped the "mother of all bombs" on an Islamic State target in Afghanistan. The 21,600-pound, GPS-guided, non-nuclear bomb was aimed at a cave and tunnel complex where ISIS fighters move freely. All sectors on the S&P 500 ended the day in the red. • Saudis sell $9 billion in bonds: The first international sale of Islamic bonds saw five-year notes sold at 2.93% and 10-year notes at 3.65%. • Adding to the case for rising rates: Weekly jobless claims dipped to 243,000 last week. (Economists expected 245K.) And producer prices saw their largest year-over-year increase in five years. • Oil up 1.8% for the week: The Saudis continue to express interest in extending OPEC’s production-cut deal past the summer. • Holiday weekend: Stock, bond and commodity markets will be closed tomorrow. European and Asian markets will also be closed Monday. However, the U.S. and Canadian markets will be back in business on Monday. And that’s when we will return with your next Afternoon Edition. So, let us take this opportunity to wish you a safe and happy long weekend!

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly By Reuters Apr 13, 2017 at 4:26 pm | Print View Major U.S. stock indexes fell on Thursday for a third straight day as investors weighed earnings reports from big banks and geopolitical tensions, while the tech sector fell for a tenth consecutive session. Wells Fargo shares fell 3.3 percent, pulling down the S&P 500, after the bank reported a drop in mortgage banking revenue. Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed late on Wednesday that it had cut its stake in the bank. JPMorgan fell 1.2 percent and Citigroup slipped 0.8 percent, even as those companies reported better-than-expected quarterly profits. Banks revealed more evidence of a slowdown in loan growth in their reports. The S&P 500 banks index closed at its lowest point since early December. Investors have sought safe-haven assets throughout the week due to geopolitical tensions in Syria and North Korea. News of a massive bomb being dropped by the United States in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday added to uncertainty. Kate Warne, principal investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said a dip in bond yields put pressure on stocks ahead of a holiday weekend in the United States. “What we’ve seen is investors from the rest of the world putting more money in U.S. Treasuries” due to geopolitical concerns, Warne said. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 138.61 points, or 0.67 percent, to 20,453.25, the S&P 500 lost 15.98 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,328.95 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 31.01 points, or 0.53 percent, to 5,805.15. The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed 8.9 percent since President Donald Trump’s Nov. 8 election, supported by his planned economic agenda of tax cuts and economic stimulus. But the rally has stalled the past six weeks as some investors question Trump’s ability to enact his proposals. There is “some concern among investors that there is now a shift going on in Washington to international and away from a domestic policy,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. The S&P 500 financial index dropped 1.3 percent, its fifth straight day of losses. Energy shares were the worst-performing group, falling 1.8 percent. The technology sector fell 0.4 percent, marking its longest losing streak since May 2012. The results from banks kicked off what is expected to be a strong first-quarter U.S. reporting season. S&P 500 companies are expected to post a 10.4 percent rise in earnings for the period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We could have double-digit earnings growth; we haven’t seen that in some time,” said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. “Investors are going to be impressed with that.” A report from the University of Michigan showed that consumer sentiment unexpectedly strengthened in April as consumer optimism on current economic conditions climbed to its highest level since November 2000.

The 10-year U.S. yield fell about two basis points to 2.22 percent at 1:10 p.m. in New York, remaining above its session low reached in early U.S. trading. The yield curve from five to 30 years steepened, while the 10-year breakeven inflation rate pared its gain. Treasuries are poised to rally for the fifth straight week, the longest stretch since July, with yields within the selloff zone created after U.S. Election Day on Nov. 8. JPMorgan Chase & Co. technical strategists said the 10-year yield has the potential to fall to 1.88 percent on a bullish break of 2.15 percent, though they expect support levels to hold. VIDEOS TOP JOBS U.S. forces in Afghanistan deployed the military's largest non-nuclear bomb, a GBU-43, on a IS target in Afghanistan, according to U.S. Central Command. It comes less than a week after the U.S. launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles against the Syrian government, sparking geopolitical tensions that have largely driven Treasuries' gains. • Gains cement weekly rally into Thursday's Sifma-recommended 2pm close of trading for USD-denominated cash fixed income (and full close Friday) • Trump added to the rally on Wednesday by saying "I do like a low-interest rate policy, I must be honest with you," in an interview with WSJ; also said he remains open to keeping Fed Chair Janet Yellen on once her term is up next year • Japanese investors sold 2.18 trillion yen of foreign bonds in the week ended April 7, the largest net sale in two years • Initial jobless claims came in at 234,000, beating the estimate of 245,000 • High-frequency indicators like TY dollar-weighted put/call ratios are approaching overbought zones, and relative to cyclically sensitive benchmarks such as Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, Treasuries are near low end of a well-defined range in place since 2010, JPM said.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Say cheers to these three new Salt Lake City bars Once free despite his sex assault convictions, it's prison for former Mormon bishop Utah Jazz are healthier, but are they healthy enough?

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UUvqce ALSO READ Wells Fargo's profit flat, costs and mortgages weigh Wells Fargo reports slight drop in profit Wells Fargo says no 2016 cash bonuses for eight senior executives Wells Fargo's profit flat, mortgage banking revenue down By Nikhil Subba and Dan Freed (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co posted flat quarterly earnings on Thursday and warned its costs would remain elevated as the fallout from a sales practices scandal continues to impact the third-largest U.S. bank. Higher personnel costs and legal fees as well as lower mortgage banking revenues kept Wells Fargo's first-quarter net income broadly flat at $5.5 billion and the San Francisco-based bank said expenses as a share of revenues would remain high. Wells Fargo is trying to put a scandal over the opening of unauthorised accounts behind it and earlier this week said it would claw back an additional $75 million of compensation from the two former executives it blamed most for the debacle. Known for consistently growing revenues and earnings in the post-crisis era, Wells Fargo has been thrown off course by the sales controversy and in recent quarters has also been disadvantaged by its smaller trading footprint. Wall Street rivals have bounced back as bond and currency markets roared back to life last year with JPMorgan and Citi each reporting a 17 percent increase in quarterly profit on Thursday, beating analyst expectations and boosting their shares. Wells Fargo's revenues fell about 1 percent to $22 billion and missed the average estimate of $22.32 billion. On a per share basis, profit rose to $1.00 from 99 cents a year earlier, beating the average analyst estimate of 97 cents. Chief Executive Tim Sloan told analysts he expected new account and credit card openings to recover in the third quarter after a steady decline since the sales scandal broke in September but the bank said costs associated with the controversy, which were $80 million in the first quarter, would remain around $70 million to $80 million for an unspecified period. "I think it will be at least a few more quarters," Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said in an interview with Reuters. The bank's efficiency ratio, a closely watched number reflecting non-interest expenses as a percentage of revenue, was 62.7 percent, compared with 58.7 percent a year ago and Sloan said it would be a challenge to get back to a preferred 55 to 59 percent level. "I want to make it very clear that operating at this level is not acceptable," he said. Sloan added that the bank will unveil at its investor day in May additional cost savings initiatives beyond the annual $2 billion in savings they are targeting starting in 2018. The bank also plans to reduce headcount in businesses such as mortgage if, as expected, business gets slower. Sloan faces a rocky shareholder meeting on April 25 after influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services called on investors to vote against 12 out of 15 directors, including Chairman Stephen Sanger. The bank's stock was down 2.5 percent at mid-afternoon on Thursday, the worst performer in the S&P 500 Financials Index <.SPSY>. After the close on Wednesday, Berkshire Hathaway Inc , Wells Fargo's largest shareholder, said it withdrew an application to the Federal Reserve to boost its ownership stake above 10 percent, and is instead selling 9 million shares to keep it below that threshold. MORTGAGES AND COSTS The Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates in March for the second time in three months has been welcomed by banks which earn more from lending out their deposits when rates rise. Higher rates helped Wells Fargo earn more from lending with a 5 percent rise to $12.3 billion in its net interest income. But higher rates can also put off borrowers, and Wells had a decline in total loans to $958 billion from nearly $968 billion in the prior quarter with a near $8 billion drop in consumer loans in that period. Wells Fargo's mortgage business, the largest in the United States by volume, saw a 23 percent drop in fee income to $1.23 billion as customers shied away from refinancing their home loans. Mortgage borrowing was likewise a dark spot in JPMorgan's results, with mortgage fees and loan servicing revenue tumbling 39 percent to $406 million from $667 million. Wells' consumer business is also feeling the impact from its unauthorised accounts scandal with a steady decline in the number of consumers opening checking and credit card accounts. Overall net profit at its retail bank, its biggest profit centre, fell 9 percent due to a drop in fee income. Wells' wholesale banking division, which provides loans and other services to corporate clients, reported a 10 percent increase in net profit from a year ago. Costs at Wells Fargo rose 6 percent compared to the year-ago period as the bank shelled out more for salaries as well as the legal costs related to the scandal.

The bank's efficiency ratio, a closely watched number reflecting non-interest expenses as a percentage of revenue, was 62.7 percent, compared with 58.7 percent a year ago and Sloan said it would be a challenge to get back to a preferred 55 to 59 percent level. "I want to make it very clear that operating at this level is not acceptable," he said. Sloan added that the bank will unveil at its investor day in May additional cost savings initiatives beyond the annual $2 billion in savings they are targeting starting in 2018. The bank also plans to reduce headcount in businesses such as mortgage if, as expected, business gets slower. Sloan faces a rocky shareholder meeting on April 25 after influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services called on investors to vote against 12 out of 15 directors, including Chairman Stephen Sanger. The bank's stock was down 2.5 percent at mid-afternoon on Thursday, the worst performer in the S&P 500 Financials Index <.SPSY>. After the close on Wednesday, Berkshire Hathaway Inc , Wells Fargo's largest shareholder, said it withdrew an application to the Federal Reserve to boost its ownership stake above 10 percent, and is instead selling 9 million shares to keep it below that threshold. MORTGAGES AND COSTS The Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates in March for the second time in three months has been welcomed by banks which earn more from lending out their deposits when rates rise. Higher rates helped Wells Fargo earn more from lending with a 5 percent rise to $12.3 billion in its net interest income. But higher rates can also put off borrowers, and Wells had a decline in total loans to $958 billion from nearly $968 billion in the prior quarter with a near $8 billion drop in consumer loans in that period. Wells Fargo's mortgage business, the largest in the United States by volume, saw a 23 percent drop in fee income to $1.23 billion as customers shied away from refinancing their home loans. Mortgage borrowing was likewise a dark spot in JPMorgan's results, with mortgage fees and loan servicing revenue tumbling 39 percent to $406 million from $667 million. Wells' consumer business is also feeling the impact from its unauthorised accounts scandal with a steady decline in the number of consumers opening checking and credit card accounts. Overall net profit at its retail bank, its biggest profit centre, fell 9 percent due to a drop in fee income. Wells' wholesale banking division, which provides loans and other services to corporate clients, reported a 10 percent increase in net profit from a year ago. Costs at Wells Fargo rose 6 percent compared to the year-ago period as the bank shelled out more for salaries as well as the legal costs related to the scandal.

Reuters Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Wells Fargo's profit flat as costs, mortgages weigh By Nikhil Subba and Dan Freed (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co posted flat quarterly earnings on Thursday and warned its costs would remain elevated as the fallout from a sales practices scandal continues to impact the third-largest U.S. bank. Higher personnel costs and legal fees as well as lower mortgage banking revenues kept Wells Fargo's first-quarter net income broadly flat at $5.5 billion and the San Francisco-based bank said expenses as a share of revenues would remain high. Wells Fargo is trying to put a scandal over the opening of unauthorised accounts behind it and earlier this week said it would claw back an additional $75 million of compensation from the two former executives it blamed most for the debacle. Known for consistently growing revenues and earnings in the post-crisis era, Wells Fargo has been thrown off course by the sales controversy and in recent quarters has also been disadvantaged by its smaller trading footprint. Wall Street rivals have bounced back as bond and currency markets roared back to life last year with JPMorgan and Citi each reporting a 17 percent increase in quarterly profit on Thursday, beating analyst expectations and boosting their shares. Wells Fargo's revenues fell about 1 percent to $22 billion and missed the average estimate of $22.32 billion. On a per share basis, profit rose to $1.00 from 99 cents a year earlier, beating the average analyst estimate of 97 cents. Chief Executive Tim Sloan told analysts he expected new account and credit card openings to recover in the third quarter after a steady decline since the sales scandal broke in September but the bank said costs associated with the controversy, which were $80 million in the first quarter, would remain around $70 million to $80 million for an unspecified period.

Wells Fargo shares fell 3.3 percent, pulling down the S&P 500, after the bank reported a drop in mortgage banking revenue. Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed late on Wednesday that it had cut its stake in the bank. JPMorgan fell 1.2 percent and Citigroup slipped 0.8 percent, even as those companies reported better-than-expected quarterly profits. Banks revealed more evidence of a slowdown in loan growth in their reports. The S&P 500 banks index <.SPXBK> closed at its lowest point since early December. Investors have sought safe-haven assets throughout the week due to geopolitical tensions in Syria and North Korea. News of a massive bomb being dropped by the United States in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday added to uncertainty. Kate Warne, principal investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said a dip in bond yields put pressure on stocks ahead of a holiday weekend in the United States. "What we've seen is investors from the rest of the world putting more money in U.S. Treasuries" due to geopolitical concerns, Warne said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 138.61 points, or 0.67 percent, to 20,453.25, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 15.98 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,328.95 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 31.01 points, or 0.53 percent, to 5,805.15. The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed 8.9 percent since President Donald Trump's Nov. 8 election, supported by his planned economic agenda of tax cuts and economic stimulus. But the rally has stalled the past six weeks as some investors question Trump's ability to enact his proposals. There is "some concern among investors that there is now a shift going on in Washington to international and away from a domestic policy," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. The S&P 500 financial index <.SPSY> dropped 1.3 percent, its fifth straight day of losses. Energy shares <.SPNY> were the worst-performing group, falling 1.8 percent. The technology sector <.SPLRCT> fell 0.4 percent, marking its longest losing streak since May 2012. The results from banks kicked off what is expected to be a strong first-quarter U.S. reporting season. S&P 500 companies are expected to post a 10.4 percent rise in earnings for the period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We could have double-digit earnings growth; we haven't seen that in some time," said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. "Investors are going to be impressed with that." A report from the University of Michigan showed that U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly strengthened in April as consumer optimism on current economic conditions climbed to its highest level since November 2000. About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.56-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.24-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 51 new lows.

By Lewis Krauskopf (Reuters) - Wall Street fell on Thursday and looked set to book losses for a third straight day as investors weighed earnings from big U.S. banks and geopolitical tensions. Wells Fargo shares fell 2.4 percent, pulling down the S&P 500, after the bank reported a drop in mortgage banking revenue. Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed late on Wednesday that it had cut its stake in the bank.

Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed late on Wednesday that it had cut its stake in the bank. JPMorgan fell 1.2 percent and Citigroup slipped 0.8 percent, even as those companies reported better-than-expected quarterly profits.

The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed 8.9 percent since President Donald Trump's Nov. 8 election, supported by his planned economic agenda of tax cuts and economic stimulus. But the rally has stalled the past six weeks as some investors question Trump's ability to enact his proposals. There is "some concern among investors that there is now a shift going on in Washington to international and away from a domestic policy," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. The S&P 500 financial index dropped 1.3 percent, its fifth straight day of losses. Energy shares were the worst-performing group, falling 1.8 percent. The technology sector fell 0.4 percent, marking its longest losing streak since May 2012. The results from banks kicked off what is expected to be a strong first-quarter U.S. reporting season.

But amid signs that the storm over fake accounts is easing, branch employees are starting to promote new accounts to people. The company said Thursday that new checking account openings were down 35 percent in March from the same month a year ago. New credit card applications were down 42 percent. Both those metrics improved from the activity in February, however. And after months of apologizing and calling customers to ask whether they really opened the accounts in their names, Wells executives said the bank is starting to move back into the offense. Bank employees are "more actively marketing products" to customers again in the branches, said John Shrewsberry, the company's chief financial officer. Regulators had fined San Francisco-based Wells Fargo $185 million in September for opening more than 2 million accounts fraudulently as employees tried to meet aggressive sales goals. The bank has been dealing with the aftermath since then, as then-CEO John Stumpf stepped down and the head of the consumer banking division moved up her retirement. Both were ordered to forfeit promised stock awards. Wells Fargo also scrapped its sales goals and announced new compensation standards. Earlier this week, the bank's board released its own investigation, and announced it was clawing back another $75 million in pay from Stumpf and former community bank executive Carrie Tolstedt, saying the executives took too long to recognize problems at the company. Even with signs of stabilization, the bank still faces several pending investigations by state and federal authorities. And in two weeks, Wells Fargo will hold its annual shareholder meeting amid a push to get rid of the company's board of directors. Overall, Wells Fargo reported net income of $5.46 billion, or $1 per share, in the quarter ending March 31, compared with $5.46 billion, or 99 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. The results surpassed Wall Street expectations of 96 cents per share, according to FactSet. The company posted revenue of $23.93 billion in the period. Its adjusted revenue was $22 billion, falling short of analyst forecasts of $22.4 billion, according to FactSet. Like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, which also reported their results on Thursday, Wells did benefit somewhat from the rise in interest rates. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates last December and again in March. Higher rates mean banks like Wells can charge more for loans. In the quarter, Wells' net interest income was $12.3 billion, up 5 percent from a year earlier. Both JPMorgan and Citi reported first quarter results that beat analysts' expectations. Unlike Wells Fargo, both banks have large trading and investment banking operations, so they tend to see profits rise and fall more noticeably with markets compared to Wells. Citi said it earned $4.1 billion, or $1.35 a share, compared with $3.5 billion, or $1.10 a share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected $1.23 a share, according to FactSet. JPMorgan earned $6.45 billion, or $1.65 per share, in the first quarter compared with net income of $5.52 billion, or $1.35 a share from a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected the bank to earn $1.51 a share. ____ Ken Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

Citigroup’s net income increase 17.1 percent to $4.1 billion in the first three months of the year, from $3.5 billion during the same period last year. The bank's revenue rose nearly 2.8 percent to $18.1 billion from $17.6 billion. JPMorgan Chase also saw its net income jump near 16.8 percent to $6.45 billion compared to $5.52 billion in the first quarter of 2016. Revenues rose 6.3 percent to $25.59 billion in the first quarter of 2017, from $24.08 billion. But Wells Fargo had its first quarter revenue fall about 1 percent to $22 billion, from $22.2 billion in the first three months last year. Net income remained unchanged at $5.5 billion. Wells Fargo’s earnings were released three days after the bank completed an internal investigation that clawed back $75 million from former CEO John Stumpf, and head of the Community Bank Carrie Tolstedt. After the weak financial report, Wells Fargo’s stock fell by as much as 3.3 percent to $51.35.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) The Associated Press Updated at 4:12 p.m. NEW YORK • Investors were in a selling mood at the end of a mostly subdued week of trading, sending U.S. stocks lower for the third day in a row. Energy stocks led the broad decline, which gathered momentum in the final hour of trading ahead of the long Easter holiday weekend. The slide marked the lowest close for the stock market since Feb. 13 and came on a day when several major banks reported their latest quarterly results, kicking off the company earnings season. Traders also weighed the potential for rising geopolitical tensions following news that the U.S. attacked an Islamic State tunnel complex in eastern Afghanistan with the largest non-nuclear weapon ever used in combat by the U.S. military. Bond yields continued to drop. Gold surged to its highest level since early November. The weakened versus the yen and euro. "Investors have plenty of reasons to be cautious and have become more cautious in recent weeks," said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. "The market had a great run and it just hasn't been given a lot of reasons for much follow-through on that." The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 15.98 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,328.95. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 138.61 points, or 0.7 percent, to 20,453.25. The Nasdaq composite index lost 31.01 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,805.15. Small-company stocks fell more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index lost 13.96 points, or 1 percent, to 1,345.24. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. The decline deepened the market's losses for the month. Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note fell to 2.23 percent from 2.24 percent late Wednesday. Gold, often sought out by investors in times of global uncertainty, climbed $10.40 to $1,288.50 an ounce. Oil prices inched higher as traders shrugged off a report by the International Energy Agency said that demand growth for oil will slow for a second consecutive year this year. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 7 cents to close at $53.18 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 3 cents to close at $55.89 per barrel in London. Even so, energy stocks fell sharply, led by Chesapeake Energy. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, shedding 26 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $5.89. After a week of mostly subdued trading without major new economic data or company news, investors got a look at the first batch of big bank earnings Thursday. Several banks reported better-than-expected results thanks to improved revenue from trading and rising interest rates. That gave the stocks a boost early on, but their gains faded. Citigroup slipped 47 cents to $58.04, while JPMorgan Chase shed $1, or 1.2 percent, to $84.40. PNC Financial Services slid 20 cents to $115.80. "A lot of investors were looking through the earnings releases today and trying to get a sense of demand for loans, and I don't think they're liking what they're seeing," Davidson said. Wells Fargo gave up 3.3 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold some of its stock in the lender to avoid being designated a bank holding company. Wells also reported flat quarterly earnings, reflecting continuing struggles to recover from its sales practice scandal. The stock lost $1.77 to $51.35. Pier 1 Imports' latest quarterly results failed to impress investors. Who's hired? Check our People in Business Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis The company's shares slumped 9.1 percent after the home decor retailer reported disappointing sales. The stock slid 66 cents to $6.59. U.S. Steel fell 5.9 percent as investors weighed the impact of a wastewater spill at one of the company's steel plants in northern Indiana. Federal officials were waiting for the results of tests aimed at determining whether a potentially carcinogenic chemical entered Lake Michigan during the wastewater spill on Tuesday. The company's shares were off $1.84 to $29.42. Major stock indexes overseas closed mostly lower. In Europe, Germany's DAX slid 0.4 percent, while France's CAC-40 shed 0.6 percent. London's FTSE-100 lost 0.3 percent. In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.7 percent and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 lost 0.7 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slid 0.2 percent after a report showed China's export growth accelerated in March, while import growth cooled. Seoul's Kospi added 0.9 percent. The dollar continued to weaken a day after President Donald Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the dollar was "getting too strong" and that he won't declare China a currency manipulator. The remarks helped push the yen to its highest level since mid-November, just after the presidential election. The dollar slid to 109.16 yen from 109.71 yen late Wednesday. The euro strengthened to $1.0612 from $1.0598. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline dipped 1 cent to $1.73 a gallon. Heating oil held steady at $1.65 a gallon.

Wells Fargo shares fell 3.3 percent, pulling down the S&amp;P 500, after the bank reported a drop in mortgage banking revenue. Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed late on Wednesday that it had cut its stake in the bank. JPMorgan fell 1.2 percent and Citigroup slipped 0.8 percent, even as those companies reported better-than-expected quarterly profits. Banks revealed more evidence of a slowdown in loan growth in their reports. The S&amp;P 500 banks index closed at its lowest point since early December. Investors have sought safe-haven assets throughout the week due to geopolitical tensions in Syria and North Korea. News of a massive bomb being dropped by the United States in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday added to uncertainty. Kate Warne, principal investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said a dip in bond yields put pressure on stocks ahead of a holiday weekend in the United States. "What we've seen is investors from the rest of the world putting more money in U.S. Treasuries" due to geopolitical concerns, Warne said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 138.61 points, or 0.67 percent, to 20,453.25, the S&amp;P 500 lost 15.98 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,328.95 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 31.01 points, or 0.53 percent, to 5,805.15. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 has climbed 8.9 percent since President Donald Trump's Nov. 8 election, supported by his planned economic agenda of tax cuts and economic stimulus. But the rally has stalled the past six weeks as some investors question Trump's ability to enact his proposals. There is "some concern among investors that there is now a shift going on in Washington to international and away from a domestic policy," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. The S&amp;P 500 financial index dropped 1.3 percent, its fifth straight day of losses. Energy shares were the worst-performing group, falling 1.8 percent. The technology sector fell 0.4 percent, marking its longest losing streak since May 2012. The results from banks kicked off what is expected to be a strong first-quarter U.S. reporting season. S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to post a 10.4 percent rise in earnings for the period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We could have double-digit earnings growth; we haven´t seen that in some time," said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. "Investors are going to be impressed with that." A report from the University of Michigan showed that U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly strengthened in April as consumer optimism on current economic conditions climbed to its highest level since November 2000. About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.56-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&amp;P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 51 new lows.

Wells Fargo shares fell 3.3 percent, pulling down the S&P 500, after the bank reported a drop in mortgage banking revenue. Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed late on Wednesday that it had cut its stake in the bank. JPMorgan fell 1.2 percent and Citigroup slipped 0.8 percent, even as those companies reported better-than-expected quarterly profits. Banks revealed more evidence of a slowdown in loan growth in their reports. The S&P 500 banks index closed at its lowest point since early December. Investors have sought safe-haven assets throughout the week due to geopolitical tensions in Syria and North Korea. News of a massive bomb being dropped by the United States in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday added to uncertainty. Kate Warne, principal investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said a dip in bond yields put pressure on stocks ahead of a holiday weekend in the United States. "What we've seen is investors from the rest of the world putting more money in U.S. Treasuries" due to geopolitical concerns, Warne said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 138.61 points, or 0.67 percent, to 20,453.25, the S&P 500 lost 15.98 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,328.95 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 31.01 points, or 0.53 percent, to 5,805.15. The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed 8.9 percent since President Donald Trump's Nov. 8 election, supported by his planned economic agenda of tax cuts and economic stimulus. But the rally has stalled the past six weeks as some investors question Trump's ability to enact his proposals. There is "some concern among investors that there is now a shift going on in Washington to international and away from a domestic policy," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. The S&P 500 financial index dropped 1.3 percent, its fifth straight day of losses. Energy shares were the worst-performing group, falling 1.8 percent. The technology sector fell 0.4 percent, marking its longest losing streak since May 2012. The results from banks kicked off what is expected to be a strong first-quarter U.S. reporting season. S&P 500 companies are expected to post a 10.4 percent rise in earnings for the period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We could have double-digit earnings growth; we haven't seen that in some time," said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. "Investors are going to be impressed with that." A report from the University of Michigan showed that U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly strengthened in April as consumer optimism on current economic conditions climbed to its highest level since November 2000. About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.56-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 51 new lows.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Asian stocks were lower on Friday as investors in the region had many reasons to worry about rising geopolitical tensions and the situation on the Korean Peninsula. Many markets were closed for public holidays. KEEPING SCORE: Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 percent to 18,364.68 and South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.5 percent to 2,137.07. Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.6 percent to 3,254.97. Hong Kong markets were closed and so were markets in Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries. NORTH KOREA: Analysts said investors sought safe havens as North Korea was believed to be planning a nuclear test and the U.S. sent an aircraft carrier toward the region. Pyongyang is preparing for the 105th anniversary of the birth of its founder Kim Il Sung on Saturday. North Korean has intensified rhetoric warning it would retaliate strongly against any aggression as U.S.-South Korea hold military exercises. ANALYST'S VIEWPOINT: "Geopolitics seemed to dominate over the past week with the ramifications of the U.S.' missile strike on Syria still reverberating and tensions around North Korea steadily building," Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, said in a daily commentary. "The issues around Syria are likely to settle down assuming U.S. involvement does not escalate, but North Korea is more risky."

Higher personnel costs and legal fees as well as lower mortgage banking revenues kept Wells Fargo's first-quarter net income broadly flat at $5.5 billion and the San Francisco-based bank said expenses as a share of revenues would remain high. Wells Fargo is trying to put a scandal over the opening of unauthorized accounts behind it and earlier this week said it would claw back an additional $75 million of compensation from the two former executives it blamed most for the debacle. Known for consistently growing revenues and earnings in the post-crisis era, Wells Fargo has been thrown off course by the sales controversy and in recent quarters has also been disadvantaged by its smaller trading footprint. Wall Street rivals have bounced back as bond and currency markets roared back to life last year with JPMorgan and Citi each reporting a 17 percent increase in quarterly profit on Thursday, beating analyst expectations and boosting their shares. Wells Fargo's revenues fell about 1 percent to $22 billion and missed the average estimate of $22.32 billion. On a per share basis, profit rose to $1.00 from 99 cents a year earlier, beating the average analyst estimate of 97 cents. Chief Executive Tim Sloan told analysts he expected new account and credit card openings to recover in the third quarter after a steady decline since the sales scandal broke in September but the bank said costs associated with the controversy, which were $80 million in the first quarter, would remain around $70 million to $80 million for an unspecified period. "I think it will be at least a few more quarters," Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said in an interview with Reuters. The bank's efficiency ratio, a closely watched number reflecting non-interest expenses as a percentage of revenue, was 62.7 percent, compared with 58.7 percent a year ago and Sloan said it would be a challenge to get back to a preferred 55 to 59 percent level. "I want to make it very clear that operating at this level is not acceptable," he said. Sloan added that the bank will unveil at its investor day in May additional cost savings initiatives beyond the annual $2 billion in savings they are targeting starting in 2018. The bank also plans to reduce headcount in businesses such as mortgage if, as expected, business gets slower. Sloan faces a rocky shareholder meeting on April 25 after influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services called on investors to vote against 12 out of 15 directors, including Chairman Stephen Sanger. The bank's stock was down 2.8 percent in midday trade on Thursday, the worst performer in the S&P 500 Financials Index. After the close on Wednesday, Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Wells Fargo's largest shareholder, said it withdrew an application to the Federal Reserve to boost its ownership stake above 10 percent, and is instead selling 9 million shares to keep it below that threshold. MORTGAGES AND COSTS The Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates in March for the second time in three months has been welcomed by banks which earn more from lending out their deposits when rates rise. Higher rates helped Wells Fargo earn more from lending with a 5 percent rise to $12.3 billion in its net interest income. But higher rates can also put off borrowers, and Wells had a decline in total loans to $958 billion from nearly $968 billion in the prior quarter with a near $8 billion drop in consumer loans in that period. Wells Fargo's mortgage business, the largest in the United States by volume, saw a 23 percent drop in fee income to $1.23 billion as customers shied away from refinancing their home loans. Mortgage borrowing was likewise a dark spot in JPMorgan's results, with mortgage fees and loan servicing revenue tumbling 39 percent to $406 million from $667 million. Wells' consumer business is also feeling the impact from its unauthorized accounts scandal with a steady decline in the number of consumers opening checking and credit card accounts. Overall net profit at its retail bank, its biggest profit center, fell 9 percent due to a drop in fee income. Wells' wholesale banking division, which provides loans and other services to corporate clients, reported a 10 percent increase in net profit from a year ago. Costs at Wells Fargo rose 6 percent compared to the year-ago period as the bank shelled out more for salaries as well as the legal costs related to the scandal.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Major U.S. stock indexes fell on Thursday for a third straight day as investors weighed earnings reports from big U.S. banks and geopolitical tensions, while the tech sector fell for a tenth consecutive session. Wells Fargo shares fell 3.3 percent, pulling down the S&P 500, after the bank reported a drop in mortgage banking revenue. Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed late on Wednesday that it had cut its stake in the bank. JPMorgan fell 1.2 percent and Citigroup slipped 0.8 percent, even as those companies reported better-than-expected quarterly profits. Banks revealed more evidence of a slowdown in loan growth in their reports. The S&P 500 banks index closed at its lowest point since early December. Investors have sought safe-haven assets throughout the week due to geopolitical tensions in Syria and North Korea. News of a massive bomb being dropped by the United States in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday added to uncertainty. Kate Warne, principal investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said a dip in bond yields put pressure on stocks ahead of a holiday weekend in the United States. "What we've seen is investors from the rest of the world putting more money in U.S. Treasuries" due to geopolitical concerns, Warne said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 138.61 points, or 0.67 percent, to 20,453.25, the S&P 500 lost 15.98 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,328.95 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 31.01 points, or 0.53 percent, to 5,805.15. The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed 8.9 percent since President Donald Trump's Nov. 8 election, supported by his planned economic agenda of tax cuts and economic stimulus. But the rally has stalled the past six weeks as some investors question Trump's ability to enact his proposals. There is "some concern among investors that there is now a shift going on in Washington to international and away from a domestic policy," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. The S&P 500 financial index dropped 1.3 percent, its fifth straight day of losses. Energy shares were the worst-performing group, falling 1.8 percent. The technology sector fell 0.4 percent, marking its longest losing streak since May 2012. The results from banks kicked off what is expected to be a strong first-quarter U.S. reporting season. S&P 500 companies are expected to post a 10.4 percent rise in earnings for the period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We could have double-digit earnings growth; we haven’t seen that in some time," said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. "Investors are going to be impressed with that." A report from the University of Michigan showed that U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly strengthened in April as consumer optimism on current economic conditions climbed to its highest level since November 2000. About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.56-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 51 new lows.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) The Associated Press Updated at 4:12 p.m. NEW YORK • Investors were in a selling mood at the end of a mostly subdued week of trading, sending U.S. stocks lower for the third day in a row. Energy stocks led the broad decline, which gathered momentum in the final hour of trading ahead of the long Easter holiday weekend. The slide marked the lowest close for the stock market since Feb. 13 and came on a day when several major banks reported their latest quarterly results, kicking off the company earnings season. Traders also weighed the potential for rising geopolitical tensions following news that the U.S. attacked an Islamic State tunnel complex in eastern Afghanistan with the largest non-nuclear weapon ever used in combat by the U.S. military. Bond yields continued to drop. Gold surged to its highest level since early November. The weakened versus the yen and euro. "Investors have plenty of reasons to be cautious and have become more cautious in recent weeks," said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. "The market had a great run and it just hasn't been given a lot of reasons for much follow-through on that." The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 15.98 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,328.95. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 138.61 points, or 0.7 percent, to 20,453.25. The Nasdaq composite index lost 31.01 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,805.15. Small-company stocks fell more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index lost 13.96 points, or 1 percent, to 1,345.24. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. The decline deepened the market's losses for the month. Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note fell to 2.23 percent from 2.24 percent late Wednesday. Gold, often sought out by investors in times of global uncertainty, climbed $10.40 to $1,288.50 an ounce. Oil prices inched higher as traders shrugged off a report by the International Energy Agency said that demand growth for oil will slow for a second consecutive year this year. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 7 cents to close at $53.18 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 3 cents to close at $55.89 per barrel in London. Even so, energy stocks fell sharply, led by Chesapeake Energy. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, shedding 26 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $5.89. After a week of mostly subdued trading without major new economic data or company news, investors got a look at the first batch of big bank earnings Thursday. Several banks reported better-than-expected results thanks to improved revenue from trading and rising interest rates. That gave the stocks a boost early on, but their gains faded. Citigroup slipped 47 cents to $58.04, while JPMorgan Chase shed $1, or 1.2 percent, to $84.40. PNC Financial Services slid 20 cents to $115.80. "A lot of investors were looking through the earnings releases today and trying to get a sense of demand for loans, and I don't think they're liking what they're seeing," Davidson said. Wells Fargo gave up 3.3 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold some of its stock in the lender to avoid being designated a bank holding company. Wells also reported flat quarterly earnings, reflecting continuing struggles to recover from its sales practice scandal. The stock lost $1.77 to $51.35. Pier 1 Imports' latest quarterly results failed to impress investors. Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis The company's shares slumped 9.1 percent after the home decor retailer reported disappointing sales. The stock slid 66 cents to $6.59. U.S. Steel fell 5.9 percent as investors weighed the impact of a wastewater spill at one of the company's steel plants in northern Indiana. Federal officials were waiting for the results of tests aimed at determining whether a potentially carcinogenic chemical entered Lake Michigan during the wastewater spill on Tuesday. The company's shares were off $1.84 to $29.42. Major stock indexes overseas closed mostly lower. In Europe, Germany's DAX slid 0.4 percent, while France's CAC-40 shed 0.6 percent. London's FTSE-100 lost 0.3 percent. In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.7 percent and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 lost 0.7 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slid 0.2 percent after a report showed China's export growth accelerated in March, while import growth cooled. Seoul's Kospi added 0.9 percent. The dollar continued to weaken a day after President Donald Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the dollar was "getting too strong" and that he won't declare China a currency manipulator. The remarks helped push the yen to its highest level since mid-November, just after the presidential election. The dollar slid to 109.16 yen from 109.71 yen late Wednesday. The euro strengthened to $1.0612 from $1.0598. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline dipped 1 cent to $1.73 a gallon. Heating oil held steady at $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas rose 4 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $3.23 per 1,000 cubic feet. Among metals, silver gained 21 cents to $18.51 an ounce. Copper added 3 cents to $2.57 a pound.

Higher costs and weaker mortgage revenue were to blame for Wells Fargo's mixed report as the nation's third-largest bank by assets is still struggling with the fallout over its sales scandal revealed last year. Citigroup easily topped Wall Street's estimates, reporting earnings of $1.35 on revenue of $18.12 billion. The beat was driven by strong growth in the bank's consumer and institutional businesses. Finally, JPMorgan reported earnings of $1.65 on revenue of $25.58 billion. The firm's trading revenue reached $6.52 billion, soaring past forecasts. Since the end of the financial crisis, JPMorgan has topped first-quarter earnings estimates 88 percent of the time, with 2014 the only earnings miss - excluding this morning's report. This is a great track record on paper, but in the short-term, it doesn't necessarily bode well for the stock. Using hedge fund analytics tool Kensho, CNBC ran a study to see how JPMorgan performs in the week following its first quarter results. Despite the high batting average for beats, JPMorgan has actually traded negatively 88 percent of the time in the following week, with an average loss of 1.43 percent—2016 logged the only positive return in that period. The Financial SPDR (XLF) also tends to head lower in this period, trading negatively 63 percent of the time, with an average loss of 0.5 percent. Disclosure: NBCUniversal, the parent of CNBC, is a minority investor in Kensho.

FILE - This July 15, 2013, file photo, shows the New York Stock Exchange. Global stock markets turned lower and the dollar was volatile Thursday, April 13, 2017, after President Donald Trump withdrew a threat to declare ... By YOUKYUNG LEE AP Business Writer SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - Asian stocks were lower on Friday as investors in the region had many reasons to worry about rising geopolitical tensions and the situation on the Korean Peninsula. Many markets were closed for public holidays. KEEPING SCORE: Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 percent to 18,364.68 and South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.5 percent to 2,137.07. Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.6 percent to 3,254.97. Hong Kong markets were closed and so were markets in Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries. NORTH KOREA: Analysts said investors sought safe havens as North Korea was believed to be planning a nuclear test and the U.S. sent an aircraft carrier toward the region. Pyongyang is preparing for the 105th anniversary of the birth of its founder Kim Il Sung on Saturday. North Korean has intensified rhetoric warning it would retaliate strongly against any aggression as U.S.-South Korea hold military exercises. ANALYST'S VIEWPOINT: "Geopolitics seemed to dominate over the past week with the ramifications of the U.S.' missile strike on Syria still reverberating and tensions around North Korea steadily building," Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, said in a daily commentary. "The issues around Syria are likely to settle down assuming U.S. involvement does not escalate, but North Korea is more risky." WALL STREET: U.S. stocks finished lower for the third straight day on Thursday as energy stocks led the decline. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 0.7 percent to 2,328.95. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7 percent to 20,453.25. The Nasdaq composite index lost 0.5 percent to 5,805.15. U.S. markets will be closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday. OIL: On Friday, the New York Mercantile Exchange and the London Metal Exchange were closed for a holiday. On Thursday, benchmark U.S. crude rose 7 cents to close at $53.18 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 3 cents to close at $55.89 per barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar bounced back after weakening against major currencies following President Donald Trump's comment in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the dollar was "getting too strong." The dollar strengthened to 109.18 yen from 109.12 yen. The euro rose slightly to $1.0617 from $1.0616. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Wells Fargo shares fell 2.4 percent, pulling down the S&P 500, after the bank reported a drop in mortgage banking revenue. Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed late on Wednesday that it had cut its stake in the bank. JPMorgan and Citigroup also slipped about 0.5 percent each, despite reporting better-than-expected quarterly profits. Investors have sought safe-haven assets throughout the week due to geopolitical tensions in Syria and North Korea. News of a massive bomb being dropped by the United States in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday added to uncertainty. Kate Warne, principal investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said a dip in bond yields put pressure on stocks ahead of a holiday weekend in the United States. "What we've seen is investors from the rest of the world putting more money in U.S. Treasuries" due to geopolitical concerns, Warne said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 67.02 points, or 0.33 percent, to 20,524.84, the S&P 500 lost 6.78 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,338.15 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.46 points, or 0.13 percent, to 5,828.70. Bank stocks had helped drive the overall market higher after U.S. President Donald Trump's Nov. 8 election victory, but the rally has stalled as U.S. bond yields have declined and investors question Trump's ability to enact his agenda including tax cuts and economic stimulus. The S&P 500 financial index slipped 0.7 percent, setting it up for a fifth straight day of losses. Energy shares were the worst-performing group, falling 1.3 percent. The technology sector was little changed after nine straight sessions of losses. Reports from banks kicked off what is expected to be a strong first-quarter U.S. reporting season. S&P 500 companies are expected to post a 10.4 percent rise in earnings for the period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We could have double-digit earnings growth; we haven't seen that in some time," said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. "Investors are going to be impressed with that." A report from the University of Michigan showed that U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly strengthened in April as consumer optimism on current economic conditions climbed to its highest level since November 2000. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.77-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 7 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 25 new highs and 48 new lows.

Wells Fargo shares fell 2.4 percent, pulling down the S&P 500, after the bank reported a drop in mortgage banking revenue. Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed late on Wednesday that it had cut its stake in the bank. JPMorgan and Citigroup also slipped about 0.5 percent each, despite reporting better-than-expected quarterly profits. Investors have sought safe-haven assets throughout the week due to geopolitical tensions in Syria and North Korea. News of a massive bomb being dropped by the United States in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday added to uncertainty. Kate Warne, principal investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said a dip in bond yields put pressure on stocks ahead of a holiday weekend in the United States. "What we've seen is investors from the rest of the world putting more money in US Treasuries" due to geopolitical concerns, Warne said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 67.02 points, or 0.33 percent, to 20,524.84, the S&P 500 lost 6.78 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,338.15 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.46 points, or 0.13 percent, to 5,828.70. Bank stocks had helped drive the overall market higher after US President Donald Trump's Nov. 8 election victory, but the rally has stalled as US bond yields have declined and investors question Trump's ability to enact his agenda including tax cuts and economic stimulus. The S&P 500 financial index slipped 0.7 percent, setting it up for a fifth straight day of losses. Energy shares were the worst-performing group, falling 1.3 percent. The technology sector was little changed after nine straight sessions of losses. Reports from banks kicked off what is expected to be a strong first-quarter US reporting season. S&P 500 companies are expected to post a 10.4 percent rise in earnings for the period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We could have double-digit earnings growth; we haven't seen that in some time," said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. "Investors are going to be impressed with that." A report from the University of Michigan showed that US consumer sentiment unexpectedly strengthened in April as consumer optimism on current economic conditions climbed to its highest level since November 2000. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.77-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 7 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 25 new highs and 48 new lows.

Global stock markets turned lower and the dollar was volatile Thursday, April 13, 2017, after President Donald Trump withdrew a threat to declare China a currency manipulator and said the U.S. currency was "getting too strong." Tensions over North Korea also weighed on investors ahead of a long weekend in many markets. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Posted: Thursday, April 13, 2017 11:10 am | Updated: 5:09 pm, Thu Apr 13, 2017. US stocks close lower for third time in 3 days Associated Press | 0 comments Investors were in a selling mood at the end of a mostly subdued week of trading, sending U.S. stocks lower for the third day in a row Thursday. Energy stocks led the broad decline, which gathered momentum in the final hour of trading ahead of the long Easter holiday weekend. The slide marked the lowest close for the stock market since Feb. 13 and came on a day when several major banks reported their latest quarterly results, kicking off the company earnings season. Traders also weighed the potential for rising geopolitical tensions following news that the U.S. attacked an Islamic State tunnel complex in eastern Afghanistan with the largest non-nuclear weapon ever used in combat by the U.S. military. Bond yields continued to drop. Gold surged to its highest level since early November. The weakened versus the yen and euro. "Investors have plenty of reasons to be cautious and have become more cautious in recent weeks," said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. "The market had a great run and it just hasn't been given a lot of reasons for much follow-through on that." The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 15.98 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,328.95. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 138.61 points, or 0.7 percent, to 20,453.25. The Nasdaq composite index lost 31.01 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,805.15. Small-company stocks fell more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index lost 13.96 points, or 1 percent, to 1,345.24. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. The decline deepened the market's losses for the month. Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note fell to 2.23 percent from 2.24 percent late Wednesday. Gold, often sought out by investors in times of global uncertainty, climbed $10.40 to $1,288.50 an ounce. Oil prices inched higher as traders shrugged off a report by the International Energy Agency said that demand growth for oil will slow for a second consecutive year this year. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 7 cents to close at $53.18 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 3 cents to close at $55.89 per barrel in London. Even so, energy stocks fell sharply, led by Chesapeake Energy. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, shedding 26 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $5.89. After a week of mostly subdued trading without major new economic data or company news, investors got a look at the first batch of big bank earnings Thursday. Several banks reported better-than-expected results thanks to improved revenue from trading and rising interest rates. That gave the stocks a boost early on, but their gains faded. Citigroup slipped 47 cents to $58.04, while JPMorgan Chase shed $1, or 1.2 percent, to $84.40. PNC Financial Services slid 20 cents to $115.80. "A lot of investors were looking through the earnings releases today and trying to get a sense of demand for loans, and I don't think they're liking what they're seeing," Davidson said. Wells Fargo gave up 3.3 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold some of its stock in the lender to avoid being designated a bank holding company. Wells also reported flat quarterly earnings, reflecting continuing struggles to recover from its sales practice scandal. The stock lost $1.77 to $51.35. Pier 1 Imports' latest quarterly results failed to impress investors. The company's shares slumped 9.1 percent after the home decor retailer reported disappointing sales. The stock slid 66 cents to $6.59. U.S. Steel fell 5.9 percent as investors weighed the impact of a wastewater spill at one of the company's steel plants in northern Indiana. Federal officials were waiting for the results of tests aimed at determining whether a potentially carcinogenic chemical entered Lake Michigan during the wastewater spill on Tuesday. The company's shares were off $1.84 to $29.42. Major stock indexes overseas closed mostly lower. In Europe, Germany's DAX slid 0.4 percent, while France's CAC-40 shed 0.6 percent. London's FTSE-100 lost 0.3 percent. In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.7 percent and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 lost 0.7 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slid 0.2 percent after a report showed China's export growth accelerated in March, while import growth cooled. Seoul's Kospi added 0.9 percent. The dollar continued to weaken a day after President Donald Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the dollar was "getting too strong" and that he won't declare China a currency manipulator. The remarks helped push the yen to its highest level since mid-November, just after the presidential election. The dollar slid to 109.16 yen from 109.71 yen late Wednesday. The euro strengthened to $1.0612 from $1.0598. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline dipped 1 cent to $1.73 a gallon. Heating oil held steady at $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas rose 4 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $3.23 per 1,000 cubic feet. Among metals, silver gained 21 cents to $18.51 an ounce. Copper added 3 cents to $2.57 a pound. U.S. markets will be closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday. ___ Follow Alex Veiga on Twitter at twitter.com/_AlexVeiga His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/alex-veiga Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The company said Thursday that new checking account openings were down 35 per cent in March from the same month a year ago. New credit card applications were down 42 per cent. Overall, Wells Fargo reported net income of $5.46 billion, or $1 per share, in the quarter ending March 31, compared with $5.46 billion, or 99 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. The results surpassed Wall Street expectations of 96 cents per share, according to FactSet. The company posted revenue of $23.93 billion in the period. Its adjusted revenue was $22 billion, falling short of analyst forecasts of $22.4 billion, according to FactSet. Like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, who also reported their results on Thursday, Wells did benefit somewhat from the rise in interest rates since a year ago. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates twice recently, last December and in March. Higher rates mean banks like Wells can charge more for loans. In the quarter, Wells’ net interest income was $12.3 billion, up 5 per cent from a year earlier. “Wells Fargo continued to make meaningful progress in the first quarter in rebuilding trust with customers and other important stakeholders, while producing solid financial results,” said Wells Fargo’s CEO Tim Sloan in a prepared statement. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco bank $185 million for opening more than two million accounts fraudulently by employees to meet sales goals. The bank has been dealing with the aftermath ever since. Earlier this week, the San Francisco released its investigation into the scandal, and said it clawed back another $75 million in pay from former CEO John Stumpf and former community bank executive Carrie Tolstedt, saying the executives took too long to recognize problems at the company. There are some signs that the damage from the scandal is dissipating. While March checking account and credit card applications were down from a year ago, they were both up from February. Sloan has said he believes the customer retreat has mitigated from its worst levels in December and January. Measures of customer loyalty and customer satisfaction were also up in March from February. Wells Fargo’s stock fell $1.08, or 2 per cent, to $52.05. Investors are selling in part because Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, the bank’s largest shareholder, said late Wednesday it would sell some of its stake for regulatory reasons.

Posted 13 Apr 2017 20:15 Updated 14 Apr 2017 02:55 FILE PHOTO: A man walks by a bank machine at the Wells Fargo & Co. bank in downtown Denver, Colorado, U.S. April 13, 2016. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wells Fargo & Co posted flat quarterly earnings on Thursday and warned its costs would remain elevated as the fallout from a sales practices scandal continues to impact the third-largest U.S. bank. Higher personnel costs and legal fees as well as lower mortgage banking revenues kept Wells Fargo's first-quarter net income broadly flat at US$5.5 billion and the San Francisco-based bank said expenses as a share of revenues would remain high. Wells Fargo is trying to put a scandal over the opening of unauthorized accounts behind it and earlier this week said it would claw back an additional US$75 million of compensation from the two former executives it blamed most for the debacle. Known for consistently growing revenues and earnings in the post-crisis era, Wells Fargo has been thrown off course by the sales controversy and in recent quarters has also been disadvantaged by its smaller trading footprint. Wall Street rivals have bounced back as bond and currency markets roared back to life last year with JPMorgan and Citi each reporting a 17 percent increase in quarterly profit on Thursday, beating analyst expectations and boosting their shares. Wells Fargo's revenues fell about 1 percent to US$22 billion and missed the average estimate of US$22.32 billion. On a per share basis, profit rose to US$1.00 from 99 cents a year earlier, beating the average analyst estimate of 97 cents. Chief Executive Tim Sloan told analysts he expected new account and credit card openings to recover in the third quarter after a steady decline since the sales scandal broke in September but the bank said costs associated with the controversy, which were US$80 million in the first quarter, would remain around US$70 million to US$80 million for an unspecified period. "I think it will be at least a few more quarters," Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said in an interview with Reuters. The bank's efficiency ratio, a closely watched number reflecting non-interest expenses as a percentage of revenue, was 62.7 percent, compared with 58.7 percent a year ago and Sloan said it would be a challenge to get back to a preferred 55 to 59 percent level. "I want to make it very clear that operating at this level is not acceptable," he said. Sloan added that the bank will unveil at its investor day in May additional cost savings initiatives beyond the annual US$2 billion in savings they are targeting starting in 2018. The bank also plans to reduce headcount in businesses such as mortgage if, as expected, business gets slower. Sloan faces a rocky shareholder meeting on April 25 after influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services called on investors to vote against 12 out of 15 directors, including Chairman Stephen Sanger. The bank's stock was down 2.5 percent at mid-afternoon on Thursday, the worst performer in the S&P 500 Financials Index. After the close on Wednesday, Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Wells Fargo's largest shareholder, said it withdrew an application to the Federal Reserve to boost its ownership stake above 10 percent, and is instead selling 9 million shares to keep it below that threshold. MORTGAGES AND COSTS The Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates in March for the second time in three months has been welcomed by banks which earn more from lending out their deposits when rates rise. Higher rates helped Wells Fargo earn more from lending with a 5 percent rise to US$12.3 billion in its net interest income. But higher rates can also put off borrowers, and Wells had a decline in total loans to US$958 billion from nearly US$968 billion in the prior quarter with a near US$8 billion drop in consumer loans in that period. Wells Fargo's mortgage business, the largest in the United States by volume, saw a 23 percent drop in fee income to US$1.23 billion as customers shied away from refinancing their home loans. Mortgage borrowing was likewise a dark spot in JPMorgan's results, with mortgage fees and loan servicing revenue tumbling 39 percent to US$406 million from US$667 million. Wells' consumer business is also feeling the impact from its unauthorized accounts scandal with a steady decline in the number of consumers opening checking and credit card accounts. Overall net profit at its retail bank, its biggest profit center, fell 9 percent due to a drop in fee income. Wells' wholesale banking division, which provides loans and other services to corporate clients, reported a 10 percent increase in net profit from a year ago. Costs at Wells Fargo rose 6 percent compared to the year-ago period as the bank shelled out more for salaries as well as the legal costs related to the scandal.

About AP Essential News from The Associated Press AAA  Apr. 13, 2017 2:40 PM ET US stock indexes drift lower as oil prices fall By ALEX VEIGABy ALEX VEIGA, AP Business Writer         AIM       Share       Google       Digg       Del.icio.us       REddit       NewsVine       Mixx       Facebook       Yahoo More News Video Buy AP Photo Reprints U.S. stock indexes veered lower in afternoon trading Thursday as investors sized up earnings from several major banks and new economic data. Energy stocks were down the most as crude oil prices headed lower. Technology companies led the gainers. Trading was light ahead of the long Easter holiday weekend. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 6 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,338 as of 2:28 p.m. Eastern Time. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 20,529. The Nasdaq composite index lost 7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,828. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. markets will be closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday. THE QUOTE: "I'd anticipate it's going to be a fairly light run coming into the end of the week here," said Paul Springmeyer, senior portfolio manager at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank. BANK ON IT: Several banks reported better-than-expected results thanks to improved revenue from trading and rising interest rates. The stocks got a boost early on, but some lost their gains by midday. Citigroup slipped 3 cents to $58.20, while JPMorgan Chase shed 43 cents to $84.97. PNC Financial Services added 61 cents to $116.61. BUFFETT EFFECT: Wells Fargo slid 2.5 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold some of its stock in the lender to avoid being designated a bank holding company. Wells also reported flat quarterly earnings, reflecting continuing struggles to recover from its sales practice scandal. The stock gave up $1.32 to $51.80. ROUGH QUARTER: Pier 1 Imports slumped 8.6 percent after the home decor retailer reported disappointing sales. The stock slid 62 cents to $6.63. HEADLINE ANGST: U.S. Steel fell 4.5 percent as investors weighed the impact of a wastewater spill at one of the company's steel plants in northern Indiana. Federal officials were waiting for the results of tests aimed at determining whether a potentially carcinogenic chemical entered Lake Michigan during the wastewater spill on Tuesday. The company's shares were off $1.40 to $29.86. ECONOMIC DATA: The Labor Department said that its producer price index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach consumers, fell 0.1 percent in March. That's the first drop since August and reflects falling energy prices. Producer prices were up 2.3 percent in March from a year earlier, the sharpest annual increase in five years. The Labor Department also reported that the number of applications for unemployment benefits declined last week. MARKETS OVERSEAS: In Europe, Germany's DAX slid 0.4 percent, while France's CAC-40 shed 0.6 percent. London's FTSE-100 lost 0.3 percent. In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.7 percent and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 lost 0.7 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slid 0.2 percent after a report showed China's export growth accelerated in March, while import growth cooled. Seoul's Kospi added 0.9 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar continued to weaken a day after President Donald Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the dollar was "getting too strong" and that he won't declare China a currency manipulator. The remarks helped push the yen to its highest level since mid-November, just after the presidential election. The dollar slid to 109.12 yen from 109.71 yen late Wednesday. The euro strengthened to $1.0617 from $1.0598. ENERGY: Oil prices moved lower after an early rally. Benchmark U.S. crude was down 6 cents to $53.05 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was up 1 cent to $55.87 per barrel in London. A report by the International Energy Agency said that demand growth for oil will slow for a second consecutive year this year. METALS: Gold climbed $10.40 to $1,288.50 an ounce, its highest level since early November. Silver gained 21 cents to $18.51 an ounce. Copper added 3 cents to $2.57 a pound. TREASURY YIELDS: Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note fell to 2.23 percent from 2.24 percent late Wednesday. ___ Follow Alex Veiga on Twitter at twitter.com/_AlexVeiga His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/alex-veigaAssociated Press Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

C., in this Sept. 2016 photo. The bank reported first-quarter results on Thursday. (Mike Blake/Reuters) Related Stories Wells Fargo claws back $75M US from top execs in sales scandal Fixing fake accounts will take more time: Wells Fargo CEO Wells Fargo's first-quarter profit was essentially flat from a year earlier as new customers continue to stay away from the bank following its sales practice scandal. The company said Thursday that new checking account openings were down 35 per cent in March from the same month a year ago. New credit card applications were down 42 per cent. Overall, Wells Fargo reported net income of $5.46 billion US, or $1 per share, in the quarter ending March 31, compared with $5.46 billion US, or 99 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. The results surpassed Wall Street expectations of 96 cents per share, according to FactSet. Fixing fake accounts will take more time: Wells Fargo CEO The company posted revenue of $23.93 billion US in the period. Its adjusted revenue was $22 billion US, falling short of analyst forecasts of $22.4 billion US, according to FactSet. Like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, who also reported their results on Thursday, Wells did benefit somewhat from the rise in interest rates since a year ago. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates twice recently, last December and in March. Higher rates mean banks like Wells can charge more for loans. In the quarter, Wells' net interest income was $12.3 billion US, up 5 per cent from a year earlier. "Wells Fargo continued to make meaningful progress in the first quarter in rebuilding trust with customers and other important stakeholders, while producing solid financial results," said Wells Fargo's CEO Tim Sloan in a prepared statement. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco bank $185 million US for opening more than two million accounts fraudulently by employees to meet sales goals. The bank has been dealing with the aftermath ever since. Earlier this week, the San Francisco released its investigation into the scandal, and said it clawed back another $75 million US in pay from former CEO John Stumpf and former community bank executive Carrie Tolstedt, saying the executives took too long to recognize problems at the company. Wells Fargo claws back $75M US from top execs in sales scandal There are some signs that the damage from the scandal is dissipating. While March checking account and credit card applications were down from a year ago, they were both up from February. Sloan has said he believes the customer retreat has mitigated from its worst levels in December and January. Measures of customer loyalty and customer satisfaction were also up in March from February. Wells Fargo's stock fell $1.08 US, or two per cent, to $52.05 US. Investors are selling in part because Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, the bank's largest shareholder, said late Wednesday it would sell some of its stake for regulatory reasons. © The Associated Press, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Latest Business Headlines Pot stocks sell off in wake of release of federal legislation April 13, 10:58 PM ET video 'What happened to my dad shouldn't have happened,' United victim's daughter says April 13, 10:59 PM ET read comments video Chevron said to be considering sale of stake in Shell oilsands mining project April 13, 5:17 PM ET U.S. to reveal on April 25 if duties will be slapped on Canadian softwood lumber April 13, 3:44 PM ET 'Appalling' United Airlines incident won't be tolerated in Canada: Garneau April 13, 4:37 PM ET read comments Must Watch Video Pot business 2:07 Renee Filippone reports that Canadians looking to cash in on legalized marijuana are still looking for answers Video United Airlines passenger considers lawsuit 2:23 The man who was dragged off an overbooked United Airlines flight suffered substantial injuries and is expected to file a lawsuit against the company Video 'Couch potato' investing 5:14 Ben Felix, associate portfolio manager with PWL Capital, on why passive investing will always beat active management in the long run Video Pot potential 5:46 Vahan Ajamian, research analyst, Beacon Securities, on what new pot legislation will mean for publicly-listed and legal cannabis companies Watch The Exchange here Watch Recent shows and interviews Recent discussions about business news and newsmakers Markets TSX COMPOSITE   Rotate stock indices Pause stock rotation Show previous stock PLAY Apr 14, 2017 12:00 AM ET Apr 14, 2017 12:00 AM ET Apr 14, 2017 12:00 AM ET Apr 14, 2017 12:00 AM ET Apr 14, 2017 12:00 AM ET Index Last Trade Change TSX COMPOSITE 15535.48 -112.92 DOW 20453.25 -138.61 NASDAQ 5805.15 -31.01 SP 500 2328.95 -15.98 TSX-VENTURE 834.62 4.85 The data on this site is informational only and may be delayed; it is not intended as trading or investment advice and you should not rely on it as such.

X Loan growth stalls despite trading gains at US banks ‘There’s a great deal of optimism but there’s still uncertainty’ about 13 hours ago David Henry Wells Fargo’s shares were down 2.6% to $51.70. Photograph: Sam Hodgson/The New York Times         Big US banks revealed more evidence of a slowdown in loan growth in their earnings reports on Thursday, though executives assured there is still healthy demand from borrowers and no reason to worry about the state of the economy. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup posted higher first-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ expectations on large gains in trading revenue. Wells Fargo & Co, which relies more on traditional lending and less on markets-related businesses, reported a slight dip in profit due to a slowdown in mortgage banking. The results underscored concerns expressed recently by analysts and investors that higher interest rates, combined with uncertainty about geopolitical events, could hurt economic growth – and therefore crimp lenders’ bottom lines. Top bank executives dismissed those concerns, citing strong demand from borrowers with impressive credit quality. Across the banking industry, loans fell slightly during the first three months of the year, according to Federal Reserve data. John Conlon, chief equity strategist at People’s United Wealth Management, who invests in bank stocks, said he is still concerned about loan growth after seeing the reports and listening to the executives’ comments. “There’s a great deal of optimism,” Conlon said, “but there’s still uncertainty.” Wells Fargo’s shares were down 2.6 per cent to $51.70, while Citigroup’s stock was flat at $58.41 and JPMorgan fell 0.6 per cent to $84.90. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index fell 0.8 per cent. The mortgage business is putting particular pressure on loan growth. The recent uptick in interest rates has crushed a wave of mortgage refinancing that kicked off in 2010, leading to big declines in mortgage banking revenue. Other areas of lending have also slowed. For instance, some big corporate borrowers have been opting to issue bonds rather than take out traditional loans, JPMorgan chief financial officer Marianne Lake said. And, in areas where banks are finding growth, like credit-card lending, they are doling out fat rewards and cutting interest rates to lure customers from one another. Even so, bank executives sounded optimistic on Thursday about the outlook for lending. – Reuters       Read More Irish banks could feel strongest effects of new Basel rules on capital Jonathan Sugarman: Ireland has destroyed the lives of whistleblowers JPMorgan profit up 16.8 % as bank makes more loans Irish Nationwide mortgage holders to lose on tracker refund Central Bank finds weak regulatory controls at some IFSC banks Permanent TSB plans to resume dividend payments to investors Central Bank scope of foreign banks here sets down a Brexit marker Central Bank plans new rules to encourage mortgage switching The Barclays boss and the whistleblower Barclays: What happens when you go after the whistleblower  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services AIB sells non-performing buy-to-let loans to Goldman Sachs for €200m Economy Irish and Spanish recoveries took rather different routes Politics British government realises Brexit is a mistake, official says Sport Ireland ‘safest country in world’ to be an MMA fighter Sponsored Ten thrifty tips to brighten up your home Let a Hume PhD scholarship unlock your potential at Maynooth University Broadband and digital technology essential for Irish business growth Lifting the diamond to a higher level Latest Business Preparation key to dealing with trauma of product recalls 07:00 Apple reportedly considering bid for Toshiba’s chip business 06:56 ‘Nothing is wasted’: chef Robin Gill goes for sustainability over style 06:30 Future Proof: Stables pulls a stunt to beat recession 06:25 Irish style economic short-termism is about to strike again 06:00 Most Read in Business 1 Brexiteers prove that stupid is as stupid does 2 AIB sells non-performing buy-to-let loans to Goldman Sachs for €200m 3 Irish style economic short-termism is about to strike again 4 Carlow’s Netwatch taps into US demand for remote security 5 German bosses say Brexit may have silver lining for Ireland 6 Irish and Spanish recoveries took rather different routes 7 Ex-Army colleagues target handgun owners with new device 8 French and Italian populists unprepared for trauma of euro exit 9 Jonathan Sugarman: Ireland has destroyed the lives of whistleblowers 10 The 95-year-old professor heralding a new type of long-lasting battery Never miss a story.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 1:45 AM, April 14, 2017 NEW YORK - Top Wall Street bankers on Thursday said they are having positive discussions about financial regulation in Washington, and downplayed the idea that U.S. policymakers might force their institutions to split up. On conference calls to discuss first-quarter earnings, executives from JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> and Citigroup Inc <C.N> said recent chatter about reinstating a Depression-era law to separate capital markets operations from traditional lending is nothing more than talk. The White House confirmed last week that economic adviser and former Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N> executive Gary Cohn backed the idea of bringing back the law, called Glass-Steagall. He is one of several prominent lawmakers, regulators or policy advisers who have expressed support for the idea, which Wall Street generally opposes. Citigroup Chief Executive Michael Corbat said his conversations with Trump administration officials have not centered on the topic. "I have yet to have anybody really explain to me what value there is in terms of either a reinstatement of Glass-Steagall, which is in itself strange, or what '21st century Glass-Steagall' is," he said. "We continue to ask about it but not necessarily be that focused on it." He noted that a number of Wall Street executives have been "very engaged" with the Trump administration, as well as key members of congressional committees and regulators with regard to financial reform. He called the White House conversations "constructive." JPMorgan executives struck a similar tone, saying a reinstatement of Glass-Steagall is inconsistent with other objectives of President Donald Trump. "It is a pro-growth agenda, tax, infrastructure, regulatory reform," said CEO Jamie Dimon. "And that is a good thing."

(AFP/Molly RILEY) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Strong trading results, rather than lending, was the driving force behind solid earnings reported by large US banks on Thursday (Apr 13), as executives expressed measured optimism about the prospects for President Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported big jumps in first-quarter net income compared with the same period of last year, while Wells Fargo continued to feel the effects of a fake accounts scandal and reported flat profits, missing analyst estimates. But in a sign of sluggishness at all three banks, loan growth was weak, especially in some key areas such as corporate loans, which can serve as a proxy on broader economic activity. "The economy is still what the economy was, it's a slow-growth economy" Citigroup chief financial officer John Gerspach said on a conference call with reporters. "It's not a robust economy yet." But he added, "I do believe that there is optimism that it will continue to grow and get better." Gerspach said Trump's election and the expectations of tax cuts and other growth measures had boosted optimism for stronger growth, but "we haven't seen concrete changes yet in policies." Shares of Citigroup fell 0.8 per cent to US$58.04, while JPMorgan lost 1.2 per cent to US$84.40, and Wells Fargo tumbled 3.3 per cent to US$51.35. Banking shares had rallied strongly on Trump's election amid expectation of he would ease of regulations and promote other growth measures that would help their business. But the sector has cooled considerably on Wall Street as Trump's policies have yet to materialise. The S&P 500 financials index is down 0.3 per cent so far in 2017. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon described US consumers and businesses as "healthy overall," but said growth could accelerate sharply if overly-constraining regulations were eased. Dimon declined to estimate the chances Trump will be able to enact such changes. "I don't want to put odds on it, but I think you have a lot of people working on it to get it done," he told reporters on a conference call. FEWER ENERGY DEFAULTS JPMorgan said results were boosted by big jumps in trading of bonds and other financial products, as well as the benefit of higher interest rates. Net income rose 16.8 per cent to US$6.5 billion. Citigroup also highlighted strong trading results, especially in interest rate-related products. Net income rose 16.8 per cent to US$4.1 billion. Both banks also benefited from lower reserves compared with the January-March period last year, when they set aside hundreds of millions of dollars to protect against the possibility of energy defaults due to the oil industry slump. Wells Fargo also benefited from improvements in the energy sector, which permitted it to release US$200 million in reserves. However, the bank's expenses for salaries and other non-interest costs rose by nearly four times that amount due to higher legal costs and greater spending on compliance programs. Earnings were US$5.5 billion, the same as the year-ago level. The bank experienced a 35 per cent drop in the opening of new checking accounts and a 42 per cent tumble in credit card applications. Wells Fargo chief executive Timothy Sloan said those consumer trends likely will worsen in the second quarter, but should rebound after that. The company has established a "rebuilding trust office" that includes staff dedicating 100 per cent of its time to implementing the consent decrees with regulators. "Right now, the most important job of this company is rebuilding trust," said Sloan said on a conference call with analysts. Wells Fargo's results came three days after the bank released a report on the factors that led to scandal over the opening of about two million deposit and credit card accounts without the customers' approval or knowledge. The report pointed blame especially at former chief executive John Stumpf and former community banking chief Carrie Tolstedt, who have been forced to pay back a total of US$136 million in compensation due to the debacle. Among the reforms, Wells Fargo has addressed a "siloed" corporate structure that meant the problems in retail banking were not scrutinised more broadly. "We centralised our enterprise activities," Sloan said. "The primary reason we did that was so that we had a more appropriate escalation of risk and a more timely escalation of risk." - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Berkshire Hathaway's disclosure on Wednesday that it had cut its stake in the bank also weighed on the stock.JPMorgan and Citigroup also slipped, despite reporting better-than-expected quarterly profits. Bank stocks have retreated after a strong rally as investors fret over lofty valuations amid questions about Trump's ability to do good on his promises of tax cuts and simpler regulations after failing to get a healthcare bill passed. The S&P 500 financial index slipped 0.3 percent, setting it up for the fifth straight day of losses. At 12:28 p.m. ET (1628 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 40.94 points, or 0.2 percent, at 20,550.92, the S&P 500 was down 3.84 points, or 0.16 percent, at 2,341.09 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.68 points, or 0.01 percent, at 5,835.48.President Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that the dollar "was getting too strong" and that he would like to see interest rates stay low. Investors have sought safe-haven assets through the week amid geopolitical tensions in Syria and North Korea. A report of a massive bomb being dropped by the United States in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday added to uncertainty. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, led by a near 1 percent decline in the energy sector as oil prices fell. However, the technology sector's 0.3 percent rise put it on track to break its nine day losing streak."Despite the rhetoric that comes out of any political event, if you have good economic data and decent earnings, (the market will) overcome the day-to-day dynamics of macro policy and political risk," said Nathan Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston Massachusetts. A report from the University of Michigan showed that U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly strengthened in April as consumer optimism on current economic conditions climbed to its strongest level since November 2000.Trading volumes are likely to be weak on Thursday ahead of the Good Friday holiday.Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,820 to 989. On the Nasdaq, 1,675 issues fell and 1,041 advanced.The S&P 500 index showed five 52-week highs and one low, while the Nasdaq recorded 23 highs and 42 lows.

Energy stocks were down the most as crude oil prices headed lower. Technology companies led the gainers. Trading was light ahead of the long Easter holiday weekend. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 3 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,341 as of 10:26 a.m.Mountain time. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 39 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,552. The Nasdaq composite index fell less than 1 point to 5,836. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. markets will be closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday. VIDEOS TOP JOBS THE QUOTE: "I'd anticipate it's going to be a fairly light run coming into the end of the week here," said Paul Springmeyer, senior portfolio manager at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank. BANK ON IT: Several banks reported better-than-expected results thanks to improved revenue from trading and rising interest rates. The stocks got a boost early on, but some lost their gains by midday. Citigroup slipped 6 cents to $58.45, while JPMorgan Chase shed 27 cents to $85.13. PNC Financial Services added 82 cents to $116.82. BUFFETT EFFECT: Wells Fargo slid 2.4 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold some of its stock in the lender to avoid being designated a bank holding company. Wells also reported flat quarterly earnings, reflecting continuing struggles to recover from its sales practice scandal. The stock gave up $1.26 to $51.86. BAD QUARTER: Pier 1 Imports slumped 10.3 percent after the home decor retailer reported disappointing sales. The stock slid 75 cents to $6.51. ECONOMIC DATA: The Labor Department said that its producer price index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach consumers, fell 0.1 percent in March. That's the first drop since August and reflects falling energy prices. Producer prices were up 2.3 percent in March from a year earlier, the sharpest annual increase in five years. The Labor Department also reported that the number of applications for unemployment benefits declined last week. MARKETS OVERSEAS: In Europe, Germany's DAX slid 0.4 percent, while France's CAC-40 shed 0.6 percent. London's FTSE-100 lost 0.3 percent. In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.7 percent and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 lost 0.7 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slid 0.2 percent after a report showed China's export growth accelerated in March, while import growth cooled. Seoul's Kospi added 0.9 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar continued to weaken a day after President Donald Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the dollar was "getting too strong" and that he won't declare China a currency manipulator. The remarks helped push the yen to its highest level since mid-November, just after the presidential election. The dollar slid to 109.20 yen from 109.71 yen late Wednesday. The euro strengthened to $1.0629 from $1.0598. ENERGY: Oil prices moved lower after an early rally. Benchmark U.S. crude was down 15 cents to $52.96 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was down 23 cents to $55.63 per barrel in London. A report by the International Energy Agency said that demand growth for oil will slow for a second consecutive year this year. TREASURY YIELDS: Bond prices didn't move much. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note held steady at 2.24 percent.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Say cheers to these three new Salt Lake City bars Once free despite his sex assault convictions, it's prison for former Mormon bishop Utah Jazz are healthier, but are they healthy enough?

Stock markets meanwhile churned lower with cautious investors unwinding positions in subdued trade before the long Easter holiday weekend. European equity markets traded near lows after Wall Street came off to a weaker start in a mixed reaction to first-quarter results from heavyweight financials JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. The European single currency fell back against the dollar, having briefly strengthened after Trump, having overnight tweeted his belief that "economic confidence is soaring", told The Wall Street Journal he was worried about the greenback's strength. "I think our dollar is getting too strong, and partially that's my fault because people have confidence in me. But that's hurting -- that will hurt ultimately," Trump, who has talked the dollar down several times since his election, told the paper. The US unit also posted slight gains against the safe-haven Japanese yen after slumping overnight to a low last seen in November. 'Overdone' "Trump's comments about a stronger dollar continued to drive trading this Thursday, the reaction being slightly overdone thanks to subdued volumes ahead of the Easter break," Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell told AFP. European markets London, Frankfurt and Paris will not reopen until Tuesday, while Wall Street will not trade on Friday. Asian markets were mixed Thursday after Trump also softened his stance on Beijing, easing concerns of a possible trade war, dealers said. Trump also reversed course on an earlier vow to label Beijing a currency manipulator and slap punitive tariffs on Chinese imports. Geopolitical tensions meanwhile continued to weigh on investor sentiment, as ties between the US and Russia turn increasingly frosty over Moscow's backing for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But Trump's praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping Wednesday raised hopes of easing friction between the two superpowers over dealing with North Korea's nuclear programme. And a surge in Chinese exports in March, the largest jump in two years, bolstered hopes that the world's number two economy is getting back on track after a recent slowdown -- it grew last year at its slowest pace in a quarter of a century. Oil recovers Oil prices recovered after the International Energy Agency said that the world market is "very close to balance" as landmark OPEC-led production cuts are mitigated by rising US supply and slipping worldwide demand growth. But in its monthly report the IEA also said that oil stockpiles probably rose in the first quarter of the year, rattling investors who worry about ongoing oil glut despite OPEC's efforts. Gold continued to sparkle as investors shifted money into safe assets, rising 0.7 percent on the day and taking its rise over the past three months to nearly 7.5 percent.

European stock markets meanwhile churned lower with trade subdued before the long Easter holiday weekend. Investors were also awaiting key first-quarter bank results from U.S. heavyweights JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. In Thursday morning London deals, the European single currency fell to US$1.0641 after briefly strengthening on the Trump remarks. And the U.S. unit held steady against the safe-haven Japanese yen after slumping overnight to 108.73 yen — a low last witnessed in November. The Frankfurt, London and Paris stock markets all shed between 0.4 and 0.7 percent in value. "Trump's comments about a stronger dollar continued to drive trading this Thursday, the reaction being slightly overdone thanks to subdued volumes ahead of the Easter break," Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell told AFP. "With both the pound and euro taking nearly half a percent off the greenback, the (European) indices found themselves on the back foot (with) the FTSE, DAX and CAC all in a state of red." Asian markets were mixed Thursday after Trump also softened his stance on Beijing, easing concerns of a possible trade war, dealers said. The dollar fell after Trump told The Wall Street Journal he was worried about its strength and said he favored low interest rates.

The most influential weights on the index included Barrick Gold Corp, the world's largest gold miner, which fell 1.6 percent to C$26.44 as prices for the precious metal edged off a five-month high. Analysts say Barrick must take steps to safeguard investor confidence by ensuring there are no more operating mishaps at its mines after a third incident in 18 months at its big Argentina mine. Financial stocks were slightly lower as US banking season kicked off with JPMorgan and Citi both reporting profit that exceeded expectations and Wells Fargo reporting flat profit and a fall in revenue. Royal Bank of Canada pulled back 0.3 percent to C$95.82 and Bank of Nova Scotia fell 0.4 percent to C$76.49. At 10:03 a.m. ET (1403 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was down 19.19 points, or 0.12 percent, at 15,629.21. Six of the index's 10 main groups were in negative territory. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 0.7 percent. Canadian new home prices rose in February, driven by higher costs in Toronto and other cities in Ontario, Statistics Canada said on Thursday in a report that was likely to underscore concerns that some markets are becoming too hot. Canadian manufacturing sales declined less than expected in February after three consecutive months of increases, weighed down by declines in the vehicle assembly sector, separate StatsCan data showed.   Copyright Reuters, 2017          Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Mail Print the author Shoaib Ur Rehman Siddiqui Previous Hungary's Orban eyes 2018 election with 'anti-Soros' university law Next White sugar gains ahead of expiry, London cocoa at 4-week low   Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

While none pulled an alarm bell, they were clear there is still some uncertainty about public policy despite confidence in the economy. Fixed-income trading revenue shined once again, and consumer lending continued to show small signs of weakness. But perhaps more notable is the fact that at least one key executive allayed fears about the potential re-introduction of the Glass-Steagall Act, which would require banks to separate their consumer and investment banking arms. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Signage is reflected in the window of a JPMorgan Chase & Co bank branch in New York. Photo: Mark Kauzlarich JPMorgan, the nation’s biggest lender by market value and likely the most vulnerable to such re-regulation, is simply shrugging off its feasibility.My take on comments from chief financial officer Marianne Lake is that she isn’t losing sleep over it, despite calls in Washington for its return. “The diversification of our business has been and was a source of strength not just for us but also for financial markets during the crisis,” she argued on the bank’s conference call with analysts, adding that such a move doesn’t feel consistent with other objectives of the Trump administration, including its pro-growth agenda and calls for a “level playing field”.Even if “re-regulation”, deregulation or tax reform, or all three, don’t materialise, banks are living up to the belief that they’ll be able to thrive in a healthier economic environment.

Stock markets meanwhile churned lower with investors unwinding positions in subdued trade before the long Easter holiday weekend. European equity markets traded near lows after Wall Street came off to a weaker start in a mixed reaction to first-quarter results from heavyweight financials JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. The European single currency fell back against the dollar, having briefly strengthened after Trump told The Wall Street Journal that he was worried about the greenback’s strength. “I think our dollar is getting too strong, and partially that’s my fault because people have confidence in me. But that’s hurting — that will hurt ultimately,” Trump told the paper. The US unit also posted slight gains against the safe-haven Japanese yen after slumping overnight to a low last seen in November. – ‘Overdone’ – “Trump’s comments about a stronger dollar continued to drive trading this Thursday, the reaction being slightly overdone thanks to subdued volumes ahead of the Easter break,” Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell told AFP. European markets London, Frankfurt and Paris are shut on Friday and Monday, while Wall Street will not trade on Friday. Asian markets were mixed Thursday after Trump also softened his stance on Beijing, easing concerns of a possible trade war, dealers said. Trump also reversed course on an earlier vow to label Beijing a currency manipulator and slap punitive tariffs on Chinese imports. Geopolitical tensions meanwhile continued to weigh on investor sentiment, as ties between the US and Russia turn increasingly frosty over Moscow’s backing for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But Trump’s praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping Wednesday raised hopes of easing friction between the two superpowers over dealing with North Korea’s nuclear programme. And a surge in Chinese exports in March, the largest jump in two years, bolstered hopes that the world’s number two economy is getting back on track after a recent slowdown — it grew last year at its slowest pace in a quarter of a century. – Oil recovers – Oil prices recovered after the International Energy Agency said that the world market is “very close to balance” as landmark OPEC-led production cuts are mitigated by rising US supply and slipping worldwide demand growth. But in its monthly report the IEA also said said that oil stockpiles probably rose in the first quarter of the year, rattling investors who worry about an ongoing oil glut despite OPEC’s efforts. Gold continued to sparkle as investors shifted money into safe assets, rising 0.9 percent on the day and taking its rise over the past three months to nearly 7.5 percent. – Key figures at 1345 GMT – New York – Dow: DOWN 0.1 percent at 20,569.39 points London – FTSE 100: DOWN 0.4 percent at 7,320.74 Frankfurt – DAX 30: DOWN 0.4 percent at 12,110.97 Paris – CAC 40: DOWN 0.6 percent at 5,072.42 EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.6 percent at 3,448.71 Tokyo – Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.7 percent at 18,426.84 (close) Hong Kong – Hang Seng: DOWN 0.2 percent at 24,261.66 (close) Shanghai – Composite: UP less than 0.1 percent at 3,275.96 (close) Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0615 from $1.0671 at 2100 GMT Pound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2513 from $1.2544 Dollar/yen: UNCHANGED at 109.35 yen from 109.07 Oil – West Texas Intermediate: UP 17 cents at $53.28 per barrel Oil – Brent North Sea: UP 6 cents at $55.92 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share via Email In this article: DollarDonald Trump You may also like Abuja runway 96% ready as airport reopens next Wednesday 2 hours ago  Business Experts harp on policy implementation at 'Bullion' lecture 2 hours ago  Business News Unpacking Nigeria’s economic recovery and growth plan 2 hours ago  Business RoundUp More   Sport Gumel, Ogba, Ndanusa, Umar, others knocked out 2 hours ago  Football Dendoncker denies United, violence mars Lyon-Besiktas 2 hours ago  Football Violence blights Nigerian League Football 2 hours ago  Football Sponsors want more of Lords, golf partnership 2 hours ago  Golf 3SC qualify for NPFL U-15 quarterfinal, Remo, ABS fight for spot 2 hours ago  Football Rivers Hoopers, Customs clash as NBBF men’s basketball league dunks off 2 hours ago   Top News Nigeria Africa World Metro Opinion Editorial Contributors Columnists Cartoons Business Appointments Business News Business RoundUp Industry Aviation Capital Market Communications Energy DrillBytes Maritime SweetCrude Infrastructure Money Technology Gadgets Telecoms Social Media Technology Sport Football Boxing Athletics Tennis Golf Arts Arts Art House Artfolk Revue Film Literature Music Theatre Visual Arts Features Policy & Politics BusinessAgro Education Executive Motoring Executive Briefs Focus Friday Worship Law Media Science Youth Speak Property Environment Mortgage Finance Real Estate Urban Development Guardian Woman Entrepreneurship GW Fiction Personality Issues WIMBIZ Saturday Magazine Youth Magazine Just Human Life & Style Love & Life Transition Travel & Tourism Celebrity Brand Intelligence Gardening Weekend Beats Sunday Magazine Ibru Ecumenical Centre Campus CityFile News Feature Living Healthy Diet Living Wellbeing Newspeople Guardian TV News Opinion Fashion Sport Entertainment Science & Tech GTV Exclusive Guardian Life Home Lifestyle Showbiz Trending LS Diaries On The Cover The Guardian Home About Us Advertise With Us |     Powered by Ventra Copyright © 2017 Guardian Newspapers.

Wells Fargo's shares fell 2 percent, pulling down the S&P 500 and the financial sector, after the bank reported a big drop in mortgage banking revenue. Berkshire Hathaway's disclosure on Wednesday that it had cut its stake in the bank also weighed on the stock. JPMorgan and Citigroup also slipped, despite reporting better-than-expected quarterly profits. Bank stocks have retreated after a strong rally as investors fret over lofty valuations amid questions about Trump's ability to do good on his promises of tax cuts and simpler regulations after failing to get a healthcare bill passed. The S&P 500 financial index slipped 0.3 percent, setting it up for the fifth straight day of losses. At 12:28 p.m. ET (1628 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 40.94 points, or 0.2 percent, at 20,550.92, the S&P 500 was down 3.84 points, or 0.16 percent, at 2,341.09 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.68 points, or 0.01 percent, at 5,835.48. President Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that the dollar "was getting too strong" and that he would like to see interest rates stay low. Investors have sought safe-haven assets through the week amid geopolitical tensions in Syria and North Korea. A report of a massive bomb being dropped by the United States in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday added to uncertainty. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, led by a near 1 percent decline in the energy sector as oil prices fell. However, the technology sector's 0.3 percent rise put it on track to break its nine day losing streak. "Despite the rhetoric that comes out of any political event, if you have good economic data and decent earnings, (the market will) overcome the day-to-day dynamics of macro policy and political risk," said Nathan Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston Massachusetts. A report from the University of Michigan showed that U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly strengthened in April as consumer optimism on current economic conditions climbed to its strongest level since November 2000. Trading volumes are likely to be weak on Thursday ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,820 to 989.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Asian stocks were lower on Friday as investors in the region had many reasons to worry about rising geopolitical tensions and the situation on the Korean Peninsula. Many markets were closed for public holidays. KEEPING SCORE: Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 percent to 18,364.68 and South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.5 percent to 2,137.07. Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.6 percent to 3,254.97. Hong Kong markets were closed and so were markets in Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries. NORTH KOREA: Analysts said investors sought safe havens as North Korea was believed to be planning a nuclear test and the U.S. sent an aircraft carrier toward the region. Pyongyang is preparing for the 105th anniversary of the birth of its founder Kim Il Sung on Saturday. North Korean has intensified rhetoric warning it would retaliate strongly against any aggression as U.S.-South Korea hold military exercises. ANALYST'S VIEWPOINT: "Geopolitics seemed to dominate over the past week with the ramifications of the U.S.' missile strike on Syria still reverberating and tensions around North Korea steadily building," Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, said in a daily commentary. "The issues around Syria are likely to settle down assuming U.S. involvement does not escalate, but North Korea is more risky." WALL STREET: U.S. stocks finished lower for the third straight day on Thursday as energy stocks led the decline. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 0.7 percent to 2,328.95. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7 percent to 20,453.25. The Nasdaq composite index lost 0.5 percent to 5,805.15. U.S. markets will be closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday. OIL: On Friday, the New York Mercantile Exchange and the London Metal Exchange were closed for a holiday. On Thursday, benchmark U.S. crude rose 7 cents to close at $53.18 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 3 cents to close at $55.89 per barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar bounced back after weakening against major currencies following President Donald Trump's comment in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the dollar was "getting too strong." The dollar strengthened to 109.18 yen from 109.12 yen. The euro rose slightly to $1.0617 from $1.0616. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

For example, in food service, the address, phone number or menu details of a restaurant; in health care, the health insurances accepted by a physician or the precise drop-off point of the emergency room at a hospital campus; or in finance, the ATM locations, retail bank holiday hours or insurance agent biographies. Intelligent search, which are searches of digital knowledge that combine context and intent, has grown significantly in recent years. Yext’s solution drives commerce by providing real-time digital knowledge that allows consumers to find the businesses and service providers that are most relevant to them.

Login Search Stocks Showing A Lack Of Direction In Morning Trading - U.S. Commentary April 13, 2017, 10:40:00 AM EDT By RTT News Shutterstock photo (RTTNews.com) - After initially moving to the downside, stocks have shown a lack of direction over the course of morning trading on Thursday. The major averages have spent the morning bouncing back and forth across the unchanged line. Currently, the major averages are turning in a mixed performance. While the Dow is down 8.61 points or less than 0.1 percent at 20,583.25, the Nasdaq is up 11.49 points or 0.2 percent at 5,847.65 and the S&P 500 is up 0.13 points or less than 0.1 percent at 2,345.06. The choppy trading on Wall Street comes as traders digest comments by President Donald Trump, who told the Wall Street Journal said he thinks the U.S. dollar "is getting too strong." On the U.S. economic front, a report released by the Labor Department showed a modest decrease in producer prices in the month of March. The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand edged down by 0.1 percent in March after rising by 0.3 percent in February. Economists had expected prices to come in flat. The report also said core producer prices, which exclude food and energy prices, came in unchanged in March following a 0.3 percent increase in February. Core prices had been expected to rise by 0.2 percent. The Labor Department also released a report showing an unexpected drop in first-time claims for unemployment benefits in the week ended April 8th. The report said initial jobless claims dipped to 234,000, a decrease of 1,000 from the previous week's revised level of 235,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to rise to 245,000. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan released a report showing an unexpected improvement in consumer sentiment in the month of April. The report said the consumer sentiment index rose to 98.0 in April from 96.9 in March, while economists had expected the index to edge down to 96.6. Trading are also digesting earnings news from financial giants JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), Citigroup ( C ), and Wells Fargo ( WFC ). While JPMorgan and Citigroup are both moving higher after reporting first quarter results that beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines, Wells Fargo has moved lower after reporting better than expected first quarter earnings but on weaker than expected revenues. Most of the major sectors are showing only modest moves on the day, although considerable strength is visible among biotechnology stocks. Reflecting the strength in the biotech sector, the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index is up by 1.2 percent. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly lower during trading on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slid by 0.7 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index edged down by 0.2 percent. The major European markets have also moved to the downside on the day. While the German DAX Index is down by 0.2 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is down by 0.3 percent and the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.4 percent. In the bond market, treasuries have pulled back off their early highs but continue to see notable strength. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by 3.5 basis points at 2.261 percent.

In a unanimous vote, the bank agreed on the deepest cut in nearly eight years, bringing the overnight Selic lending rate to an almost two-year low of 11.25 percent. Despite calls from some politicians and business leaders for the central bank to be even more aggressive, the policy statement announcing the decision suggested it would keep the current pace of cuts for now. JPMorgan economists wrote in a note to clients: "At the current juncture, we keep our call for another 100bp cut at the May meeting, followed by one cut of 75 basis points in July and a final 50 basis-point cut in September." Rate future yields indicated an 80 percent probability of a 100 basis-point cut in May, with a 20 percent chance of a 125 basis point reduction, traders said. The Brazilian real firmed 0.4 percent, tracking other Latin American currencies higher after US President Donald Trump said that the US dollar was getting too strong and he would prefer the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index, however, was nearly flat. Shares of planemaker Embraer SA fell 2.6 percent, leading losses on the index, after disappointing first-quarter delivery figures. Analysts at Morgan Stanley Securities cut the price target on US-listed Embraer shares to $23 from $27.   Copyright Reuters, 2017  Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Mail Print the author Shoaib Ur Rehman Siddiqui Previous Portugal expects to eliminate budget deficit by 2020   Next SAP says executive Steven Singh to leave company   Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

FILE - This July 15, 2013, file photo, shows the New York Stock Exchange. Global stock markets turned lower and the dollar was volatile Thursday, April 13, 2017, after President Donald Trump withdrew a threat to declare ... By YOUKYUNG LEE AP Business Writer SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - Asian stocks were lower on Friday as investors in the region had many reasons to worry about rising geopolitical tensions and the situation on the Korean Peninsula. Many markets were closed for public holidays. KEEPING SCORE: Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 percent to 18,364.68 and South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.5 percent to 2,137.07. Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.6 percent to 3,254.97. Hong Kong markets were closed and so were markets in Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries. NORTH KOREA: Analysts said investors sought safe havens as North Korea was believed to be planning a nuclear test and the U.S. sent an aircraft carrier toward the region. Pyongyang is preparing for the 105th anniversary of the birth of its founder Kim Il Sung on Saturday. North Korean has intensified rhetoric warning it would retaliate strongly against any aggression as U.S.-South Korea hold military exercises. ANALYST'S VIEWPOINT: "Geopolitics seemed to dominate over the past week with the ramifications of the U.S.' missile strike on Syria still reverberating and tensions around North Korea steadily building," Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, said in a daily commentary. "The issues around Syria are likely to settle down assuming U.S. involvement does not escalate, but North Korea is more risky." WALL STREET: U.S. stocks finished lower for the third straight day on Thursday as energy stocks led the decline. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 0.7 percent to 2,328.95. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7 percent to 20,453.25. The Nasdaq composite index lost 0.5 percent to 5,805.15. U.S. markets will be closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday. OIL: On Friday, the New York Mercantile Exchange and the London Metal Exchange were closed for a holiday. On Thursday, benchmark U.S. crude rose 7 cents to close at $53.18 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 3 cents to close at $55.89 per barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar bounced back after weakening against major currencies following President Donald Trump's comment in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the dollar was "getting too strong." The dollar strengthened to 109.18 yen from 109.12 yen. The euro rose slightly to $1.0617 from $1.0616. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Shares of JPMorgan and Citigroup rose about 1 percent after the two banks reported better-than-expected quarterly profits. However, Wells Fargo slipped 1.4 percent after reporting a big drop in mortgage banking revenue and Berkshire Hathaway's disclosure that it had reduced its stake in the bank. The earnings come in the wake of a frenetic rally in bank shares that started after Trump's election as US president on hopes that he would rein in banking regulations and introduce other business friendly policies. The S&P 500 financial index was up 0.2 percent. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, which are due to report results next week, were also up. At 11:04 a.m. EDT (1504 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was up 6.58 points, or 0.03 percent, at 20,598.44, the S&P 500 was up 2.22 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,347.15 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 18.15 points, or 0.31 percent, at 5,854.31. President Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that the dollar "was getting too strong" and that he would like to see interest rates stay low. However, the impact of the comments was short-lived as the beaten down dollar recovered slightly and gold prices lost some of their luster after gaining for four straight days. "Despite the rhetoric that comes out of any political event, if you have good economic data and decent earnings, (the market will) overcome the day-to-day dynamics of macro policy and political risk," said Nathan Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston Massachusetts. Five of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by technology, which rose for the first time after a nine-day losing streak. Trading volumes are likely to be weak on Thursday ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,360 to 1,351. On the Nasdaq, 1,332 issues rose and 1,258 fell. The S&P 500 index showed three 52-week highs and no lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 18 highs and 37 lows.   Copyright Reuters, 2017  Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Mail Print the author Shoaib Ur Rehman Siddiqui Previous GLOBAL MARKETS-Dollar rebounds, Treasury yields off lows, after Trump comments   Next High-grade euro zone yields fall after Trump rate comments     Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The company said Thursday that new checking account openings were down 35 percent in March from the same month a year ago. New credit card applications were down 42 percent. Overall, Wells Fargo reported net income of $5.46 billion, or $1 per share, in the quarter ending March 31, compared with $5.46 billion, or 99 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. The results surpassed Wall Street expectations of 96 cents per share, according to FactSet. The company posted revenue of $23.93 billion in the period. Its adjusted revenue was $22 billion, falling short of analyst forecasts of $22.4 billion, according to FactSet. Like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, who also reported their results on Thursday, Wells Fargo did benefit somewhat from the rise in interest rates since a year ago. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates twice recently, last December and in March. Higher rates mean banks like Wells Fargo can charge more for loans. In the quarter, Wells Fargo’s net interest income was $12.3 billion, up 5 percent from a year earlier. “Wells Fargo continued to make meaningful progress in the first quarter in rebuilding trust with customers and other important stakeholders, while producing solid financial results,” said Wells Fargo’s CEO Tim Sloan in a prepared statement. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco bank $185 million for opening more than two million accounts fraudulently by employees to meet sales goals. The bank has been dealing with the aftermath ever since. Earlier this week, the San Francisco released its investigation into the scandal, and said it clawed back another $75 million in pay from former CEO John Stumpf and former community bank executive Carrie Tolstedt, saying the executives took too long to recognize problems at the company. There are some signs that the damage from the scandal is dissipating. While March checking account and credit card applications were down from a year ago, they were both up from February. Sloan has said he believes the customer retreat has mitigated from its worst levels in December and January. Measures of customer loyalty and customer satisfaction were also up in March from February. Wells Fargo’s stock fell about 2 percent Thursday morning. Investors are selling in part because Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, the bank’s largest shareholder, said late Wednesday it would sell some of its stake for regulatory reasons.

The S&P 500 financial index was up 0.2 percent. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, which are due to report results next week, were also up. At 11:04 a.m. EDT (1504 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was up 6.58 points, or 0.03 percent, at 20,598.44, the S&P 500 was up 2.22 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,347.15 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 18.15 points, or 0.31 percent, at 5,854.31.President Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that the dollar "was getting too strong" and that he would like to see interest rates stay low. However, the impact of the comments was short-lived as the beaten down dollar recovered slightly and gold prices lost some of their luster after gaining for four straight days. "Despite the rhetoric that comes out of any political event, if you have good economic data and decent earnings, (the market will) overcome the day-to-day dynamics of macro policy and political risk," said Nathan Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston Massachusetts. Five of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by technology, which rose for the first time after a nine-day losing streak. Trading volumes are likely to be weak on Thursday ahead of the Good Friday holiday.Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,360 to 1,351. On the Nasdaq, 1,332 issues rose and 1,258 fell.The S&P 500 index showed three 52-week highs and no lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 18 highs and 37 lows.

Wells Fargo & Co, which relies more on traditional lending and less on markets-related businesses, reported a slight dip in profit due to a slowdown in mortgage banking.The results underscored concerns expressed recently by analysts and investors that higher interest rates, combined with uncertainty about geopolitical events, could hurt economic growth - and therefore crimp lenders' bottom lines.But on conference calls to discuss results, top bank executives dismissed those concerns, citing strong demand from borrowers with impressive credit quality."I wouldn't overreact to loan growth," said JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.The bank's core loan portfolio averaged $812 billion during the first quarter, up 9 percent on an annualized basis. But that growth rate has ticked down from 12 percent in the previous quarter and 17 percent a year ago. Wells Fargo's annual loan growth rate of 4 percent has also been slowing over the past year. Across the banking industry, loans fell slightly during the first three months of the year, according to Federal Reserve data.John Conlon, chief equity strategist at People's United Wealth Management, who invests in bank stocks, said he is still concerned about loan growth after seeing the reports and listening to the executives' comments."There's a great deal of optimism," Conlon said, "but there's still uncertainty." Wells Fargo's shares fell 2 percent to $52.08 following its results, while Citigroup's stock rose 1.2 percent to $59.21 and JPMorgan rose 0.7 percent to $85.98. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index was flat.The mortgage business is putting particular pressure on loan growth. The recent uptick in interest rates has crushed a wave of mortgage refinancing that kicked off in 2010, leading to big declines in mortgage banking revenue.Other areas of lending have also slowed. For instance, some big corporate borrowers have been opting to issue bonds rather than take out traditional loans, JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said. And, in areas where banks are finding growth, like credit-card lending, they are doling out fat rewards and cutting interest rates to lure customers from one another.Even so, bank executives sounded optimistic on Thursday about the outlook for lending.Higher rates allow banks to earn more money from the loans they make, as well as the idle cash they have invested in low-risk securities like Treasury bonds. JPMorgan expects to add another $400 million to its net interest income in the second quarter. That metric is important because it shows the difference between what banks pay for funds and what they earn from using them.Additionally, they said, signals that lawmakers and the White House want to spur the economy bode well for loan growth. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said first-quarter lending reflects some waiting by borrowers for Washington to act."We haven't seen concrete changes yet in policies," Gerspach said. "When we get tax reform [and] when the administration is successful in implementing some of what they have been talking about - hopefully that will spur the economy on."

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Major U.S. stock indexes fell on Thursday for a third straight day as investors weighed earnings reports from big U.S. banks and geopolitical tensions, while the tech sector fell for a tenth consecutive session. Wells Fargo shares fell 3.3 percent, pulling down the S&P 500, after the bank reported a drop in mortgage banking revenue. Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed late on Wednesday that it had cut its stake in the bank. JPMorgan fell 1.2 percent and Citigroup slipped 0.8 percent, even as those companies reported better-than-expected quarterly profits. Banks revealed more evidence of a slowdown in loan growth in their reports. The S&P 500 banks index closed at its lowest point since early December. Investors have sought safe-haven assets throughout the week due to geopolitical tensions in Syria and North Korea. News of a massive bomb being dropped by the United States in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday added to uncertainty. Kate Warne, principal investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said a dip in bond yields put pressure on stocks ahead of a holiday weekend in the United States. "What we've seen is investors from the rest of the world putting more money in U.S. Treasuries" due to geopolitical concerns, Warne said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 138.61 points, or 0.67 percent, to 20,453.25, the S&P 500 lost 15.98 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,328.95 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 31.01 points, or 0.53 percent, to 5,805.15. The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed 8.9 percent since President Donald Trump's Nov. 8 election, supported by his planned economic agenda of tax cuts and economic stimulus. But the rally has stalled the past six weeks as some investors question Trump's ability to enact his proposals. There is "some concern among investors that there is now a shift going on in Washington to international and away from a domestic policy," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. The S&P 500 financial index dropped 1.3 percent, its fifth straight day of losses. Energy shares were the worst-performing group, falling 1.8 percent. The technology sector fell 0.4 percent, marking its longest losing streak since May 2012. The results from banks kicked off what is expected to be a strong first-quarter U.S. reporting season. S&P 500 companies are expected to post a 10.4 percent rise in earnings for the period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We could have double-digit earnings growth; we haven’t seen that in some time," said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. "Investors are going to be impressed with that." A report from the University of Michigan showed that U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly strengthened in April as consumer optimism on current economic conditions climbed to its highest level since November 2000. About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.56-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 51 new lows.
