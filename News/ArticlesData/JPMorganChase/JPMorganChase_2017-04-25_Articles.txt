While giant corporations have for decades and on a bipartisan basis exerted far too much influence over government decision-making, we’ve never seen anything like the Trump administration. The key officials in the federal government, starting with the president himself, come from Big Business; the administration openly seeks guidance and direction from giant corporations and corporate CEOs on policymaking; and the Trump administration is rushing to deliver subsidies, tax breaks and deregulatory gifts to the giant corporations to which the administration apparently owes its primary allegiance. A day-by-day review of the administration’s first 100 days in office shows that virtually every day there has been a new, extraordinary grant of power to corporate interests and/or another development in Donald Trump’s get-rich-quick-scheme known as the American presidency. America has never seen anything like this. The corporate capture began at the same moment as the Trump presidency. Corporations that have pending business before the president — AT&T, Bank of America, Boeing, Chevron, Deloitte, JPMorgan Chase and United Parcel Service – were among the top funders of the inauguration and surrounding festivities. Giant companies and billionaires heaped more than $100 million on the festivities. New President Trump immediately signaled his intent to deliver on the corporate wish list by signing two executive orders, one designed to start the process of destroying the Affordable Care Act and another freezing all regulatory activity for 90 days. It’s been downhill since then. President Trump has assembled what is probably the least qualified and certainly most corporate cabinet of all time. By way of reminder, this list includes: the former CEO of Exxon Mobil (Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State); a slew of former Goldman Sachs executives, so much so that the factions fighting for control of the administration each hail from Goldman Sachs (chief strategist Steve Bannon and top economic advisor Gary Cohn); a banker known as the Foreclosure King to run the Department of Treasury (Steven Mnuchin), an Amway heiress and Republican megadonor (Betsy DeVos); and a former state attorney general who allowed the fossil fuel industry to draft letters on attorney general letterhead on multiple occasions (Scott Pruitt, Environmental Protection Agency). Having a corporate cabinet has apparently not satisfied Trump’s yen to hang out with the corporate elite. Trump started his first full weekday in office with a breakfast meeting with CEOs of a dozen corporations, and the meetings continue at a staggering pace. Trump is meeting with more than two CEOS every day, on average. These extraordinary gatherings, which have the explicit purpose of providing a way for Big Business to shape the administration’s policies, are supplemented by the president’s more casual interactions with corporate leaders at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., where the membership fee is now $200,000. Many of the gatherings reflect the administration’s interest in giving special consideration to the views of specific corporate sectors, such as airlines, health insurance corporations, pharmaceutical corporations, and the automotive industry. One of every five of the corporate executives who met with the Trump administration within the first 100 days represented the banking or financial sector. It’s not just meetings and personnel. The Trump administration is off to a roaring start on delivering the goodies to Big Business. It has taken care of its Dirty Energy friends. By executive order, Trump overturned Obama measures to block the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines. A few days later, the Army Corps of Engineers granted Energy Transfer Partners the final permit it needs to complete the Dakota Access Pipeline. It has also put in place measures to speed approval of other pipelines and fossil fuel projects, and is expected in the coming days to announce measures to upend the Environmental Protection Agency. In March, Trump announced a review – plainly aimed to be a roll back – of auto fuel efficiency standards. Just a few years ago, a U.S. government bailout saved the Big Three automakers from utter collapse. The modest reciprocity the government demanded was industry agreement to higher fuel efficiency standards – its most important move to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. Now the auto industry and the Trump administration are colluding to abrogate the deal. Consumers will be swindled in the process; the fuel economy rules that Trump is reversing were projected to save Americans up to $5,700 for every car they purchase, and $8,200 for every truck. Trump has issued an executive order aimed at undoing President Obama’s Clean Power Plan – his signature effort to reduce climate pollution from coal powered plants; the administration is debating pulling the United States out of the Paris climate agreement; and administration officials have banned the use of the term “climate change.” EPA Chief Scott Pruitt and his minions are delivering a host of other gifts to polluters, such as inaugural $1 million donor Dow, notably including a refusal to ban a brain-damaging pesticide. The administration is taking care of its Wall Street friends (meaning those who remain outside the administration). Trump has signed executive orders aimed at unraveling the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law (“We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank,” the president told JPMorgan Chase’s CEO Jamie Dimon and other CEOs in January) and repealing an Obama administration Labor Department rule requiring financial advisors to give advice based on their customers’ best interests. The Labor Department rule, if adopted, will save consumers $17 billion a year in rip-off fees and bad advice. Contemplated changes in Dodd-Frank rules, the Wall Street Journal reports, will enable the six biggest banks to return $100 billion of reserves to shareholders. A staggering gift to the shareholders – at the cost of making the financial system far, far more unstable, insecure and prone to another 2008-style meltdown. Although its prospects are dim, Trump proposed a cruel, sadistic and military-industrial-complex-fawning budget, featuring $54 billion in increased spending on weapons and war, with gouging cuts to spending on everything from environmental protection to Meals on Wheels. Trump strongly backed the American Health Care Act (Obamacare repeal), and is now angling for it to be revived with slight modifications – which would make it still worse. To pay for a $350 billion tax cut for the super rich and large corporations, the bill would deny health care coverage to 24 million people by 2026. In addition to mass financial hardship, that denial of coverage would have meant that every year millions would suffer needlessly from treatable ailments and tens of thousands would die from preventable illness. Cutting off Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood would have denied provision of care to millions of low-income women. And the bill’s financing structure would have weakened Medicare’s finances, imperiling still more Americans. Happily, bombast aside, odds appear slim of successfully bringing this proposal back from the dead. Perhaps most consequentially, the administration has commenced its full-fledged assault on health, safety, environmental, worker, consumer, financial security, civil rights and other regulatory protections. Deregulatory measures may well be Trump’s signature achievement – both of the first 100 days and the entire presidency. What does it mean to deregulate? It means lifting restraints on corporate misconduct, and signaling to big companies that in pursuit of profit they are free to rip off, price gouge, poison and endanger Americans and our planet. In February, Trump signed a deregulatory executive order that directs federal agencies to repeal two federal regulations for every new rule they issue, and requires that any cost to industry of new rules be offset by savings from repealed rules. In this crazy scheme, regulators are not permitted to consider the benefits of rules. No one thinking sensibly about how to set rules for health, safety, the environment and the economy would ever adopt this approach – unless their only goal was to confer enormous benefits on Big Business. That is indeed the goal here. (With the Natural Resources Defense Council and Communication Workers of America, Public Citizen has sued President Trump and the administration to have this executive order overturned.) Trump has eagerly signed into law a series of deregulatory measures to undo Obama administration achievements, using an obscure legislative vehicle known as the Congressional Review Act. Industries that have collectively spent more than $1 billion on lobbying and campaign contributions have seen their investments pay off many times over. Trump has gleefully signed measures making it easier for coal companies to pollute streams and rivers; authorizing Big Oil to hide payments to developing country governments; erasing obligations for government contractors to ensure the safety and health of their employees; and making it possible for cable and Internet providers to collect and sell our most personal information. It’s hard to imagine there’s anyone in the United States, not connected to Comcast, Verizon or another telecom company, who favors giving the telecoms the right to traffic in our personal data. Leaving aside confirmations, these Congressional Review Act regulatory repeals are, by far, the most significant legislative action during Trump’s term. The corporate cronies heading or nominated to lead key regulatory agencies guarantee that deregulation will be a consistent and overriding theme of the administration. Trump’s pick for Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton, if confirmed will assume office with unprecedented conflicts and zero demonstrated commitment to protecting investors. Scott Gottlieb, the nominee for Food and Drug Administration commissioner, has deep ties to the pharmaceutical industry and aims to roll back drug and device safety standards. President Trump and his new Federal Communication Commission Chair Ajit Pai are intent on repealing the agency’s Net Neutrality rule, which is designed to protect a free and open Internet by preventing broadband providers from favoring their own or discriminating against others’ content. The rule protects consumers from excessive tolls that could significantly impact their pocketbook, a diminished Internet that would degrade their user experience and, most importantly, from broadband provider censorship or undue influence over what they can see and access. Meanwhile, Trump’s top regulatory advisor, the financial mogul Carl Icahn, is leveraging his role to push for very specific regulatory changes that would advantage his companies. The value of his oil refining companies has jumped by more than half a billion dollars in anticipation that Trump will deliver a revision to ethanol rules that Icahn is seeking. Icahn’s conflicts are jaw-dropping, but it all comes from the top. President Trump has resisted calls to divest himself of his business empire, giving him unprecedented conflicts of interest and ensuring that this administration will go down as the most corrupt in history. Foreign policy conflicts are already manifest: Does Trump congratulate Turkish President Erdogan on his consolidation of authoritarian power because of Trump’s business interests in Turkey? Does Rex Tillerson’s refusal to condemn human rights violations in the Philippines follow from Trump’s real estate ventures in that country? What’s the correlation between warming relations with China and China’s approval of trademark requests from Trump and Ivanka Trump? So too are domestic priorities distorted: Trump has ordered a repeal of an important Clean Water Rule opposed by golf courses. Policies at the Labor Department and National Labor Relations Board will directly impact his companies. The Chamber of Commerce is clamoring for legislation to destroy class actions – the kind of lawsuits filed by the ripped off students at “Trump University.” And, as we look forward past the first hundred days, the dominant legislative debate will focus on tax policy. Donald Trump is an admitted exploiter of tax loopholes; and although he refused to make his tax returns public, he has bragged that he pays the lowest rate possible. What are the chances that he is going to support tax reform measures that would hurt his personal business empire? What are the chances this administration’s conflicts will be resolved? What are the chances that policy making will be advanced in the interest of Americans rather than giant corporations? None, none and none – unless We the People mobilize in sufficient numbers to force a change.

Find out the most important investor takeaways from this year’s Q1 earnings reports. John Maxfield and Gaby Lapera (JohnMaxfield37) Apr 25, 2017 at 7:31AM Three of the nation's biggest banks kicked off first-quarter earnings season last week. The results were generally positive, with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) both reporting double-digit bottom-line increases compared to the year-ago quarter. The exception was Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), which uncharacteristically reported a year-over-year decline in its quarterly profit. Listen in to this week's episode of Industry Focus: Financials, where The Motley Fool's Gaby Lapera and John Maxfield dig into the details behind these performances. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on April 17, 2017. Gaby Lapera: Hello, everyone! Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. You're listening to the Financials edition, taped today on Monday, April 17, 2017. My name is Gaby Lapera, and joining me on Skype is John Maxfield, our banking expert extraordinaire. How's it going, John? John Maxfield: [laughs] I love that introduction, but I think it's probably over billing me. But it's going great, thank you! Lapera: I'm really glad to hear that. Listeners, I'm really sorry, you might hear me take some extra big deep breaths during this podcast. I had some kind of adverse reaction to a medication, and I think it gave me a touch of asthma. So, sorry in advance about that. Today, we're going to be talking about what else but first-quarter banking results. Aren't you excited? I know I am! How about you, Maxfield? Maxfield: Snoozer. [laughs] No, that's not true. We're going to talk about some interesting things. So even though, in general, it could be a conversation that could be really boring, I think there's some interesting stuff that listeners will pick up from this. Lapera: Oh, no, we bring the pizzazz. Maxfield: [laughs] You bring the pizzazz, I bring the boring. You're here, Gaby. Lapera: [laughs] So far, JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells have all reported. Bottom lines for JPMorgan and Citi look good. Maxfield: Yeah, both of them were up 17% on a year-over-year basis. When you're talking the biggest banks in the country, and among the biggest banks in the world, it's not often that you're going to see earnings grow by double-digit percentages on a year-over-year basis. Lapera: Yeah, that's pretty exciting. We were talking a little bit before the show, and it looks like it's mostly driven through their trading and investment banking. All these big banks, well, Wells kind of, but JPMorgan and Citi especially are universal banks. That means they have two separate arms. They have their retail arm, where they're doing what you traditionally think of as a bank's business, like giving out loans and collecting interest and doing whatever it is that big banks do. The other side of it is this investment-banking side. That's where they saw the big gains this quarter. Maxfield: Yeah. If you think about where we were at this point last year -- and I want to say, I'm going to be totally selfish here, but there's a part of me that wishes we were where we were at this point last year, because that's where, as an investor, we had gone through a huge correction in the market, and as an investor, that's the absolute best time to be in. Right now, everything looks so expensive, so I'm thinking back so fondly on those days. But if you think back to the first quarter of last year, which is what the banks were comping against in the first quarter of this year, there were two things in particular that really helped those comps shine. The first is that oil prices dipped below $30 a barrel. They got down to around $25 a barrel. And that is really, really low. The problem with that for banks -- even though it's great for consumers -- is that if you lend money to energy companies and the price of oil goes down that far, some of those companies that are operating with really tightened margins aren't going to be able to service their loans. So that made banks increase their loan-loss provisions in anticipation of future loan losses from the energy industry. Oil prices have since been on the mend. So they didn't have that concern this year, so they were able to scale down their provisions. Provisions act on income in the same way that expenses do. So it just freed up a whole bunch of revenue to fall to the bottom line.  The second point, to the point that you're making, Gaby, is that there is also in that first quarter is when the United Kingdom announced that it was going to have a referendum on whether or not it would stay in the European Union. Now, that actual vote didn't happen until later in the year, but that announcement, in addition to concerns about slowing economic growth in China, caused an enormous amount of volatility in the various types of capital markets, and that translated into lower trading revenues for banks. What banks are is, they help institutional investors buy and sell securities, but when everything's going crazy in the market, those institutional investors step back, which reduces the commission that large, universal banks make from them. Lapera: Yeah, everyone was kind of in a tizzy at the end of the first quarter of last year. I remember that. I was looking at the show notes from last year around this time, and I was like, "Oh, yeah, I remember." We actually got a listener question about what was going on and we answered it and everything. Times were different then, a whole year ago. But the point that you're making, Maxfield, I think, is that the hurdle, the bar, is low for these banks to succeed year over year, in terms of 2016's first quarter versus 2017's first quarter, right? Maxfield: That's exactly right. Now, I don't want to be unfair, because JPMorgan Chase, even though, there was an easy comparison in terms of the comps this year compared to last year, it still had a really good quarter. Even in this really difficult and inhospitable environment for banks, it's earning a double-digit return on equity. So let's be fair; it had a good quarter. But it wasn't as amazing as it looks, based on those comps. Lapera: Yeah, totally fair. So, even though JPMorgan and Citi did generally well, Citi's net interest margin went down. Can you talk a little bit about that? Maxfield: Yeah, and I'm really glad you brought that up. One of the narratives in the banking industry right now is that banks are going to earn a lot more money as interest rates continue to go up. Since the financial crisis, interest rates have been really low. But in December of 2015, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 25 basis points. They did so again in December of last year and did so again one more time in March of this year. When interest rates go up, that means it costs more to borrow. And because the principal product that commercial banks in particular sell are loans, if the prices of those loans go up, that translates into higher revenue. What we're seeing with Citigroup, and we're going to see a lot of that with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) when it reports earnings tomorrow and throughout the year, because it's come out and said, "Look, on a quarterly basis, just because of that 25 basis points," that's a 0.25% increase in the Fed funds rate, which is the rate that banks lend money, the reserves that are held at the Federal Reserve, if they have excess reserves held there, they lend those reserves out on an overnight basis to other banks that need more liquidity. So as that has gone up, Bank of America is going to make all this additional money. But here's the thing. In Citigroup's case, and JPMorgan Chase is seeing the same thing, and other banks are expected to see that, too, but Citigroup didn't see that, and the reason is because it is still dealing with a lot of churn on its balance sheet related to toxic assets that date back to the financial crisis. So there's all this other noise in the numbers that is disguising the positive impact of higher interest rates on Citigroup's bottom line. Lapera: Yeah. I will say, it's 2017, it's been a while. You would think they would have sorted through this a little bit quicker, and I think that speaks to the complex structure that Citibank has, that it's so difficult for them to unload these assets, with the regulations on them. But hopefully we see a little bit more hustle on that. Maxfield: It also speaks to the magnitude of the issues that Citi ran into in the financial crisis. It has taken a long time to work through these things. The other bank that had a similar thing was Bank of America, and it really didn't turn the corner until two years ago. So Citigroup is just a little behind it, but it eventually will turn the corner, and you'll see that in the bottom-line numbers. Lapera: Yeah, eventually, one day, hopefully. [laughs] The other bank I wanted to talk about is what used to be America's sweetheart of a bank, which is Wells Fargo. They're probably going to be the only big bank to see its earnings decline on a year-over-year basis. Do you think that's related to the account scandal? Maxfield: I think that it is. Michael Douglass, who is an editor at The Motley Fool, he describes Wells Fargo as "the fallen angel," and I think that's the perfect way to describe it. If you go back 150 years, Wells Fargo has one of the best reputations, and one of the best brands in the bank industry in the United States for a long, long time -- back since the Gold Rush in the late 1840s and 1850s, when it was established. But because of that fake-account scandal that was revealed last September -- thousands of Wells Fargo employees, in an effort to meet sales quotas, in terms of selling additional credit cards, selling additional checking accounts, selling additional savings accounts, they opened up fake accounts for customers that customers either didn't need, didn't approve of, or didn't even know were being opened. So that has really tarnished Wells Fargo's reputation. And if you look at Wells Fargo's numbers from the most recent quarter, it isn't strikingly obvious. It isn't like the revenue fell by 10% as a result of this, or their expenses went up by 20%. It's a much more marginal impact. But what we're seeing is a continued erosion in a number of key metrics at Wells Fargo. The efficiency ratio is a perfect example. It has long been one of the most efficient banks in the country. But because of potential revenue pressure as a result of what happened, the reputational damage it suffered, and that sales scandal last year, combined with the potential that they're going to have to increase their compliance costs, their regulatory costs to deal with that, it's slowly eroding its bottom line at this point. Lapera: Yeah. And that's something you're just going to have to look out for long-term. The thing with Wells Fargo is that basically all things have been held equal except for the reputational damage that we mentioned from the account scandal. As a result of the account scandal, they changed some of their internal practices for selling, as one might expect, to encourage their employees to stop creating these fraudulent accounts, which means that some of their numbers don't look as good anymore for account openings. Because there's fewer fraudulent accounts. So when you throw all that into the mix, we'll see whether or not Wells Fargo pulls out of it. It's not quite a nosedive yet, but it's definitely something to keep your eye on. Maxfield: To that point, Gaby, if you listen to Wells Fargo's executives prior to the crisis, for years, they stressed the cross-sell ratio. That is the number of financial products -- so, checking accounts, credit cards, mortgages, all those types of financial products and services -- the number of those that the average customer at Wells Fargo used. And they always trended 2 times, 3 times the industry average in terms of the number of products that each of their customers used. Then, if you listened to the way their executives talk about getting those large cross-sell numbers, what they would do is go after primary checking accounts for a customer, which is the principal banking product, and then build on top of that -- and now, we're seeing new checking account numbers falling on a year-over-year basis by 30%, 40%, new credit card applications at Wells Fargo falling by 40%-plus on a year over year basis -- in the short term, that's not going to have a big impact on their numbers. Because it's not like a bank makes a whole bunch of money when a credit card application is submitted, or any money, quite frankly, or when a new checking account is opened. But it's that deepening of the relationship where the profitability comes from. So the question is, when they announced that they were getting rid of their sales quotas in their branches as a result of the scandal, what is that going to look like over the long term for Wells Fargo, given that its model has been predicated on cross-selling for all of these years? Lapera: Yeah, definitely. It's an interesting story, and one that we will definitely continue to cover on Industry Focus. One bank that you might notice is missing is Bank of America. That's because they don't report until tomorrow. Overall, I'm kind of expecting to see the same thing going on with Bank of America as you saw with JPMorgan. In fact, they might even do better, because their profitability is so tied to interest rates. And you've talked about before, a little bit of an increase in interest rates means $X billion more of Bank of America. Maxfield: Yeah. I think that Bank of America is in a stretch right now, where every quarter you're just going to see tangible improvements, and tangible improvements, and tangible improvements. I'm very optimistic, if it wasn't clear, about Bank of America. The one thing I would say, however, that investors should be thinking about with Bank of America and other banks right now, is not so much about their fundamental performance. We were talking about this before the show, Gaby, I don't think that's what's driving their stocks right now. I think what's driving their stocks right now is expectations around policy. When you're listening to the fact that Bank of America is going to have this great fundamental quarter, they seem to be primed for this great fundamental quarter, I would not interpret that, as an investor, to mean that its stock is necessarily going to shoot up after it announces results tomorrow. Lapera: Yeah, and I definitely want to get into that thing that you alluded to about fundamentals versus policy. We covered that the first quarter of last year was pretty terrible for banks, so the year-over-year growth looks phenomenal. But there's some other stuff going on with bank stocks. If you've been following the banking sector for at least the last four or five months, you might have noticed that there was something that is now affectionately called the Trump bump, which was right after the election, bank stocks took off. And that's not a coincidence, because one of the things that Trump talked about on the campaign trail over and over again was deregulation and allowing more freedom for the banks. And people drove bank stocks up on the assumption that this regulation was, especially Dodd-Frank, that's really what we're talking about when we say regulation, that that was going to be repealed or changed in such a way that banks would have more freedom, and they were going to be able to drive up their profits. Maxfield: Yeah. So, what we saw in the election is, bank stocks went up 20%-30% almost immediately. The election happened in November, earnings didn't come out until the middle or beginning of October, and then the Federal Reserve raised rates in December, and then earnings for the fourth quarter didn't come out until January. So there were no fundamental catalysts -- and when I say fundamental catalysts, I mean there was nothing company-specific. It's not like a company came out and said, "We quadrupled our earnings on a year-over-year basis," and everybody thought, "Oh, all banks are going to quadruple their earnings on a year-over-year basis." It was that you had this expectation fueled rally in bank stocks around this idea that if Donald Trump's team at the White House is able to get through easing of the regulations in the banking industry, that that is going to cause profits to go way up. It's hard to see right now how profits at these banks that are earning more money than they've ever end before. Even Bank of America -- which has dug itself out of the financial crisis but is still deep in the throes of seeing its profitability recover -- even it has shot way up. So the question is, what does that mean for investors? And what it means to me is that you have to be really careful in this zone right now, because I don't think we can expect a 25% boost in profit at these big banks that are earning so much money. And JPMorgan Chase is earning more than it's ever earned on a quarterly basis. It's just hard to understand how, even if there are significant deregulatory moves made in this area, that it's going to have such a huge impact on profits. Lapera: Yeah. So basically, the stock-price increase is a gamble by investors thinking that these banks will make way more money than they're already making. And as you pointed out, Maxfield, the banks are already making quite a bit of money. So I'm not 100% sure how they would make even more money just like that as soon as deregulation happens. The other thing to think about is, I think there's a post-election high where everyone was like, "Yeah, he's going to get in there, the first 100 days he's going to get a lot pushed through," and the reality is, in Washington D.C., nothing happens quickly. And that's for a reason; that's a protective thing that D.C. has. I know people hate to hear that, but it's good that people can't make rash decisions and changes to legislation, whether or not they're good. This way, it gives everyone a lot of time to consider what the ramifications of any given legislation will be. But that also means that legislation takes a really long time to push through. And banking regulation, as dry and complex as it is, is probably going to take even longer than other types of regulation. Maxfield: And we saw, with the challenges, trying to get that initial healthcare bill through, that just because there's unity between the branches, Republican-controlled White House, House, and Senate, there are still factions in there that are going to make the legislative agenda difficult to get through. Here is where it gets really dicey for investors. Because bank stocks are up on an expectations-infused rally, it means that investors are thinking and making decisions in the political context. One of the things we know, when a person makes decisions in the political context, is that it is extremely difficult, regardless of which side of the aisle you're on, to make objective, fact-based decisions. In fact, there's this great book, Mistakes Were Made (but Not by Me), that digs into a particular type of behavioral bias known as cognitive dissonance. One of the things that they talk about in that book is, there was a study done where people, Democrats and Republicans, were put into MRIs, and then confronted with information that was either consistent or inconsistent with their political beliefs. And what they saw was, when information that was consistent with your political belief was introduced and you started thinking about it, the area of your brain that is responsible for making deep, analytical insights started firing. But what happened was, if information that you disagreed with politically was introduced, that same area of the brain, they saw, actually shut down. So, what that means is, the way our brain works, when there is information in the political context that we agree with, we incorporate that into our analysis, but the information that we disagree with, we do not incorporate that into our analysis. And in the investing world, which is really unforgiving because you're talking about numbers and money, you need both sides of the story to have a balanced approach. Lapera: Yeah. And I think I actually see where you're going with this. There was a story out of Wisconsin. I will quote to you part of it. "When GOP voters in Wisconsin were asked last October whether the economy had gotten better or worse over the past year, they said worse, by a margin of 28 points. But when they were asked the very same question last month," in March, "they said better, by a margin of 54 points." That's a net swing of 82% between late October 2016 and mid-March 2017. That's crazy, because there's no way the economy has changed that much between October and March. So it really just comes down to people's perceptions of how the economy is doing. And even more than that, when you ask Democrats that same question, it was basically flipped. Democrats were saying, "We think the economy is way worse; we think a recession is imminent." So this is something that I don't know it's ever been seen before, but we're really letting political activity cloud how we're viewing the economy, which fundamentally can alter how you view investing decisions. Maxfield: Right, and the Michigan consumer-confidence survey, which is an even broader survey than the Wisconsin survey, it confirmed the same thing. It found a stark partisan divide between how Democrats view the economy and how Republicans view the economy. In fact, I can't remember if it was January or February when it was the largest partisan divide that survey had ever seen, but I think it narrowed a bit in a more recent month, but it's still relatively wide. To your point, what they have seen is, since Donald Trump has taken office, optimism among Republicans has shot way, way up, but among Democrats it has shot way down. So Democrats are expecting, generally, an imminent recession. The data shows they're expecting a recession. The Republicans are expecting a robust recovery. This just goes to the point. I think there's two points here. First, consumer-confidence data is more complicated than the headline number. Second, this goes to the point that when you're in the political realm, even when you're making decisions about things that are non-political, i.e., the economy or investing, politics still creeps in and short-circuits a rational, objective, fact based thought process. Lapera: Yeah. I mean, honestly, the truth is probably somewhere in between, because that's generally how it goes with these things. But I think the message we're trying to deliver to you, dear listeners, is that you should do your best to make decisions about companies based on the company's fundamentals. Ignore the outside noise. Don't let it creep in. Focus on what you think is good for a company. Don't make bets on what you think other people are going to do. That's how you evaluate a company. That's how you become a long-term thinker and a long-term investor. Maxfield: And even more generally, Gaby, we know how difficult it is to make accurate forecasts. So when you're investing, being a really good investor isn't necessarily being the one who's able to forecast into the future the most accurately, although that would certainly help. [laughs] It would help, but it's almost pointless to try, because it's a crap shoot, almost, trying to forecast into the future. So, what you see with really good investors, and I think this is what you're saying, is they focus on two things. Look at the quality of the company itself, and whether it has competitive advantages, whether its profitability is on the rise, whether it's run in an efficient manner, and try and look at and compare that to where the valuations are at any given time. And then, focus your analysis around those things, and do your very best to cut out any extraneous noise that could potentially mess up your results. Lapera: Yes, I 100% agree with you. On that note, I think we're actually done. I think we've run a little bit over. I think we might be boring Austin a little bit. Sorry, Austin!

GET REAL -- The White House yesterday sent out the message that they planned to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent -- fulfilling a campaign-season promise. Is this an opening negotiating position or what Trump wants to achieve? We don’t know, because we haven’t seen him in a successful legislative negotiation yet. BUT PRIVATELY, CAPITOL HILL REPUBLICANS ARE SEETHING. Why? Because a 15 percent corporate rate is practically impossible to achieve without blowing a hole in the budget. The president might be willing to balloon the national deficit, but Hill Republicans -- which have made debts and deficits their central issue over the last decade -- are not. To make a cut like that permanent, Republicans would need Democratic votes in the Senate, because it would run afoul of reconciliation rules. Speaker Paul Ryan and House Republicans raise $1 trillion in new cash with the border-adjustment tax, and they can only get the corporate rate down to 20 percent. Trump is signaling he has no interest in the so-called BAT. -- WSJ’S RICHARD RUBIN: “Five Roadblocks in the Way of the White House’s Proposed Corporate Tax Cut”: “Deficits … Passthroughs … Reconciliation … Tradeoffs … Corporate Splits.” http://on.wsj.com/2p07O8y **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh SPOTTED -- THE DINNER OF THE NIGHT -- Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chief deputy whip and a critical player on practically any bill that comes to the House floor, dining with White House National Economic Adviser Gary Cohn at Le Diplomate on 14th Street. … MEETING TODAY -- Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. … TRUMP SOFTENS TONE ON BORDER WALL: The idea that the Trump administration could get funding for a border wall is fantastical, as Democrats can stop it cold in the Senate. Why did the White House take a firm position on it, only to abandon it last night? (See: Dawsey, Josh http://politi.co/2pdnhRd). When Congress passes the government funding bill in the next few days, the narrative will be that Trump was unable to secure money for the border wall, and in typical Washington fashion, has pushed off the fight to September. Sure, the administration could get a win here, if they let themselves. If they beef up border security or step up surveillance on the border they can sell that as a “down payment" on a stronger border, as Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) has been putting it. RACHAEL BADE and JOHN BRESNAHAN: “Ryan on the hot seat to deliver for Trump”: “‘He has a really tough job, and I think he’s managing it well,’ an administration official added. ‘We all look back and see things we could have done better, but he’s got a very diverse conference that has a lot of different views.’” http://politi.co/2pgoWYv -- ABOUT THAT PROGRESS ON HEALTH CARE: Remember when House Republicans wanted to show progress on health care before heading home a few weeks ago? They went to the House Rules Committee and started the process of passing a bill implementing risk-sharing pools. We hear that effort will be dropped and that House Republicans could kill the rule as soon as today. TRUMP’S FIRST 100 DAYS -- The White House is launching a website to commemorate the milestone. The site has three categories of accomplishments: “Building American Prosperity,” “Keeping Americans Safe & Strengthening Security Abroad,” and “Making Government Accountable to the People.” The president has called the 100-day construct a “ridiculous standard.” http://bit.ly/2p08J9f -- AP: “Trump’s 100-days promises: Fewer than half carried out,” by Jill Colvin and Calvin Woodward. http://apne.ws/2oGPlv9 ABOUT THOSE 100 DAYS -- THE RESISTANCE: “Trump has enabled the Democratic Party to overlook its serious problems,” by Gabe Debenedetti: “By most traditional measures, the Democratic Party hit rock bottom at the outset of Donald Trump’s presidency. The Democratic National Committee was leaderless and in shambles. Congress and the White House were under Republican control, as were about two-thirds of the statehouses. Perhaps the most popular national figure associated with the party, Sen. Bernie Sanders, refused to even call himself a Democrat. “Yet Trump’s first 100 days in office appear to have resuscitated the party, if for no reason other than the rank-and-file loathe him so deeply and furiously. Grassroots activism and organizing is surging. Irate Democrats are flooding GOP town halls even in conservative states like Idaho and South Carolina. Small-dollar fundraising is also on fire — six of the 10 Senate Democrats up for re-election in states Trump won collected over $2 million in the first three months of the year. For some of them, that represented more than had ever been raised in their state this early in the election cycle. But while the president has generated a vibrant culture of resistance on the left, it’s obscuring the depth of the hole that the Democratic Party still finds itself in.” http://politi.co/2pvfXn9 FOR YOUR RADAR -- “Seoul: North Korea holds drill to mark military anniversary,” by AP’s Eric Talmadge and Kim Tong-Hyung in Pyongyang, North Korea: “South Korea's military said Tuesday that North Korea held major live-fire drills in an area around its eastern coastal town of Wonsan as it marked the anniversary of the founding of its military. The exercise took place as a U.S. guided-missile submarine arrived in South Korea and envoys from the United States, Japan and South Korea met in Tokyo to discuss the growing threat posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons and missiles program. Though experts thought a nuclear test or ballistic missile launch might happen, the morning came and went without either.” http://apne.ws/2q9DqGO -- “As North Korea Speeds Its Nuclear Program, U.S. Fears Time Will Run Out,” by NYT’s David Sanger and William Broad: http://nyti.ms/2q1pUs5 ****** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: “Creating greater economic opportunity must be a responsibility and imperative for all of us,” writes Peter Scher, head of Corporate Responsibility at JPMorgan Chase. What are the key inputs for creating lasting impact in our communities? Learn more about driving inclusive economic growth in the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Responsibility Report http://politi.co/2ouiWI5 ****** ANNIE KARNI in BERLIN -- “Ivanka Trump faces skeptical audience in Berlin”: “‘What does a daughter with no political experience have to do in the White House?’ said Andrea Seibel, an opinion editor at Die Welt, the influential conservative-leaning Berlin daily, where editors huddling in the newsroom Monday afternoon planned to give front-page coverage to the visit. ‘We have family clan experiences in autocracies,’ Seibel said. ‘Ivanka Trump isn’t elected, she is a daughter. She didn’t say anything in the elections when he was saying nasty things about women and migrants. She is his voice, but somehow she has a nicer face.’ “The coverage of Ivanka Trump in the German media in the days leading up to her speech was similar to that at home, where she has been criticized on late night programs like ‘Saturday Night Live’ for being ‘complicit’ in her father’s agenda.” http://politi.co/2q0RoOJ -- VIDEO of Ivanka arriving in Berlin. http://bit.ly/2pgqBgD -- IVANKA FT OP-ED with World Bank president JIM YONG KIM, “Investment in women unleashes global gains: Female economic empowerment brings dividends for families, businesses and nations”: “We know what works. We need to increase access to finance, redistribute care work, accelerate progress to financial inclusion, and offer programmes that train female entrepreneurs and help them to access higher value markets. We need to develop new legal and regulatory frameworks to boost women’s growth and productivity. The right skills training enhances women’s capacity to better manage their businesses. And mentorship opportunities and access to networks bring learning opportunities and connections to capital and markets.” http://on.ft.com/2q17nML LUMBER WARS -- “In New Trade Front, Trump Slaps Tariff on Canadian Lumber,” by NYT’s Peter Baker in D.C. and Ian Austen in Ottawa: “The Commerce Department determined that Canada had been improperly subsidizing the sale of softwood lumber products to the United States, and after failed negotiations, Washington decided to retaliate with tariffs of 3 percent to 24 percent. The penalties will be collected retroactively on imports dating back 90 days … “The United States and Canada have been at odds over softwood lumber in one form or another since the 19th century, with the current dispute tracing back to 1982. The United States imported $5.7 billion in softwood lumber last year alone, mainly for residential home building. At the conflict’s heart is a fundamental difference in forestry ownership. In the United States, forest lands are largely held by lumber companies. In Canada, they tend to be owned by the government, and American mills contend that Canadian provinces subsidize their industries by charging low royalty rates for cutting trees. A temporary truce under President George W. Bush, which effectively limited Canadian exports to the United States, expired in 2015.” http://nyti.ms/2pgi6lC -- TORONTO STAR: “The move was expected: the historic dispute over lumber pricing has led to once-a-decade trade skirmishes over the issue, resulting in American duties, then the inevitable court battles, and ultimately negotiated settlements. What wasn’t expected Monday was the enthusiasm with which the new American administration flung itself into the lumber hostilities, touting its incoming countervailing duties as an example of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tough, America-first trade posture.” http://bit.ly/2pdfNxx TRUMP INC. -- “Flynn’s Turkish lobbying linked to Russia,” by Isaac Arnsdorf: “The Turkish man who gave Michael Flynn a $600,000 lobbying deal just before President Donald Trump picked him to be national security adviser has business ties to Russia, including a 2009 aviation financing deal negotiated with Vladimir Putin, according to court records. The man, Ekim Alptekin, has in recent years helped to coordinate Turkish lobbying in Washington with Dmitri ‘David’ Zaikin, a Soviet-born former executive in Russian energy and mining companies who also has had dealings with Putin’s government, according to three people with direct knowledge of the activities. “This unusual arrangement, in which Alptekin and Zaikin have helped steer Turkish lobbying through various groups since at least 2015, raises questions about both the agenda of the two men and the source of the funds used to pay the lobbyists. Although Turkey is a NATO ally, its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has grown increasingly authoritarian and friendly with Putin. And the hiring of Flynn by Alptekin came at a time when Flynn was working for Trump’s campaign and Putin’s government was under investigation for interfering with the U.S. election.” http://politi.co/2oHnb38 POLITICO NAMES A NEW CEO -- Robert Allbritton and John Harris email the POLITICO world staff: “POLITICO’s next CEO is Patrick Steel, who is leaving a successful 16-year career at the investment bank of FBR & Co. to join us on May 8. Patrick is right for POLITICO for these primary reasons ... [H]is experience and expertise for the past 16 years has been in helping recognize companies that are poised for dramatic growth both domestically and overseas, and helping their management teams organize to achieve their potential.” WSJ story on the hire http://on.wsj.com/2orts74 THE JUICE … -- FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: UBS INVESTOR WATCH is out with its quarterly report this time focused on the first 100 days of the Trump administration. The findings: 61 percent of investors are optimistic about the economic outlook, up from 42 percent last summer. Three-in-four business owners are optimistic about their business outlook for the next four months. And while health care continues to be the top concern for investors, 90 percent believe government should spend more time coming up with a better solution. The survey polled more than 2,200 people who have at least $1 million in investable assets from March 28 through April 3. More results http://bit.ly/2oFSzy9 -- JONES DAY, the Trump campaign’s law firm, is running an online ad touting its “Insights on the New Administration,” listing issues it has expertise on like “energy & environment,” “financial regulation,” “government contracts,” and “health care / ACA”. One of the ads, which has a picture of the White House, was a prominent ad on NPR’s home page on Saturday. The ad links to a page (http://bit.ly/2q3yfbo) that has 14 publications analyzing the Trump administration’s policies. The law firm, whose former partner Don McGahn became White House counsel, was paid $3.3 million in legal fees by the campaign through the end of last month. At least three Jones Day lawyers joined McGahn in the White House. The firm, which does not lobby in Washington, did not respond to requests for comment on the ad campaign.

She’s been doing sports investigations since 2015 and was a business reporter prior to that.” -- RANDOLPH ALLES is expected to be named the new Secret Service director.

TAMMY DUCKWORTH is scheduled to deliver her first speech on the Senate floor at 2:30 p.m. The Illinois Democrat will “call for a return to the shared values of equality, opportunity, and inclusiveness that have helped make our country the strongest in the world.” http://bit.ly/2pZIfmQ TRUMP’S TUESDAY -- The president will be on Capitol Hill for a Holocaust remembrance ceremony. He’ll meet with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Playbook Reads PHOTO DU JOUR: Former President Barack Obama speaks at a forum with young leaders to discuss community organizing at the University of Chicago on April 24. | Jim Young/AFP/Getty SCHEDULE SHIFT -- “Trump dinner with Supreme Court justices postponed,” by Josh Gerstein: “President Donald Trump has postponed plans to host a dinner this week for the justices of the just-back-to-full-strength Supreme Court, White House officials said Monday. A week-ahead schedule distributed to reporters on Sunday said Trump would attend a dinner Thursday evening with the justices, ‘including his successfully confirmed nominee Justice Neil Gorsuch.’ However, a later version of the outlook dropped the Supreme Court event. A Trump aide said Monday that the dinner was put off due to scheduling issues during this busy week where officials are going all-out to mark the president’s accomplishments in his first 100 days in office.” http://politi.co/2q9Ju1J BEYOND THE BELTWAY -- “A reelection challenge (almost) as big as Texas,” by WaPo’s Karen Tumulty in Tornillo, Texas: “Midterm elections are known to be brutal on the party in power, and if there is an anti-Republican wave in 2018, look for it to touch shore right here. The vast, volatile 23rd Congressional District of Texas is bigger in area than 29 states. It stretches from San Antonio to El Paso and includes about one-third of the entire U.S.-Mexico border. Its overwhelmingly Latino electorate last year went for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. But it also reelected a Republican to the U.S. House — one of fewer than two dozen in the country to split that way. Rep. Will Hurd narrowly won a second term in what turned out to be the most expensive House race in Texas history. Democrats have put Hurd’s seat in their top five targets in 2018. He will also be running to beat the fickle tendencies of a district that has ousted four different incumbents since 2006.” http://wapo.st/2pdajD3 WEST COAST WATCH -- “Anticipating a shift to the right in the courts, the NRA begins its attack on gun controls in California,” by L.A. Times Pat McGreevy: “The state affiliate of the National Rifle Assn. on Monday filed the first in a series of planned court challenges opposing sweeping new gun control laws approved in California in the wake of the San Bernardino terror attacks. The flurry of legal action comes as Neil Gorsuch, President Trump’s choice for the Supreme Court, takes his seat, returning a conservative majority to the nation’s highest court. And as the Republican administration begins appointing additional judges to the federal court system, gun-rights advocates say they hope that some of the more restrictive laws imposed in recent years will be vulnerable to legal challenge.” http://lat.ms/2q9JFKN PLAYBOOK METRO SECTION -- “Tony Kornheiser’s D.C. bar finally has its new name,” by WaPo’s Dan Steinberg: “Kornheiser announced on his podcast last week that the former Chad’s (formerly Chadwick’s) has been renamed Chatter, effective immediately. The name is both a reference to the restaurant’s new podcasting studio -- which he said should be open by May 1 -- and to a famous quote about newspapers. ... Some of his partners -- who include Maury Povich, Gary Williams and Alan Bubes -- preferred Chatters, but Kornheiser prevailed upon them to use the singular.” http://wapo.st/2oGS7AM ****** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: “The same attributes that drive business success –innovation, ingenuity and the ability to efficiently marshal human and financial capital – also offer tremendous promise to help solve pressing societal challenges.” Read “Private Enterprise for Public Good” by JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report. http://politi.co/2pLN1Uy ****** MEDIAWATCH -- “White House turns conservative media reception into on-the-record briefing,” by Hadas Gold: “Around 50 attendees from the likes of Breitbart, the Washington Free Beacon, Daily Caller, Christian Broadcast Network, Catholic-focused The Eternal Word Television Network, as well as conservative radio hosts like Laura Ingraham, Larry O’Connor and John Fredericks mingled with senior administration officials and the president over light snacks, fruit and candy in the White House’s Roosevelt room. Nearly the entire communications staff were in attendance in addition to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Stephen Bannon, senior adviser Jared Kushner, National Security Council spokesperson Michael Anton and Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland. After about 30 minutes, the president came in and, standing in the corner of the room, began to take questions from the assembled press, later turning the event on the record.” http://politi.co/2pvdBEL --Some reporters grumbled that they were unprepared when the evening turned into an impromptu presidential news conference. Reporters had been expecting a casual reception. The invitation had said the event was going to be “on background,” which the White House reiterated at the start of the event, according to an attendee. Because they thought the event was on background, some reporters at the reception weren’t jotting down exact quotes from Trump during his Q&A. --SPOTTED: Charlie Spiering, Matthew Boyle, Alex Marlow, Kaitlan Collins, Jim Stinson, Star Parker, Adam Kredo, Brent Schur, Vince Coglianese, Katie Pavlich, Trey Yingst -- “Bill O’Reilly plans to turn podcast into ‘genuine news program’,” by Hadas Gold: “Bill O'Reilly wasted no time stepping back into the media limelight following his stunning fall from grace last week, when he was pushed out of Fox News. On his podcast, which O'Reilly made free for this week, he said he plans to develop his website and the podcast, moving it from a short daily program into what would amount to a replacement for his long-running Fox show. ‘And then as we develop the website, we’ll have guests and things like that, and this will become longer and longer and longer, into a genuine news program. That’s the vision right now,’ O’Reilly said. After this week, those wishing to listen to O'Reilly's podcast will have to pay a fee.” http://politi.co/2p04v1a --“Tucker Carlson Is Shopping Around A Book,” by BuzzFeed’s Steven Perlberg: “On Monday night, Tucker Carlson assumed the prized 8 p.m. time slot on Fox News, a big step in the cable news host’s steady climb at the network over the past few months. Now Carlson is looking to raise his profile even more. According to three people familiar with the matter, the 47-year-old Fox host is shopping a book or series of books to publishers. ... [T]he ongoing auction will likely fetch Carlson millions of dollars. The book is not autobiographical in nature, but rather reflects on themes Carlson cares about ... Carlson is being represented by literary agency Javelin. The firm’s founding partner, Keith Urbahn, is a former chief of staff to former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.” http://bzfd.it/2q0V1nQ -- “Trump Adviser Gorka Walks Off Stage at a Discussion of Fake News,” by Bloomberg’s Nafeesa Syeed: “Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka, under fire for his alleged association with a Hungarian nationalist group and his views on Islam, walked off the stage during a conference in Washington after facing questions from students and protesters he said distracted from other participants. Gorka, a deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, was on a panel at Georgetown University on Monday titled ‘News, Alternative Facts and Propaganda: The Role of Cyber in Influence Operations.’ ...

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: How Much Would Trump’s Tax Cuts Help Bank of America? The nation’s second-biggest bank by assets paid more in taxes last year than all but five other companies on the S&P 500. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Apr 25, 2017 at 7:29PM One of the reasons bank stocks have surged since the presidential election is that investors expect the current administration to follow through on Trump's campaign vow to lower the top corporate tax rate from 35% to as low as 15%. But while all banks would benefit from this, as would all other profitable companies, few would gain as much as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The nation's second-biggest bank by assets paid $7.3 billion in income taxes last year. Only five companies on the S&P 500 paid more than that, with two of those also happening to be banks -- JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. Why do banks pay so much in taxes compared to other companies? The simple answer is that they earn more money. Apple is the only company in the country that earns more than JPMorgan Chase. Wells Fargo and Bank of America aren't far behind. Their net incomes over the past 12 months rank them fourth and sixth on the S&P 500, respectively. Unlike most other leading blue-chip companies, banks use an enormous amount of leverage, typically holding $10 worth of assets for every $1 in shareholders' equity. This allows banks to scale up their profits relative to other types of companies. Every $1 in shareholders' equity at Apple, for instance, translates into a comparatively modest $2.50 worth of assets. Cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35% down to 15% would therefore be a boon for Bank of America. It would have reduced the North Carolina-based bank's tax liability in 2016 by nearly half, or 48%, leaving $3.5 billion in additional net income to hit the bank's bottom line. That would make a huge difference, boosting Bank of America's net income by 19%, or approximately $0.35 per share. Bank of America's headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. Image source: Getty Images. The challenge for investors right now, however, is that much of this already appears to be priced into Bank of America's stock. This explains why its shares are up 44% since the beginning of November. To put that in perspective, the S&P 500 is up only 13% over the same stretch, while the KBW Bank Index has climbed 24% -- the latter tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo. If Trump's tax plans don't come to fruition -- and that could very well be the case, given the impact of the cuts on the federal deficit -- bank stocks could be in for a correction. It's too early to say if that will happen, but investors in bank stocks should keep it in the back of their minds. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 25, 2017 2:48pm   Comments Share: Related 8 Technical Levels From Tuesday's PreMarket Prep T-Mobile: Market Share Gains Continue, Time To Talk M&A? T-Mobile US Inc (NASDAQ: TMUS) shares are moving higher Tuesday following the company’s first-quarter earnings release that saw 1.1 million net additions. As the mobile provider continues to take market share, M&A talks are starting to heat up with the industry quiet period for the 600 MHz auction set to end Thursday. M&A Talks Heat Up “We continue to prefer T-Mobile as the best fundamental investment in the wireless space because the runway for subscriber share growth remains long and shares may benefit further from potential industry consolidation,” said JPMorgan following the first-quarter earnings release. Shares of potential takeover target Sprint Corp (NYSE: S) have spiked higher following the news as well. JPMorgan sees the possibility of merger deal being attempted and approved between both companies at 40 percent in the near term. Despite increasing competition, analysts are predicting subscriber guidance numbers to continue to increase through the year. JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating and $71 price target on the company. Beyond M&A On top of potential merger activity, T-Mobile has aggressive distribution plans in the works. “The company plans on expanding distribution by opening 1,500 T-Mobile stores (vs. 400 in 2016) and another 1,500 prepaid stores this year, which should keep gross add share numbers tracking higher and offset rising churn from the company’s steadily growing base.” Related Links: Sprint Stock Is Soaring; Possible Merger In The Works?

Brent crude was down 3 cents at $51.57 a barrel by 1411 GMT, down from a session high at $51.92, while U.S. crude futures were down 13 cents at $49.10 a barrel. Brent has fallen by almost 10 percent since late 2016, despite efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017. With oil supplies still around record highs, Stephen Schork of the Schork report said on Tuesday that "OPEC has failed miserably in its endeavour to balance the oil market". JPMorgan said in a market note "it is evident that ... crude markets are still struggling to clear (oversupply)". The bank said it was closing its "August Brent long position at a loss." To reduce the supply overhang, JPMorgan said OPEC "will be forced to renew, and possibly deepen the agreement if they wish to keep prices much above $50 per barrel". Russia said at the weekend its oil output could climb to the highest rate in 30 years if OPEC and non-OPEC producers do not extend their supply reduction deal beyond June 30. Extreme weakness in physical crude, where prices in the North Sea market have fallen to their lowest this year, is also acting as a drag on futures. But one analyst said crude demand could pick up and the long-awaited draw in global inventories could start to show with refinery maintenance around Europe and Russia set to peak in May at an estimated 1.5 million bpd. "If you look at the last six weeks, when you include the U.S., Europe, Singapore and floating storage, (inventories) have been going down on average by 8 million barrels a week," SEB commodities strategist Bjarne Schieldrop said. If that pace continued, he said it would equate to a draw down of 250 million to 300 million barrels by the end of 2017. "With refineries out, you have a lot of crude oil sloshing around, creating weakness in the spot price," he said. "We still have the OPEC meeting ahead of us on May 25 and it's always uncertain. But it doesn't make sense to sell down to $45 ahead of that."

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: How Visa Inc Makes Money Visa's business model is a bit more complicated than one might first guess. Here's how this company has consistently beaten the market since going public. Matthew Cochrane (CMFCochrane) Apr 25, 2017 at 12:44PM As investors, it's very important to understand how the companies we invest in make money. While this might sound painfully obvious, many invest in companies with only a vague notion of how they make money. To be sure, some business models are easier to grasp than others. For instance, even average consumers can tell you that Nike makes money selling shoes and that Coca-Cola earns a profit selling sugary carbonated beverages. Other companies' business models are not so obvious. Take Visa Inc (NYSE:V), for instance. Since its IPO in March 2008, Visa has provided monster returns to shareholders, producing gains of well over 500%! V data by YCharts While the returns have been unquestionably great, Visa's business model is often misunderstood. While it might commonly be called a credit card company, that definition is ambiguous and doesn't really explain how it generates revenue. Without further ado, let's take a closer look at this market-beating investment and determine exactly how it creates all those profits for investors. How Visa doesn't make money Because a lot of confusion exists on this point, let's start with how Visa does not make money. As with Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), consumers don't actually borrow money from Visa when they use their credit cards to make purchases. Therefore, when consumers make credit card payments Visa does not profit from the interest rates charged by the card. The money being borrowed is from the card-issuing financial institution, such as JPMorgan Chase or Capital One, and thus all interest expenses paid on a Visa-branded credit card goes to the card issuer.  Image source: Pixabay. There are pros and cons to this model. The obvious downside is that consumers pay a lot of credit card interest each year and none of that revenue goes to Visa. The positive is that Visa faces none of the default risk that comes from lending money. For what it's worth, Wall Street tends to assign much higher valuations to companies that do not face loan default risk. As a result, Mastercard's and Visa's price-to-earnings ratios are easily more than double of card-issuers' valuations like the American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), Capital One, and JPMorgan Chase. The four-party payment model Visa essentially acts as the middleman in a four-party model which, besides Visa, includes the card-issuing financial institution, the merchant, and the acquirers (the merchant's bank). According to the company's 10-K report, its annual filing with the SEC, every time a card is used Visa collects fees, as tiny slivers taken out of each transaction amount (it can vary depending on the card-issuing bank and merchant where it is used), in three main ways: service revenues, data processing revenues, and international transaction revenues. Last quarter, more than 96% of Visa's revenue was generated through these three streams. Service revenues are what the company earns for services provided to card issuers for the use of Visa products. The primary driver of this revenue category is payment volume. In other words, the more a product costs, the more revenue Visa makes in this category. For example, a gallon of milk will not bring in nearly as much service revenue as a brand-new energy-efficient refrigerator. What makes this type of revenue special is that it is a built-in hedge against inflation. If the cost of widgets rises due to consumer inflation, Visa's (and Mastercard's) revenue will automatically grow right along with it! Data processing revenues are the microscopic fees Visa collects for the authorization, settlement, clearing, and other various access and maintenance fees for its vast payment network. These revenues are based on the number of transactions that are made across Visa's network; not how much money is being charged. What exactly do these terms mean? Well, the authorization is the process by which Visa routes the transaction from the point-of-sale to the card issuer for approval. The clearing is the exchange of the transaction information between the issuer and acquirer after a sale is made and authorized while the settlement is the facilitation of the actual exchange of funds between the involved parties. Finally, international transaction revenues are earned for cross-border and currency conversion activities. These revenues are generated whenever a card holder purchases goods in a country different from the card-issuers country of origin. Because these fees make up such a significant chunk of Visa's total revenue, the company is especially sensitive to economic downturns across the world or whenever an event occurs, like the outbreak of a disease or act of terrorism, which can significantly hurt a region's tourism industry. It also means Visa is affected by the strength of the U.S. dollar more than most companies. The Foolish conclusion What I have found to be helpful when I only vaguely understand a company's business model, is to read the company's business overview section in its annual 10-K report. The reports are usually found on a company's investor relations website. Fifteen minutes spent reading this section is a great launching pad for further discovery and education about a company. Nearly all the information in this article was taken from Visa's most recent annual filing. Understanding how a company makes money is a must for potential investors as it is nearly impossible to evaluate a corporation's prospects without knowing the different ways it earns revenues. It would be a shame to eliminate potentially great investments, like Visa, because of a lack of understanding its fundamental business model.  Matthew Cochrane owns shares of Mastercard.

Brent crude was up 8 cents at $51.68 a barrel by 0940 GMT, while U.S. crude futures were up 10 cents at $49.33 a barrel. Brent is down 10 percent since late 2016, despite efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017. Given that oil supplies remain at record highs, Stephen Schork of the Schork report said on Tuesday that "OPEC has failed miserably in its endeavour to balance the oil market". JPMorgan said in its latest weekly market note to clients that "it is evident that ... crude markets are still struggling to clear (oversupply)". The bank said it was closing its "August Brent long position at a loss." JPMorgan said that to reduce the supply overhang, OPEC "will be forced to renew, and possibly deepen the agreement if they wish to keep prices much above $50 per barrel". Russia said on Monday its oil output could climb to the highest rate in 30 years if OPEC and non-OPEC producers do not extend their supply reduction deal beyond June 30. Extreme weakness in physical crude, where prices in the North Sea market have fallen to their lowest this year, is also acting as a drag on futures. However, with refinery maintenance around Europe and Russia set to peak in May at an estimated 1.5 million bpd, according to one analyst, crude demand will pick up and the long-awaited draw in global inventories should begin in earnest. "If you look at the last six weeks, when you include the U.S., Europe, Singapore and floating storage, (inventories) have been going down on average by 8 million barrels a week. If you extend that to the end of the year, at that kind of pace, you would draw down 250 to 300 million barrels," SEB commodities strategist Bjarne Schieldrop said. "With refineries out, you have a lot of crude oil sloshing around, creating weakness in the spot price ... we still have the OPEC meeting ahead of us on May 25 and it's always uncertain. But it doesn't make sense to sell down to $45 ahead of that," he said.

But they suffered a blow today as analysts at JPMorgan Cazenove became one of the construction services firm’s only City supporters, upgrading from Neutral to Overweight. More than a fifth of the FTSE 250 company’s shares are out on loan to short-sellers hoping to profit from a share slump, according to data from the financial watchdog. They’ve been in luck over the past couple of years, with the company losing a third of its value since its failed merger with Balfour Beatty in 2014. But JPMorgan left them feeling a little less confident ahead of next week’s trading update, predicting the shares will recover to 292p. The upgrade boosted Carillion by 8.27p, or 3.8%, to 224.57p. The Macron-mania which swept  markets higher yesterday faded slightly. However, buyers could still be found as the FTSE 100 added another 15.39 points to 7280.07, although gains would have been greater had it not been for Whitbread’s 6.8% dive, down 292p to 4015p.  “After Monday’s Gallic surge the  markets seem in need of a break, explaining the morning’s rather snail-like start,” said Spreadex analyst  Connor Campbell. His views were shared by Neil Wilson at ETX Capital. “The relief rally in  European stocks is just about still on but there are no signs of exuberance just yet. European equity markets are pretty well unmoved this morning as investors take another look at where the value is to be found,” he said. The oil price managed to reverse six days of losses, which came as traders lost confidence that proposed production cuts from Opec will solve the market’s oversupply. Brent crude edged up 14 cents to $51.74 a barrel, lifting London’s heavyweight oilers. Royal Dutch Shell, the biggest listed UK company, strengthened 19.5p to 2119.5p and BP was nudged 0.94p higher to 450.24p. Goldman Sachs lost its confidence in London’s mining giants amid a reversal in fortunes for the sector. The investment bank cut its rating on BHP  Billiton, which lost 7.5p to 1207p, to Sell and Anglo American, off 15p at 1114p, to Neutral. It warned half  of BHP’s profits come from iron ore and coal, two commodities it is now bearish on. Junior market investors checked into budget hotel chain easyHotel. Shares rose 2.5p to 95p after it signed a deal to develop hotels in Nepal with IGC Group, with the first in the capital Kathmandu.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Companies HSBC wins mandate on $100 billion Saudi Aramco IPO Europe's biggest bank joins peers including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley on the deal. Reuters April 25, 2017 16:36 IST A Swiss International aircraft flies past the HSBC headquarters building in the Canary Wharf financial district in east London on February 15, 2015.Reuters file HSBC Holdings Plc has been formally mandated as an adviser on the initial public offering of Saudi Arabia's national oil giant Aramco IPO, expected to be the world's largest ever IPO, HSBC's chief executive said.  Europe's biggest bank joins peers including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley on the deal, which is expected to raise some $100 billion (78.03 billion pounds) and is the centrepiece of the Saudi government's ambitious strategy to diversify away from oil. HSBC's Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver announced the bank's appointment on the deal at a shareholders' meeting in Hong Kong, confirming a Reuters report in February that the bank was close to being mandated on the hottest investment banking ticket in the world. Gulliver also said HSBC is confident it can maintain dividend payouts in the foreseeable future and expects to exceed risk-weighted asset and cost-saving targets. Despite earnings pressure, HSBC has retained its dividend payout ratio at a higher level in the last few years, at a time when some of its peers, including Standard Chartered, withheld dividend payments for 2016. The bank may have to move "some thousand roles" from Britain to Paris depending on how the country's Brexit negotiations with the European Union unfold, chairman Douglas Flint added. HSBC last month named AIA Group boss Mark Tucker as the new chairman of its board, replacing veteran Flint, whose departure will end one of the longest-serving management partnerships at a major global bank. CEO Gulliver is also due to leave in 2018.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures <CLc1> had added 14 cents, or 0.3 percent, by 0640 GMT, but remained below the $50 mark pierced late last week, at $49.37 a barrel. Brent crude <LCOc1> rose 14 cents, or 0.27 percent, to $51.74 per barrel. Traders said the gains were a counter-reaction to consecutive price drops in the previous six sessions. Despite Tuesdays increases, market sentiment has turned bearish, with Brent down 10 percent since late 2016 despite efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017 in order to tighten the market. Given that oil supplies remain at record highs despite the cuts, Stephen Schork of the Schork report said on Tuesday that “OPEC has failed miserably in its endeavour to balance the oil market”. JPMorgan said in its latest weekly market note to clients that “it is evident that… crude markets are still struggling to clear (oversupply).” The bank said that it was closing its “August Brent long position at a loss.” Indicating its cautious outlook, JPMorgan said that “crude markets are close to floating storage economics and (this) is a bearish sign for output price developments.” Floating storage is a clear indicator of oversupplied markets. It is pursued when oil for immediate delivery is so much cheaper than that for future dispatch that it becomes profitable for traders to charter tankers to store it for later. JPMorgan said that in order to reduce the ongoing supply overhang, OPEC “will be forced to renew, and possibly deepen the agreement if they wish to keep prices much above $50 per barrel.” Russia said on Monday that its oil output could climb to the highest rate in 30 years if OPEC and non-OPEC producers do not extend a supply reduction deal beyond June 30. Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows that Russian oil shipments, which exclude its pipeline exports, have already reached record highs of 5 million bpd in April, up 17 percent since December, before the cuts were officially implemented. While producers may hurt under the renewed slack in crude markets, consumers like refiners benefit as their production margins making fuels such as gasoline improve <DUB-SIN-REF> <GL92-SIN-CRK>.

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UV3Pdm ALSO READ Oil prices rise as planned oil production cuts start to materialise Oil stable on firm U.S. data, but doubts over global output cut linger U.S. oil prices slip on rising shale oil forecasts Oil dips on doubts over touted production cuts Oil prices steady in run-up to Christmas By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices recovered some ground on Tuesday, halting six consecutive sessions of slide, but markets remain under pressure as traders lose confidence that pledged output cuts by major producers will rein in oversupply in a world awash with fuel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures had added 14 cents, or 0.3 percent, by 0640 GMT, but remained below the $50 mark pierced late last week, at $49.37 a barrel. Brent crude rose 14 cents, or 0.27 percent, to $51.74 per barrel. Traders said the gains were a counter-reaction to consecutive price drops in the previous six sessions. Despite Tuesdays increases, market sentiment has turned bearish, with Brent down 10 percent since late 2016 despite efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017 in order to tighten the market. Given that oil supplies remain at record highs despite the cuts, Stephen Schork of the Schork report said on Tuesday that "OPEC has failed miserably in its endeavour to balance the oil market". JPMorgan said in its latest weekly market note to clients that "it is evident that... crude markets are still struggling to clear (oversupply)." The bank said that it was closing its "August Brent long position at a loss." Indicating its cautious outlook, JPMorgan said that "crude markets are close to floating storage economics and (this) is a bearish sign for output price developments." Floating storage is a clear indicator of oversupplied markets. It is pursued when oil for immediate delivery is so much cheaper than that for future dispatch that it becomes profitable for traders to charter tankers to store it for later. JPMorgan said that in order to reduce the ongoing supply overhang, OPEC "will be forced to renew, and possibly deepen the agreement if they wish to keep prices much above $50 per barrel." Russia said on Monday that its oil output could climb to the highest rate in 30 years if OPEC and non-OPEC producers do not extend a supply reduction deal beyond June 30. Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows that Russian oil shipments, which exclude its pipeline exports, have already reached record highs of 5 million bpd in April, up 17 percent since December, before the cuts were officially implemented. While producers may hurt under the renewed slack in crude markets, consumers like refiners benefit as their production margins making fuels such as gasoline improve.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson By Julia Simon | NEW YORK NEW YORK Oil prices settled slightly higher on Tuesday in volatile trading, then were mixed after hours when an industry group's preliminary report showed a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories. Oil prices seesawed throughout the day after falling sharply over the previous six sessions. Prices have been pressured as rising U.S. crude production has offset much of the output cuts by OPEC and other countries trying to reduce a global glut in crude. “We’ve seen rigs increase for the last 14 weeks and if we continue to see that it could put pressure on crude oil prices," said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors. Prices dipped after the market settled. The American Petroleum Institute said its data showed U.S. crude oil stocks rose 897,000 barrels in the latest week. Analysts had expected a draw of 1.6 million barrels. The API also said U.S. gasoline inventories increased. The market will watch closely Wednesday morning to see whether official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration confirms the API numbers. [EIA/S] U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled up 33 cents to $49.56 a barrel, breaking a streak that saw the benchmark lose 7.4 percent. Brent crude LCOc1 settled up 50 cents at $52.10 a barrel. Both crude contracts fell after the API report, but U.S. crude bounced back to its settlement price. The API said gasoline stocks rose 4.4 million barrels. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 1 million-barrel decline, as U.S. summer driving season approaches. "We're seeing less demand last week which could be allowing a build, and it could be furthering that as the weeks go on," Zahir said. Brent is down about 5 percent since early December, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia agreed to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of the year. On Tuesday, the Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvokovich as saying Russia may increase oil production. Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky noted that global crude loadings "continue to tick higher" and added that the glut probably will not abate "until we see the oil on the water falling." Georgi Slavov, head of research at Marex Spectron, said supply should tighten over the next couple of weeks, "not only in the Arabian Gulf but also with Russian oil. Russia is not going to pump and export as much oil as they did in the last couple of weeks."

U.S. crude futures settled up 33 cents to $49.56 a barrel, breaking a streak that saw the benchmark lose 7.4 percent. Brent crude settled up 50 cents at $52.10 a barrel. Analysts forecast U.S. crude oil stocks to fall by 1.6 million barrels in the most recent week. The industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) is due to release its inventory figures at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT). The figures are a precursor to data from the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA). Brent is down about 5 percent since early December, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia agreed to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of the year. With oil supplies still around record highs, Stephen Schork of the Schork Report said on Tuesday that "OPEC has failed miserably in its endeavour to balance the oil market." On Tuesday, the Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvokovich as saying Russia may increase oil production if it feels prices are unlikely to fall as a result. Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky said global crude loadings are at record levels. "We still see that continue to tick higher," Smith said. "Until we see the loadings drop, until we see the oil on the water falling, we are unlikely to see the market materially moving toward rebalancing." But Georgi Slavov, head of research at Marex Spectron, said he sees supply tightening over the next couple of weeks. "It's important that this tightening is not only in the Arabian Gulf but also with Russian oil," he said, "Russia is not going to pump and export as much oil as they did in the last couple of weeks." Slavov also sees optimistic signs for the oil price in the weakening U.S. dollar, which has fallen more than 3 percent since early March. "You haven't priced it in yet, this is for sure." Slavov said, adding that the U.S. dollar's slide against a basket of other currencies "looks quite likely to persist, which in turn should help oil." The dollar was down about 0.3 percent on Tuesday.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures added 21 cents, or 0.4 percent, by 0123 GMT, but remained below the $50 mark pierced late last week, at $49.44 a barrel. Brent crude futures rose 23 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $51.83 per barrel. Traders said the slight gains were a counter-reaction to consecutive price drops in the previous six sessions. Despite Tuesdays small price rises, overall market sentiment has turned bearish, with Brent down nearly 10 percent since the end of December despite an effort led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017 in order to tighten the market. "It is evident that ... crude markets are still struggling to clear (oversupply)," U.S. bank JPMorgan said in its latest weekly oil market update to clients. The bank said that it was closing its "August Brent long position at a loss," and that it "will review macro balances in the coming weeks before initiating further trades." Indicating that the bank's view on markets had turned bearish, JP Morgan said that "crude markets are close to floating storage economics and (this) is a bearish sign for output price developments." Floating storage is seen as a clear indicator of oversupplied markets. It is pursued when oil for immediate delivery is so much cheaper than that for future delivery that it becomes profitable for traders to charter tankers to store crude for sale at a later date. "There is further short-term downside to prices," JPMorgan said, adding that in order to reduce the ongoing supply overhang, OPEC "will be forced to renew, and possibly deepen the agreement if they wish to keep prices much above $50 per barrel." Russia said on Monday that its oil output could climb to the highest rate in 30 years if OPEC and non-OPEC producers do not extend a supply reduction deal beyond June 30. Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows that Russian oil shipments, which exclude its pipeline exports, have already reached record highs of 5 million bpd in April, up 17 percent since December, before the cuts were officially implemented.

By Caroline Simon 2 hours ago Penn students rarely bat an eye when they see clusters of their suit-clad peers rushing off to Huntsman Hall, clutching leather-bound folders. On this campus, companies like McKinsey & Company and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are household names. Career Services emails, campus flyers and advertisements in The Daily Pennsylvanian are populated by prestigious banks and consulting firms. It is commonly understood that Penn students, more than their peers at similar institutions, flock to careers in finance and consulting after graduation. Nearly half of 2016 Penn graduates who took full-time jobs worked in those two industries, with 25 percent in finance and 17 percent in consulting. Meanwhile, only a quarter of 2016 Harvard University graduates entered these two industries — 14 percent accepted full-time offers in “financial services,” while another 11 percent went into consulting. Yale University, Princeton University and Cornell University each had a little over a quarter of their 2016 graduates accept full-time offers in the two sectors. While large paychecks — which can often climb into six digits and beyond — are enticing aspects of finance and consulting, they are not all that draw Penn students to join these industries. Often, there is something else at play: prestige. “You have seen the pyramid narrow as you moved along. You went to high school, you did well in high school, you got into a very competitive, selective university, you’ve done well here,” Patricia Rose, director of Career Services said. “Do you want to become a tool and die maker in Illinois? That might be a terrific opportunity, but you probably want to go to an employer that has made it known that they are prestigious and selective.” Top-ranked investment banks and consulting firms are known for accepting large classes of recent college graduates from each year. In 2016, Goldman Sachs hired 29 new employees from Penn, Boston Consulting Group hired 28, JPMorgan Chase hired 26 and Deloitte hired 23. All of these companies ranked among the top 10 employers for Penn students last year. Top Employers Create your own infographics Over time, technology companies have also joined the ranks of firms known for hiring large numbers of Penn students — Google hired 28 of the 2016 graduates last year. While tech has ballooned in prominence, Rose said investment banking has also grown more popular over the last few decades, and consulting is always a popular option as well. The camaraderie fostered by large numbers of young, elite people working side by side is something that Penn students actively seek in their first jobs, Rose explained. “Students at Penn like to be with folks like themselves, and by that, I mean other students who are part of a curated group,” she said. “They’re really smart, [and] they’ve been selected.” It’s not just Penn students seeking the companies — the companies seek Penn students by coming to campus and establishing their presence in the recruiting process. Having companies on campus appeals to Penn students, Rose said, because they don’t have to reach out to employers themselves and they can often secure offers early in the year. “Students are very busy,” Rose said. “And if you have people available on campus and you’re getting emails saying, ‘Come meet with us,’ you’ll check it out.” Wharton senior Mario Del Cueto, who serves as an advisor to younger Wharton students, acknowledged the prominence of investment banking and consulting in the Wharton community, in particular. “Part of the reason why these are so well-known is because those are the things that get repeated again in club meetings and even in the classroom,” he said. Careers in finance, he said, are easy for Wharton students to imagine because their finance courses often involve working on the same kinds of models, for example, that they would work on in a potential summer internship. “That correlation is easier to draw,” he said. Alexandra Michel, a Graduate School of Education professor who received a doctorate from the Wharton School and used to work at Goldman Sachs, sees the decision to enter a prestigious, high-paying job after college as the obvious next step after what is often an elite upbringing. Average Salary Create your own infographics “There is a whole life experience that predisposes children to be more successful, and get into these more successful schools, and get drawn into careers that feel like their childhood and feel like the elite trajectory that they have been on throughout their childhood,” Michel said. Many students sign job offers at investment banks or consulting firms with the implicit understanding that they will only work there for two or three years before moving on to another job or a graduate degree. Rose said the short-term commitment appeals to Penn students, many of whom may plan on switching jobs or going back to school in their twenties. “If you had a company who came to this campus as they do to, say, big Midwestern state universities, and they say, ‘You can come to work for us at Caterpillar Tractor and you can make a career here.’ Well, who wants to think about 30, 40 years at one place?” Rose said. “Not our students.” But these prestigious jobs come at a price. Many companies require their analysts to work over 100 hours a week and be constantly available, a lifestyle Michel sees as a major health risk. “There’s this disconnect between these elite individuals who have everything that society can offer, and who are pampered by their firms, but who, nevertheless, are working under really difficult conditions,” Michel said. “And society has zero empathy for that.” Michel cited a list of issues that can arise from overworking, ranging from cardiovascular disease to depression to relationship problems. Recently, the dangers of these jobs have been illuminated by a string of tragedies. In 2015, Sarvshreshth Gupta, a first-year analyst at Goldman Sachs who was also a 2014 Penn graduate, died by suicide. Two years before that, a 21-year-old investment banking intern at Bank of America Merrill Lynch died after having an epileptic seizure in the shower following 72 straight hours of work without sleep. Though investment banking and consulting dominate Penn students’ perceptions of commonly chosen careers, Wharton advisors said they actively try to make sure the students they advise are aware of other options. Wharton senior and advisor Anushree Gupta, said her organization, Wharton Women, tries to make sure members are aware of options to work for other industries. “We really tried to broaden the spectrum of industries people were exposed to and make sure they didn’t just hear about banking and consulting,” she said. “We tried to make sure that no one felt pressured, and didn’t feel like the only thing that was talked about were those two industries.” All comments eligible for publication in Daily Pennsylvanian, Inc. publications.

Wall Street banks typically pay much less than the official 35 percent corporate tax rate. And yet after attacking Hillary Clinton for her ties to Wall Street, President Donald Trump is pushing reforms that would make it even easier for big banks to rig the tax rules and skip out on paying their fair share. Nine of the largest and most profitable U.S. banks paid an average federal tax rate of only 18.6 percent between 2008 and 2015, according to a new paper co-published by the Institute for Policy Studies and several tax and Wall Street reform groups. By using various loopholes, these banks avoided paying about $80 billion that could’ve gone towards urgent public needs, like fixing our crumbling infrastructure and expanding pre-K programs. Under Trump’s plan, tax-dodging banks would pay even less. The official rate would drop to 15 percent, and they’d still benefit from loopholes that would let them pay even lower rates. One of the biggest loopholes allows U.S. banks and other large corporations to use “creative accounting” to shift profits earned in the United States to foreign nations with low or no corporate taxes. Corporations still owe U.S. taxes on these profits, but they can put off paying them indefinitely. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just send Uncle Sam an IOU every year? Tax-dodging game Financial firms are particularly good at this offshore tax-dodging game. The six largest U.S. banks (Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo) have set up more than 2,300 subsidiaries in tax havens like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. In 2016, they were holding nearly $150 billion in profits offshore. Trump’s tax plan would slash the rate on those offshore profits to just 10 percent, saving the banks an estimated $25 billion. When these tax discounts on offshore profits have been tried in the past, they didn’t help bring back U.S. jobs. Instead of doling out new tax breaks to Wall Street, lawmakers should be working to make sure these profitable firms pay their fair share. After all, these are the guys who drove our economy off a cliff with their recklessness and greed in 2008. After the crash, taxpayers put them on a path back to profitability with massive bailouts. Where is all that money going today? While much of the country continues to struggle with widespread unemployment, losing their homes, and skinny budgets, Wall Street’s high profits are once again driving sky-high pay for executives. One practical way to generate much-needed revenue from Wall Street would be through a tax on short-term speculation. Working families pay sales taxes when they buy essentials like gas and shoes. But when Wall Street traders buy millions of dollars in stocks or derivatives and sell them a split second later, they don’t pay any tax at all. A tiny fee at rates of a few pennies per $100 of trading of stocks, bonds, and derivatives would raise massive revenue while discouraging the short-term speculation that produces no real economic value and makes markets less stable. Lawmakers should also consider using tax policy to discourage banks from taking on dangerous levels of debt. Reckless, excessive borrowing among so-called “too big to fail” banks was one of the key causes of the financial crisis. A small tax on big bank liabilities could raise significant money while preventing future bailouts.

After a three-hour annual meeting replete with shareholder outbursts and one unscheduled break to remove an angry investor, the San Francisco company announced voting tallies that showed the toll of the aggressive sales practices last fall that cost Wells Fargo $185 million in fines. Most striking, the bank's nonexecutive chairman, Stephen Sanger, garnered only 56% of shareholders' support, far below the 95% or more that most directors usually get with little fanfare. The head of the bank's risk committee, Enrique Hernandez, fared even worse, getting a 53% vote. In all, nine directors got votes of less than 75%. None of the board's longer-serving directors could muster more than 80% of the vote. "The outcome is a wake-up call that directors at U.S. companies may no longer glide through a crisis without taking individual hits in reputation," said Stephen Davis, associate director of Harvard Law School's Programs on Corporate Governance and Institutional Investors. "Institutional investors are staffing up for regular, tougher scrutiny of directors." Mr. Sanger, a former General Mills chief executive who spearheaded the board's response to last year's fake-account scandal, said Tuesday that shareholders "sent the entire board a clear message of dissatisfaction." Even so, neither Wells Fargo nor the board said there would be any immediate changes in the wake of the vote. Instead, Mr. Sanger reiterated what the bank has told some large shareholders privately: that six directors will step down from the board within the next four years when they hit the mandatory retirement age of 72 years old. Mr. Sanger, who turned 71 this month, added that the board is "urgently looking" to add new talent beyond the two directors who joined the board in February. Those two directors, along with CEO Timothy Sloan, who joined the board last year, received 99% majorities from shareholders on Tuesday. Bank investors have increasingly sent tough messages through the ballot box. In 2015, Bank of America Corp. Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan survived a vote that would have stripped him of one of those two roles at the Charlotte, N.C., bank. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Chairman and CEO James Dimon survived a similar vote after the "London whale" trading loss, but two of the New York bank's directors left the board after they garnered vote tallies of less than 60% in 2013. In 2012, Citigroup Inc. shareholders rejected a board-approved compensation plan for its senior executives, including CEO Vikram Pandit, who left later that year. In 2009, Bank of America shareholders voted to split the chairman and CEO positions in a narrow vote that essentially stripped Kenneth Lewis of his duties as chairman. He left the bank a few months later. For Wells Fargo, while the unanimous re-election of directors is a relief for the bank the fact that a majority of directors received less than three-quarters support suggests that Wells Fargo's board may face continuing pressure to make more changes. The breadth and scale of shareholders' limited support, especially with no alternative board candidates, is "very rare," said Sandeep Dahiya, an associate professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. Over the past 10 years, only 22 directors a year, on average, out of nearly 40,000 directors at S&P 500 companies received less than 60% of the vote for re-election, according to ISS Analytics, the data arm of proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. Focus on the board election built earlier this month, when ISS recommended that shareholders vote against re-electing 12 Wells Fargo directors who served while the sales practice issues occurred. Some large shareholders thought the board was slow to react to the sales-practices problems, though they have cited improvements in the board's response more recently. Though Wells Fargo's board has been active over the past several months in seeking shareholder feedback, issuing detailed results of an independent investigation over the sales practices and clawing back about $183 million in pay from executives, Mr. Dahiya said more actions may be necessary. He said in the coming months it is possible some board members may voluntarily depart as typically the more dissatisfied shareholders are, the more likely directors are to leave. The bank and board declined to comment beyond an earlier press release Tuesday. Tensions flared at the bank's meeting, held at a golf resort's conference center in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Among the roughly 300 shareholders attending, four shareholders spoke out of turn, yelling at the board or management to voice complaints. The first shareholder outburst prompted Mr. Sanger to halt the meeting for several minutes while the investor was removed from the room. The investor, Bruce Marks, a housing advocate and activist, had requested that each director speak to what they knew about the sales-practice issues, which resulted in about 5,300 employees being fired over a five-year period. When Messrs. Sloan and Sanger told Mr. Marks he was out of order, Mr. Marks responded that "Wells Fargo has been out of order for years." The meeting restarted a few minutes later, with Mr. Sanger saying Mr. Marks had been removed. Before Mr. Sanger read the vote tallies at the end of the meeting, former and current bank employees and customers came to a microphone, sometimes fighting back tears. Some discussed health problems and stress they say were brought about by the bank's aggressive sales culture. Others recalled decisions by the bank to foreclose their home. Mr. Sloan in most of these cases directed the speakers to follow up with Wells Fargo officials after the meeting. One former employee apologized to customers for the bank's aggressive sales tactics, and said that they were why she left the company. Mr. Sloan, in response, asked her to "consider coming back," adding that the bank has rehired more than 1,000 employees who had left because they didn't feel comfortable with the sales practices. A bank spokesman said most of those rehires, since September, are within the retail banking unit but declined to comment further. Still, "investors want change," said New York City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer, whose office oversees New York City's pension funds and voted against 10 Wells Fargo directors. "These wrongs need to be made right."

Reuters/Siu Chiu By Sumeet Chatterjee and Donny Kwok HONG KONG, April 24 (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc has been formally mandated as an adviser on the initial public offering of Saudi Arabia's national oil giant Aramco , expected to be the world's largest ever IPO, HSBC's chief executive said on Monday. Europe's biggest bank joins peers including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley on the deal, which is expected to raise some $100 billion and is the centrepiece of the Saudi government's ambitious strategy to diversify away from oil. HSBC's Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver announced the bank's appointment on the deal at a shareholders' meeting in Hong Kong, confirming a Reuters report in February that the bank was close to being mandated on the hottest investment banking ticket in the world. Gulliver also said HSBC is confident it can maintain dividend payouts in the foreseeable future and expects to exceed risk-weighted asset and cost-saving targets. Advertisement Despite earnings pressure, HSBC has retained its dividend payout ratio at a higher level in the last few years, at a time when some of its peers, including Standard Chartered , withheld dividend payments for 2016. The bank may have to move "some thousand roles" from Britain to Paris depending on how the country's Brexit negotiations with the European Union unfold, chairman Douglas Flint added, reiterating the bank's previous estimates of staff moves. HSBC last month named AIA Group boss Mark Tucker as the new chairman of its board, replacing veteran Flint, whose departure will end one of the longest-serving management partnerships at a major global bank. CEO Gulliver is also due to leave in 2018, and one of the main tasks facing Tucker immediately after taking over the new role in October will be selecting a new chief executive for Europe's biggest bank.

The brokerage noted that it has taken a neutral outlook on the stocks of Macau-based gaming operators. A report from JP Morgan analysts DS Kim and Sean Zhuang states that the “positive surprise in the gross gaming revenue could stall soon as the cyclical tailwind from last year’s China macro drop waning or even rolling over.” The country’s macro drop included liquidity easing, property rally and commodity price hikes amongst other factors. “As the sector runs out of positive catalysts, we think investors will focus more on the individual operator’s execution and resulting earnings revision potential, making stock calls increasingly more important,” the team noted. On a report issued on Friday, banking group Morgan Stanley noted that this year’s second-quarter results might be a good entry point for investors interested in a long-term position in Macau gaming stocks.  “Macau has underperformed the Hang Seng Index in every second quarter since 2012 – except for 2013 – and we believe the same could happen in the second quarter of 2017,” wrote analysts Praveen Choudhary, Alex Poon and Thomas Allen, referring to the main index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, as cited in a GGRAsia report. According to the group, they are expecting a “high valuation, a seasonally weak quarter, and a peak in China’s PPI [producer price index] to be near-term risks, adding, “in the medium term, we remain constructive thanks to infrastructure.” Wells Fargo Securities LLC analysts Cameron McKnight and Robert Shore said in a Sunday memo on Macau, and referring to mainland China economic policy: “VIP growth is roaring back on the heels of last year’s economic stimulus – but we think this could stall once the effect of the stimulus and the Chinese housing bubble wears off – as it did in 2013-14.” Furthermore, credit debt watcher Fitch Ratings raised its forecast on Macau’s VIP and mass market 2017 growth to 12 percent.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman A New Fintech Accelerator Emerges, Backed by Ohio Industry Giants /EINPresswire.com/ — COLUMBUS, OH–(Marketwired – Apr 25, 2017) –  In an unprecedented cross-industry partnership, Ohio-based flagship companies are launching a new global Fintech (financial technology) accelerator. KeyBank, Progressive, The Kroger Co., Grange Insurance, Huntington, FifthThird, First Federal Lakewood, Root Insurance, and Safelite are among the Ohio companies backing „Fintech71”, a newly-formed accelerator, whose name is a nod to the cross-state highway I-71 connecting Ohio via its three largest cities: Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland. JPMorgan Chase, which is among the state’s largest technology employers, will lend its thought leadership and industry expertise to the program. In addition, Silicon Valley Bank is supporting the effort, signifying national interest in the new endeavor.  The accelerator will focus on growing entrepreneurial activity, attracting more Fintech companies, and expanding the innovation pipeline for current private-sector stakeholders, including Ohio’s strong financial services base and Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 companies headquartered in the state. Such broad-based collaboration is unique and will benefit companies selected into the accelerator by offering them an exceptional range of mentor and partnership options. Combined with a stipend of $100,000 for each finalist team, access to some of the country’s best millennial talent, and an attractive cost of living, „Fintech71” and its graduates will be positioned for sustained success. „Ohio’s ranking as a Top 5 Fortune 500 and Top 5 Fortune 1000 headquarter destination is not without reason,” said Matt Armstead, the executive director for the accelerator. „Ohio is an innovative, resourceful and hard-working state where people have not forgotten how to make things. With the creation of this accelerator, we aim to leverage Ohio’s tech-savvy talent, attractive cost of doing business and established industry strength to make Ohio a global hotspot for Fintech innovation and growth.” The application process opens May 15 and will close on July 15. The inaugural class of up to 12 companies will start on Sept. 10, 2017, and will be based in Columbus, Ohio. All Fintech-related innovations ready for commercialization are encouraged to apply. International companies are particularly welcome and visa support will be provided for outstanding candidates. Financial services is the second-largest private sector in Ohio and sixth largest in the United States by GDP. As part of its mission to attract jobs and investment to the state, JobsOhio, a private, non-profit economic development corporation, will provide support to the accelerator’s operations. Lumos, a group of serial entrepreneurs with vast experience in accelerators and insurance, banking and payments startups, will run the program day to day.  Ohio-based industry associations, including the Ohio Bankers League, are supporting the initiative, and more private sector partnership announcements with Fintech71 are expected soon.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Chesapeake Lodging Trust Obtains $225.0 Million Unsecured Term Loan ARLINGTON, Va.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Chesapeake Lodging Trust (NYSE:CHSP), a lodging real estate investment trust (REIT), announced today that it has closed on a five-year, $225.0 million unsecured term loan. The term loan was led by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and PNC Bank, N.A., as documentation agent. The term loan provides for the possibility of future increases, up to a maximum amount borrowed of $375.0 million, in accordance with the terms of the term loan agreement. The loan bears interest equal to LIBOR, plus 1.45% – 2.20% (the spread over LIBOR based on the Trust’s consolidated leverage ratio). Contemporaneous with the closing of the unsecured term loan, the Trust entered into an interest rate swap to fix LIBOR at 1.86% for the five-year term. As of April 25, 2017, the effective interest rate on the unsecured term loan was 3.31%. Proceeds from the term loan were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The term loan agreement contains the same financial covenants as those contained in the Trust’s revolving credit facility. “We are pleased to take advantage of the historically low interest rate environment and extend the weighted-average maturity of our debt to 5.9 years,” said Douglas W. Vicari, Chesapeake Lodging Trust’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “Furthermore, we now have full borrowing availability of $300.0 million under our revolving credit facility which provides us flexibility and capacity to take advantage of shareholder value creation opportunities as they arise.” ABOUT CHESAPEAKE LODGING TRUST Chesapeake Lodging Trust is a self-advised lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on investments primarily in upper-upscale hotels in major business and convention markets and, on a selective basis, premium select-service hotels in urban settings or unique locations in the United States. The Trust owns 22 hotels with an aggregate of 6,694 rooms in nine states and the District of Columbia. Additional information can be found on the Trust’s website at www.chesapeakelodgingtrust.com.

Print Story X Print Story Business April 25, 2017 Share Advertisement HSBC wins mandate on $100bln Saudi Aramco IPO HONG KONG: HSBC Holdings Plc has been formally mandated as an adviser on the initial public offering of Saudi Arabia´s national oil giant Aramco, expected to be the world´s largest ever IPO, HSBC´s chief executive said on Monday. Europe´s biggest bank joins peers including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley on the deal, which is expected to raise some $100 billion and is the centrepiece of the Saudi government´s ambitious strategy to diversify away from oil. HSBC´s Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver announced the bank´s appointment on the deal at a shareholders´ meeting in Hong Kong, confirming a Reuters report in February that the bank was close to being mandated on the hottest investment banking ticket in the world.  Gulliver also said HSBC is confident it can maintain dividend payouts in the foreseeable future and expects to exceed risk-weighted asset and cost-saving targets.  Despite earnings pressure, HSBC has retained its dividend payout ratio at a higher level in the last few years, at a time when some of its peers, including Standard Chartered, withheld dividend payments for 2016.The bank may have to move "some thousand roles" from Britain to Paris depending on how the country´s Brexit negotiations with the European Union unfold, chairman Douglas Flint added, reiterating the bank´s previous estimates of staff moves.   Advertisement Comments Comment Advertisement Topstory 14 van passengers martyred in Kurram blast Opposition MPs tear up pro-PM resolution in Kashmir Assembly Maryam not cleared by SC in Panama case?

The surge this week in the Dow DJIA, +1.12% which posted the first back-to-back 200+-point gains since the two days following the U.S. election, is being attributed by many to the reduced risk of euro dissolution in the wake of French election results and hopes for corporate tax cuts and a budget deal. But there is a lot more to it than that. Since April 13, when J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.87%  kicked off first-quarter earnings reporting season before the market opened, 15 of the Dow’s 30 components have reported results through Tuesday morning, with 11 beating earnings expectations, according to FactSet. That 73% beat rate is above the 5-year average of 68% for S&P 500 index SPX, +0.61%  companies, FactSet said. More important, the shares of the Dow companies that have revealed results have gained a combined total of $20.69 in price since the reports were released through Tuesday, with 10 winners rising a combined $35.87 and five losers falling $15.01. The combined price gains added about 142 points to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index. That would represent about 35% of the Dow’s 404-point gain since earnings season started. Most of those earnings-related gains have come on Tuesday alone. The stocks of the five Dow companies that reported results added a combined 128 points to the Dow’s price, or more than half of the Dow’s 232-point rally. The biggest contributors were shares of Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +7.86% which added 52 points, and McDonald’s Corp. MCD, +5.57% which added about 51 points. Some Dow members scheduled to report earnings later this week include United Technologies Corp. UTX, +0.47% Boeing Co. BA, +0.80%  and Procter & Gamble Co. PG, +0.50%  on Wednesday; Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.58% Intel Corp. INTC, +0.33%  and Pfizer Inc. PFE, +0.06%  on Thursday; and Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.76%  and Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.76%  on Friday.

Economy Federal Reserve Capitol Report Economic Report Columns Darrell Delamaide Irwin Kellner Rex Nutting Tools Economic Calendar Real Estate Location Scouts realtor.com My MarketWatch Watchlist Alerts Games Log In Home Industries Investing/Securities A big chunk of the Dow’s gains have come from earnings By Tomi Kilgore Published: Apr 25, 2017 4:53 p.m. ET Share Half the Dow components have reported results, with those stocks contributing about a third of the Dow’s gains littleny / Shutterstock.com Earnings are doing the heavy lifting for the Dow industrials By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor Investors can thank earnings, as much as they can anything else, for the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s rally over the last couple of weeks. The surge this week in the Dow DJIA, +1.12% which posted the first back-to-back 200+-point gains since the two days following the U.S. election, is being attributed by many to the reduced risk of euro dissolution in the wake of French election results and hopes for corporate tax cuts and a budget deal. But there is a lot more to it than that. Since April 13, when J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.87%  kicked off first-quarter earnings reporting season before the market opened, 15 of the Dow’s 30 components have reported results through Tuesday morning, with 11 beating earnings expectations, according to FactSet. That 73% beat rate is above the 5-year average of 68% for S&P 500 index SPX, +0.61%  companies, FactSet said. More important, the shares of the Dow companies that have revealed results have gained a combined total of $20.69 in price since the reports were released through Tuesday, with 10 winners rising a combined $35.87 and five losers falling $15.01. The combined price gains added about 142 points to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index. That would represent about 35% of the Dow’s 404-point gain since earnings season started. Most of those earnings-related gains have come on Tuesday alone. The stocks of the five Dow companies that reported results added a combined 128 points to the Dow’s price, or more than half of the Dow’s 232-point rally. The biggest contributors were shares of Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +7.86% which added 52 points, and McDonald’s Corp. MCD, +5.57% which added about 51 points. Some Dow members scheduled to report earnings later this week include United Technologies Corp. UTX, +0.47% Boeing Co. BA, +0.80%  and Procter & Gamble Co. PG, +0.50%  on Wednesday; Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.58% Intel Corp. INTC, +0.33%  and Pfizer Inc. PFE, +0.06%  on Thursday; and Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.76%  and Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.76%  on Friday.

Even so five members, including the chairman, received only tepid support from investors. The cantankerous gathering in Ponte Vedra Beach, in northeast Florida, lasted nearly three hours and was repeatedly interrupted by irate shareholders, and even a Catholic nun. After the meeting the bank announced that Chairman Stephen Sanger was reelected with just 56 percent of the vote, and four other board members received scant support of 60 percent or less. Companies often replace board members who barely achieve reelection. "The Wells Fargo investors have sent a clear statement of dissatisfaction," Sanger said at the end of the gathering. "I assure you that the board has heard that message." The bank's leaders opened the meeting in by apologizing anew for the fake accounts scandal and reviewing the changes made since it became public, including replacing the chief executive, eliminating product sales goals for retail bank staff and raising pay for lower-ranking employees. The scandal came to light in September 2016 when the bank reached a settlement with regulators to pay $185 million after opening some two million deposit and credit card accounts without customers approval or knowledge. New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who opposed 10 of the board members, called the vote a "stunning rebuke" to leadership. "Investors have lost faith in Wells Fargo's board," Stringer said on Twitter. "Investors want change. These wrongs need to be made right. Accountability matters." Morningstar analyst Jim Sinegal said the board "holds some responsibility" for the debacle and the company's "painfully slow response." In addition, results in the first quarter "show that the scandal is having an effect on the business, and the lack of action today certainly won't do anything to help them repair their reputation." - Getting an earful - "We are facing these problems head on and Wells Fargo is emerging a much stronger company," said chief executive and board member Tim Sloan, who was reelected with 99 percent of the vote. But Sloan and Sanger got an earful from agitated shareholders. One investor interrupted the executives to demand a response from each board member on whether they were "complicit or incompetent" in the affair. "Let each one speak to say what they knew and when they knew it," said the investor who was ultimately led out of the meeting. Sanger declined to open the floor to individual board members. Sister Nora Nash called for a report on the "root causes" that led to the retail sales scandal. She represented the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia, a Catholic order of nuns which holds 14,832 shares of Wells Fargo stock. Nash characterized the lapses on retail sales as part of a "systemic" problem in the bank, which extends to mortgage lending and other practices. The proposal garnered 22 percent of the votes. Shares of Wells Fargo rose 1.7 percent to $54.56. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

In the green corner are stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500 index is just 0.3% away from a record high reached in March on bets that Donald J. Trump's administration will push through tax-code changes to spark growth. In the red corner sit U.S. government bonds, where benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have unwound almost half of their post-election increase, suggesting a far more pessimistic view of the economy.

Immense annual gains of 50%, 60%, and greater were pocketed by investors who caught the trend. Don’t worry, I’m not talking about speculative fintech or other risky high-tech financial names. Believe it or not, the outsized gains were made in solid, multi- billion dollar companies like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). Hopefully, your portfolio captured some or all of this historic upside. It’s Not Too Late to Profit on Financial Stocks  If you missed riding the uptrend higher, or simply want to have a chance to pocket additional gains, it’s not too late. I have identified five solid financial stocks that still have tremendous upside potential and pay hefty dividends. Amazingly, these stocks trade in a market that has never had a financial calamity since the 19th century. This industry remained stable during both the Great Depression and the global banking crisis of 2008. This market, the Canadian banking industry, never experienced a financial crisis due to a myriad of reasons that are beyond the scope of this article. Suffice to say; the Canadian banking system is widely considered to be a bastion of stability. 10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every Year In comparison, the United States has suffered through a dozen-plus banking mishaps during its history. Some academics point to the fact that banking regulations are used as political leverage in the United States’ two-party system as the reason for relatively high financial instability. The major Canadian banks, however, severely lagged the performance of the U.S. banking sector in 2016. Canadian banks returned 26% as a group, which is nothing to sneeze at, and this could mean there’s still room for growth north of the border. Here’s why I think Canadian banking stocks remain a solid buy opportunity: 1. Return on earnings Canadian banks as a group achieve about 15-16% ROE (return on equity), which places them in the same category as major internet names. 2. Stability of earnings Canadian bank earnings have dropped by just 14% during the last recession while U.S. bank stocks have given up an average of 46%. 3. Dividends Banks in our neighbor to the north pay between 3% and 5% in dividend yields. 4. Outperformance Canadian banks are the only sector to outperform Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway over the past 20 and 25 years. 5. Low Volatility The Globe & Mail’s Globe Investor column did a study on the best low volatility stocks for turbulent times. The study was conducted by analyzing stable stocks comprising the PowerShares S&P/TSX Composite Low Volatility Index ETF, which tracks the index of the same name. The index is weighted with the least volatile stocks ranked the highest. Canadian banks are the highest rated stocks on the list. The study also revealed that the stocks included have an average dividend yield well over the market average, while price-to-earnings ratios are lower than the S&P/TSX average. Here are 5 leading Canadian bank stocks to consider today: Next Page   1 2 View All View All   Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2017/04/5-ultra-cheap-bank-stocks-with-high-dividends/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace The 10 Best Cheap Stocks for You to Buy for $10 or Less 3 Technology Stocks Leading the Charge Past Nasdaq 6,000 3 Stocks to Sell Before Earnings Crush Them 3 Defense Stock Picks as Tensions Escalate 7 Best Chinese Stocks on Renewed Growth The Tesla Stock Hype Cycle Will End in Tears Apple Wants to Make Recycled iPhones ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Editor's Picks The 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy for $10 or Less 3 Tech Stocks Leading the Charge Past Nasdaq 6,000 7 Best Chinese Stocks to Buy on Renewed Growth 3 Stocks to Sell Before They’re Crushed by Earnings 3 Defense Stocks to Buy Now As Tensions Escalate Most Popular 7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should Own 10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every Year 7 Short Squeeze Stocks That Will Be Shot Into Orbit The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next Decade How to Trade Caterpillar Inc.

At a time of volatile household incomes and widespread economic insecurity, the latest innovations in financial technology may help bring some peace of mind and a little stability to financially stressed American families. The past few years have seen a proliferation of apps designed to help families—not rich people looking to allocate 401(k) retirement accounts, but the larger number struggling to make it from paycheck to paycheck, coping with the uncertainty of everyday life and trying to keep the promises they made to themselves to save. “In the U.S. we don’t really have an access-to-banking problem,” says Jennifer Tescher, president of the Center for Financial Services Innovation, a nonprofit that aims to help the industry better serve low- and moderate-income consumers. After all, 93% of U.S. households have bank accounts, according to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data. “The bigger issue is: Can we use technology to help people better manage their financial lives?” Author David Wessel Director - The Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy Senior Fellow - Economic Studies Twitter davidmwessel The financial strains that afflict many American households are well documented. About 12% of respondents to a 2015 Federal Reserve survey said their income varied “quite a bit” from one month to the next during the past year; an additional 20% said they occasionally had some unusually high or low months. The JPMorgan Chase Institute, sifting through data on one million Chase customers from 2012 to 2015, found that more than half experienced greater than 30% month-to-month changes in income; for Chase’s lowest-income customers, it was three-quarters. And scrutiny of 235 low- and moderate-income families in four communities, detailed in a new book, “The Financial Diaries: How American Families Cope in a World of Uncertainty,” found that the households typically experienced five months a year in which spending was either 25% above or below the monthly average. So now come the apps, a slice of what has come to be known as fintech—technology that is changing the financial industry. Making, saving, spending A three-year-old app called Even, for instance, is a response to the volatility of some people’s income—the Lyft driver, say, whose earnings swing widely from week to week. Based on past paychecks, Even estimates the amount a person makes on average, advancing money on bad weeks that the user pays back on a good week. The cost of the credit extended is covered by a subscription fee—$3 a month for individuals, though for many users employers subscribe and offer Even as an employee benefit. The company has raised $12 million in venture capital. Another app, Digit, from Hello Digit Inc., attempts to make saving easier. A user gives the app access to his or her checking account. It analyzes income and spending patterns, decides how much one can afford to save at any given time and automatically moves that sum into a Digit savings account, often just a few dollars every couple of days. “We believe so strongly in our math and our ability to safely identify money you can afford to save that if we overdraft your account, we’ll cover the fee, up to two times per customer,” Digit says. The two-year-old company effectively pays interest at a 0.2% annual rate on the $500 million it has accumulated in user savings, and makes its money by investing at a higher rate. It has raised $36 million in venture funding. Related Content Up Front FinTech: How can government promote the good and protect against the bad Aaron Klein and Nicholas Montalbano Tuesday, February 14, 2017 The Prism app, from Prism Money, began by simply putting all of a user’s bills in one app to cut down on the hassle of keeping track of them all. But the founders realized that managing the payment of bills was a huge source of stress to many people and shifted their focus to helping users with that, says Tyler Griffin, until recently Prism’s CEO and now entrepreneur in residence at the Center for Financial Services Innovation. Users connect the app to their bank accounts and monthly bills. The app reminds users when a bill is due and allows them to pay it with one click. It alerts users if a bill payment will trigger an overdraft, and it helps them avoid late fees by prioritizing their bills so they pay the ones due sooner first. Prism raised $3 million in venture capital before selling last year to PayNearMe, a firm that allows people to pay all sorts of bills in cash at 28,000 retail outlets. Other fintech companies help people borrow at lower costs than they can find elsewhere. Ascend Consumer Finance makes three-year loans averaging $6,000 at annual interest rates as high as 36%, which sounds steep but is well below the annual rates of 350% or more often charged by the payday lenders many people use. Also, Ascend cuts the interest rate—halving it in some cases—in any month in which a borrower reduces his or her debt by $50 or more, saves $50 or more, or spends less than $600 on a credit card. The two-year-old company has raised $60 million in equity and debt. Trends converge This proliferation of fintech apps in the past few years is the result of a convergence of forces. Several are technological. There is the ubiquity of smartphones among Americans of all incomes and the evolution of app stores with user-generated ratings that can quickly propel startups to popularity. There are the falling barriers to entry as more, and cheaper, software platforms and third-party services emerge on which startups rely. And there is the capacity and (sometimes grudging) willingness of big banks to let customers give fintech apps access to customers’ financial data. Related Books Behavioral Science & Policy Edited by Craig Fox and Sim B. Sitkin 2016 Behavioral Science & Policy Edited by Craig Fox and Sim B. Sitkin 2015 Going Mobile By Darrell M. West 2014 At the same time, investors are pouring billions into fintech startups as a cadre of entrepreneurs—some motivated by their own frustrations with conventional banking, others looking for ways to make money by doing good—emerge. Some are deploying the lessons of behavioral economics, fashioning smartphone-based nudges to get people to do what they intend to do but often don’t. Quinten Farmer, a co-founder of Even, emphasizes the need for app designers to talk to their customers. “The very first hire we made at Even was a user researcher,” he said at a recent forum. “It was not a popular choice with our investors; they wanted us to hire an engineer. But she has ended up being an incredibly foundational part of how our product has come together.” Every day on their morning commute, the Even team is “listening to a podcast that she put together which is interviews with the people we serve talking about the features that we’re working on building that day,” he said. The long view Few, if any, of these young fintech services have gone viral. Indeed, several are available only in some states, because state-by-state regulatory approvals are costly and time-consuming. Ascend, for instance, is doing business in just eight states. Whether the startups can prove profitable while serving low- and moderate-income customers remains to be seen. “I think fintech has significant potential if policy makers and firms are intentional about wanting to serve the low-income community by lowering costs, increasing speed and improving control over one’s financial life,” says Michael Barr, a University of Michigan law professor and former Treasury Department official with a longstanding interest in consumer finance. But, he adds, “The low-hanging fruit for making a lot of money is not in poor people. It may be a very long time before the bottom of the [income] pyramid is reached. It may be that there need to be special incentives for that—regulatory relief, tax credits.” Jonathan Morduch, a New York University professor of public policy and an economist and co-author of “The Financial Diaries,” has plenty of praise for fintech apps, but doubts they will be the ultimate solution to financial stress for many. “The apps make life easier for a bunch of folks, but you have to be in the mode of needing or recognizing them,” he says. “I’m a whole lot more excited about having a responsive credit union near you than an app.” Sometimes, he says, one needs a human to talk to.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman A New Fintech Accelerator Emerges, Backed by Ohio Industry Giants COLUMBUS, OH–(Marketwired – Apr 25, 2017) –  In an unprecedented cross-industry partnership, Ohio-based flagship companies are launching a new global Fintech (financial technology) accelerator. KeyBank, Progressive, The Kroger Co., Grange Insurance, Huntington, FifthThird, First Federal Lakewood, Root Insurance, and Safelite are among the Ohio companies backing „Fintech71”, a newly-formed accelerator, whose name is a nod to the cross-state highway I-71 connecting Ohio via its three largest cities: Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland. JPMorgan Chase, which is among the state’s largest technology employers, will lend its thought leadership and industry expertise to the program. In addition, Silicon Valley Bank is supporting the effort, signifying national interest in the new endeavor.  The accelerator will focus on growing entrepreneurial activity, attracting more Fintech companies, and expanding the innovation pipeline for current private-sector stakeholders, including Ohio’s strong financial services base and Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 companies headquartered in the state. Such broad-based collaboration is unique and will benefit companies selected into the accelerator by offering them an exceptional range of mentor and partnership options. Combined with a stipend of $100,000 for each finalist team, access to some of the country’s best millennial talent, and an attractive cost of living, „Fintech71” and its graduates will be positioned for sustained success. „Ohio’s ranking as a Top 5 Fortune 500 and Top 5 Fortune 1000 headquarter destination is not without reason,” said Matt Armstead, the executive director for the accelerator. „Ohio is an innovative, resourceful and hard-working state where people have not forgotten how to make things. With the creation of this accelerator, we aim to leverage Ohio’s tech-savvy talent, attractive cost of doing business and established industry strength to make Ohio a global hotspot for Fintech innovation and growth.” The application process opens May 15 and will close on July 15. The inaugural class of up to 12 companies will start on Sept. 10, 2017, and will be based in Columbus, Ohio. All Fintech-related innovations ready for commercialization are encouraged to apply. International companies are particularly welcome and visa support will be provided for outstanding candidates. Financial services is the second-largest private sector in Ohio and sixth largest in the United States by GDP. As part of its mission to attract jobs and investment to the state, JobsOhio, a private, non-profit economic development corporation, will provide support to the accelerator’s operations. Lumos, a group of serial entrepreneurs with vast experience in accelerators and insurance, banking and payments startups, will run the program day to day.  Ohio-based industry associations, including the Ohio Bankers League, are supporting the initiative, and more private sector partnership announcements with Fintech71 are expected soon.

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 25, 2017 10:51am   Comments Share: Related JPM Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For April 25, 2017 A Peek Into The Markets: U.S. Stock Futures Rise Ahead Of Earnings Election in France Helps US Market Indexes Gain on Monday (GuruFocus) Related WFC Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For April 25, 2017 The Market In 5 Minutes Breaking Down the —-Stage Dividend Discount Model for Beginners (GuruFocus) Guggenheim issued a trio of upgrades Tuesday, raising ratings for American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) from Neutral to Buy. The firm also raised its rating for Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC) from Sell to Neutral. According to analyst Eric Wasserstrom, all three financial sector giants have key similarities. Bullish Stances First, each of the stocks has made improvements to its EPS outlook. American Express and JPMorgan now have significant growth potential, and Wells Fargo earnings seemed to have stabilized following the company’s fraudulent accounts scandal. Second, Guggenheim no longer has a cautious overall view of the banking and specialty finance space following the pullback in the financial sector in recent weeks. Finally, the three upgraded stocks all have specific potential EPS drivers ahead outside of the general bullish themes impacting the sector as a whole. Trio Themes For now, Guggenheim is pursuing two distinct investing themes in the financial sector. The first theme is catalyst-driven value stocks, a group that includes American Express, Ally Financial Inc (NYSE: ALLY), Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS).

KeyBank, Progressive, The Kroger Co., Grange Insurance, Huntington, FifthThird, First Federal Lakewood, Root Insurance, and Safelite are among the Ohio companies backing "Fintech71", a newly-formed accelerator, whose name is a nod to the cross-state highway I-71 connecting Ohio via its three largest cities: Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland. JPMorgan Chase, which is among the state's largest technology employers, will lend its thought leadership and industry expertise to the program. In addition, Silicon Valley Bank is supporting the effort, signifying national interest in the new endeavor.  The accelerator will focus on growing entrepreneurial activity, attracting more Fintech companies, and expanding the innovation pipeline for current private-sector stakeholders, including Ohio's strong financial services base and Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 companies headquartered in the state. Such broad-based collaboration is unique and will benefit companies selected into the accelerator by offering them an exceptional range of mentor and partnership options. Combined with a stipend of $100,000 for each finalist team, access to some of the country's best millennial talent, and an attractive cost of living, "Fintech71" and its graduates will be positioned for sustained success. "Ohio's ranking as a Top 5 Fortune 500 and Top 5 Fortune 1000 headquarter destination is not without reason," said Matt Armstead, the executive director for the accelerator. "Ohio is an innovative, resourceful and hard-working state where people have not forgotten how to make things. With the creation of this accelerator, we aim to leverage Ohio's tech-savvy talent, attractive cost of doing business and established industry strength to make Ohio a global hotspot for Fintech innovation and growth." The application process opens May 15 and will close on July 15. The inaugural class of up to 12 companies will start on Sept. 10, 2017, and will be based in Columbus, Ohio. All Fintech-related innovations ready for commercialization are encouraged to apply. International companies are particularly welcome and visa support will be provided for outstanding candidates. Financial services is the second-largest private sector in Ohio and sixth largest in the United States by GDP. As part of its mission to attract jobs and investment to the state, JobsOhio, a private, non-profit economic development corporation, will provide support to the accelerator's operations. Lumos, a group of serial entrepreneurs with vast experience in accelerators and insurance, banking and payments startups, will run the program day to day.  Ohio-based industry associations, including the Ohio Bankers League, are supporting the initiative, and more private sector partnership announcements with Fintech71 are expected soon.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Center for Global Policy Solutions’ 2017 Future of Wealth Summit Launches This Week Washington, DC (PRWEB) April 25, 2017 The Center for Global Policy Solutions, a 501(c)3 think tank and action organization dedicated to driving society toward inclusion, today announced the launch of its annual 2017 Future of Wealth Summit: Technology, Inclusion and Social Change. The Summit will take place April 26–28 in Washington, D.C., at the Washington Court Hotel, 525 New Jersey Ave., NW. This year’s opening reception keynote speech on April 26 will feature Jesse Williams, actor, activist and co-founder of the startup mobile app Ebroji. More information on the summit, including confirmed speakers and the agenda, can be found at http://2017summit.globalpolicysolutions.org. Leaders in government, business, philanthropy, academia, journalism, and advocacy will converge on the nation’s capital to explore structural barriers to equality, equity and opportunity in the United States. “With technology rapidly advancing amid great uncertainty, as well as great social, political and economic disruption, this is a very necessary gathering,” said Dr. Maya Rockeymoore, CGPS President and CEO. “The greater focus is to advance solutions which encourage a more inclusive, equitable, and prosperous society for all people.” Due to an overwhelming response from participants and a strong social media campaign, the event is already sold out and over-capacity. Sponsors include Google and JP Morgan Chase & Co. Other speakers include: Star Jones, a noted television personality and attorney who heads the National Association of Professional Women and Professional Diversity Network; U.S. Reps. Greg Meeks (NY-5th), Eddie Bernice Johnson (TX-30th), and Elijah Cummings (MD-7th); and Panama Jackson, co-founder of the popular VerySmartBrothas.com blog. Summit organizers anticipate more than 300 policymakers, journalists, advocates, and experts at the intersection of government, technology, economics, education, health, and human and civil rights. Summit participants will learn about the impact of the latest technological advancements in big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence and delve into tech sector’s lack of racial and gender diversity. Discussions will center on applications fostering convenient access to critical information and services without encouraging uses that reinforce biases, narrow choices, and undermine privacy. This year’s Summit will also feature an “Inclusion Revolution Innovation Competition” awarding a $10,000 prize to innovators who develop products, services, programs, or policies that help make the application of technology, big data, and/or the operation of the tech sector more inclusive and socio-economically beneficial to marginalized communities. There will be an awards luncheon honoring notables who have worked to bridge the digital divide and a special screening of the acclaimed documentary “Against All Odds: The Fight for a Black Middle Class.” ### About CGPS Founded on the principle that a more inclusive nation is a stronger, more prosperous one, the Center for Global Policy Solutions (CGPS) is a 501(c)(3) that equips businesses and organizations with the tools to effect change, driving society toward inclusion.

Investors in the S&P 500 were moving into riskier assets and out of gold and bonds By Sam Collins, InvestorPlace Chief Technical Analyst  |  Apr 25, 2017, 7:57 am EDT     Popular Posts: Is the S&P 500’s Breakout a Fake-Out? With the S&P 500 Near Highs, Buy Good Stocks on the Dips Recent Posts: Is the S&P 500’s Breakout a Fake-Out? Trade of the Day: SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI) Stock Is a Golden Investment With the S&P 500 Near Highs, Buy Good Stocks on the Dips View All Posts On Monday the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, fell 24% as investors sold gold and bonds in favor of higher-risk investments. The French election was credited with the big gains on Wall Street in spite of one leading politician, Marine Le Pen’s, negative position on the European Union. But opinion polls showed that Le Pen would come in second against the National Front leader, Emmanuel Macron, in a head-to-head election. According to The Wall Street Journal, banks, both domestic and international, would be big winners with the larger institutions benefitting most. Yesterday’s advances by the large banks confirmed that opinion: JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) rose 3.8% and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) gained 3.2%. Safety-net investments like gold and bonds fell sharply. Gold fell 0.9% to $1,276 per ounce and the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note’s yield rose as its price declined. President Donald Trump ordered aides to increase the pace of work on the draft of a new tax plan. That, too, had a positive impact on stocks. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 216 points, closing at 20,764, the S&P 500 gained 25 points at 2,375, the Nasdaq gained a whopping 73 points at 5,984, and the Russell 2000 closed at 1,398 for a gain of 18. The NYSE’s primary exchange traded 670 million shares with total volume of 3.6 billion shares. The Nasdaq crossed 1.8 billion shares. On the Big Board, advancers outpaced decliners by 2.4-to-1, and on the Nasdaq, advancers led by 2.6-to-1. Blocks on the NYSE increased by just10 above 7,340 on Friday to 7,350. Click to Enlarge In one day, the inverse indicator fell 24% to end close to the VIX’s low for the year — a very bullish indication for stocks. Click to Enlarge The S&P 500 didn’t miss a beat as banks and other internationals jumped due to the election results in France. But is this the real thing or just another fake out? Conclusion: Neither high volume nor strong bullish breadth support a break-away gap. Buying stocks on geopolitical happenings has not proven to be consistently successful. My reading is that we may challenge the April reversal high and perhaps even the S&P’s closing high at 2,395 made on March 1, but unless breadth and volume increase, I suggest adding to cash, a move that is seldom wrong.

Europe's biggest bank joins peers including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley on the deal, which is expected to raise some $100 billion and is the centrepiece of the Saudi government's ambitious strategy to diversify away from oil. HSBC's Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver announced the bank's appointment on the deal at a shareholders' meeting in Hong Kong, confirming a Reuters report in February that the bank was close to being mandated on the hottest investment banking ticket in the world. Gulliver also said HSBC is confident it can maintain dividend payouts in the foreseeable future and expects to exceed risk-weighted asset and cost-saving targets. Despite earnings pressure, HSBC has retained its dividend payout ratio at a higher level in the last few years, at a time when some of its peers, including Standard Chartered, withheld dividend payments for 2016. The bank may have to move "some thousand roles" from Britain to Paris depending on how the country's Brexit negotiations with the European Union unfold, chairman Douglas Flint added, reiterating the bank's previous estimates of staff moves. HSBC last month named AIA Group boss Mark Tucker as the new chairman of its board, replacing veteran Flint, whose departure will end one of the longest-serving management partnerships at a major global bank. CEO Gulliver is also due to leave in 2018, and one of the main tasks facing Tucker immediately after taking over the new role in October will be selecting a new chief executive for Europe's biggest bank.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Economy Companies Markets Finance Regulation Business Companies HSBC confirms advisory mandate on bumper Saudi Aramco IPO Global banking giant expected to advise Saudis on what's being tipped as the world's largest IPO. By Gaurav Sharma April 25, 2017 13:11 BST The HSBC logo is seen at their offices at Canary Wharf financial district in London.Reinhard Krause/Reuters HSBC has confirmed its mandate to advise Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco on the public listing of its stock, a bid tipped by analysts to be the world's largest ever initial public offering (IPO). The global bank's chief executive Stuart Gulliver officially announced the lucrative mandate at a shareholders' meeting in Hong Kong on Monday (24 April), confirming what newswire Reuters had reported in February. The move would see the banking giant join peers JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley on the deal, which has been given dizzying valuations by many market commentators. Aramco is expected to list around 5% of its equity in a bid to raise $100bn (£78bn, €91.8bn), with valuation estimates for the whole company coming in as high as $2trn. While Tadawul, the Saudi Stock Exchange, would get the primary domestic Aramco listing slated for 2019, lobbying for the secondary international listing has intensified, with London, New York and Hong Kong stock exchanges leading suitors. In February, Riyadh surprised the market by choosing New York-based boutique bank Moelis & Co as an IPO adviser, but bigger banking sector names have since followed suit. If a $2trn valuation is ultimately realised, Aramco would beat the current valuations of the world's largest publicly traded companies Apple ($720bn), Google ($585bn) and Microsoft ($500bn), as well as the world's largest oil and gas company ExxonMobil ($340bn), several times over.

The benchmark index of the second-largest stock exchange in the world rallied along with the wider US stock markets on Monday. By: FE Online | Published: April 25, 2017 1:39 PM The Nasdaq Composite Index yesterday rose 1.2% to close at a new record high of 5,983.82 points, after rising to an all-time intraday high of 5,989.92 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index yesterday rose 1.2% to close at a new record high of 5,983.82 points, after rising to an all-time intraday high of 5,989.92 points. The benchmark index of the second-largest stock exchange in the world rallied along with the wider US stock markets on Monday, tracking a relief rally that swept through Asian and European markets. The centrist candidate and market favorite Emmanuel Macron won the first round of the French presidential election. Pro-EU and anti-Frexit Macron is expected to beat right-wing rival Marine Le Pen in a deciding vote on May 7 according to polls, which were mostly right about the first-round results, Reuters reported. You may like to watch: US equities soared on Monday as investors cheered the results of the first round in the French presidential election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1%, to close at 20,763.89, led by a 3.5% surge in shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co and a 2.9% jump in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. French boost “The market really seemed to like” the election outcome, Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial, said in an interview to the CNBC news channel. “It really surprised me because the other candidate is Le Pen and she’s the sleeper candidate,” Warren added. On the other side, the French election driven, European stock markets skyrocketed across the board, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index popping about 2%. The French CAC 40 rose 4.14% and hit a nine-year high. The euro also rose sharply against most major currencies. The common currency briefly broke above $1.09 against the US dollar and last traded around 1.3% higher at $1.087, Reuters said. Korean fears Earlier this month, global markets witnessed a downtrend due to the US missile strikes on Syria and concerns over North Korea’s inflammatory comments. North Korea’s vice-foreign minister Han Song-Ryol had spooked the markets by saying that an “all-out war” would result if the US took military action. “If the US is reckless enough to use military means, from that very day, there will be all out war. Our nuclear weapons protect us from that threat,” vice foreign minister Han Song-Ryol had told the BBC’s John Sudworth. “We’ll be conducting more missile tests on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis,” he had said. You may also like: Yesterday too, at a “national meeting” of thousands of senior military and civilian officials, North Korea’s minister of defense Gen Pak Yong Sik reiterated that the country is ready to use pre-emptive strikes or any other measures it deems necessary to defend itself against the “US imperialists”, PTI reported. “The situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula is so tense that a nuclear war may break out due to the frantic war drills of the US imperialists and their vassal forces for aggression,” PTI cited him as saying. US watch Going ahead, the US investors are also gearing up for the busiest earnings week in at least a decade, with over 190 S&P 500 members, including heavyweights Alphabet and Microsoft due to report results. The possibility of a US government shutdown comes as President Donald Trump is about to conclude his first 100 days in office, Reuters said in a report. Trump has ordered aides to put together a tax plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%. Expectations of tax reform have been one of the pillars of the stock markets post-election. Moves across markets point to an unwinding of bets taken in the past few days as traders had turned defensive ahead of the French election, Reuters said in a report. In France, Le Pen and Macron will face off again on May 7. Most polls show Macron easily beating Le Pen in the second round, CNBC has said. No Comments.

The stock rose as much as 7.6 percent to 144 kronor, the highest intraday price since July 24, 2007, and was up 6 percent at 9:39 a.m. in Stockholm. Adjusted operating profit climbed to 7.03 billion kronor ($798 million). Orders for commercial vehicles and machinery for construction sites and mining also gained, Gothenburg, Sweden-based Volvo said Tuesday in a statement, boding well for future revenue. Volvo CEO Martin Lundstedt sees more positive outlook in N. America Source: Bloomberg “This was an extremely strong quarter, with the benefits of the restructuring over the past couple of years coming through,” said Jose Asumendi, a London-based analyst with JPMorgan Chase & Co. “Those orders are going to translate into sales in the coming quarters.” Volvo last year completed a reorganization to cut in annual spending by 10 billion kronor from 2012 levels. The manufacturer also moved early to reduce truck output in North America after an industrywide contraction following a period of high demand. While order intake was strong, Volvo recorded a 5 percent drop in deliveries during the quarter, and left its forecasts for key markets unchanged. The adjusted earnings beat the 5.46 billion-krona average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. European demand for trucks has been buoyed by improved economic prospects, including German business confidence at a six-year high. At the same time, demand in the U.S. has flagged, though this may turn around as President Donald Trump has a goal of lifting growth in the world’s largest economy to 3 percent. New truck orders rose 11 percent in the quarter, helped by jumps of 27 percent in North America and 31 percent in Asia, Volvo said. Sales contracts for construction equipment increased 34 percent, bolstered by growth in Asia and Europe. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Truck-market weakness in North America looks to be “bottoming out,” while a recovery in the mining industry has boosted the construction-equipment business, Chief Executive Officer Martin Lundstedt said in the statement. Volvo has canceled planned “stop days” at its plants in the region, which will operate as normal during the second quarter, because of the stronger demand, he told analysts in a webcast. Volvo’s return on sales during the quarter widened to 9.1 percent from 6.2 percent a year earlier. That compares with 8.4 percent profitability at Daimler AG’s trucks unit in the period. Daimler, the world’s biggest maker of commercial vehicles, outlined plans early this month to scale back the workforce at its German plants to cut 400 million euros ($434 million) in fixed costs.

Oil prices seesawed throughout the day after falling sharply over the previous six sessions. Prices have been pressured as rising U.S. crude production has offset much of the output cuts by OPEC and other countries trying to reduce a global glut in crude. “We’ve seen rigs increase for the last 14 weeks and if we continue to see that it could put pressure on crude oil prices," said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors. Prices dipped after the market settled. The American Petroleum Institute said its data showed U.S. crude oil stocks rose 897,000 barrels in the latest week. Analysts had expected a draw of 1.6 million barrels. The API also said U.S. gasoline inventories increased. The market will watch closely Wednesday morning to see whether official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration confirms the API numbers. [EIA/S] U.S. crude futures <CLc1> settled up 33 cents to $49.56 a barrel, breaking a streak that saw the benchmark lose 7.4 percent. Brent crude <LCOc1> settled up 50 cents at $52.10 a barrel. Both crude contracts fell after the API report, but U.S. crude bounced back to its settlement price. The API said gasoline stocks rose 4.4 million barrels. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 1 million-barrel decline, as U.S. summer driving season approaches. "We're seeing less demand last week which could be allowing a build, and it could be furthering that as the weeks go on," Zahir said. Brent is down about 5 percent since early December, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia agreed to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of the year. On Tuesday, the Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvokovich as saying Russia may increase oil production. Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky noted that global crude loadings "continue to tick higher" and added that the glut probably will not abate "until we see the oil on the water falling." Georgi Slavov, head of research at Marex Spectron, said supply should tighten over the next couple of weeks, "not only in the Arabian Gulf but also with Russian oil. Russia is not going to pump and export as much oil as they did in the last couple of weeks."

US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures added 24 cents, or 0.5 per cent, by 0305 GMT, but remained below the $50 mark pierced late last week, at $49.47 a barrel. Brent crude rose 26 cents or 0.5 percent to $51.86 per barrel. Traders said the gains were a counter-reaction to consecutive price drops in the previous six sessions. Despite Tuesday's increases, market sentiment has turned bearish, with Brent down 10 percent since late 2016 despite efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017 in order to tighten the market. Given that oil supplies remain at record highs despite the cuts, Stephen Schork of the Schork report said on Tuesday that "OPEC has failed miserably in its endeavour to balance the oil market." JPMorgan said in its latest weekly market note to clients that “it is evident that... crude markets are still struggling to clear (oversupply).” The bank said that it was closing its “August Brent long position at a loss.” Floating storage economics Indicating its cautious outlook, JPMorgan said that “crude markets are close to floating storage economics and (this) is a bearish sign for output price developments.” Floating storage is a clear indicator of oversupplied markets. It is pursued when oil for immediate delivery is so much cheaper than that for future dispatch that it becomes profitable for traders to charter tankers to store it for later. JPMorgan said that in order to reduce the ongoing supply overhang, OPEC “will be forced to renew, and possibly deepen the agreement if they wish to keep prices much above $50 per barrel''. Russia had said on Monday that its oil output could climb to the highest rate in 30 years if OPEC and non-OPEC producers do not extend a supply reduction deal beyond June 30. Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows that Russian oil shipments, which exclude its pipeline exports, have already reached record highs of 5 million bpd in April, up 17 per cent since December, before the cuts were officially implemented. While producers may hurt under the renewed slack in crude markets, consumers like refiners benefit as their production margins making fuels such as gasoline improve.

By Andrew Bary Biography Updated March 23, 2009 11:59 p.m. ET FRANKLY, WE HAD SOME concerns about drawing up our annual list of the 30 Most Respected CEOs. In a year of devastating losses, plunging stock prices and endless scandal, could we really find 30 CEOs worthy of great respect? To our surprise, there were actually many more -- leaders who are not only weathering the tumult relatively unscathed but positioning their companies to thrive when conditions finally improve. A group of Barron's editors winnowed the field to 30, after speaking with investors, analysts, executives and others. Strong financial controls, client focus and innovation have been keys to survival. Randy Jones for Barron's The final list is made up of chief executive officers from around the world who are doing outstanding jobs of keeping their companies out of trouble and on course. That means conservative financial management, a strong focus on the customer and relentless innovation. The roster includes no fewer than 12 new names. Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, for instance, has transformed his company from an online bookseller to one of the world's top retailers, with a true hot product in its Kindle wireless e-book reader. Under Jim Skinner, McDonald's started growing again as the company capitalized on healthier foods like salads, while not ignoring its core customers who crave Big Macs. In financial services, few leaders stand taller than JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, who has avoided major mishaps and become the go-to guy for regulators looking to unload crippled companies like Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. Of course, adding a dozen names meant kicking a dozen off. They included Kenneth Chenault of American Express (now mired in credit-quality problems), Lew Frankfort of Coach (groping to find his way in the collapsed luxury market) and Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric (sitting on pile of potentially troubled real-estate investments). The list includes 12 executives from outside the U.S. -- from a supermarket baron in England to an electronic-games whiz from Japan. But for all its surprises, the list also includes some old standbys, corporate luminaries who were just were just bound to be there. Like Warren Buffett. Despite a 50% drop in the stock market from its 2007 peak, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway brka 1.055615876462782% Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

TOP 30 CEOS: B-D | F-J | L-Ma | M-Sc | S | T-W THIS RANKING ISN'T BASED on any statistical formula. Barron's has an investment focus, and we pay close attention to how stocks perform during a CEO's tenure. It shouldn't be surprising, then, that most of the 30 stocks have beaten the Standard & Poor's 500 index during the CEO's tenure. In the year ended Feb. 27, the average performance of the stocks has been a loss of 31.8% -- not good, but significantly better than the S&P 500, which was off 44.8%. To make the grade, CEOs need to have been on the job for at least three years, and we prefer those with at least five years of experience. It takes time to affect corporate cultures and establish a reputation in the investment community. While the stock prices of these companies often shine, most of the CEOs in our Hall of Fame aren't obsessed with creating "shareholder value." That mantra, which was embraced by a broad swath of Corporate America, often involved acquisitions or financial gimmicks like massive share repurchases that left companies burdened with debt and ill-prepared to deal with the business and financial challenges of the past year. Barron's Andrew Bary talks about the world's top 30 CEOs, including leaders from some familiar names: Berkshire Hathaway, JP Morgan, FedEx. Costco Wholesale COST 0.20309870597110197% Costco Wholesale Corp. U.S.: Nasdaq USD172.68 0.35 0.20309870597110197% /Date(1493154000233-0500)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 1384982 AFTER HOURS USD177.85 5.17 2.9939772990502664% Volume (Delayed 15m) : 118059 P/E Ratio 31.85977859778598 Market Cap 74957958071.3422 Dividend Yield 1.1582117211026175% Rev. per Employee 555936 More quote details and news » COST in Your Value Your Change Short position CEO Jim Sinegal is a prime illustration. Sinegal is proud that his stock has consistently maintained one of the highest price/earnings ratios in the retailing industry. Yet Costco is no slave to Wall Street. Sinegal's view is that if a company treats employees fairly and provides good value to customers, shareholders will benefit in the long run. When commodity prices started to decline in the fall, Costco moved to cut prices, even before its suppliers did. A popular item like rotisserie chickens, for instance, dropped by $1, to $4.99 -- and Costco sells a million of them each week in its 400 domestic stores. "It's easy to raise prices," Sinegal said last week. "It benefits you today, but will hurt you tomorrow" by alienating customers. Costco refuses to mark up the price of any product by more than 15%. THE BEST CEOS HAVE A passion for the job, and many of those on our list have been at it for a long time. The 73-year-old Sinegal, a Costco co-founder, says he "loves coming to work," despite a grueling travel schedule that takes him to nearly all of the 400 domestic stores once a year. Buffett has famously said that he "tap dances" to work every day. Apple aapl 0.619604566972988% Apple Inc.

While Jobs has been rightly criticized for being evasive about his health problems in the past year, he remains one of the most valuable CEOs on the planet. Apple comes up with a steady stream of innovative tech products, including, most recently, an iPod the size of a paper clip. The company has managed to create a cachet around a commodity product, the personal computer: Buyers pay as much as twice the price for a Macintosh relative to comparable PCs, which Apple mercilessly mocks in its clever TV ads. No wonder that Apple's market value of $90 billion is more than four times that of Dell's, which used to dominate Apple. One test of a great CEO is whether Wall Street greets a departure with displeasure or relief. Jobs is the ultimate CEO on that score. Apple shares probably will fall if he's unable to resume an active role as CEO in the summer, after his health-related leave of absence. The 78-year-old Buffett has been in good health, and Berkshire shareholders are hoping the Great One is able to run the show for at least another five years to take advantage of so many juicy investment opportunities.

CEO Larry Fink is viewed as one of the smartest and most capable executives in the field, and there is periodically speculation that he will leave to head a larger company. Fink was under consideration to succeed Stan O'Neal at Merrill Lynch in 2007 -- and luckily for him, he didn't get the job. The buzz on 56-year-old Fink is that while he loves BlackRock, a firm that he helped found 20 years ago, he may want the challenge and recognition that comes with a higher-profile position. If Fink wants to leave, there certainly are plenty of turnaround situations awaiting him in financial services. OUR LIST DOES COME WITH a caveat: Inclusion is no guarantee of continued success. The biggest embarrassment from the 2008 list was Fred Goodwin, the former CEO of Royal Bank of Scotland. The bank, once one of the largest in the world, has effectively been nationalized by the U.K. government after loan problems and a disastrous deal to buy ABN Amro. Known as Fred the Shred because of his cost-cutting zeal after the bank's many acquisitions, Goodwin has been shredded in the British media, and he got shown the door by his new boss -- an unhappy British government. Some of this year's CEOs may be risky bets, too. Consider Lakshmi Mittal of ArcelorMittal, the world's leading steel company. Mittal is a controversial choice because of the company's heavy debt after a series of acquisitions, but we are betting that Mittal can handle it. Not everyone is going to agree with our choices. We're bound to make some mistakes, and we welcome feedback. Let us know which CEOs we should add, drop or retain. For potential additions, we generally prefer larger companies with market values of at least a few billion dollars. Please e-mail your suggestions to editors@barrons.com.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures added 24 cents, or 0.5 percent, by 0305 GMT, but remained below the $50 mark pierced late last week, at $49.47 a barrel. Brent crude rose 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $51.86 per barrel. Traders said the gains were a counter-reaction to consecutive price drops in the previous six sessions. Despite Tuesdays increases, market sentiment has turned bearish, with Brent down 10 percent since late 2016 despite efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017 in order to tighten the market. Given that oil supplies remain at record highs despite the cuts, Stephen Schork of the Schork report said on Tuesday that "OPEC has failed miserably in its endeavour to balance the oil market". JPMorgan said in its latest weekly market note to clients that "it is evident that... crude markets are still struggling to clear (oversupply)." The bank said that it was closing its "August Brent long position at a loss." Indicating its cautious outlook, JPMorgan said that "crude markets are close to floating storage economics and (this) is a bearish sign for output price developments." Floating storage is a clear indicator of oversupplied markets. It is pursued when oil for immediate delivery is so much cheaper than that for future dispatch that it becomes profitable for traders to charter tankers to store it for later. JPMorgan said that in order to reduce the ongoing supply overhang, OPEC "will be forced to renew, and possibly deepen the agreement if they wish to keep prices much above $50 per barrel." Russia said on Monday that its oil output could climb to the highest rate in 30 years if OPEC and non-OPEC producers do not extend a supply reduction deal beyond June 30. Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows that Russian oil shipments, which exclude its pipeline exports, have already reached record highs of 5 million bpd in April, up 17 percent since December, before the cuts were officially implemented. While producers may hurt under the renewed slack in crude markets, consumers like refiners benefit as their production margins making fuels such as gasoline improve.

Continue Reading Below U.S. crude futures settled up 33 cents to $49.56 a barrel, breaking a streak that saw the benchmark lose 7.4 percent. Brent crude settled up 50 cents at $52.10 a barrel. Analysts forecast U.S. crude oil stocks to fall by 1.6 million barrels in the most recent week. The industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) is due to release its inventory figures at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT). The figures are a precursor to data from the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA). Brent is down about 5 percent since early December, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia agreed to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of the year. With oil supplies still around record highs, Stephen Schork of the Schork Report said on Tuesday that "OPEC has failed miserably in its endeavor to balance the oil market." Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT On Tuesday, the Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvokovich as saying Russia may increase oil production if it feels prices are unlikely to fall as a result. Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky said global crude loadings are at record levels. "We still see that continue to tick higher," Smith said. "Until we see the loadings drop, until we see the oil on the water falling, we are unlikely to see the market materially moving toward rebalancing." But Georgi Slavov, head of research at Marex Spectron, said he sees supply tightening over the next couple of weeks. More from FOXBusiness.com Tom Price on efforts to drive down drug prices The potential obstacles to Trump's tax reform plan North Korea looking for a fight with US? "It's important that this tightening is not only in the Arabian Gulf but also with Russian oil," he said, "Russia is not going to pump and export as much oil as they did in the last couple of weeks." Slavov also sees optimistic signs for the oil price in the weakening U.S. dollar, which has fallen more than 3 percent since early March. "You haven't priced it in yet, this is for sure." Slavov said, adding that the U.S. dollar's slide against a basket of other currencies "looks quite likely to persist, which in turn should help oil." The dollar was down about 0.3 percent on Tuesday.

US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures had added 14 cents, or 0.3 per cent, by 0640 GMT, but remained below the $50 mark pierced late last week, at $49.37 a barrel. Brent crude rose 14 cents, or 0.27 per cent, to $51.74 per barrel. Traders said the gains were a counter-reaction to consecutive price drops in the previous six sessions. Despite Tuesdays increases, market sentiment has turned bearish, with Brent down 10 per cent since late 2016 despite efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and Russia to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017 in order to tighten the market. Given that oil supplies remain at record highs despite the cuts, Stephen Schork of the Schork report said on Tuesday that "Opec has failed miserably in its endeavour to balance the oil market". JPMorgan said in its latest weekly market note to clients that "it is evident that... crude markets are still struggling to clear (oversupply)." The bank said that it was closing its "August Brent long position at a loss." Indicating its cautious outlook, JPMorgan said that "crude markets are close to floating storage economics and (this) is a bearish sign for output price developments." Floating storage is a clear indicator of oversupplied markets. It is pursued when oil for immediate delivery is so much cheaper than that for future dispatch that it becomes profitable for traders to charter tankers to store it for later. JPMorgan said that in order to reduce the ongoing supply overhang, Opec "will be forced to renew, and possibly deepen the agreement if they wish to keep prices much above $50 per barrel." Russia said on Monday that its oil output could climb to the highest rate in 30 years if Opec and non-Opec producers do not extend a supply reduction deal beyond June 30. Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows that Russian oil shipments, which exclude its pipeline exports, have already reached record highs of 5 million bpd in April, up 17 per cent since December, before the cuts were officially implemented. While producers may hurt under the renewed slack in crude markets, consumers like refiners benefit as their production margins making fuels such as gasoline improve.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures CLc1 added 21 cents, or 0.4 percent, by 0123 GMT, but remained below the $50 mark pierced late last week, at $49.44 a barrel. Brent crude futures LCOc1 rose 23 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $51.83 per barrel. Traders said the slight gains were a counter-reaction to consecutive price drops in the previous six sessions. Despite Tuesdays small price rises, overall market sentiment has turned bearish, with Brent down nearly 10 percent since the end of December despite an effort led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017 in order to tighten the market. "It is evident that ... crude markets are still struggling to clear (oversupply)," U.S. bank JPMorgan said in its latest weekly oil market update to clients. The bank said that it was closing its "August Brent long position at a loss," and that it "will review macro balances in the coming weeks before initiating further trades." Indicating that the bank's view on markets had turned bearish, JP Morgan said that "crude markets are close to floating storage economics and (this) is a bearish sign for output price developments." Floating storage is seen as a clear indicator of oversupplied markets. It is pursued when oil for immediate delivery is so much cheaper than that for future delivery that it becomes profitable for traders to charter tankers to store crude for sale at a later date. "There is further short-term downside to prices," JPMorgan said, adding that in order to reduce the ongoing supply overhang, OPEC "will be forced to renew, and possibly deepen the agreement if they wish to keep prices much above $50 per barrel." Russia said on Monday that its oil output could climb to the highest rate in 30 years if OPEC and non-OPEC producers do not extend a supply reduction deal beyond June 30. Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows that Russian oil shipments, which exclude its pipeline exports, have already reached record highs of 5 million bpd in April, up 17 percent since December, before the cuts were officially implemented.

By Julia Simon NEW YORK — Reuters Published Monday, Apr. 24, 2017 9:32PM EDT Last updated Tuesday, Apr. 25, 2017 6:15PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Oil prices settled slightly higher on Tuesday in volatile trading, then were mixed after hours when an industry group's preliminary report showed a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories. Oil prices seesawed throughout the day after falling sharply over the previous six sessions. Prices have been pressured as rising U.S. crude production has offset much of the output cuts by OPEC and other countries trying to reduce a global glut in crude. “We’ve seen rigs increase for the last 14 weeks and if we continue to see that it could put pressure on crude oil prices," said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors. Prices dipped after the market settled. The American Petroleum Institute said its data showed U.S. crude oil stocks rose 897,000 barrels in the latest week. Analysts had expected a draw of 1.6 million barrels. The API also said U.S. gasoline inventories increased. The market will watch closely Wednesday morning to see whether official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration confirms the API numbers. [EIA/S] U.S. crude futures <CLc1> settled up 33 cents to $49.56 a barrel, breaking a streak that saw the benchmark lose 7.4 percent. Brent crude <LCOc1> settled up 50 cents at $52.10 a barrel. Both crude contracts fell after the API report, but U.S. crude bounced back to its settlement price. The API said gasoline stocks rose 4.4 million barrels. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 1 million-barrel decline, as U.S. summer driving season approaches. "We're seeing less demand last week which could be allowing a build, and it could be furthering that as the weeks go on," Zahir said. Brent is down about 5 percent since early December, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia agreed to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of the year. On Tuesday, the Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvokovich as saying Russia may increase oil production. Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky noted that global crude loadings "continue to tick higher" and added that the glut probably will not abate "until we see the oil on the water falling." Georgi Slavov, head of research at Marex Spectron, said supply should tighten over the next couple of weeks, "not only in the Arabian Gulf but also with Russian oil. Russia is not going to pump and export as much oil as they did in the last couple of weeks."

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures added 24 cents, or 0.5 percent, by 0305 GMT, but remained below the $50 mark pierced late last week, at $49.47 a barrel. Brent crude rose 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $51.86 per barrel. Traders said the gains were a counter-reaction to consecutive price drops in the previous six sessions.

Given that oil supplies remain at record highs despite the cuts, Stephen Schork of the Schork report said on Tuesday that "OPEC has failed miserably in its endeavour to balance the oil market". JPMorgan said in its latest weekly market note to clients that "it is evident that... crude markets are still struggling to clear (oversupply)." The bank said that it was closing its "August Brent long position at a loss." Indicating its cautious outlook, JPMorgan said that "crude markets are close to floating storage economics and (this) is a bearish sign for output price developments."

By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices inched up on Tuesday but markets remain under pressure following six consecutive sessions of declines as traders lose confidence that pledged output cuts by major producers will rein in oversupply in a world awash with fuel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures added 24 cents, or 0.5 percent, by 0305 GMT, but remained below the $50 mark pierced late last week, at $49.47 a barrel. Brent crude rose 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $51.86 per barrel. Traders said the gains were a counter-reaction to consecutive price drops in the previous six sessions. Despite Tuesdays increases, market sentiment has turned bearish, with Brent down 10 percent since late 2016 despite efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017 in order to tighten the market. Given that oil supplies remain at record highs despite the cuts, Stephen Schork of the Schork report said on Tuesday that "OPEC has failed miserably in its endeavour to balance the oil market". JPMorgan said in its latest weekly market note to clients that "it is evident that... crude markets are still struggling to clear (oversupply)." The bank said that it was closing its "August Brent long position at a loss." Indicating its cautious outlook, JPMorgan said that "crude markets are close to floating storage economics and (this) is a bearish sign for output price developments." Floating storage is a clear indicator of oversupplied markets. It is pursued when oil for immediate delivery is so much cheaper than that for future dispatch that it becomes profitable for traders to charter tankers to store it for later. JPMorgan said that in order to reduce the ongoing supply overhang, OPEC "will be forced to renew, and possibly deepen the agreement if they wish to keep prices much above $50 per barrel." Russia said on Monday that its oil output could climb to the highest rate in 30 years if OPEC and non-OPEC producers do not extend a supply reduction deal beyond June 30. Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows that Russian oil shipments, which exclude its pipeline exports, have already reached record highs of 5 million bpd in April, up 17 percent since December, before the cuts were officially implemented.

Germany’s blue-chip DAX index jumped 3.4 per cent to end at a fresh record, while Paris climbed 4.1 per cent and London 2.1 per cent. Major US indices gained more than one per cent and the Nasdaq finished at a new record on large gains for Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and other tech giants. Banking stocks, in particular, took off, with some financials, like Societe Generale and Credit Agricole in Paris, posting double-digit intraday gains and US names like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America winning more than three per cent. Investors globally had been fearful that a wave of populism, which swept US President Donald Trump into the White House and saw Britain vote to leave the EU, could lead to a win for the anti-European Le Pen and put the future of the bloc in doubt. However, Macron is widely expected to gallop to victory over the divisive National Front leader and traders gave a huge thumbs-up. The euro shot higher to trade above US$1.09 (RM4.79) at one point, compared with US$1.0726 on Friday. “European markets are in a buoyant mood,” said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG trading group. “The move back into risk assets means the chief losers have been the likes of gold and the Japanese yen, with stock markets moving sharply higher.” The price of safe-haven gold fell by more than one per cent on the day. ·      But will it last? -Some cautioned that the party mood may fizzle out by the time of the second round vote in two weeks, followed by a parliamentary vote in June.   “Our optimism is a bit muted,” said Stefan Kreuzkamp at CIO Deutsche Asset Management. “A lot depends on the outcome of the parliamentary election and how this outcome supports Macron’s mandate.” Macron, a political neophyte despite serving as a government minister, has no established political organization behind him and no seats in parliament. Oil had another volatile day as investors mulled the chances of OPEC extending an output cut agreement beyond June. After a firmer start, the oil price fell back into negative territory on selling by traders doubting that any extension, if agreed, would actually soak up the current glut on oil markets.

(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co's directors face an unusual and difficult task after shareholders rebuffed most of them: reformulating the board in a way that satisfies investors without causing more chaos. Chairman Stephen Sanger said no directors will step down immediately, even after a dozen fell short of a traditional threshold of shareholder confidence at the bank's dramatic annual meeting on Tuesday. But sources said some directors nearing a mandatory retirement age may speed up plans to leave, as the board begins a gradual turnover. The results were uniformly described as devastating: only three directors received solid support and four, including Sanger, squeaked by with just 53 to 57 percent of votes cast, according to the bank's preliminary tally. Some investors who voted against directors told Reuters their intention was not to get them ousted immediately, but to signal dissatisfaction with the bank's response to a scandal involving thousands of employees creating as many as 2.1 million unauthorised customer accounts. Even so, several shareholder elections experts called the vote tally unprecedented, especially at a company the size of Wells Fargo, and predicted it would spur change. "These numbers are more than not good, they're reflective of an overwhelming rejection of the directors," said Columbia Law School professor Robert Jackson, who studies corporate governance. Jackson expects at least a few directors step down in a month or two, much like two directors left JPMorgan Chase & Co after winning narrow majorities in 2013. He expects Sanger to be replaced by a colleague who garnered more support. "When 44 percent of investors don't like your work, then the question of whether he will step down isn't 'if' but 'when,'" Jackson said. There are not many examples that compare to Wells Fargo's situation. After the 2008 financial crisis, the boards of Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc were refashioned under the eye of federal regulators who wanted more directors with banking experience. But those changes came with checks and balances from the U.S. government. Typically, the board's governance and nominating committee would handle director changes. But only one director on that committee received a vote of high confidence, potentially putting members in the awkward position of picking their own replacements. Six of Wells Fargo's directors will reach a mandatory retirement age in the next four years, including Sanger, who turns 72 next year. A person familiar with board discussions said some of those retirements are likely to happen sooner. The three directors in good stead with shareholders all joined the board in recent months, indicating investors may welcome new additions with the right expertise. Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended shareholders vote against the dozen who received tepid support. Kevin McManus, vice president at Egan-Jones Proxy Services, said directors should not be caught off guard by the outcome of Tuesday's vote. "They might not be able to leave at once," he said, but "hopefully they've already planned for this possibility."

Almost twenty years ago, Sony’s profits were boosted by the launch of the original PlayStation followed by hit software including Metal Gear Solid, according to Bloomberg’s latest report. Preliminary operating profit for the fiscal year through March 2017 was 19 percent higher than company projections, amounting to 285 billion yen ($2.6 billion). Net income was also expected to be twice the previous forecast, totaling 73 billion yen. As a result, JP Morgan Chase & Co. improved Sony’s stock rating while analysts from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. among many others believe that the company can achieve an operating profit of 500 billion yen. This is the second year in a row that Sony’s profits have topped $2 billion and also happens to be longest streak of it since 2001. On April 28, the company is expected to release forecasts for the fiscal year that began this month.

Chairman Stephen Sanger said no directors will step down immediately, even after a dozen fell short of a traditional threshold of shareholder confidence at the bank's dramatic annual meeting on Tuesday. But sources said some directors nearing a mandatory retirement age may speed up plans to leave, as the board begins a gradual turnover. The results were uniformly described as devastating: only three directors received solid support and four, including Sanger, squeaked by with just 53 to 57 percent of votes cast, according to the bank's preliminary tally. Some investors who voted against directors told Reuters their intention was not to get them ousted immediately, but to signal dissatisfaction with the bank's response to a scandal involving thousands of employees creating as many as 2.1 million unauthorized customer accounts. Even so, several shareholder elections experts called the vote tally unprecedented, especially at a company the size of Wells Fargo, and predicted it would spur change. "These numbers are more than not good, they're reflective of an overwhelming rejection of the directors," said Columbia Law School professor Robert Jackson, who studies corporate governance. Jackson expects at least a few directors step down in a month or two, much like two directors left JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> after winning narrow majorities in 2013. He expects Sanger to be replaced by a colleague who garnered more support. "When 44 percent of investors don't like your work, then the question of whether he will step down isn't 'if' but 'when,'" Jackson said. There are not many examples that compare to Wells Fargo's situation. After the 2008 financial crisis, the boards of Bank of America Corp <B.ACN> and Citigroup Inc <C.N> were refashioned under the eye of federal regulators who wanted more directors with banking experience. But those changes came with checks and balances from the U.S. government. Typically, the board's governance and nominating committee would handle director changes. But only one director on that committee received a vote of high confidence, potentially putting members in the awkward position of picking their own replacements. Six of Wells Fargo's directors will reach a mandatory retirement age in the next four years, including Sanger, who turns 72 next year. A person familiar with board discussions said some of those retirements are likely to happen sooner. The three directors in good stead with shareholders all joined the board in recent months, indicating investors may welcome new additions with the right expertise. Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended shareholders vote against the dozen who received tepid support. Kevin McManus, vice president at Egan-Jones Proxy Services, said directors should not be caught off guard by the outcome of Tuesday's vote. "They might not be able to leave at once," he said, but "hopefully they've already planned for this possibility."

Not for release in the United States. ANY SECURITIES REFERRED TO HEREIN WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE “1933 ACT”) AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES OR TO A U.S. PERSON IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE 1933 ACT. Universal Ventures Inc. (the “Corporation” or “Universal”) (TSXV:UN) is pleased to announce that it has executed a binding agreement (the “Binding Agreement”) dated April 21, 2017 with mCloud Corp. (“mCloud”), a private company incorporated pursuant to the laws of Delaware, pursuant to which Universal will acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of mCloud (the “Transaction”). Upon completion, the Transaction will constitute a reverse take-over of Universal by mCloud, with the resulting company to be renamed “Universal mCloud Inc.” (the “Resulting Issuer”). Universal and mCloud are at arm’s length to each other. Prior to the closing of the Transaction, mCloud will complete the acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of Field Diagnostic Services, Inc. (“FDSI”), a Delaware corporation engaged in the business of providing enterprise HVAC software and services designed to optimize energy efficiency and reduce energy and maintenance costs. Immediately following the completion of the FDSI Acquisition, the parties are to proceed with the Transaction on the basis that mCloud will have an enterprise value of approximately US$12 million (the “Valuation”). Upon closing of the Transaction, the resulting issuer will be a Tier 2 Technology issuer. “We believe that combining with mCloud will create a game-changing company with excellent growth potential in the industrial energy software space”, said Harry Katevatis, Chief Executive Officer of Universal. “mCloud offers leading edge solutions that combine the latest cloud-based solutions and mobile augmented reality to leverage accurate and secure deep analytics”, said Russel McMeekin, Chief Executive Officer of mCloud. “In addition, we have a very robust pipeline of potential complimentary acquisitions that we believe are best executed via this combination with Universal and its efficient capital structure. mCloud's team has extensive experience in acquisitions of a wide range of size and complexity of companies. We intend to be the 'first stop shop' for entrepreneurial high-growth industrial cloud software companies that are seeking to be part of mCloud's AssetCare™ suite of cloud solutions to realize maximum shareholder value”. Information on mCloud mCloud, a San Francisco, California company with a technology center in Vancouver, British Columbia, provides AssetCare™ solutions for managing critical assets with secure mobile technology, deep analytics, machine-to-machine learning and support for field service technicians. mCloud currently targets complex distributed energy assets such as high-intensity HVAC units, mid-size wind energy turbines and natural gas compressors.

AssetCare™ makes it easy to use and analyze the full breadth of asset information.

To facilitate the Transaction, Universal will consolidate its outstanding common shares on a 2:1 basis prior to the completion of Transaction.

Upon completion of the Transaction, CDN$200,000 in existing debt of Universal, together with the parties' Transaction costs, will be repaid from cash on hand and the proceeds of the Private Placement (as defined below). Private Placement Financing Subject to the satisfaction of applicable conditions, mCloud intends to complete a private placement (the “Private Placement” of shares of common stock of mCloud (the “mCloud Private Placement” at a price of CDN $0.55 (the “Offering Price”) to raise aggregate gross proceeds of up to CDN$5,000,000. Each mCloud Private Placement Share will ultimately be exchanged for one post-consolidated common share of Universal as part of the Transaction. mCloud expects to engage a syndicate of agents to act on a commercially reasonable efforts basis for the Private Placement, and in connection therewith intends to pay cash commission and/or broker warrants of mCloud to the agents in amounts to be determined. The completion of the Transaction, including the Private Placement, is conditional on obtaining all necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals in connection with the matters described above and other conditions customary for a transaction of this type, including completion of due diligence by each party to the Transaction.

Brent crude was up 23 cents at $51.83 a barrel by 1:17 p.m. EST (1717 GMT), while U.S. crude futures rose 12 cents to $49.35 a barrel. Analysts polled ahead of inventory reports from the industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) and the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated, on average, that U.S. crude stocks fell 1.6 million barrels last week, the third consecutive weekly draw. The API data is due at 4:30 p.m. EDT. Brent is down about 5 percent since early December, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia agreed to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of the year. With oil supplies still around record highs, Stephen Schork of the Schork report said on Tuesday that "OPEC has failed miserably in its endeavour to balance the oil market." Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky said global crude loadings are at record levels. "We still see that continue to tick higher," Smith said. "Until we see the loadings drop, until we see the oil on the water falling, we are unlikely to see the market materially moving toward rebalancing." Russia said on Monday its oil output could climb to the highest rate in 30 years if OPEC and non-OPEC producers do not extend their supply reduction deal beyond June 30. And on Tuesday, the Interfax news agency quoted Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvokovich as saying Russia may increase oil production if it feels prices are unlikely to fall as a result. To reduce the supply overhang, JPMorgan said OPEC "will be forced to renew, and possibly deepen the agreement if they wish to keep prices much above $50 per barrel." But ClipperData's Smith said there was a lot of posturing ahead of the May 25 meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC producers. "We have a month before the meeting in Vienna," he said, "Between now and then we're going to get a lot of contrasting rhetoric." SEB commodities strategist Bjarne Schieldrop said the current climate will be uncertain until the May 25 meeting. "It doesn't make sense to sell down to $45 ahead of that," he said.

Read More. Follow @matt_levine April 25, 2017 9:28 AM EDT a | A By Matt Levine Corporate access. How much should investors pay to talk to corporate executives? While corporate access has long been the subject of scrutiny over whether it gives some investors an unfair edge, it’s seen as a useful way for executives to explain their strategy and for asset managers to get a better sense of a company than filings can provide. The stakes are high: Rusling estimates that a one-on-one meeting with a big name CEO could be worth as much as $20,000. Well, look. If it's a way for companies to explain their strategy, the companies should be willing to pay to do it. (In fact they are, a little: Adrian Rusling's company/investor matchmaking service, CorporateAccessNetwork, "charges companies 100 euros ($108) a month to use a premium version of its web-based platform to set up meetings.") If it's a way for asset managers to get a better sense of the company, they should be willing to pay for it. (In fact they are, a lot: "Investors globally spend more than $2 billion a year for corporate access, according to consulting firm Greenwich Associates.") If it's a mutually beneficial relationship in which companies get to explain themselves to their owners and owners get to learn about companies, then the market-clearing price should be around zero. Maybe one side or the other pays a bit for the matchmaking technology, fine. But if you are paying $20,000 for a meeting, the contents of that meeting are not a mutually beneficial exchange. The mutually beneficial exchange is: You get the contents of the meeting, and the other guy gets the money. Or, I mean, someone gets the money. Traditionally the way it works is that investment bank research departments set up these meetings and capture the money. The companies get ... something ... from the banks. (They get better analyst ratings, is what they get, though you're not supposed to say that. Also they get to meet with investors and explain their strategy.) The banks, meanwhile, don't get paid anything for setting up the meetings. Instead, they get paid commissions for executing trades, which pays for the banks' research function, which sets up the meetings. There are inefficiencies and conflicts at every step of that process, and, strangely, regulation might fix them. Europe's MiFID II rules, which require investors to pay explicitly for research rather than subsidizing it through trading commissions, also require investors to pay for research and corporate access separately. That has encouraged independent corporate-access matchmakers, which have some advantages for issuers. "I can trust that he’s going to reach out to not only the fast-money hedge funds, which typically pay a lot of commissions, but also the holders FedEx would prefer: long-term holders,” says a FedEx Corp. investor-relations employee about Rusling. People who pay for corporate access with trading commissions are not necessarily the people whom companies want to meet. And better analyst ratings are not necessarily the currency in which companies want to get paid. A regulatory system that encourages companies to give access to the investors they want as shareholders -- and to be rewarded with better shareholders, rather than better research coverage or more trading -- seems like an improvement for the companies. It's not obviously an improvement for market efficiency; companies might prefer meetings with credulous lazy investors instead of sharp critical ones. But it's not like they're wasting corporate access on short sellers now.  Aramco. A crucial part of the job of a capital markets banker is: You meet with the chief executive officer of a private company. He tells you that he wants to do an initial public offering, and that his company is worth $2 billion. "At least!," you chime in enthusiastically. You get the IPO mandate, because he believes that you believe in that $2 billion valuation, and are the banker best suited to achieving it. The IPO prices at a $1 billion valuation. He is happy. This is not an easy job! It is not primarily about financial analysis, or even investor targeting and marketing. It is a job of client psychology. You have to gently introduce your client, who has lived his whole life with his private company, and who believes absolutely in its value, to the harsh realities of the public market. You have to persuade him that you are his guide and ally in this journey, not a cold unfeeling representative of the market yourself. And you have to leave him satisfied that the market's conclusion is rational and that he's better off in the public markets, even at a valuation way below what he wanted. Anyway Saudi Arabian Oil Co.'s bankers, and employees, are facing a similar problem except that instead of billions it's trillions: The country’s deputy crown prince, who is leading a push to overhaul the economy, has pegged the value of the company known as Saudi Aramco at $2 trillion. But officials working on the deal have struggled to come up with a scenario under which Saudi Aramco is worth more than $1.5 trillion, according to people familiar with the matter, even after factoring in a recent tax cut and other tools the government has to make it more attractive investors. Oops! Such is life. I am just going to skip ahead to the bankers' next problem: Also, the remaining Aramco shares in Saudi hands would be less valuable than the prince forecasts, lowering the amount of money the kingdom could borrow against those shares to fund economic diversification. Borrow against the shares? The plan is to float about 5 percent of the company -- $75 billion at that $1.5 trillion valuation -- and leave the rest, for now, in the hands of the Saudi government. How much would you lend against that $1.4 trillion private stub? How much do you think the deputy crown prince will want his banks to lend? My guess is that those numbers will also differ by at least 12 digits. I do not envy the bankers in charge of negotiating the largest and strangest margin loan in history. Requests for activists. Here's a story about how Neuberger Berman likes to get activists to do expensive risky difficult work for it: Last year it campaigned for change at another company in which it had invested, the technology company Ultratech. It secured two board seats, but the process, Mr. Amato said, was “in all honesty expensive and time-consuming.” In the case of Whole Foods, Neuberger Berman lobbied for the activists to do the messy work of battling the company in public. What's in it for the activists? The difficulty of activist investing is that if you buy 5 percent of a company's stock, mount an expensive proxy campaign, win, improve the company's operations, and end up adding a billion dollars in value, you only get to capture $50 million of it. You are constantly being under-compensated for the value you add. Of course it can be to your advantage to cultivate big traditional institutional investors: They have votes, and legitimacy, and if you are frequently mounting proxy fights it is helpful to have big shareholders who owe you favors. Still it seems like an uneven exchange. Elsewhere in activism: "Arconic Delays Annual Meeting, Considers Adding Two Elliott Directors." A scheme. This is sort of a slick scheme. Kevin Amell, an options portfolio manager at Eaton Vance Management, would have his fund sell some options. These were listed options with very wide bid/ask spreads: Market makers might bid to buy the options for $15.00, and offer to sell them at $17.00. If you wanted to sell, you could come into the market with a market order and get $15.00 from the market makers. Amell would instead offer to buy the options in his personal account for $15.05, and then have the fund sell them at $15.05. So he made the fund an extra 5 cents, versus the national best bid.  Then he'd go and sell those same options, from his personal account, for like $15.80, clipping a 75-cent profit for himself. (These numbers are illustrative but in the right ballpark.) The Securities and Exchange Commission's complaint has a diagram: The SEC calls Amell's trades with the fund "pre-arranged trades," but they all happened through public orders on the exchange. The intuition is that if you are an options market maker, and the spread is $15.00 to $17.00, you might see fair value at $16.00. If someone (Amell) comes into the market with a $15.05 bid, you don't do anything. And then if someone (Eaton Vance) comes into the market with a market sell order, they're going to sell to that $15.05 bid (Amell's). On the other hand, if someone (Amell) comes into the market with a $15.80 limit sell order, some market maker is going to find that attractive enough to take the other side (to buy below fair value). So buying at just above the best bid, and selling at just below the midpoint, was a viable strategy for Amell.  This did not work out especially well for Amell. He made "at least $1.95 million" doing it over about two years, but then he was caught and pleaded guilty to criminal fraud. He agreed to turn over the $1.95 million; prosecutors have "agreed to recommend a sentence of no greater than 27 months in prison."  Still I can't resist thinking that it's a slick scheme. Amell performed the traditional function of a market maker for his fund: He provided liquidity by trading with the fund at the national best bid; in fact, he gave the fund some price improvement over the best bid in the market. And then he took the risk of getting out of the position: If there had been no buyers at the midpoint, and the price had moved against him, he'd have lost money. That's what the bid/ask spread is: compensation for market makers to take the risk of providing liquidity to people who want to buy or sell immediately. It's a perfectly legitimate trading strategy. Just: Not if you run the fund! Market makers trade for their own account, as arms-length counterparties to investors who want to buy or sell. They provide a valuable service, but it's not a fiduciary service. They want to buy as low as possible, and the investors want to sell as high as possible; a mutually beneficial deal can be worked out, but the market maker is not acting in the investor's best interests. A fund manager had better be acting in his fund's best interests.  Goldman's quarter. Why did Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have a rough time in fixed income, currencies and commodities last quarter? I tend to think of bank trading activities as weighted random number generators; if you watch them long enough, they should be profitable, but any small sample will probably be above or below the long-term expected value. This is a boring structural explanation, though, that doesn't have much to say about any particular quarter. If you want the particular coin flips that went wrong, you can sometimes find them: Traders got burned by a constellation of souring debts tied to a coal-mining giant and struggling mall retailers, as well as wagers linked to the U.S. dollar, according to people familiar with the matter. The bank incurred tens of millions of dollars in losses on companies including Peabody Energy Corp. and Energy Future Holdings Corp. Borrowings from retailers including Rue 21 Inc., Gymboree Corp. and Claire’s Stores Inc. also stung, the people said. "We could have done a better job navigating the market," shrugged Goldman Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez. (Disclosure: I used to work at Goldman.) My Bloomberg View colleague Lisa Abramowicz argues that Goldman's rough quarter is a good argument against the repeal of the Volcker Rule: Goldman skates closer to the line on taking large speculative trading positions than its rivals do, and those positions seem to have hurt it this quarter. Maybe. But the weird thing about post-crisis invocations of the Volcker Rule is how the intent seems to have changed. When the Volcker Rule was first proposed, it was viewed as a way to reduce the risk of systemic financial crises. Later -- in the JPMorgan Chase & Co. London Whale debacle, for instance -- the goal was to prevent large banks from losing a lot of money, even though the London Whale losses probably posed no systemic risk. Banks are supposed to be boring now, and even non-systemic big losses need to be regulated away. Now, Goldman had a disappointing quarter. But it made money! Net revenue was $8.03 billion; net income was $2.26 billion; FICC trading net revenue was $1.7 billion. That was "about $340 million below estimates and barely higher than a year earlier," but it's still positive. If the justification for the Volcker Rule is now that it will prevent banks from making less money than analysts' estimates, then that is a pretty weak justification. Failed bank alumni clubs. Speaking of systemic risk, what do you do about the fact that people who worked at failed banks seem kind of proud of it? Psychologists say that forging such connections is a natural way for humans to respond to high-stress situations such as combat or being held hostage. But a bank failure? “It’s surprising,” says Frank Ochberg, a psychiatry professor at Michigan State University and expert on post-traumatic stress disorder. Failed-bank devotees say outsiders wouldn’t understand. “There’s a very strong loyalty because of that,” says Ms. Ensor. One former Washington Mutual employee "lost half her retirement savings when WaMu failed, but she still adores it." Regulators talk a lot about changing banking culture by clawing back bonuses and so forth, but what if that just increases the all-in-it-together romance of working at a bank that explodes? Really they should ban failed-bank reunions, and selling memorabilia on eBay. How rich are Renaissance Technologies executives? So rich! Here's a Bloomberg calculation that estimates that two -- founder James Simons and Henry Laufer -- are multibillionaires, while two others -- co-CEOs Robert Mercer and Peter Brown -- are at least very close to being billionaires. If and when they are billionaires, Renaissance "will have created more billionaires than any other hedge fund." The best part about being a Renaissance billionaire is that the firm has sort of moved past the concept of "skin in the game." Its main Medallion fund is closed to outside investors and capped at about $10 billion, meaning that when it generates big profits year after year, the partners cash out the profits instead of leaving them tied up in the fund. Usually, if you are a successful hedge fund manager, the better your fund does, the greater the percentage of your net worth will be tied up in the fund. With Medallion it's the reverse. Though I guess if you have a perpetual-motion profit machine you might be sad that you can't put more money into it. Latency. If you are interested in latency arbitrage and colocation and front-running, well, here is an article about video-game server latency: He had to learn how to “see into the future,” he said, and predict and input moves in advance. Elento likens the scenario to that of a football player, but “instead of being a regular football player, he has to close his eyes for a quarter of a second for every second, and he has to judge all of his decisions based on information he knew before, and he has to just plug in the information for the last quarter of a second.” Of course you can solve this problem via colocation: "That’s partly why all the big tournaments — the ones where the winning team gets cash prizes of over $1 million — happen in big stadiums, and in person." But if you live in Hawaii, colocating near the "League of Legends" game servers in Chicago may not be that appealing. Harvard. Here is an amusing description of Harvard Business School, from a Wall Street Journal review of Duff McDonald's book, "The Golden Passport": When America’s corporations floated out of World War II on an ocean of cash, the wise men of Harvard decided that management was all about creating vast, technocratic amoebas that could swallow any business in their path. When Wall Street began to eat those amoebas for lunch, they suddenly realized that management was all about maximizing shareholder value. People are worried about unicorns. Here we are dealing in sub-unicorns, but my excuse is that they are funny sub-unicorns. First, Yik Yak is getting partially acqui-hired: Square Inc. acquired the engineering team of Yik Yak, according to a person familiar with the matter, marking the decline of the once-popular anonymous social network. The payments processor paid less than $3 million for between five and ten of Yik Yak’s engineers, according to the person. Atlanta-based Yik Yak’s Chief Executive Officer Tyler Droll will not join Square, the person added, asking not to be identified talking about a private matter. Yik Yak reached a $400 million valuation at its peak, but is now being sold for parts at a fraction of that valuation. Elsewhere in amusing sub-unicorns and their parts, Ben Einstein took apart a Juicero Inc. juice squeezer to find out why it's so expensive. The answer seems to be that venture capitalists gave Juicero too much money: Our usual advice to hardware founders is to focus on getting a product to market to test the core assumptions on actual target customers, and then iterate. Instead, Juicero spent $120M over two years to build a complex supply chain and perfectly engineered product that is too expensive for their target demographic. Don't miss the diagram explaining how Ellen Huet's hands squeeze a bag of juice a lot more efficiently than the $400 Juicero. Things happen. Trump Tax Plan Said to Call for Corporate Rate Cut to 15%.

The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up In the green corner are stocks. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index is just 0.2 percent away from a record high reached in March on bets that Donald Trump’s administration will push through tax-code changes to spark growth. In the red corner sit U.S. government bonds, where benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have unwound almost half of their post-election increase, suggesting a far more pessimistic view the economy. “The increasing divergence between global equity market performance and bond markets has raised questions as to whom is right,” Jefferies Group LLC analysts led by Sean Darby wrote in a note. Figuring out which market will be on the right side of history is a pressing issue for analysts, investors and traders. If government bonds prove correct, risk appetite may soon vanish; if the optimism displayed by stocks and corporate bonds is vindicated, then interest-rate markets are likely to sell off in coming months, according to strategists. The issue is gaining added urgency as Trump nears his 100th day as president with plans to unveil Wednesday a proposal to lower the corporate rate to 15 percent. Optimism that the new U.S. administration would deliver tax cuts and boost corporate earnings may account for the resilience of bullish equity sentiment, according to strategists at Rabobank International. “The post-election jump in stocks could at least in part have been due to this mechanistic response rather than an optimistic view of the future,” strategists led by Richard Macguire wrote in a note. A cut in the corporate tax rate would automatically boost earnings per share, justifying an advance in stock prices, they argue. Still, interest-rate markets are flashing warning signals. Money markets such as the London interbank offered rate and interest rate swaps, for instance, show some alarm over growth prospects next year, according to Bank of America Corp. “The rates market is pricing in the death of tax reform and dimming 2018 economic prospects,” strategists led by Shyam Rajan wrote in a note to clients. Technical factors may explain the recent rally in both Treasuries and risk assets, suggesting the divergence in the economic signals sent by the asset classes isn’t as stark as it looks on the surface. For example, hedging by options traders and investors with mortgage books may account for dips in long-dated government bond yields in recent weeks, analysts say. What’s more, earnings-per-share forecasts for the S&P 500 are rising faster than estimates for first-quarter nominal expansion of the U.S. economy, a factor that has driven the outperformance of stocks over government bonds this year. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. expect the U.S. grew 4.1 percent on a non-inflation-adjusted basis. Meanwhile, the outcome of the first round of voting in the French presidential elections has given rise to a widespread relief rally on the view that geopolitical risk is diminishing. “It may be that bond markets were more worried about Le Pen, and the Treasury rally reflected flight to quality out of Italian bonds,” says Jim Leaviss, a fund manager at M&G Investments who says he is vexed by the inconsistent market signals this month. What’s more, the outperformance of small capitalization stocks -- which tend to be more domestically focused than their large-cap peers -- has eased since late February, highlighting that equities, to some extent, are pricing in less enthusiasm over U.S. growth. But others say that the conflicting messages being sent by stocks and corporate bond spreads, on the one hand, and Treasuries, on the other, can’t continue. JPMorgan analysts led by Eric Beinstein reckon the difference has become “extreme,” and that corporate spreads will likely widen. At Rabobank, strategists have a starker warning: Treasury valuations suggest “increased certainty that Trump will have trouble in bringing about meaningful changes.” As bellwethers for economic sentiment, both risk markets and Treasuries can’t be right -- highlighting the high stakes for markets as the U.S. administration gears up to unveil its tax proposals.

Ogg April 25, 2017 9:00 am EDT Print Email Tweet Stocks were putting in a second day of big gains, but rather than being a French cheer it was due to multiple Dow components posting strong earnings. Even though this bull market is now more than eight years old, investors have found reason after reason to step in and buy the market sell-offs. Investors are also still looking for new trading and investing ideas. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each day of the week in an effort to find new ideas for our readers. Some of the key analyst reports cover stocks to buy, and other reports cover stocks to sell or to avoid. Color has been added on many of the following calls, and the consensus analyst price targets referenced are from Thomson Reuters. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Tuesday, April 25, 2017: Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) was downgraded to Market Perform from Outperform at Raymond James. Amazon closed up 1% at $907.41 and was indicated down 0.2% at $905.50 on Tuesday. American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) was raised to Buy from Neutral by Guggenheim. Shares closed up 1.1% at $80.45 on Monday and were indicated up 0.75% at $81.05 on Tuesday. Amex has a 52-week trading range of $57.15 to $82.00, and it has a consensus analyst target price of $81.60. Best Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE: BBY) was raised to Buy from Neutral and the price objective was raised to $58 from $46 (versus a $51.15 prior close) at Merrill Lynch. Best Buy has a 52-week range of $28.76 to $51.42, and its shares are indicated to open at a new 52-week high of $52.50 on Tuesday. General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) was downgraded to Neutral from Buy and the price objective was cut to $31 from $35 at Merrill Lynch. What is odd here is that Merrill Lynch was very positive in its flash-report after GE’s earnings. The firm now feels that investors should move to the sidelines as expectations are still too high for 2018. GE’s 52-week range is $28.19 to $33.00. Its shares were indicated down 0.6% at $29.37. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) was raised to Buy from Neutral at Guggenheim. It closed up 3.5% at $87.50 on Monday and was indicated up 0.9% higher at $88.25 on Tuesday. The 52-week range is $57.05 to $93.98. Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC) was raised to Neutral from Sell at Guggenheim. Wells Fargo closed up 1.2% at $53.65 on Monday and was indicated up 0.7% at $54.04. It has a 52-week range of $43.55 to $59.99. Other key analyst calls were seen in the following: America Movil SAB de C.V. (NASDAQ: AMOV) was raised to Hold from Sell at Deutsche Bank.

(NYSE: LFC) was downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Merrill Lynch. The firm believes the coming capital injection to China Guangfa Bank could be an overhang for China Life’s share price. Conagra Brands Inc. (NYSE: CAG) was downgraded to Sell from Neutral with a $35 price target (versus a $40.93 close) at UBS. Digi International Inc. (NASDAQ: DGII) was started as Buy and assigned a $16 price target (versus a $12.00 close) at Benchmark Securities. Gartner Inc. (NYSE: IT) was started as Neutral and assigned a $115 price target (versus a $113.42 close) at Goldman Sachs. GasLog Ltd.

"We're inviting techonomic thinkers to join us for either one or both of two days – Techonomy Health first, and then Techonomy NYC on May 17." Techonomy Health explores the vast potential tech holds to remake this $3 trillion U.S. industry. The program includes healthcare experts, technologists, policy makers and entrepreneurs for a high-energy discussion around topics including how AI and CRISPR will change the war on cancer, the future of consumer health information and media, the ethical and moral quandaries of enhancing the human genome, and what Trumpcare and Obamacare mean for health innovation. Speakers include Len Greer, President, Johnson & Johnson Health and Wellness; Meredith Guerriero, director for the healthcare industry at Facebook; Arianna Huffington, Founder and CEO, Thrive Global; John Mattison, Chief Medical Information Officer, Kaiser Permanente; celebrated author and holistic medicine expert Dean Ornish; Claudia González Romo, Executive Office of the Secretary General, UNICEF; Oscar CEO Mario Schlosser; Brent Shafer, CEO of Philips North America; and Steven Zatz, CEO of WebMD. (Full list below.) The following day, Techonomy NYC will be a New York-style version of Techonomy’s longstanding retreat in California, where last fall Mark Zuckerberg famously spoke about fake news. Techonomy NYC will ignite invigorating discourse around ongoing challenges relating to what a government led by Trump means for technology; the future of work in an on-demand gig economy; the digital and social fight against terrorism; and tough-to-answer questions about decision making power in an AI world, among many other topics.

Yet Goldman Sachs is now asking prospective employees to come out as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender right when they apply for the job. After the typical questions about a job applicant's gender and race, Goldman Sachs(gs) asks candidates to indicate their sexual orientation via a drop-down menu including the choices bisexual, gay man, gay woman, heterosexual, lesbian, other, and "prefer not to say." Following that, the application also queries: "Please indicate if you identify as Transgender." Goldman's questions—neither of which typically pop up in polite conversation—may seem shocking at first. But it has a reason for asking. " We ask for this data because we want to keep ourselves accountable," says Anilu Vazquez-Ubarri, Goldman's chief diversity officer and global head of talent. In other words, she says, the bank wants to make sure it is not unfairly discriminating against LGBT applicants. Under Equal Employment Opportunity Commission rules first implemented in 1978, major employers are required to track their job applicants and employees' nationality, race, and gender (though applicants are free to withhold the information). While the data is not part of hiring decisions, it can be used in employment discrimination cases that arise. The EEOC, however, does not mandate tracking of LGBT status, though it says federal discrimination protections extend to that community—even if the law does not explicitly say so. But Goldman, whose benefits package covers sex reassignment surgery, decided to start measuring its own LGBT inclusivity roughly a year ago. Its method is similar to that of the commission: First, it asks candidates to self-identify. Then, it removes the data from the resume and interview process. Finally, after the hires have been made, Goldman checks if the proportion of LGBT applicants is reflected in the eventual group hired. toshibaToshiba Is Replacing Its Auditor PwC Over Irreconcilable Differences North CarolinaNorth Carolina Repeals Transgender Bathroom Law LGBTNorth Carolina Nears Repeal of Controversial Bathroom Bill IndonesiaLGBT Discrimination Is Costing Indonesia $12 Billion a Year, Study Says beauty and the beastDisney Is Releasing ‘Beauty and the Beast’ in Malaysia With Its ‘Gay Moment’ Intact 50 Best Workplaces for DiversityYou Can Now Use Yelp to Find Gender-Neutral Restrooms PoliticsTrump Rolls Back Transgender Bathroom Guidelines For Schools PoliticsThe Trump Administration’s Latest Announcement Has Alarmed LGBT Groups Across the Country While the bank isn't seeking to hit a specific target at the moment, it is hoping to increase its percentage of LGBT employees, which it plans to track on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis. "It is a competitive market. If we don’t do that outreach, it is possible that we have left the best candidate on the table," says Vazquez-Ubarri. The bank also actively reaches out to LGBT groups on university campuses in a bid to bolster its diversity. "Hopefully, this will become a part of what everyone does." Employers now have an imperative to demonstrate that their values match those of the younger generations just starting their careers and entering the workforce. The majority of Millennials and Gen-Zs now support LGBT rights, which means that big companies such as Goldman have to step in line if they want to stay an attractive workplace, said Deena Fidas, director of the workplace equality program at the Human Rights Campaign. Indeed, 89% of Fortune 500 companies have policies prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, while 66% ban discrimination based on gender identity, according to the Human Rights Campaign. So far, Goldman Sachs is the only bank queried by Fortune to have included such questions on its job application. Its fellow banks including J.P. Morgan Chase (jpm), Morgan Stanley (ms), Citigroup (c), HSBC (hsbc), Wells Fargo (wfc), and Bank of America (bac), have all stuck with the traditional script. None ask about sexuality, and most gave users the choices of "male," "female," or some variation of "do not wish to disclose" for gender. Wells Fargo only allows its applicants to choose either male or female, or leave the section blank. Related Most Powerful WomenMuseums Are Collecting Women’s March Signs as Historical Artifacts Most Powerful Women Museums Are Collecting Women’s March Signs as Historical Artifacts By law, job applicants may of course choose to not answer the questions. Still, all those banks, regardless of whether they ask about it on their application forms, keep track of their employees' sexual orientation through internal questionnaires later on. One bank, HSBC, has begun allowing its customers to pick from a variety of gender neutral prefixes such as 'Mx,' in its account application. But the bank has not done the same for its job applicants. For now, HSBC plans to keep its questions "strictly" about the demographic groups that require reporting under equal employment opportunity and affirmative action rules—though it would be open to making a change, says Terri Pearce, the bank's head of learning and recruiting for the U.S. To be sure, just tracking LGBT status within a company's applicant pool isn't necessarily enough to bolster the representation of that group in-house. Plus, some job hunters' resumes contain hidden signs that can reveal their gender, race or even sexual identity even if they never explicitly disclosed them. That could put some applicants at a disadvantage in the hiring process, as studies have shown that resumes with a white, male-sounding name tend to do better than the same resume headed by a black, hispanic, female, or Asian-sounding name. "There is this unconscious bias happening," says Clair Farley, director of economic development at San Francisco's LGBT Center. Farley advises LGBT job seekers not to come out until after a job offer has been made. Then, if the offer is rescinded, the litigation process is much simpler, she says. "Where women and LGBT are first to be hired, they are also first to be fired," Farley says.

While other big banks coughed up to attend the CERAWeek by IHS Markit conference, the energy industry’s biggest annual confab, the Swiss lender was the only one that officially sponsored the show in Houston. It shelled out a few hundred thousand dollars, scoring a hospitality suite for schmoozing executives as well as a choice panelist seat on day one of the conference. Sponsoring CERAWeek -- the oil patch’s equivalent to airing a Super Bowl commercial -- underscored the bank’s affinity for its oil and gas team, which has been a bright spot amid trading losses, costly lawsuits and other woes. It also showed how the firm aims to protect its share of the brutally competitive energy advisory business as it scales back on sales and trading to focus on wealth management. “They have been in the business for a long time” said Anthony Tripodo, chief financial officer of Houston-based Helix Energy Solutions Group Inc., which hired Credit Suisse to run its $228.8 million equity raising this year. “They have a feel of who will buy the securities. They delivered as promised. We almost did twice as much as what we went out for,” Tripodo said. Equity Fees The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Credit Suisse’s energy bankers brought in $293 million in advisory fees in the Americas last year, according to data from Dealogic. Only JPMorgan Chase & Co. got more. The Zurich-based lender was particularly dominant at raising cash for shale explorers rebounding from the oil price rout. Credit Suisse acted as left lead on about 41 percent of the sector’s exploration and production equity offerings last year, valued at a total of $3.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “They have a very strong U.S. presence” in energy, said Alison Williams, a bank analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “They do have relative strength versus the other European banks. Credit Suisse does earn more than everybody else.” The equity-raising boom in oil and gas should continue through this year, said Osmar Abib, Credit Suisse’s global co-head of oil and gas, as the trend shifts from exploration companies looking to sell shares to issuances by services providers. Credit Suisse expects as many as 15 oilfield-services providers to seek to raise a combined total of $3 billion to $4 billion through initial public offerings this year. Just two have priced IPOs in the U.S. this year: ProPetro Holding Corp. raised $350 million while Select Energy Services Inc. raised $121. Credit Suisse worked on both listings Energy Prices Companies that offer pressure pumping, hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield services are gearing up to IPO because energy prices have stabilized, creating a window for private equity-backed firms to tap the markets, Abib said. They also need to raise money to hire workers and update equipment as producers ramp up drilling, he said. “It has been a very brutal downturn,” Abib said. “Despite that, there has been a record amount of equity financing by the industry.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

MSCI's benchmark emerging equities index has rallied hard since market favourite Emmanuel Macron went safely through the first round of voting in France to face far-right leader Marine Le Pen in a May 7 run-off for the presidency. Emerging market stocks rose almost 1 percent, extending similar gains from the previous session to touch their highest level since June 2015. "We have at least a week of upside to look forward to because we have just seen an easing of European political risk," said Koon Chow, emerging markets macro and FX strategist at UBP. "Europe is important for EM because it is a place where it sells its goods to and also where it gets a lot of investment from." Asian manufacturing markets set the trend with index heavyweights such as Hong Kong and Taiwan up 1.2 percent. Korean stocks gained over 1 percent to touch a near six-year high, and the Korean won rose 0.7 percent. Trump has called for new UN sanctions against North Korea , which has conducted a big live-fire exercise to mark the foundation of its military. Parts of emerging Europe also continued to perform well as the risk of an anti-European Union French president receded. Poland, one of the biggest net receivers of EU funds, rose 0.5 percent to the highest since July 2015. The Polish zloty gained 0.2 percent against the euro after touching two-week highs on Monday. Trump's promise to offer a "big tax reform and tax reduction" plan on Wednesday also lifted investor sentiment. So did his indication that he is willing to delay pushing for funds to build a border wall with Mexico . Chow said that the risk of U.S. protectionism and other forces of political friction had eased, helping some emerging market currencies appreciate against the dollar. The yield premium paid by emerging market sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified narrowed 1 basis point to 306 basis points (bps), the lowest level since April 7. It has narrowed 14 bps since April 18. Currencies retreated a touch after pushing to multi-week highs on Monday. The South African rand slipped 0.5 percent against the dollar, after rising to a three-week high in the previous session. The central bank's leading business cycle indicator was up 1.1 percent month-on-month in February. The Turkish lira also slipped 0.5 percent from a two-month high on Monday. Turkey's central bank governor said it would maintain its tight monetary policy stance, before its rate-setting meeting on Wednesday. The Hungarian forint weakened 0.2 percent against the euro . Hungary's central bank meets later on Tuesday, and is expected to keep rates on hold and maintain a loose monetary policy.

Crude oil edged higher on Tuesday after giving up most of the gains made during the month with the market losing confidence in OPEC and Russia sticking to production cuts. Read more Saudi February crude oil exports drop to 21-month low Brent crude was up two cents, trading at $51.62 per barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate rose to $49.24. The prices are still down at its lowest since late March. After starting the year on a high, with Brent reaching over $57 per barrel, oil is 10 percent down since the end of 2016. Traders are worried the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and other producers will not extend the deal to cut production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017. If they fail to do so, Russian oil output could hit a record high, analysts warn. According to Thomson Reuters Eikon, Russian exports excluding those through pipelines are up 17 percent since December, to five million bpd before the cuts were officially implemented in April. "OPEC has failed miserably in its endeavor to balance the oil market," Stephen Schork of the Schork report said on Tuesday. "It is evident that... crude markets are still struggling to clear (oversupply)," JPMorgan said in a note to clients this week. According to the investment bank, the Gulf states will be forced to extend cuts, if they “wish to keep prices much above $50 per barrel." Rising US oil production is also preventing a price recovery. In the week to April 21, American drillers added oil rigs for a 14th week in a row to 688 rigs. US crude production is at 9.3 million bpd, up 10 percent since mid-2016 and approaching top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia.

MSCI's benchmark emerging equities index has rallied hard since market favourite Emmanuel Macron went safely through the first round of voting in France to face far-right leader Marine Le Pen in a May 7 run-off for the presidency. Emerging market stocks rose almost 1 percent, extending similar gains from the previous session to touch their highest level since June 2015. "We have at least a week of upside to look forward to because we have just seen an easing of European political risk," said Koon Chow, emerging markets macro and FX strategist at UBP. "Europe is important for EM because it is a place where it sells its goods to and also where it gets a lot of investment from." Asian manufacturing markets set the trend with index heavyweights such as Hong Kong and Taiwan up 1.2 percent. Korean stocks gained over 1 percent to touch a near six-year high, and the Korean won rose 0.7 percent. Trump has called for new UN sanctions against North Korea , which has conducted a big live-fire exercise to mark the foundation of its military. Parts of emerging Europe also continued to perform well as the risk of an anti-European Union French president receded. Poland, one of the biggest net receivers of EU funds, rose 0.5 percent to the highest since July 2015. The Polish zloty gained 0.2 percent against the euro after touching two-week highs on Monday. Trump's promise to offer a "big tax reform and tax reduction" plan on Wednesday also lifted investor sentiment. So did his indication that he is willing to delay pushing for funds to build a border wall with Mexico . Chow said that the risk of U.S. protectionism and other forces of political friction had eased, helping some emerging market currencies appreciate against the dollar. The yield premium paid by emerging market sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified narrowed 1 basis point to 306 basis points (bps), the lowest level since April 7. It has narrowed 14 bps since April 18. Currencies retreated a touch after pushing to multi-week highs on Monday. The South African rand slipped 0.5 percent against the dollar, after rising to a three-week high in the previous session. The central bank's leading business cycle indicator was up 1.1 percent month-on-month in February. The Turkish lira also slipped 0.5 percent from a two-month high on Monday. Turkey's central bank governor said it would maintain its tight monetary policy stance, before its rate-setting meeting on Wednesday. The Hungarian forint weakened 0.2 percent against the euro .

As Wolf alludes in this post, one of the reason so many real world retailers are hitting the wall so hard is that private equity leverage and asset stripping made them particularly vulnerable. While the losses to online retailers would have forced some downsizing regardless, the fact that so many are making desperate moves in parallel is in large measure due to the fact that the tender ministrations of their private equity overlords have made them fragile. Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt, in their landmark book Private Equity at Work, described a real estate looting strategy that as of 2014 had already ruined some formerly viable retail and restaurant chains. As we summarized their observations: For instance, one way that private equity overlords enrich themselves at the expense of the businesses they acquire is by taking real estate owned by the company, spinning it out into another entity (owned by the PE fund and to be monetized subsequently) and having the former owner make lease payments to its new landlord. The problem with this approach is usually twofold. First the businesses that chose to own their own real estate did so for good reason. They were typically seasonal businesses, like retailers, or low margin businesses particularly vulnerable to the business cycle, like low-end restaurants. Owning their own property reduced their fixed costs, making them better able to ride out bad times. To make this picture worse, the PE firms typically “sell” the real estate at an inflated price, which justifies saddling the operating business with high lease payments, making the financial risk to the company even higher. Of course, those potentially unsustainable rents make the real estate company look more valuable to prospective investors than it probably is. Eileen Applebaum provided examples of how this worked (and regularly left bankruptcies in its wake) in an interview with Andrew Dittmer. Now here is the cute part. First, remember that the private equity fund manager makes out regardless of whether their investors do well, since nearly 2/3 of their total fees are not related to performance. We’ve posted on how private equity fund managers get rich on management fees alone. However, private equity fund managers do have an incentive not to burn private equity limited partners, since they want to raise more funds. The real estate asset stripping op co/prop co model is analogous to the discredited dividend recap strategy, which was widely criticized after Clayton & Dubilier quickly bankrupted Hertz that way. But leveraging up a company in a very big way and extracting a lot of cash, which the op co/prop co model does, allows the private equity fund manager to make a big distribution to investors early on, producing a handsome IRR on that deal. And if the deal goes bad, what happens? The end result to the private equity investors depends on how much cash was returned, between the real estate sale and any positive cash flows afterward, before the company goes bust. It could turn out to be pretty profitable to a bit of a turkey. The real losers are the lenders to the retailer. And who might they be? Increasingly they are the very same investors as in the private equity funds. Private equity fund managers offer credit funds, which lend in large measure to private equity deals. However, the effect for an investor like CalPERS is to distort which pocket made the money. The private equity deal looks better by virtue of dumping losses on the credit fund, which are seldom recouped even in case of seemingly obvious fraudulent conveyance (those cases are costly and difficult to win and even then, recoveries are almost always partial). So from the perspective of reporting investment strategy returns, the private equity gains are coming at least in part from bankruptcy-induced diminished returns at credit funds held by the same investors. By Wolf Richter, a San Francisco based executive, entrepreneur, start up specialist, and author, with extensive international work experience. Originally published at Wolf Street Mall traffic is sagging. Department store sales have been in decline since 2001. Most retailers are loaded up with debt. Many have been losing money. Now they’re running out of options. Store closings numbered in the thousands last year. This year they promise to get much worse. “Zombie malls” have become reality, their vast parking lots rented to car dealers to store their excess vehicle inventory. But ecommerce sales are booming, including online sales by some brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Walmart and Macy’s:   Over-indebted retailers are notoriously difficult to restructure and many end up being liquidated. Unsecured creditors, such as suppliers and junior bond holders, are often left out in the cold. Even secured creditors can end up holding the bag. April so far is huge for brick-and-mortar meltdown: April 21 – Bebe Stores, a fashion retailer, announced, after four years of losses, that it would close all its 180 stores by the end of May and liquidate all merchandise and fixtures in the stores. It might also file for bankruptcy to get out of the store leases. It will only sell online. Barely a month earlier, Bebe said it had hired a financial adviser to look at “strategic alternatives” and a real estate adviser “to assist with options related to its lease holdings,” at which point its shares plunged. April 19 – Neiman Marcus, the luxury retailer with 42 stores around the country and two Bergdorf Goodman stores in Manhattan, announced that, in order to preserve cash, it would not pay interest on a bond issue in cash, but “in kind.” The payment-in-kind (PIK) option had been written into the bond covenant. At the time, creditors didn’t care. Now they’ll get the coupon on these $600 million in 8.75% notes for the next six months in form of more bonds of uncertain value. The already beaten-down notes traded at 56.7 cents on the dollar. On March 3, sources told Reuters that Neiman Marcus has hired investment bank Lazard Ltd to help restructuring its nearly $5 billion in debt though it was, these sources insisted, in no immediate risk of bankruptcy. The company was acquired by private equity firms in a leveraged buyout before the Financial Crisis and is now owned by Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. They were going to dump it into the public’s lap, but the IPO was scrapped when the problems could no longer be hidden. April 17 – Marsh Supermarkets was preparing to file for Bankruptcy, sources told the Wall Street Journal. Three weeks earlier, it stopped paying rent on six Indianapolis stores. Here too, there’s a private equity angle. Sun Capital Partners acquired Marsh in 2006 for $88 million in cash and the assumption of $237 million in debt. At the time it had 120 stores. Ten years of asset stripping later, the chain is down to 67 stores and going bankrupt. April 11 – Arhaus, a furniture retailer that designs its own furniture and contracts out manufacturing, with 67 stores in 25 states, has appointed a “chief restructuring officer, two sources close to the situation said,” according to Debtwire. “This complements the co-advisory roles of Piper Jaffray and Candlewood Partners to explore a refinancing.” In early March, Arhaus announced that CEO Adrian Mitchell, after just 13 months on the job, would be replaced by co-founder and Chairman John Reed. In 2014, private equity firm Freeman Spogli made a minority investment. April 4 – Rue21, a teen apparel chain with over 1,000 stores, missed principal and interest payments on its debt and is preparing to file for bankruptcy as soon as this month, said “people familiar with the matter,” according to Debtwire. Once again, there is a private equity angle: the company was acquired by PE firm Apax in 2013 for about $1 billion. Back in September 2013, problems were already piling up when JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs had trouble selling the junk debt they pledged to sell to fund the buyout. April 4 – Payless Inc., the discount shoe retailer with almost 22,000 employees and over 4,000 stores in 30 countries, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It plans to slash its debt in half. It said its restructuring plan has the support of creditors holding two-thirds of its first-lien and second-lien term debt. It said it would immediately shutter about 400 stores in the US and Puerto Rico. CEO W. Paul Jones blamed “the continued challenges of the retail environment, which will only intensify.” Here too, a PE angle: Payless was acquired by PE firms Golden Gate Capital and Blum Capital Partners in 2012 when publicly traded Collective Brands was broken up. And this is the March meltdown: On March 20, Sears, the big whale that everyone is waiting for to wash up on the beach, came closer to washing up on the beach by acknowledging that it will likely wash up on the beach, when it said in its annual report that it had “substantial doubt” about its ability to keep operating as a “going concern.” It lost over $10 billion in recent years. When will Sears finally file for bankruptcy? Not before the second half of 2017. That was our verdict in December, and we’re sticking to it. If it files before July 8, 2017, it might run afoul of the bankruptcy code’s two-year look-back period governing “fraudulent conveyance,” concerning what happened to Sears’ real estate. On March 11, Gordmans Stores, with over 100 locations in 22 states, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with plans to liquidate its inventory and assets. By the end of March, Stage Stores jumped in and offered to buy at least 50 of the stores. Gordman’s is another PE firm asset-stripping special. It was acquired by PE firm Sun Capital in 2008 at the end of the leveraged buyout boom for an undisclosed price. In 2010, Sun Capital sold 30% of this shares in an IPO. Gordman’s got nothing. In 2012, Sun Capital sold more shares, slashing its ownership to 50%. In 2013, Sun Capital forced Gordman’s to issue a $70 million special dividend, of which Sun Capital got half. Of that dividend, $25 million came from cash holdings; $45 million was borrowed money. In total, Sun Capital obtained $140 million, likely exceeding the purchase price by good margin. And the party may not be over yet. On March 10, Gander Mountain, after a failed expansion drive, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It will shutter 32 of its 160 stores. It had been taken private in 2010 by Gratco, a holding company controlled by Gander Chairman and CEO David Pratt, and Holiday Station stores, a gas-station retail operation. On March 8, RadioShack, owned since 2015 by General Wireless, filed for bankruptcy for the second time. It will close about 200 stores and evaluate options on the remaining 1,300. On March 6, hhgregg, an appliance and electronics retailer, filed for bankruptcy, after announcing a few days earlier that it would close 88 of its 220 stores, shutter three distribution centers, and shed 1,500 jobs. On March 1: BCBG Max Azria filed for bankruptcy. The fashion retailer that once had more than 570 boutiques globally, including 175 in the US, started closing 120 of its stores in January. The January and February meltdown: Michigan Sporting Goods Distributors said it will liquidate its 68 stores and lay off its 1,300 workers. Eastern Outfitters, the parent of Bob’s Stores and Eastern Mountain Sports, owned by PE firm Versa Capital, filed for bankruptcy. Wet Seal filed for the second time in recent years. The teen retailer closed all its stores. Limited stores, another victory for PE firm Sun Capital, shuttered all its 250 stores. American Apparel, a manufacturer with 110 retail stores, which had filed for bankruptcy for the second time last November, said that it had started to lay off 2,400 workers and that everything would be shut down. Only the brand name was acquired by a Canadian firm. This thermometer for discretionary spending is the first to react when consumers hit their limits.

Rather its seems that amazon is expanding Because retailers are closing. Bezos probably should thank PE firms for their destructive activities. Reply ↓ Art Eclectic April 25, 2017 at 11:49 am Exactly. The crappified shopping experience and lack of inventory came first. A miserable brick and mortar experience drove shoppers into the welcoming arms of Amazon because they just wanted to buy stuff and retail made it hard. Reply ↓ Vatch April 25, 2017 at 12:46 pm lack of inventory A couple of days ago, reader Heron pointed this out: http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/04/amazon-com-effect-retailers-say-theyre-not-selling-consumers-report-buying.html#comment-2804851 Whether it’s called “slim inventory” or “JIT”, it’s a problem for shoppers. Reply ↓ sgt_doom April 25, 2017 at 2:01 pm Indeed! I’m sure an old junk bond Wall Street dood like Bezos is already pals with ’em! Great article, and should be enlightening for those not in the know. Whether Josh Kosman’s outstanding book, The Buyout of America, or Eileen Appelbaum’s marvelous work, the PE swineherds have been dismantling the American (and other countries’) economy for quite a few years now, and the kings of debt, led by Peter G. Peterson who spends his free time decrying debt (?!?!?!?), are the villains of our age! Reply ↓ AnotherTosser April 25, 2017 at 6:18 pm The retail market, by and large, is hosed, especially if they’ve decided to get into bed with PE. Amazon might be filling out the areas left bare by the collapse, but Amazon itself has a major problem in the form of counterfeit inventory which is going to blow up in its face. If you look at the comments on HN, more than a few people mention how they got something that was sold (sometimes by Amazon) as legit, but turned out to be fake – this stems from Amazon’s practice of commingling inventory when you participate in their “fulfilled by” program. Considering their expansion into grocery and other food-type items, a counterfeit scandal is one they can ill afford. If retail’s currently fried, and you can’t trust what you buy on Amazon, what’s left? The correction is going to take a while, and will be deeply felt, I fear. Reply ↓ cnchal April 25, 2017 at 10:06 pm > If retail’s currently fried, and you can’t trust what you buy on Amazon, what’s left? Manufacturers cooperating or colluding to develop their own sales platform and cutting out Amazon and Wal Mart and selling direct to the customer. Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers April 25, 2017 at 5:26 am Thank you, Yves. You won’t be surprised to hear about this scam operating in the UK. It has been the case for about thirty years and forms part of the “financial engineering” that has replaced metal bashing in Blighty. It’s not just retail, but football (aka soccer) that has fallen victim. Many clubs were similarly divided between the operating company / team and the ground. Some still are, e.g. Chelsea and Stamford Bridge. Around the turn of the century, a former footballer (ex West Ham and Manchester City and one of the mobile chicanes negotiated by Diego Maradona for his second goal against England at the World Cup in 1986) who had made a small fortune at the Lloyd’s insurance market, approached my employer, HSBC, for a loan, if not a partnership, to take over Aston Villa, which operates from a big site in Birmingham (Villa Park). His plan was to split the football club from the ground / stadium and get the club to pay the landlord rent, develop the ground for residential and retail purposes, and get the club to share a stadium with another Birmingham / Midlands region club, e.g. Birmingham City, Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves) or Port Vale. HSBC wisely declined. It was still just about a boring trade bank then, but was embarking on a spree under John Bond. Not long after, Barclays (a future employer at the time) became adviser to Leeds United. I don’t know if Leeds split between club and ground (Elland Road), but the club began leasing, not buying players, and securitising the income stream. After some success, including an appearance in Europe’s top competition, Leeds fell apart and is languishing in the lower divisions (minor leagues). Philip Augar, a former banker (Schroeders, NatWest etc.) and author (Reckless Capitalism, Decline Of Gentlemanly Capitalism etc.), dedicated one of his books to Leeds United, his childhood club, “one of the early victims of this madness”. The footballer I mentioned above is still active in the City, not so much at Lloyd’s (opposite one of my two offices), but with financial engineering in sport. He was widely quoted in the FT a few weeks ago. With regard to retail, the scam played a part in the collapse of a retail chain, British Home Stores. The former chairman and main shareholder, “Sir” Philip Green, split the retail operations from the stores. He / his Monaco company owns many of the (former) sites, including what was BHS HQ in Marylebone (just down the road from Baker Street station and Mme Tussaud). Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers April 25, 2017 at 5:33 am I forgot to add that said player was still hawking the same “financial solutions” (snake oil) in the FT. The paper did not mention how the solutions had worked out. The thing is, in many cases, the solutions seem / are designed to fail, after some roaring success, and (or so) the insiders can profit from the wreckage (“disaster capitalism”) as they are often creditors (e.g. the knight of the realm above) and can salvage what they consider to be the valuable bits. Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers April 25, 2017 at 5:40 am Just one more thing to add, sorry, is that many UK retailers are under similar pressure. One hears in the City that one or two household names are nearing collapse. One well known US Main Street store merged with a well known and similar UK High Street store a couple or so years ago. They are run / owned from Switzerland, I think, by an Italian, whose PE firm, again based off shore, is one of the biggest shareholders in the group. The Italian billionaire ran the UK firm before the merger. They are rumoured to be one, if not the, next domino. Reply ↓ allan April 25, 2017 at 6:58 am Yet another unintended (?) consequence of QE ∞. The ZIRP simultaneously made pension funds and endowments desperate for returns and enabled PE firms to raise large amounts of money at low rates. But on the bright side, QE saved us over the last 8 years from the horror of meaningful fiscal stimulus and infrastructure investment. So we should thank Drs. Bernanke and Yellen and their enablers for letting the market work its magic and protecting us from the dead hand of state intervention. Reply ↓ Jim A. April 25, 2017 at 8:06 am And the great recession meant that there were plenty of stressed business which PE funds could gain controlling interests in for relatively low cost. Reply ↓ Grumpy Engineer April 25, 2017 at 9:58 am ZIRP also made it easier to load all of these retailers up with excess debt. Management could borrow more money than necessary, pay themselves lavish bonuses with the excess, and claim that “interest rates are low; making payments will be easy“. They could even show you the math. Of course, that math assumed that sales would steadily climb into the future. If sales fell even slightly, the payments became an oversized burden. And paying off the enormous loan principal was beyond all hope. Companies with little debt can generally survive a reduction in sales. They can engage in cost-cutting exercises, maybe encourage some employees to retire earlier, etc. It’s even easier if they own their own property and don’t have to renegotiate a lease. But when you’ve got a lot of debt and servicing that debt requires that sales continue to rise quarter after quarter after quarter without fail, then things get a LOT more fragile. The effects of even a single bad quarter get greatly amplified. [“Leverage” can work both ways.] And steadily-declining sales are the kiss of death. Oh, yes. Ultra-low interest rates “helped” retailers a lot. Helped set them up for failure, that is.

Reply ↓ FedUpPleb April 25, 2017 at 10:47 am I have found retail shopping over the last ten years to be a poor now bordering on depressing experience. Poor selection, sparse stores, uncompetitive prices,staff either untrained or trained only to nag about loyalty cards, and the quality of items has nosedived across the board. Even the “luxury” items are cheap and poorly made. The only consistent exvception to this trend is toy stores. I guess kids are tougher customers. I hate shopping online. I hate the uncertainty. I hate the delay. I hate the decision fatigue. But what choice do I even have anymore? It costs me more petrol to go shopping than they charge for delivery. Reply ↓ sgt_doom April 25, 2017 at 2:05 pm Thanks, FedUpPleb — I keep telling this to the stooges who keep prattling on about the low cost of items — which are far too expensive, last only several washings (delicate cycle only, of course) or several months and are of the poorest quality, completely different from my youth! Reply ↓ Sutter Cane April 25, 2017 at 12:28 pm Given the post and the comments, it actually sounds like the future for retailers that survive doesn’t seem so bleak, IF (big if): 1. They manage to avoid private equity takeover 2. Don’t take on debt 3. Make customer service a priority 4. Sell quality goods a step above the usual Chinese garbage found everywhere else (or at least that can’t be shipped as easily) 4. Keep their stores updated and pleasant to visit What with all of the closures, there might be opportunities for the retailers that survive if they avoid the mistakes of their fallen competitors. But are there any examples of companies out there that are doing these things? Nordstrom? Costco? Anybody? Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef April 25, 2017 at 2:42 pm There retailers are national chain retailers. Before them, there were mom-and-pop retailers. They had bleak-future-moment a long, long time ago. Perhaps they will come back one day, when people make enough money to value service again, instead of supporting ‘trade’ as a WSJ poll shows, because trade means affordable junk commensurate with stagnant or declining real wages.

If you need tall sizes for shirts, you used to be able to get these at most every department store, but over the last decade or two almost every department store around these parts was sold and restructured; after these changes the stores always have less inventory for higher prices. Now the only place you can find a wide selection of tall sizes is the internet. Retail clothiers have essentially said we’re not interested in selling things to tall men. And they’re not interested in selling things to large men, or large women, or short people, or old people. How badly should I feel about the disappearance of an industry that decided they had no interest in me whatsoever?

Bonds issued by Guitar Center, the biggest retailer of musical instruments in the world, are languishing at record lows on growing concern that the company is going to be overwhelmed by its roughly $1 billion of outstanding bond debt, part of a debt burden that totals about $1.6 billion, once loans and other borrowings are included. … … in 2007, the company was taken private by Mitt Romney’s former private-equity firm Bain Capital in an LBO valued at $2.1 billion that left it saddled with $1.6 billion of high-yield debt. Coming just ahead of the 2008 financial crisis, the company struggled with its high interest payments for several years. In 2014, its main creditor, private-equity firm Ares Management LLC, took a controlling stake in the company in a deal in which it converted some of its debt into equity, and left Bain as a partial owner with representation on the board. … As Mitt would say, why don’t they get a loan from their parents?

Reply ↓ Pwelder April 25, 2017 at 6:55 pm Ares had a deal down in West Texas with Clayton Williams Energy Inc. (You remember Clayton – he ran for Governor of Texas against Ann Richards) Unfortunately Clayton decided not to hedge his production for 2015-6, just before the Saudis pulled the plug on the oil price in November 2014. All of a sudden CWEI, whose share price had been bouncing around above $100, was two jumps ahead of the sheriff with bankruptcy a real threat. The stock got down to 7. Beginning last March Ares put in a bunch of equity and debt, and it turned out Clayton had squirreled away a ton of acres in the best part of the Permian Basin. With BK off the table the stock price recovered, Noble Energy bought them out for $130+ per share, and Ares made about six times their money in less than a year. What’s interesting for present purposes is there was no asset-stripping or any other shenanigans. Ares took a risk – which looked huge at the time – and made out like bandits. That’s how it’s supposed to work. And the funny thing is, Ares is owned by a bunch of Arabs out in the Middle East. Great piece by Richter and Yves – and a lot of smart commentary from out here in the bleachers. Thanks to all.

These 3 box stores site went from impossible to use to very friendly to use and shipping is normally free over small amount. I had to buy a new blue tooth the other day and amazon wanted $170.00 I then went to the company site and it’s very much improved bought recondition one for $39.00 free shipping. The new one there was $69.00 they have a third party sell through their site. Reply ↓ JustAnObserver April 25, 2017 at 6:30 pm Very interesting. Could Amazon suffer the fate that people go there to browse what’s available but then buy online direct from the maker’s site ? As you remarked many of the manufacturers’ sites have vastly improved as well as their access to fast shipping channels. This is already a known defense against the proliferation of counterfeit goods on generic online sites like Amazon that really don’t give a f**k about the fakes problem as long as they get their cut of the price.

Good luck Reply ↓ Paul Greenwood April 26, 2017 at 1:40 am private equity fund managers do have an incentive not to burn private equity limited partners, So they flip it at an inflated value to another PE buyer to keep portfolio performances looking good and churn regularly until a secondary-fund picks it up to forward to a Liquidation Front Company. It is exactly what Philip Green did at BHS having stripped a £1 billion dividend courtesy of HBOS corruption. This game was well exposed under Robert Campeau decades ago. It is amazing how the old shell games continue. Same story at Karstadt in Germany with Thomas Middlehof and the Arcandor disaster. The Western economic model has been built around Liquidation for decades and the ramping up of liabilities within shell businesses so looters can extract equity and cash. It is so transparent that only criminals do not notice Reply ↓ Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Indrawati said in an interview on Monday that the government would reallocate some spending within the budget to more "productive" areas that can support growth, such as land acquisition for infrastructure projects. The former World Bank managing director also insisted that Indonesia's international banking environment was not becoming more difficult, despite a recent row over a negative JP Morgan research report. One of Indrawati's first acts when she returned to Jakarta as finance minister in July 2016 was to slash state spending by $10.2 billion to hold Indonesia's deficit within a 3 percent legal limit. "We are not going to cut. The president is asking to reallocate more, focusing on the spending which is productive," Indrawati said of this year's budget, after the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings in Washington. She said revenue projections appear "on track" as the World Bank projects Indonesia's economic growth at 5.2 percent this year, compared to the government's official 5.1 percent forecast used for budget planning, and 5.0 percent last year. "If there is going to be a change in the revenue it will be because of the commodity prices, like oil. We are assuming $45 a barrel, maybe it's going to be an average of $50," she said. Indonesian crude grade prices ranged from $46.65 a barrel to $50.80 a barrel on Monday. Benchmark U.S. light crude traded at $49.49. Indrawati said the government needed to boost infrastructure spending this year for some specific projects, such as hosting the Asian Games in 2018, but added, "The overall top line is not going to change." Interest rates are another variable that could have an effect on revenues, depending on how far and fast the U.S. Federal Reserve raises rates this year, which could affect growth, capital flows and the value of the rupiah. Indrawati said Indonesia was much better positioned to handle Fed rate hikes than during the "taper tantrum" of 2013, when funds flowed out of emerging markets as the Fed signaled it would scale back its bond-buying efforts. Indrawati said this time around, the Fed's intentions have been well-telegraphed, and confidence in Indonesia's growth prospects, its growing middle class and its reform efforts are also stronger. "As long as this movement of the interest rates is being viewed by the market as a sign of strength of the U.S. economy, I think there will be less possibility of volatility," she said. Following the growth of religious tension in the recent election of the governor of Jakarta, Indrawati said it was "not necessarily the correct projection" to assume similar issues for 2019 national elections, and added that it would have no effect on President Joko Widodo's reform program. "This is still a healthy democracy, it's a good result of democracy. People presenting what they wish, what they expect," she said. "And for government, at the national level, we will continue doing our program." RESEARCH ROW Indrawati sent shockwaves through the banking sector in January when she severed the government's business ties with JP Morgan Chase and Co after the bank analysts downgraded Indonesian stocks to "underweight" in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's election in November. She said she wanted to encourage banks to operate in a "healthy way" for the country and independent research was welcomed as long as it was accurate. Banks working on behalf of the government, such as those handling sovereign bond issues, need to be clear on what the government expects from them, she said. "What we discussed with JP Morgan was that the relationship between the government of Indonesia with any institution, if it is really based on mutual benefit and serving the country, it should be defined more clearly," Indrawati said. The removal of JP Morgan as a primary bond dealer was followed by new regulations requiring Indonesia's primary bond dealers to "safeguard" their partnership with the government and avoid conflicts of interest..

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Dow Jones Industrial Average Pops 216 Points Ahead of Trump Tax Plan Shutterstock photo The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)  jumped 200 points out of the gate, and spent the whole session trading higher. Stocks reacted to the first-round results of the French presidential election , as well as anticipation that President Donald Trump will unveil his tax plan on Wednesday. Trump’s chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are expected to meet with Republican leaders tomorrow on Capitol Hill. Bank stocks were the big winners — and helped boost the S&P 500 Index ( SPX ) — while strong days for Amazon and Hasbro  stocks sent the Nasdaq Composite (COMP) into uncharted territory. Against this risk-on backdrop, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) plunged 25%. Continue reading for more on today’s market, including: 5 signs today’s stock surge was a relief rally . Analyst: Buy this  FANG stock ahead of earnings. 2 must-see stock charts this week. Plus, a spiraling drug stock; a closer look at surging chipmakers; and the Dow stock hitting new highs. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA – 20,763.89) added 216.1 points, or 1%. JPMorgan Chase led 25 Dow stocks higher with its 3.5% pop, while Nike paced the four decliners with its 0.7% loss. General Electric was unchanged. The  S&P 500 Index (SPX – 2,374.15)  closed up 25.5 points, or 1.1%, clearing recent resistance at 2,350 . The Nasdaq Composite (COMP – 5,983.82) hit an intraday high of 5,989.92, before settling with a 73.3-point, or 1.2%, gain — its loftiest close on record. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX – 10.84) plunged 3.8 points, or 25.9%, to mark its lowest close since Feb. 14. 5 Items on Our Radar Today: The White House has called for a rare full-Senate briefing on Wednesday to discuss North Korea , and what Trump is calling a „real threat to the world.” The briefing will reportedly include Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Joseph Dunford, with all 100 senators invited to attend.  (MarketWatch) The Supreme Court declined to hear a case from General Motors to block ignition-switch suits due to a clause in its 2009 bankruptcy. In 2016, a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that GM was not protected from the claims because many of the plaintiffs were not notified of the faulty ignition switches and/or the company’s bankruptcy.  (Reuters) A „buy the rumor, sell the news” scenario sent this drug stock down nearly 15%.

Caterpillar (CAT) reported first-quarter earnings of $1.28 a share on revenue of $9.82 billion, crushing Wall Street estimates and sending shares soaring Tuesday. Estimates: Analysts expected the Dow Jones industrial average heavy equipment maker to earn 62 cents a share, down 7.5% from 67 cents a year earlier. Revenue was seen slipping 2% to $9.26 billion from $9.46 billion. Outlook: The Peoria, Ill., company raised guidance, while noting that "geopolitical and market uncertainty along with volatility in commodity prices continue to present risks for the rest of the year." Caterpillar boosted its 2017 revenue guidance to a range of $38 billion to $41 billion, up from January guidance of $36 billion to $39 billion. Analysts were expecting $38.3 billion. Management now sees adjusted earnings of $3.75 per share at the midpoint its revenue range vs. earlier guidance of $2.90. Current analyst forecasts call for 2017 earnings of $3.26. Stock: Caterpillar shares jumped 7.9% to 104.42 on the stock market today, their highest level since November 2014. The stock cleared two buy points, a traditional flat base entry of 99.46 and a more-aggressive entry of 97.99. above a 99.46 buy point, after approaching a breakout point on Monday as Caterpillar reported its first year-over-year retail sales gains since late 2012. Caterpillar, a bellwether for global growth and potentially a key beneficiary of President Trump's big infrastructure plans, had mostly moved sideways for the past five months, amid volatility surrounding an IRS investigation, uncertainty about President Trump's agenda, an improving outlook for state infrastructure spending and a recovery in the energy and mining sectors. IBD'S TAKE: If President Trump and Congress add a big federal infrastructure funding package on top of state initiatives, "that creates an inflection point for pricing," Granite Construction CEO James Roberts said in February. Two other heavy equipment makers, Deere (DE) and Terex (TEX), also neared breakouts after gaining amid Caterpillar's good news on Monday. Caterpillar revealed that equipment sales by retailers rose 1% from a year ago in the March quarter, driven by construction equipment sales in China and the Asia-Pacific region. But Asia-Pacific was the only region that saw growth. Overall, Caterpillar retail sales fell 13% in North America, 25% in Latin America and 3% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. On Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase upgraded Terex to overweight from neutral, boosting its price target to 47 from 30. Shares closed on Monday at 33.09. Terex vaulted 7.7% to 35.65, topping a 33.97 entry from a 2-month consolidation and setting its highest marks since September 2014. Deere rallied 2.6% to 113.15, clearing a 112.28 buy point and hitting a new all-time high.

Moneycontrol News Reliance Industries witnessed a surge of over 3 percent intraday on Tuesday as investors cheered the company’s better-than-expected results. Analysts, too, have given the numbers their thumbs-up as well. The petrochemical major's quarterly earnings beat analysts' expectations on Monday as profit on a standalone basis grew by 1.6 percent sequentially to Rs 8,151 crore for January-March quarter. Net income on consolidated basis rose 7 percent to Rs 8,053 crore QoQ. Standalone revenue from operations during the quarter increased 12 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 74,598 crore while consolidated revenue soared 10.33 percent to Rs 92,889 crore, the company said in its filing. Reliance reported gross refining margin for the quarter at USD 11.50 a barrel, which was far ahead of analysts' estimates of USD 11 a barrel and outperformed Singapore complex margins by USD 5.2 a barrel. It had posted GRM at 10.8 a barrel in December quarter. The company’s stock was in the news recently when it surpassed Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in terms of market capitalisation and also became the most valued company in the country. Analysts have largely given positive calls on the stock, driven by a reduction of capex cycle in sight and better metrics in the results. Citi maintained its buy call on the stock with an increase in its bull case target to Rs 1,923 due to higher Jio valuation and lower peak net debt. It believes that the company’s outperformance could sustain as the earnings are at an inflection point. Among key risks to the stock are weakening in refining fundamentals and global petrochemical spreads, the research firm added. Analysts at the firm termed the company’s March quarter performance as strong, with the standalone EBITDA being 3 percent ahead of estimates. Meanwhile, the profit after tax (PAT) was largely in line, it said. Gross refining margins of USD 11.5 per barrel were above its estimates, it said. On the company’s capex plans, it sees standalone capex being lesser than USD 2.5 billion in FY18. Jio’s capex in the first quarter of the fiscal will be similar to March quarter before declining sharply, it said. Nomura maintained its buy call on the stock as well, but with an unchanged target price of Rs 1,540. The brokerage house observed that the net profit was 1-2 percent ahead of its estimates, driven by lower tax rate. It too feels that the recent outperformance of the company could sustain. However, the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and profit before tax (PBT) were below its estimates on the back of higher depreciation and lower other income. These numbers too were partly offset by lower finance costs, it added. Going forward, it sees earnings growing ahead once Jio, petchem and refining expansion projects start to deliver. It expects consolidated EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 19 percent/15 percent, respectively over FY16-20. Meanwhile, it observed that high capex on Jio continued during the quarter and expects similar capex in Q1 of this fiscal. The near-term focus will be on addition in customers of Jio. Having said that, it feels that the large capex cycle is coming to an end. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has downgraded the stock to neutral, but increased the target price to Rs 1,450 from Rs 1,375. The global brokerage firm observed that the firm’s March quarter net profit was 9 percent above estimates, while refining beat was led by GRM. Analysts at the firm now have the focus on Jio’s success and the capex cycle. They believe that a further rerating on the stock is contingent on a successful Jio P&L as well as falling capex. It further added that while capex could decline, there is limited visibility on a successful Jio P&L. The stock could find support from growth in Jio’s monthly subscribers, while weak margin, project startup hiccups and high capex were the key risks, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, has an overweight rating on the stock as it saw upside risks from improving energy margins as well as project executions. A steady project pipeline commissioning from FY18 should reduce the risk of further capex, it added. JPMorgan is neutral on the stock with an increased target price of Rs 1,310 from Rs 1,240. While the lower capex in its core business was positive, Jio was the key unknown element, it said. Further extension of discounts by Jio would be negative, it added. Rolling forward its valuation to FY19, Deutsche Bank raised its target by 10 percent to Rs 1,600. Lower downstream margins, policy vagaries were the key downside risks for stock, it said. The stock has moved around 12 percent in the past one month, while its three-day gain stood at 5 percent. At 11:04 hrs, Reliance Industries was quoting at Rs 1,437.90, up Rs 21.50, or 1.52 percent on the BSE. It touched a 52-week high of Rs 1,465.00.(Disclosure: Reliance Industries, the parent firm of Jio, owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com.) tags #Reliance Industries #Result Analysis Related news Business Here are Sandip Agarwal's views on Wipro's Q4 numbers Apr 26, 2017 09:13 AM Business BSE International Exchange to start single future trading from Friday Apr 25, 2017 01:52 PM Business Buy DLF, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Capital: Ashwani Gujral Apr 25, 2017 12:10 PM Business Analysts largely hail Reliance's Q4 performance; retain positive calls on stock Apr 25, 2017 11:27 AM Business Expert take: Decoding Reliance Industries' fourth-quarter results beat Apr 25, 2017 11:18 AM Business Add Reliance Industries to portfolio, advises Sudarshan Sukhani Apr 25, 2017 10:38 AM Business Buy RIL on dips, see higher levels in Indiabulls Housing Finance: Ashwani Gujral Apr 25, 2017 10:26 AM Business Expect more surprises for Reliance going ahead: Edelweiss' Jal Irani Apr 25, 2017 09:35 AM Business Stocks in the news: Reliance, Biocon, Sun Pharma, Strides, Rel Comm, Tata Power Apr 25, 2017 08:25 AM News Most Popular Top News Stay with winners! 100 stocks which rose to lifetime high in April gave up to 127% return Hindustan Zinc posts 42% rise in Q4 profit at Rs 3,057 cr, margin expands 940 bps Vijay Mallya gifted $40 million to his children, funnelled Rs 3200 crore overseas: ED’s dossier EC to get 30,000 new VVPAT machines by July for Guj, HP polls Delhi MCD Election Result 2017 LIVE: BJP sweeps all 3 corporations; AAP continues EVM blame game Market Live: Sensex, Nifty extend gains; banks, auto, FMCG stocks support Five stocks which can give up to 17% return when markets at record high S Chand IPO: Do not go by the cover! see more Video of the day Kotak flags disconnect between slow growth & market rally; bullish on HDFC Bank, M&M Portfolio Markets Watchlist Live TV Show Currencies Commodities Fixed Income Personal Finance Mutual Fund Stock Market India IPO Global Market Budget 2017 BSE Sensex Forum News Business Markets Stocks Economy Mutual Funds Personal Finance IPO Startups Stocks: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | Others Mutual Funds: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z Visit the App Store to see all our apps: Tools Retirement Planning EMI Calculator SIP Calculator SIP Planner Useful Links Budget 2016 Live Sensex Public Sector Banks Best Portfolio Manager Small Savings Schemes Bonds Specials Master Your Money Game Changers Travelcafe SME Special Investment Watch PowerYourTrade MoneyBhai Focus Grow My Money GE Step Ahead SME Step Up Feedback & Info feedback@moneycontrol.com About us | Contact Us | Feedback | Disclaimer | Privacy Statement | Terms of Use | Careers | Financial Terms (Glossary) | Sitemap | RSS Feed Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.
