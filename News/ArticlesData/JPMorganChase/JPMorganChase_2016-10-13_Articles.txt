NEW YORK: US stocks opened higher on Friday as a trio of leading banks beat analyst third quarter earnings forecasts despite the tough low interest rate environment. The three -- Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup -- all saw net profits fall as low rates pared lending margins, but they beat forecasts from analysts, driving their shares higher in early trade. About 30 minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 percent to 18,229.53. The broad-based S&P 500 added 0.6 percent at 2,146.22, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.7 percent to 5,251.99. Citigroup shares led the three reporting banks with a 2.5 percent gain, Wells Fargo rose 0.5 percent and JPMorgan 1.3 percent. Other banks yet to report for the quarter rode the wave higher: Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley both jumped more than 3 percent while Bank of America rose 2.2 percent. Also helping the market were fresh economic indicators pointing to a resilient economy; both retail sales and producer prices picked up in September. Underpinning that was a jump in key consumer and producer price indexes in China, with the producer price index showing the first year-on-year gain in almost five years. Among other stocks, two partially China plays. Intel gained 1.6 percent and Caterpillar 1.4 percent. Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices surged 7.5 percent, helped by a trading upgrade from Credit Suisse. US retail sales rose in September after a decline in August, turning the corner after a summer in which consumers had shown a slackening appetite, according to the Commerce Department. Advance estimates for the month were $459.8 billion, representing an increase of 0.6 percent over August and 2.7 percent over the same month last year. The result matched analyst expectations. Sales were down for the month in department stores, electronics and appliance retailers. Spending rose on furniture, building materials, and gasoline. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said that on closer inspection the results were cause for concern. "A rebound in US retail sales in September masks worrying signs of a slacking-off in the underlying trend in consumer spending to the worst for over three years, suggesting the economy is struggling to pull out of the malaise seen in the first half of the year," he wrote in a client note. "The September upturn leaves total sales 0.7 percent higher in the third quarter, less than half of the 1.5 percent expansion seen in the second quarter."  Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus E-Paper Aaj Kal Sunday Magazine Facebook Daily Times Instagram Twitter Tweets by @DailyTimes_DT SoundCloud sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Contact us Privacy Policy TERMS AND CONDITIONS © 2016 Dailytimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co

Forty-eight per cent of all Americans aged 18 to 30 have zero in retirement savings and no access to a traditional pension, according to a GenForward poll by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago with the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The youngest in that group are more likely to still be in school, but the trend also holds for those in their late 20s. More than 4 in 10 of those aged 25 to 30 have nothing for retirement. ___ Yellen: Slow recovery confounds economists’ expectations WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said Friday that the slow recovery from the Great Recession has surprised economists, confounding long-held beliefs about growth and inflation. Her remarks could help explain why the Fed has been reluctant to raise U.S. interest rates. Speaking to an economic conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Yellen did not address the Fed’s timetable for rates. The central bank is widely expected to resume raising rates in December, a reflection of an improved economy. Yellen said sluggish worldwide growth would likely keep global interest rates low, making it harder for central banks to combat the next recession with rate cuts. ___ US bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones from airliners WASHINGTON (AP) — The Transportation Department is issuing an emergency order banning passengers and flight crews from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note7 smartphones on airline flights in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The order goes into effect Saturday at noon eastern time. It says the phone may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can’t be shipped as air cargo. The department says passengers who attempt to travel with the phones will have the phones confiscated and may face fines. ___ US stocks inch higher as banks rise and drugmakers fall NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks gave up large gains and finished barely higher Friday. Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the U.S. and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. ___ US retail sales up 0.6 pct., but signs of caution emerge WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. shoppers stepped up their spending in September, with sharply higher sales at auto dealers, restaurants and gas stations. But the government’s retail sales report released Friday also contained some evidence that spending might be slowing. For much of this year, consumers have spent at a solid pace as income gains have accelerated and the job market has improved. Last month’s overall retail sales gain was a decent seasonally adjusted 0.6 per cent. Much of it, though, was due to higher oil prices, which increased how much people spent at gas stations but were not necessarily a sign of stronger consumer spending. ___ Wells Fargo’s earnings fall as bank deals with scandal NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo’s earnings slipped in the third quarter as the banking giant started dealing with the aftermath of a sales practices scandal. Wells said Friday that it earned $5.6 billion, or $1.03 per share, compared with $5.8 billion, or $1.05 per share, in the same period a year earlier. The results beat analysts’ expectations of $1.01 per share. The bank is being roiled by a crisis that ultimately toppled its CEO this week. Wells reached a $185 million settlement with regulators last month following allegations that its employees opened up to 2 million bank and credit card accounts without their customers’ authorization in order to meet sales goals. ___ JPMorgan’s 3Q earnings fall 8 per cent, still beat estimates NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase’s third-quarter profit fell 8 per cent as higher revenue in retail and investment banking was offset by money set aside to cover loans that might go bad. However, the results still beat Wall Street’s expectations. The largest U.S. bank by assets and revenue said it earned $6.29 billion in the quarter, or $1.58 per share, down from a profit of $6.80 billion, or $1.68 per share, in the same period a year earlier. The results beat the $1.39 per share analysts were looking for, according to FactSet. ___ Citigroup’s profit falls 11 per cent, but beats forecasts NEW YORK (AP) — Citigroup said Friday that its profit fell nearly 11 per cent in its third quarter, but the results easily beat Wall Street expectations and its shares rose. The bank reported net income of $3.8 billion, or $1.24 per share, in the three months ending Sept. 30, compared with $4.3 billion, or $1.35 per share, in the same quarter the year before. That’s better than the $1.15 per share that Wall Street analysts expected, according to FactSet. Revenue fell 5 per cent to $17.76 billion in the quarter, beating the $17.29 billion that analysts expected. ___ Hershey’s CEO John Bilbrey plans to retire next year NEW YORK (AP) — Hershey says CEO John Bilbrey plans to retire from the chocolate company next year. The news comes less than two months after Oreo cookie maker Mondelez ended talks to buy Hershey, in a deal that would have brought together some of the world’s best known chocolate and snack brands. Hershey makes Reese’s peanut butter cups, Kisses and other chocolates and candies. Bilbrey will retire on July 1, 2017 and stay on as a non-executive chairman. Bilbrey, who is 60, was named CEO five years ago and joined the Hershey, Pennsylvania-based company 13 years ago. ___ Chinese nationals who defrauded Goodyear get prison in Ohio AKRON, Ohio (AP) — Federal authorities say two Chinese nationals who defrauded Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. out of $1.5 million in a kickback scheme have each been sentenced in Ohio to more than two years in prison. Authorities say Xin Franco Fan and Rex Xu Yu earlier pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and honest services wire fraud. They were sentenced Thursday in Akron to 27 months in prison and ordered to repay the $1.5 million. Affidavits say Akron-based Goodyear contacted the FBI in February about the men, who worked for a Singapore-based subsidiary that acquires $1 billion a year in rubber for Goodyear. ___ Medicare unveils far-reaching overhaul of doctors’ pay WASHINGTON (AP) — Changing the way it does business, Medicare on Friday unveiled a far-reaching overhaul of how it pays doctors and other clinicians. The goal is to reward quality, penalize poor performance, and avoid paying piecemeal for services. Whether it succeeds or fails, it’s one of the biggest changes in Medicare’s 50-year history. The complex regulation is nearly 2,400 pages long and will take years to fully implement. It’s meant to carry out bipartisan legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama last year. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average inched up 39.44 points, or 0.2 per cent, at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor’s 500 added 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.83 points to 5,214.16. U.S. crude oil gave up 9 cents to $50.35 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 8 cents to $51.95 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 1 cent to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas slumped 6 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 14, 2016 at 4:48PM Image source: Getty Images. Stocks closed out the trading week on a positive note, with both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) rising slightly. The indexes had been up by almost a full percentage point early in Friday's session, but they declined in the afternoon hours to finish with just modest gains. Today's stock market Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow 0.22% 39.44 S&P 500 0.02% 0.43 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. The United States Oil Fund ETF (NYSEMKT:USO) has been one the market's most heavily traded funds lately thanks to the commodity's wild price swings. But a mild move in the price of crude oil held USO to a less than 1% drop on Friday. The SPDR Select Finance Sector Fund (NYSEMKT:XLF), meanwhile, rose 1% after several of its biggest constituents posted strong earnings results.  As for individual stocks, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) attracted plenty of investor attention on Friday. Twitter loses another suitor Twitter's painful month continued as the stock fell hard to bring its October results to a brutal 27% decline so far. Shares slumped 5% on heavy trading volume after salesforce.com officially backed away from a rumored potential acquisition deal. Executives told Financial Times that a purchase "wasn't the right fit for us," and a spokesman confirmed the news with The Wall Street Journal. Investors' hopes had been raised in early October by comments from Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who called Twitter an "unpolished jewel" with valuable data assets. However, the executive team was apparently swayed by negative feedback from investors that included a sharp drop in its stock price and has decided to pass on the opportunity. With a buyout seemingly off the table, Twitter's operating metrics will come under even closer scrutiny this month. Management projections call for the social media giant to post $600 million of third-quarter sales, flat when compared to the prior quarter and just 7% higher than the year-ago period. The company will have plenty of positive engagement metrics to trumpet, including high interest in the presidential election and in its live video broadcasts of NFL games. But investors will likely be looking for more, including evidence that user growth has sped up and that monetization trends are improving. JPMorgan posts record earnings JPMorgan shares were flat after the banking giant posted surprisingly strong third-quarter results. Higher profits across each of its divisions contributed to record overall earnings as profits grew to $1.58 per share and sales rose to $25.5 billion. Despite investor concerns over the low-interest-rate environment, the company beat consensus estimates by a wide margin on both the top and bottom lines. "We delivered strong results this quarter with each of our businesses performing well," CEO Jamie Dimon said in a press release. Image source: Getty Images. Morgan's investment banking division was a standout performer, with revenue rising 16% and net income doubling to a record $2.9 billion. Management credited several positive trends for that success, including a near-50% spike in markets revenue as clients traded busily following volatile events like the Brexit vote and changing expectations on the timing of the Federal Reserve's next interest rate hike. Fed officials expect the current low-interest-rate environment to easily stretch out past 2017, but JPMorgan and peers like Citigroup are demonstrating that they can still produce strong results even with federal fund rates stuck near 0%.

Earnings for the first round of banks — JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and PNC — came in above expectations. Loan growth — a source of much of the anxiety, particularly in commercial — is still up mid-to-upper single digits year-over-year, but may be decelerating. Net interest is holding up. Expense control is good. For JPMorgan and Citigroup, the beats came largely on stronger trading revenue, particularly in fixed income. JPM saw fixed income trading up 48 percent, with Citigroup up 35 percent. That's good, but other banks like Wells Fargo and PNC do not have those trading operations. So loan growth — and fee growth — is a much more important component. For Wells Fargo, total average loans rose a respectable 7 percent year-over-year. All the banks that reported started the trading day up, but fell mostly flat mid-morning. What happened? First, despite the beats, earnings were down across the board year-over-year. Second, the "body language" on the conference calls seem to indicate that fourth-quarter earnings estimates may be too high, primarily due to potentially slower commercial loan growth. The jury is still out on this, but it correlates with everything we have been hearing. After all, strong fixed-income trading results are nice for big money center banks like JPMorgan and Citigroup, but don't necessarily push stocks up much. They respond more to loan growth, which is respectable but hardly robust. After all, how much loan growth can you get with 2 percent GDP growth? Third, Wells Fargo — which is down fractionally despite the beat — may be a special case. The sales scandal overshadowed the earnings beat. For instance, in September, the bank said customer visits with branch bankers were down 10 percent year-over-year, and consumer checking account openings were down 25 percent. Without being able to estimate the financial impact of the sales scandal, many are just staying away. Finally, banks trading flat to weaker after JPMorgan reports is not that unusual. According to our partners at Kensho, when JPMorgan beats by 5 cents or more in the last 10 years, the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE), a basket of bank stocks, on average trades down 1.5 percent the week after JPMorgan beats.

Home Markets World markets Sales scandal costs Wells Fargo; JPMorgan and Citi please Wall Street Sales scandal costs Wells Fargo; JPMorgan and Citi please Wall Street JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup trounced third-quarter estimates on Friday on a sharp rebound in trading revenues while Wells Fargo & Co barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank. By: Reuters | New York | Updated: October 15, 2016 12:25 AM Wells Fargo is under pressure to keep its profit engine humming while dismantling the aggressive sales culture at the heart of its woes, since unlike JPMorgan and Citigroup it does not have a big trading arm. (AP) JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup trounced third-quarter estimates on Friday on a sharp rebound in trading revenues while Wells Fargo & Co barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank. Wells Fargo is under pressure to keep its profit engine humming while dismantling the aggressive sales culture at the heart of its woes, since unlike JPMorgan and Citigroup it does not have a big trading arm. Less than 48 hours after taking the helm from Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf, Tim Sloan, who had been chief operating officer, struck a contrite tone with analysts. He admitted that senior management was responsible for the scheme in which Wells’ branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge to meet internal sales targets. Stumpf had been widely criticised for saying responsibility fell on low-level workers, some 5,300 of whom were fired. Some former workers say they were let go for refusing to open unauthorised accounts and are now suing the bank. “Saying we put our team members through the wringer is an understatement,” Sloan said on a conference call. The scandal has shattered the bank’s folksy image, and Wells Fargo, once a Wall Street darling for its ability to sell multiple products to individual customers, said on Friday that new account openings had dropped sharply. New consumer checking accounts were 30 percent lower than in August, and 25 percent lower than the prior year. Applications for consumer credit cards fell 30 percent in September from the prior month, and retail and small business customers used their debit cards 4 percent less in September versus August. Wells Fargo scrapped sales targets for branches last month and customer interactions with branch bankers fell 14 percent in September from the previous month and was down 10 percent from last year. The bank has said the scandal will minimally affect its wealth management business and was unlikely to alter its plans to return capital to shareholders. Sloan still must navigate federal and state investigations in coming months. The scandal has renewed left-leaning lawmakers’ attacks on Wall Street and bolstered their mission to introduce stricter oversight. JPMORGAN MOMENTUM CONTINUES While Wells Fargo’s overall profit dropped for the fourth straight quarter, net income in the third quarter topped estimates, helped in part by lower-than-expected loan-loss provisions. JPMorgan and Citi also beat expectations as bond trading roared back in the third quarter, boosted by Brexit-inspired volatility along with changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as money market reforms. Banks got a fillip from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, which moved to a seven-year high during the quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings of short-term bank debt in advance of new U.S. regulations. JPMorgan’s Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said it was too early to say if the momentum has continued into the fourth quarter, but so far so good. “The momentum that I just characterized as fairly broad and fairly consistent across the quarter, has somewhat continued so far,” she told journalists. JPMorgan’s aftertax income dropped 7.6 percent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of $2.2 billion a year earlier. But revenues and profits both topped analysts’ estimates. Citigroup, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, beat expectations for third-quarter net profit after trading revenue surged 35 percent. While net income fell 11 percent to $1.24 per share, it exceeded the average estimate of $1.16 per share. Total adjusted revenue fell 4 percent to $17.76 billion, but beat the average estimate of $17.36 billion. The strong trading performance helped U.S. financial stocks snap a three-day losing streak, with markets-focused bank shares such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley up 1.7 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, ahead of their results next week. Citigroup ticked slightly higher at midday after earlier rising as much as 3 percent along with a strong broader market. JPMorgan tipped into negative territory after earlier gaining as much as 2 percent. Wells Fargo was down 0.8 percent. The S&P financial index edged up. The British government’s tougher line on immigration in the wake of the Brexit vote has bankers preparing for a scenario in which London loses access to the single market, meaning they would have to move parts of their operations elsewhere in Europe. “As a result, we will be starting to build out technology systems and operations in Europe,” JPMorgan’s Lake said.

Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the U.S. and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. "The retail sales numbers on the surface looked pretty good but when you dig into them they were not that great," said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "It seems like every good report we get, we get an offsetting weaker report." The Dow Jones industrial average, which had jumped as much as 162 points in the morning, finished up 39.44 points, or 0.2 percent, at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 inched up 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.83 points to 5,214.16. Goldman Sachs was responsible for most of the Dow's gains. It rose $3.10, or 1.9 percent, to $170.52 after Britain's High Court threw out a $1 billion lawsuit against the company. Libya's sovereign wealth fund had accused Goldman Sachs of duping the fund into making risky deals. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.80 percent from 1.75 percent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, and that allows banks to make bigger profits from lending. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results were better than investors expected. The reports may have raised investor hopes for companies that will report their results next week, like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock. "It was a good kickoff to earnings season" for banks, said Baele. "It was actually some decent revenue as well with both investment banking and trading." Rising bond yields attracted investors' attention, and they sold utilities, real estate investment trusts, and other stocks that pay large dividends as a result. Those payments are more appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields are low. PG&E Corp. fell 57 cents to $59.80 and Duke Energy slid 73 cents to $77.21. The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, which helped technology companies recover some of Thursday's losses. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.42 while Intel rose 48 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.45 and Apple picked up 68 cents to $117.66. While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department's report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl's lost $1.44, or 3.2 percent, to $43.68 and Macy's fell $1.23, or 3.3 percent, to $35.57. Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. HP stock lost 67 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $14.48. Twitter fell 91 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $16.88 after Salesforce.com told the Financial Times it isn't interested in buying the company. Twitter has lost 32 percent of its value since October 5th on reports that potential buyers were not going to make offers. Salesforce investors were not enthusiastic about the potential offer, and its stock jumped $3.64, or 5.2 percent, to $74.27. U.S. crude oil gave up 9 cents to $50.35 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 8 cents to $51.95 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost $1.39, or 3.7 percent, and closed at a three-year low of $36.49. Cancer drug maker Celgene sank $2.13, or 2.1 percent, to $98.50. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 1 cent to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas slumped 6 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold fell $2.10 to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver lost 2 cents to $17.44 an ounce. Copper slipped 1 cent to $2.11 a pound. The dollar rose to 104.18 yen from 103.60 yen. The euro rose to $1.0983 from $1.1053. France's CAC 40 jumped 1.5 percent and Germany's DAX rose 1.6 percent. In Britain the FTSE 100 advanced 0.5 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.4 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.9 percent. Thailand's SET index climbed 4.7 percent in the second day of trading after the death of Thailand's king. The SET fell 4 percent in September as investors worried about the monarch's health and even with the rally Friday the index fell 1.8 percent this week. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The S&P 500 financial index .SPSY was up 0.44 percent, after rising as much as 1.5 percent following JPMorgan (JPM.N), Citigroup (C.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) market-beating results.However, Wells Fargo shares fell 0.7 percent as the bank struggles with a sales scandal that cost Chief Executive John Stumpf his job. JPMorgan and Citi were flat. Yellen is due to speak at a conference in Boston where she could offer her thoughts on the growing support for an interest rate hike in the near term.A sustained growth in the labor market and improving inflation have encouraged policymakers such as Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who said on Friday that placing "very high" odds on a rate hike in December seemed appropriate. Traders have currently priced in a 67 percent chance of a rate hike in December, while the odds for November are minimal as the Fed's meeting falls just days before the Nov.8 U.S. presidential election. "We don't expect a departure from the script, which was laid out at the minutes of the September meeting, and expect the Fed to continue moving on a path toward a December rate hike," said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the Private Client Group of U.S. Bank. Major U.S. stock indexes have been swinging between losses and gains since Monday due to uncertainty regarding the quarterly earnings season and the outcome of a tightly run U.S. presidential race.The three indexes are on track for the second straight weekly loss. While earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to fall 0.7 percent - marking the fifth straight quarter of decline - some investors hope that enough companies will beat analysts' expectations for the index to end the season with a slight gain. At 12:27 p.m. ET (1627 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 54.3 points, or 0.3 percent, at 18,153.24.The S&P 500 .SPX was up 2.38 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,134.93 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 4.77 points, or 0.09 percent, at 5,218.10.Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with technology .SPLRCT rising the most by 0.47 percent. Microsoft (MSFT.O) was its biggest driver, rising 0.8 percent after Cowen & Co raised its price target. McDonald's (MCD.N) fell 0.6 percent after the fast-food chain operator announced charges related to strategic changes it had outlined last year.HP Inc (HPQ.N) fell 2.9 percent after the company said it would cut about 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,575 to 1,300. On the Nasdaq, 1,369 issues rose and 1,318 fell.The S&P 500 index showed three new 52-week highs and one new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 21 new highs and 58 new lows.

(Photo: REUTERS/Brendan McDermid) prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: U.S. stocks ended little changed on Friday, losing ground late after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's comments on the economy unnerved investors. Financial shares finished up, giving the S&P 500 its biggest boost after stronger-than-expected bank results, but gave up most of their early gains. Healthcare shares led declines. Yellen, in a speech at a conference of policymakers and academics, laid out the deepening concern at the Fed that U.S. economic potential is slipping - and may need aggressive steps to rebuild it. "In looking at the market, I think, yes, (Yellen's speech) had a dovish tilt to it if you took it literally," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said Yellen's speech could suggest the U.S. central bank will stay accommodative for longer. Yellen did not address interest rates or immediate policy concerns directly. Traders have currently priced in a 67-percent chance of a rate hike in December. The S&P 500 financial index was up 0.5 percent. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup trounced third-quarter estimates. Wells Fargo & Co barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank. Shares of JPMorgan ended down 0.3 percent, however, while Citigroup ended up 0.3 percent and Wells Fargo was down 0.1 percent. Wells Fargo has been under pressure following recent revelations that branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge. The bank earnings somewhat helped shore up Wall Street's confidence on the outlook for third-quarter earnings after some disappointing results from industrial and healthcare companies. S&P 500 earnings for the quarter are still expected to have declined 0.4 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 39.44 points, or 0.22 percent, to 18,138.38, the S&P 500 gained 0.43 points, or 0.02 percent, to 2,132.98 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.83 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,214.16. For the week, the Dow was down 0.6 percent, the S&P 500 was down 1 percent and the Nasdaq fell 1.5 percent. Shares of Twitter fell 5.1 percent to US$16.88 after Salesforce.com's chief executive ruled out bidding for Twitter. Salesforce.com shares jumped 5.2 percent to US$74.27. HP Inc fell 4.4 percent to US$14.48 after the company said it would cut about 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years. About 6.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 27 new highs and 80 new lows.

Wells Fargo is under pressure to keep its profit engine humming while dismantling the aggressive sales culture at the heart of its woes, since unlike JPMorgan and Citigroup it does not have a big trading arm. "We're prepared for things to get worse before they get better," Chief Executive Tim Sloan, who took over as boss on Wednesday after John Stumpf, the bank's veteran leader, announced he was leaving amid a public furor over the scandal. Revelations that Wells' branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge to meet internal sales targets has shattered the bank's folksy image. Once a Wall Street darling for its ability to sell multiple products to individual customers, Wells Fargo said on Friday that new account openings had dropped sharply. New consumer checking accounts were 30 percent lower than in August, and applications for consumer credit cards fell 30 percent in September from the prior month. Wells Fargo's staff are in a period of flux after the bank scrapped sales targets for branches last month and in a note following Sloan's presentation, Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at KBW, said, "Management doesn't know what the consumer bank will look like in the future." The bank has said the scandal will minimally affect its wealth management business and was unlikely to alter its plans to return capital to shareholders. On Friday, the state of Ohio joined a growing list of municipalities to suspend business relationships with Wells Fargo. The bank makes less than 1 percent of its revenue from working with local governments but Ohio's decision is a blow, coming days after Stumpf, a lightning rod for much of the criticism around the scandal, had departed. Sloan must navigate federal and state investigations in coming months. The scandal has renewed left-leaning lawmakers' attacks on Wall Street and bolstered their mission to introduce stricter oversight. JPMORGAN MOMENTUM CONTINUES While Wells Fargo's overall profit dropped for a fourth straight quarter, net income in the third quarter topped estimates, helped in part by lower-than-expected loan-loss provisions. JPMorgan and Citi also beat expectations as bond trading roared back in the third quarter, boosted by Brexit-inspired volatility along with changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as money market reforms. Banks got a fillip from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, which moved to a seven-year high during the quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings of short-term bank debt in advance of new U.S. regulations. JPMorgan's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said the fourth quarter so far is showing positive signs. "The momentum that I just characterized as fairly broad and fairly consistent across the (third) quarter, has somewhat continued so far," she told journalists. JPMorgan's after-tax income dropped 7.6 percent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of $2.2 billion a year earlier. But revenues and profits both topped analysts' estimates. Citigroup, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, beat expectations for third-quarter net profit after trading revenue surged 35 percent. While net income fell 11 percent to $1.24 per share, it exceeded the average estimate of $1.16 per share. Total adjusted revenue fell 4 percent to $17.76 billion, but beat the average estimate of $17.36 billion. The strong trading performance helped U.S. financial stocks snap a three-day losing streak, with markets-focused bank shares such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley up 2 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, ahead of their results next week. Citigroup was up over 0.8 percent in late trade after earlier rising as much as 3 percent. JPMorgan tipped into negative territory after earlier gaining as much as 2 percent. Wells Fargo was up 0.25 percent. The S&P financial index gained 0.85 percent. The British government's tougher line on immigration in the wake of the Brexit vote has bankers preparing for a scenario in which London loses access to the single market, meaning they would have to move parts of their operations elsewhere in Europe. "As a result, we will be starting to build out technology systems and operations in Europe," JPMorgan's Lake said.

Keris Alison Lahiff Oct 14, 2016 12:40 PM EDT U.S. stocks climbed after big banks JPMorgan ( JPM) , Citigroup  ( C) and Wells Fargo  ( WFC) beat Wall Street estimates. Banks have had to weather an environment of low interest rates with a cautious Federal Reserve holding policy at crises levels. Consumer sentiment made a surprisingly large drop in October as worries over the presidential election reached a peak. The University of Michigan index fell to a 13-month low.  HP ( HPQ) slid after issuing a weak forecast and detailing plans to cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years. HP said it continued to face weakness in the printer and personal computer markets.  Best Buy ( BBY) fell after September retail sales data showed a drop in sales at electronics and appliance stores. Analysts expected to see a boost in electronics spending following the release of the iPhone 7. TheStreet's Keris Lahiff has details from Wall Street.

Shares of JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, rose 1 percent after the lender beat estimates for revenue and profit. Citi rose 2.3 percent after its profit fell less than expected. The S&P 500 financial index soared 1.4 percent, far outdoing the other seven major sectors that were higher. Bank of America was the top influence on the S&P, while Goldman Sachs had a similar impact on the Dow. Investors are also awaiting Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech at noon in Boston, where she is likely to offer more insight into the growing sentiment among policymakers to raise interest rates relatively soon. Sustained growth in the labor market and improving inflation have encouraged Fed officials such as Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren, who told CNBC on Friday that the "very high" odds for a rate increase in December was appropriate. A report from the U.S. Commerce Department showed retail sales rebounded in September, helped by a surge in motor vehicle purchases. The measure rose 0.6 percent, compared to a fall of 0.2 percent in August. Major U.S. stock indexes have been swinging between losses and gains since Monday as uncertainty regarding the quarterly earnings season and the outcome of a tightly run U.S. presidential race threaten market valuations. At 9:36 a.m. ET (1336 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 136.39 points, or 0.75 percent, at 18,235.33. The S&P 500 was up 12.23 points, or 0.57 percent, at 2,144.78 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 32.62 points, or 0.63 percent, at 5,245.96. McDonald's fell 1.1 percent and was the biggest drag on the S&P after the fast-food chain operator announced charges related to strategic changes it had outlined last year. HP Inc fell 1.8 percent after the company said it would cut about 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years. "From a fundamental standpoint, investors are really hungry for clarity and a bullish catalyst," said Adam Sarhan, CEO of Sarhan Capital. "That will come from the Fed and from earnings today." Earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to have fallen about 0.7 percent in the third quarter but some investors hope that enough companies will beat analysts' expectations for the index to end the season with a slight gain.

Shares of JPMorgan, the biggest US bank by assets, rose 1 per cent after the lender beat estimates for revenue and profit. Citi rose 2.3 per cent after its profit fell less than expected. The S&P 500 financial index soared 1.4 per cent, far outdoing the other seven major sectors that were higher. Bank of America was the top influence on the S&P, while Goldman Sachs had a similar impact on the Dow. Investors are also awaiting Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s speech at noon in Boston, where she is likely to offer more insight into the growing sentiment among policymakers to raise interest rates relatively soon. Sustained growth in the labour market and improving inflation have encouraged Fed officials such as Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren, who told CNBC on Friday that the “very high” odds for a rate increase in December was appropriate. A report from the US Commerce Department showed retail sales rebounded in September, helped by a surge in motor vehicle purchases. The measure rose 0.6 per cent, compared to a fall of 0.2 per cent in August. Major US stock indexes have been swinging between losses and gains since Monday as uncertainty regarding the quarterly earnings season and the outcome of a tightly run US presidential race threaten market valuations. At 9.36am. ET (1336 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 136.39 points, or 0.75 per cent, at 18,235.33. The S&P 500 was up 12.23 points, or 0.57 per cent, at 2,144.78 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 32.62 points, or 0.63 per cent, at 5,245.96. McDonald’s fell 1.1 per cent and was the biggest drag on the S&P after the fast-food chain operator announced charges related to strategic changes it had outlined last year. HP Inc fell 1.8 per cent after the company said it would cut about 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years. “From a fundamental standpoint, investors are really hungry for clarity and a bullish catalyst,” said Adam Sarhan, CEO of Sarhan Capital. “That will come from the Fed and from earnings today.” Earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to have fallen about 0.7 per cent in the third quarter but some investors hope that enough companies will beat analysts’ expectations for the index to end the season with a slight gain. The dollar rose 0.35 per cent, while prices of gold, a safe haven, dropped 0.34 per cent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,011 to 623. On the Nasdaq, 1,626 issues rose and 526 fell. The S&P 500 index showed three new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded seven new highs and 12 new lows.

 Wall Street's most important business is bouncing back Matt Turner and Portia Crowe Oct. 14, 2016, 12:24 PM 6,039 facebook linkedin twitter email print Toru Hanai/Reuters The crash of fixed income, currencies, and commodities trading has been Wall Street's never-ending story. Over the past few years, revenue has plunged, traders have been fired, and business lines have been shuttered. But for at least a moment, that pressure seems to have abated. On Friday, both JPMorgan and Citigroup reported a knockout quarter in the business in the third quarter. For its fixed-income unit, JPMorgan reported revenue of $4.33 billion for the quarter — up 45% from the same quarter a year ago. That's the unit's best performance in more than three years. Daniel Pinto, the CEO of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, said in a memo to employees that both macro (rates and FX) and spread products (credit) had their best third quarter in five years. Over at Citigroup, fixed-income markets revenue came in at $3.5 billion, up 35% from the same quarter a year ago and on par with that of the second quarter, which is traditionally a busier time of year than summer. The bank said there was strength in rates, currencies, and spread products, making the rebound broad-based. That performance helped the bank beat analyst expectations. JPMorgan and Citigroup finished the first six months as the top two banks in fixed income, currencies, and commodities revenue, according to Coalition, and the good news for Wall Street more broadly is that the comeback has no single driver. Rates, currencies, and spread product revenues all rebounded. JPMorgan Chase & Co. It is also the first time in a while in which both macro products, like rates and currencies, and spread products, like corporate bonds and securitized products, have been strong at the same time. Rates was a terrible business for several years but has bounced back recently, with credit becoming the horror show. But JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake said credit was "a comeback story" following a challenging period there. Whether the performance is sustainable is another question. Numerous key factors aligned to help drive strong trading in the third quarter, including the aftermath of Britain's decision to leave the European Union and the subsequent wild swings in sterling; big currency moves in various emerging markets; a surge in debt issuance; and plenty of central-bank news. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley report earnings next week. We'll soon find out whether the rest of Wall Street has benefitted from the same rebound in its most important business.

(JPM) Earnings Are Nothing to Complain About The mega-bank did plenty of things right last quarter, even if it can't maintain the pace By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Oct 14, 2016, 11:34 am EST     Popular Posts: 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in 2017 The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2016 Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock is Working Its Way Back to Relevancy Recent Posts: Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

(CSCO) Stock This Is the Best Thing to Happen to Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) In a While View All Posts JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) may not have hit a grand slam with its third-quarter numbers posted Friday morning, but all things considered, its earnings report should be plenty satisfying to owners of JPMorgan stock. Source: via Wikimedia Revenue was up a solid 8%, and both the top line and the bottom line rolled in better than expected for the period. The end result? JPM stock was up a respectable 1.4% (it’s since fallen to a 10 basis-point gain) on the heels of the news, extending what’s now become a 28% advance from its February low, and moving to a 3.7% year-to-date gain. JPMorgan stock remains vulnerable to the wishy-washy economy, and still has issues it must contend with. But, JPM just became at least a little easier to own. JPM Earnings Recap For its recently completed fiscal third quarter, JPMorgan Chase & Co. turned $25.51 billion worth of revenue into a per-share profit of $1.58. The top line was 8% better than the year-ago revenue tally of $23.5 billion, though the bottom line came up short of the $1.68 per share of JPM reported in Q3 of 2015. Nevertheless, last quarter’s numbers topped expectations for earnings of $1.39 per share and sales of $24.3 billion. The 10 Best Dividend Stocks for Every Retirement Portfolio It’s also worth noting the earnings dip wasn’t one that was entirely operationally driven. In the same quarter a year earlier, the bottom line of $6.8 billion was boosted by a $2.2 billion tax benefit. Last quarter, JPMorgan booked a tax expense, leading to net income of $6.2 billion. Were it not for the timing of tax factors, JPMorgan Chase may have seemingly done even better. CEO Jamie Dimon commented on last quarter’s numbers, “We delivered strong results this quarter with each of our businesses performing well.” Earnings Growth Breakdown There’s little doubt as to the highlight last quarter: fixed income, currencies and commodities (or FICC). That division’s revenue was up 45% last quarter, to $4.33 billion, thanks to a swell of trading activity after the Brexit vote in June. Those flames were fanned by strong improvements in credit-based products. Other bright spots include commercial banking. Net income for its commercial banking arm grew 50% on a year-over-year basis, to $778 million. Corporate and investment banking income nearly doubled, reaching $2.91 billion on a 14% uptick in revenues. The bond trading desk saw a 48% increase in revenues. Dimon added: “We had record net income in Commercial Banking and record loan balances in Asset Management. The Corporate & Investment Bank reported its best third quarter revenue. In the Consumer businesses, we grew both loans and deposits [by] double-digits.” Strong forward progress wasn’t seen across the board, however. The bank’s consumer and community banking group’s net income fell 16% to $2.2 billion. And, though core loans made by its commercial banking arm were up 14%, the company’s provisions for loan losses jumped 86% to $1.27 billion; bad oil and gas industry loans continue to plague banks. Bottom Line for JPMorgan Stock All told, the JPMorgan’s return on tangible common equity (or ROTCE) fell to 13% thanks to rising credit costs, despite a 6% decrease in non-interest expenses. The company has set a ROTCE target of 15%. Stumpf Is Out, but Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) Is Ignoring This Crucial Rule It was by no means a perfect quarter for JPMorgan, and questions remain as to how long the bank’s fixed income and currency exchange business can maintain Q3’s impressive growth rate. Even as the overall economy superficially appears to be losing traction, demand for banking services and an increasing amount of economic activity — especially at the threshold of an interest rate hike — bodes well for JPM stock. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Posted 14 Oct 2016 20:25 Updated 14 Oct 2016 22:10 Traders work in the Citigroup booth on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., May 25, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Citigroup Inc, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, beat expectations for third-quarter net profit on Friday after trading revenue surged 35 percent. The resurgence, which was echoed at rival JPMorgan, is a boost for Chief Executive Michael Corbat, who has stuck with the bank's trading business while shrinking large parts of its consumer banking business in overseas markets. While net income fell 11 percent to US$3.84 billion, or US$1.24 per share, it exceeded the average estimate of US$1.16 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total adjusted revenue fell 4 percent to US$17.76 billion, again beating the average estimate of US$17.36 billion. Citigroup's shares rose 2.2 percent to US$49.58 in early trading, similar to gains at rivals JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as investors lauded a solid start to the U.S. bank earnings season. Both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit forecasts on Friday. Bank of America reports results on Monday, followed by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley later next week. CONSUMER BANKING Revenue at Citi's institutional clients group, which includes trading and investment banking, rose 13 percent, boosted by volatility in fixed income markets. That volatility and greater activity were spurred by Britain's June vote to leave the European Union, changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan, and money market reforms. However, equity market revenue fell about 34 percent as political uncertainty discouraged companies from initial public offerings and share offers. JPMorgan reported a 1 percent increase. Citi's global consumer banking division had a less stellar performance. Net income fell by nearly a quarter due to a higher cost of credit and higher operating expenses. Part of those expenses were due to the cost of becoming the lender behind retailer Costco Wholesale Corp.’s co-branded credit cards this year from American Express Co. Citigroup said revenue from its North American branded card business grew 15 percent to US$2.2 billion, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio as well as modest organic growth driven by higher volumes. The business accounts for about a quarter of its total net income and a third of profit from its global consumer franchises. Citigroup executives have said the branded card business is expected to generate a 2.3 percent return on assets, more than double the profitability of the entire company. Overall operating expenses fell 2.5 percent to US$10.40 billion. PROFIT TARGETS Despite the solid performance in investment banking, Corbat fell further behind in his quest to reach a 10 percent return on tangible common equity, a key measure of profitability. It fell to 7.8 percent from 8.9 percent a year earlier. Corbat had set the target of reaching a 10 percent return on equity by 2015 shortly after taking the reins in 2012. But the bank has found it hard to hit the target as its earnings are squeezed by low interest rates and the U.S. Federal Reserve's requirement that banks retain more capital. Analysts say the Fed would need to allow the bank to return as much as it earns to significantly improve shareholders' returns and the Fed now lets Citi distribute about 65 percent of its capital. Corbat reached that level in June when he won approval from the regulator to triple the bank's dividend and increase spending on its stock buybacks by more than a third. Previously, Citi had failed Fed tests of its capital plans twice. The bank's common equity Tier 1 capital rose to 12.6 percent from 12.5 percent in the second quarter even as Citigroup returned capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. The stock had lost 6.3 percent this year as of Thursday's closing price of US$48.47. Citigroup's stock has languished at a steep discount to its tangible book value, which was US$64.71 at the end of September.

The S&P 500's financial index surged 1.16 percent, its best showing in seven days, after JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo reported quarterly revenue and profit that beat market expectations. JPMorgan and Citi rose slightly, while the scandal-hit Wells reversed course to trade down 0.15 percent. Bank of America was the top influence on the S&P, while Goldman Sachs had a similar impact on the Dow. The two banks are scheduled to report results along with Morgan Stanley next week. While earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to fall 0.7 percent, marking the fifth straight quarter of decline, some investors hope that enough companies will beat analysts' expectations for the index to end the season with a slight gain. The early part of the earnings season is dominated by financials and the positives from the sector set the tone for the rest of the period, said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the Private Client Group of U.S. Bank. The KBW Bank index rose 0.6 percent, snapping a three-day losing streak. Investors are also awaiting Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech at noon in Boston, where she is likely to offer more insight into the growing sentiment among policymakers to raise interest rates relatively soon. Sustained growth in the labor market and improving inflation have encouraged Fed officials such as Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren, who told CNBC on Friday that the "very high" odds for a rate increase in December was appropriate. "We don't expect a departure from the script which was laid out at the minutes of the September meeting and expect the Fed to continue moving on a path towards a December rate hike," Northey said. At 11:05 a.m. ET (1505 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 114.88 points, or 0.63 percent, at 18,213.82. The S&P 500 was up 8.99 points, or 0.42 percent, at 2,141.54 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 27.93 points, or 0.54 percent, at 5,241.26. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher. Energy fell 0.16 percent as oil prices dropped 0.83 percent. Microsoft rose 1.1 percent after Cowen & Co raised price target on the stock. McDonald's fell 1.1 percent after the fast-food chain operator announced charges related to strategic changes it had outlined last year. HP Inc fell 1.8 percent after the company said it would cut about 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,813 to 998. On the Nasdaq, 1,562 issues rose and 993 fell. The S&P 500 index showed three new 52-week highs and one new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded seven new highs and 41 new lows.

Continue Reading Below Better-than-expected big bank earnings on Friday somewhat helped shore up Wall Street's confidence, which has been shaken by a rocky beginning to third-quarter reporting season, marred by disappointing results from industrial and healthcare companies. But with the bulk of results still to come, investors are counting on large U.S. companies to stop a year-long streak of profit declines. Next week's reports include Microsoft <MSFT.O>, General Electric <GE.N>, Johnson & Johnson <JNJ.N> and Bank of America <BAC.N>. Mixed initial results have added to other concerns in recent days that hurt equities, including weak economic data in China, worries over Britain's exit from the European Union, and the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike before year-end. After a second straight week of losses, the S&P 500 sits about 2.5 percent below its all-time closing high set two months ago. "The exuberance you saw this summer as it got to new highs was built on the premise that prices were leading a breakout in earnings," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Investors "were looking for a pretty strong breakout in the second half of the year to make up for a very weak first half, and I just don't know that that's in the cards," McCain said. With 34 S&P 500 companies reporting so far, third-quarter earnings are expected to slip 0.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But given how many better-than-expected reports typically occur, investors are eyeing the quarter to potentially end with earnings in positive territory. S&P 500 profits fell 5 percent in the first quarter and 2.1 percent in the second. "At the end of the day, it really is all about earnings. Every economic data point filters down into earnings," said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. "When we actually move to positive, I think psychologically that will be a point for investors to say, 'Wow, this really is probably the best place to be in terms of investing. You have to be in equities'," said Cavanaugh. Strong earnings forecasts will be important for supporting historically expensive stock valuations. The S&P 500 trades at nearly 17 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, against its historical average of 15 times. One potential obstacle to upbeat outlooks is the strengthening U.S. dollar, which this week climbed to its highest since March against a basket of currencies <.DXY>. Multinational companies that generate business outside the United States stand to see those sales reduced when translated back into dollars. Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, said he will be watching "whether or not businesses feel like they have their operating models working well and under control, and if the dollar turns into the excuse du jour for weak guidance or missing the quarter." "At these valuation levels, the market gets to be vulnerable," Gayle said.   (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Nick Zieminski) What do you think?

On Friday, Oct. 14, 2016, JPMorgan Chase reports financial results. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • JPMorgan Chase's third-quarter profits fell 8 percent from a year earlier, the bank said Friday, as higher revenue in retail and investment banking was offset as the bank had to put aside more money to cover loans that might go bad. The results still beat Wall Street's expectations, however, and JPMorgan Chase's stock rose in early pre-market trading. The largest U.S. bank by assets and revenue said it earned $6.29 billion in the quarter, or $1.58 per share, down from a profit of $6.80 billion, or $1.68 per share, in the same period a year earlier. The results beat the $1.39 per share analysts were looking for, according to FactSet. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "We delivered strong results this quarter with each of our businesses performing well," JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon said in prepared remarks. As it has been for several quarters now, JPMorgan remained under pressure from the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates at near record low levels. Banks are directly impacted by low interest rates because it inhibits their ability to charge more in interest when their customers borrow. In JPMorgan's consumer bank, its largest division by revenue, reported a 16 percent decline in net income from a year ago to $2.20 billion. JPMorgan was able to increase deposits sharply in the quarter and also originated more mortgages, but it had to set aside more money to cover potentially bad loans in its credit card and auto divisions. The bank also said it had increased promotional and new credit card account costs in the quarter, likely tied to the interest in the bank's Chase Sapphire Reserve card which debuted in the quarter to unexpectedly strong demand. JPMorgan's investment bank had a particularly strong quarter, with pre-tax profit of $2.91 billion, double its earnings from a year earlier. A large driver of the gain was the bank's bond trading desks, where revenue rose 48 percent from a year earlier, compared to the 1 percent rise in revenue in stock trading. Investment banking advisory fees, which are earned when JPMorgan's bankers help companies issue debt, merge, acquire or issue stock, was up 14 percent from a year ago. Revenue rose to $24.67 billion, compared with $22.78 billion in the same period a year earlier. JPMorgan's stock rose 1.4 percent in pre-market trading.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows NHL: Coyotes F Brad Richardson carted off ice on stretcher Utah lawmakers: Time to take 'training wheels' off booming solar industry, retire tax credit BYU football: UMass' struggles as independent, FBS newcomer, paint a cautionary tale Garrison Keillor: Politics is not everything.

 JPMORGAN: We've had problems like Wells Fargo — but they're not 'systemic' Portia Crowe Oct. 14, 2016, 10:50 AM 4,009 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake. JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan has encountered some of the cross-selling issues that have recently plagued Wells Fargo — but it's nothing "systemic." That's according to chief financial officer Marianne Lake, who said on a call following third-quarter earnings that JPMorgan is conducting a deep-dive investigation following the news about its competitor. In September, Wells Fargo paid a $185 million settlement with regulators over accusations its employees wrongly opened as many as 2 million accounts in customers' names without their knowledge between at least 2011 and 2015. CEO John Stumpf has since retired from the firm. "We have over 50,000 people working in over 5,000 branches — it's obviously the case that we will occasionally find issues, both issues of this nature and of other natures," Lake said. "The important thing is that we are focused on finding them, finding them timely, and fixing them." Asked whether there had been at least a couple of cross-selling incidents, Lake responded yes. "We can't have zero defects; the point is that we are not building our incentives to get those behaviors," she said. "We're paying for deep relationships — if we find someone who's abusing our code of conduct for this or any other reason, we will take action." Asked whether JPMorgan bankers created fake bank accounts, or whether customers have complained about being forced into accounts, Lake responded, "No, nothing like that." She said JPMorgan reviews its incentive compensation plans for branches annually and has a complaints management process.  Additionally, she said, the firm is taking an "inward deep-dive" given the news, and has not yet found any "systemic" issues. "We're not seeing anything that rises to the level that we would be concerned," Lake said.

U.S. stocks are falling early Thursday, Oct. 13, 2016, and following global markets lower after a steep drop in China’s exports, a troubling sign for the second-largest economy in the world. Banks and mining companies are taking some of the largest losses. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • U.S. stocks are slightly higher Friday. Technology stocks are rising as investors were pleased with economic reports from the U.S. and China. Financial stocks are up after several major U.S. banks reported strong third-quarter results, while energy companies are down as the price of oil falls. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 80 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,179 as of 11:10 a.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 5 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,138. The Nasdaq composite edged up 11 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,224. The Dow was up as much as 162 points earlier. VIDEOS TOP JOBS US ECONOMY HOPES: The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. The Labor Department said producer prices rose in September as the cost of energy and food increased, but inflation appeared to remain limited. CHINA INFLATION: Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, while the national producer price index, which measures inflation, rose for the first time since 2012. That could result in factories in China starting to pass rising costs to their consumers. Stocks fell Thursday as a report on imports and exports caused investors to worry that China's economic is weakening. Some of the largest losses went to tech companies, as China is a major market for them. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.43 while Intel rose 50 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.47 and Apple picked up 52 cents to $117.50. BANKS MAKE IT COUNT: JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup's results were better than investors expected. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, set aside more money to cover loans that could go bad, but it reported a big gain in deposits and originated more mortgages. Citigroup reported better results from its consumer banking business. Their stocks did not move much, but the reports may have raised investor hopes for the banks that will report their results next week. Citigroup added 9 cents to $48.57. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs gained $2.67, or 1.6 percent, to $170.09 and Morgan Stanley gained 32 cents, or 1 percent, to $32.06. DEPARTMENT STORE BLUES: While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department's report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl's lost $1.42, or 3.1 percent, to $43.70 and Macy's fell $1.30, or 3.5 percent, to $35.50. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged up to 1.76 percent from 1.75 percent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, which lets banks make bigger profits from lending. PRINTER JAM: Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. The company is trying to sell more high-end PCs, office printers and 3D printing systems as more people use smartphones and store documents and photos online. HP stock lost 48 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $14.67. INFOSYS IN TROBLE: Business consulting services company Infosys again cut its annual revenue projections after its second-quarter sales fell short of estimates. The stock shed 91 cents, or 5.5 percent, to $15.74. QUEASY: Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost $1.13, or 3 percent, to $36.75 and drug and generic ingredient maker Perrigo fell $1.76, or 2 percent, to $86.14. ENERGY: U.S. crude oil gave up 36 cents to $50.08 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 38 cents to $51.65 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. EOG Resources sank 71 cents to $94.79 and Devon Energy declined 48 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $43.42. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 103.91 yen from 103.60 yen. The euro rose to $1.10995 from $1.1053. OVERSEAS: France's CAC 40 jumped 1.5 percent and Germany's DAX rose 1.6 percent. In Britain the FTSE 100 advanced 0.5 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.4 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.9 percent. Thailand's SET index climbed 4.7 percent in the second day of trading after the death of Thailand's king. The SET fell 4 percent in September as investors worried about the monarch's health and even with the rally Friday the index fell 1.8 percent this week.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows NHL: Coyotes F Brad Richardson carted off ice on stretcher Utah lawmakers: Time to take 'training wheels' off booming solar industry, retire tax credit BYU football: UMass' struggles as independent, FBS newcomer, paint a cautionary tale Garrison Keillor: Politics is not everything.

Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the U.S. and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. "The retail sales numbers on the surface looked pretty good but when you dig into them they were not that great," said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "It seems like every good report we get, we get an offsetting weaker report." FILE - In this Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2014, file photo, American flags fly in front of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are falling early Thursday, Oct. 13, 2016, and following global markets lower after a steep drop in China¿s exports, a troubling sign for the second-largest economy in the world. Banks and mining companies are taking some of the largest losses. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) The Dow Jones industrial average, which had jumped as much as 162 points in the morning, finished up 39.44 points, or 0.2 percent, at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 inched up 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.83 points to 5,214.16. Goldman Sachs was responsible for most of the Dow's gains. It rose $3.10, or 1.9 percent, to $170.52 after Britain's High Court threw out a $1 billion lawsuit against the company. Libya's sovereign wealth fund had accused Goldman Sachs of duping the fund into making risky deals. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.80 percent from 1.75 percent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, and that allows banks to make bigger profits from lending. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results were better than investors expected. The reports may have raised investor hopes for companies that will report their results next week, like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock. "It was a good kickoff to earnings season" for banks, said Baele. "It was actually some decent revenue as well with both investment banking and trading." Rising bond yields attracted investors' attention, and they sold utilities, real estate investment trusts, and other stocks that pay large dividends as a result. Those payments are more appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields are low. PG&E Corp. fell 57 cents to $59.80 and Duke Energy slid 73 cents to $77.21. The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, which helped technology companies recover some of Thursday's losses. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.42 while Intel rose 48 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.45 and Apple picked up 68 cents to $117.66. While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department's report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl's lost $1.44, or 3.2 percent, to $43.68 and Macy's fell $1.23, or 3.3 percent, to $35.57. Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. HP stock lost 67 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $14.48. Twitter fell 91 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $16.88 after Salesforce.com told the Financial Times it isn't interested in buying the company. Twitter has lost 32 percent of its value since October 5th on reports that potential buyers were not going to make offers. Salesforce investors were not enthusiastic about the potential offer, and its stock jumped $3.64, or 5.2 percent, to $74.27. U.S. crude oil gave up 9 cents to $50.35 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 8 cents to $51.95 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost $1.39, or 3.7 percent, and closed at a three-year low of $36.49. Cancer drug maker Celgene sank $2.13, or 2.1 percent, to $98.50. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 1 cent to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas slumped 6 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold fell $2.10 to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver lost 2 cents to $17.44 an ounce. Copper slipped 1 cent to $2.11 a pound. The dollar rose to 104.18 yen from 103.60 yen. The euro rose to $1.0983 from $1.1053. France's CAC 40 jumped 1.5 percent and Germany's DAX rose 1.6 percent. In Britain the FTSE 100 advanced 0.5 percent.

Business Home LBoard ‘We can’t stop Umno members, who belong to NGOs, taking part’ Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Citigroup beats profit expectations on bond trading comeback Reuters | October 14, 2016 Revenue at Citi's institutional clients group, which includes trading and investment banking, rose 13 percent, boosted by volatility in fixed income markets. NEW YORK: Citigroup Inc, the fourth-biggest US bank by assets, beat expectations for third-quarter net profit on Friday after trading revenue surged 35 percent. The resurgence, which was echoed at rival JPMorgan, is a boost for Chief Executive Michael Corbat, who has stuck with the bank’s trading business while shrinking large parts of its consumer banking business in overseas markets. While net income fell 11 percent to $3.84 billion, or $1.24 per share, it exceeded the average estimate of $1.16 per share, according to Thomson Reuters. Total adjusted revenue fell 4 percent to $17.76 billion, again beating the average estimate of $17.36 billion. Citigroup’s shares rose 2.2 percent to $49.58 in early trading, similar to gains at rivals JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as investors lauded a solid start to the US bank earnings season. Both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit forecasts on Friday. Bank of America reports results on Monday, followed by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley later next week. Consumer banking Revenue at Citi’s institutional clients group, which includes trading and investment banking, rose 13 percent, boosted by volatility in fixed income markets. That volatility and greater activity were spurred by Britain’s June vote to leave the European Union, changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan, and money market reforms. However, equity market revenue fell about 34 percent as political uncertainty discouraged companies from initial public offerings and share offers. JPMorgan reported a 1 percent increase. Citi’s global consumer banking division had a less stellar performance. Net income fell by nearly a quarter due to a higher cost of credit and higher operating expenses. Part of those expenses were due to the cost of becoming the lender behind retailer Costco Wholesale Corp.’s co-branded credit cards this year from American Express Co. Citigroup said revenue from its North American branded card business grew 15 percent to $2.2 billion, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio as well as modest organic growth driven by higher volumes. The business accounts for about a quarter of its total net income and a third of profit from its global consumer franchises. Citigroup executives have said the branded card business is expected to generate a 2.3 percent return on assets, more than double the profitability of the entire company. Overall operating expenses fell 2.5 percent to $10.40 billion. Profit targets Despite the solid performance in investment banking, Corbat fell further behind in his quest to reach a 10 percent return on tangible common equity, a key measure of profitability. It fell to 7.8 percent from 8.9 percent a year earlier. Corbat had set the target of reaching a 10 percent return on equity by 2015 shortly after taking the reins in 2012. But the bank has found it hard to hit the target as its earnings are squeezed by low interest rates and the US Federal Reserve’s requirement that banks retain more capital. Analysts say the Fed would need to allow the bank to return as much as it earns to significantly improve shareholders’ returns and the Fed now lets Citi distribute about 65 percent of its capital. Corbat reached that level in June when he won approval from the regulator to triple the bank’s dividend and increase spending on its stock buybacks by more than a third. Previously, Citi had failed Fed tests of its capital plans twice. The bank’s common equity Tier 1 capital rose to 12.6 percent from 12.5 percent in the second quarter even as Citigroup returned capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. The stock had lost 6.3 percent this year as of Thursday’s closing price of $48.47. Citigroup’s stock has languished at a steep discount to its tangible book value, which was $64.71 at the end of September.

NEW YORK: US stocks opened higher Friday as a trio of leading banks beat analyst third quarter earnings forecasts despite the tough low interest rate environment. The three — Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup — all saw net profits fall as low rates pared lending margins, but they beat forecasts from analysts, driving their shares higher in early trade. About 30 minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 percent to 18,229.53. The broad-based S&P 500 added 0.6 percent at 2,146.22, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.7 percent to 5,251.99. Citigroup shares led the three reporting banks with a 2.5 percent gain, Wells Fargo rose 0.5 percent and JPMorgan 1.3 percent. Other banks yet to report for the quarter rode the wave higher: Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley both jumped more than 3 percent while Bank of America rose 2.2 percent. Also helping the market were fresh economic indicators pointing to a resilient economy; both retail sales and producer prices picked up in September. Underpinning that was a jump in key consumer and producer price indexes in China, with the producer price index showing the first year-on-year gain in almost five years. Among other stocks, two partially China plays. Intel gained 1.6 percent and Caterpillar 1.4 percent. Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices surged 7.5 percent, helped by a trading upgrade from Credit Suisse. Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

Financial shares finished up, giving the S&P 500 its biggest boost after stronger-than-expected bank results, but gave up most of their early gains. Healthcare shares led declines. Yellen, in a speech at a conference of policymakers and academics, laid out the deepening concern at the Fed that U.S. economic potential is slipping - and may need aggressive steps to rebuild it. "In looking at the market, I think, yes, (Yellen's speech) had a dovish tilt to it if you took it literally," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said Yellen's speech could suggest the U.S. central bank will stay accommodative for longer. Yellen did not address interest rates or immediate policy concerns directly. Traders have currently priced in a 67-percent chance of a rate hike in December. The S&P 500 financial index was up 0.5 percent. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup trounced third-quarter estimates. Wells Fargo & Co barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank. Shares of JPMorgan ended down 0.3 percent, however, while Citigroup ended up 0.3 percent and Wells Fargo was down 0.1 percent. Wells Fargo has been under pressure following recent revelations that branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge. The bank earnings somewhat helped shore up Wall Street's confidence on the outlook for third-quarter earnings after some disappointing results from industrial and healthcare companies. S&P 500 earnings for the quarter are still expected to have declined 0.4 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 39.44 points, or 0.22 percent, to 18,138.38, the S&P 500 gained 0.43 points, or 0.02 percent, to 2,132.98 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.83 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,214.16. For the week, the Dow was down 0.6 percent, the S&P 500 was down 1 percent and the Nasdaq fell 1.5 percent. Shares of Twitter fell 5.1 percent to US$16.88 after Salesforce.com's chief executive ruled out bidding for Twitter. Salesforce.com shares jumped 5.2 percent to US$74.27. HP Inc fell 4.4 percent to US$14.48 after the company said it would cut about 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years. About 6.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 27 new highs and 80 new lows.

Shares of JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, rose 1 percent after the lender beat estimates for revenue and profit. Citi rose 2.3 percent after its profit fell less than expected. The S&P 500 financial index soared 1.4 percent, far outdoing the other seven major sectors that were higher. Bank of America was the top influence on the S&P, while Goldman Sachs had a similar impact on the Dow. Investors are also awaiting Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech at noon in Boston, where she is likely to offer more insight into the growing sentiment among policymakers to raise interest rates relatively soon. Sustained growth in the labor market and improving inflation have encouraged Fed officials such as Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren, who told CNBC on Friday that the "very high" odds for a rate increase in December was appropriate. A report from the U.S. Commerce Department showed retail sales rebounded in September, helped by a surge in motor vehicle purchases. The measure rose 0.6 percent, compared to a fall of 0.2 percent in August. Major U.S. stock indexes have been swinging between losses and gains since Monday as uncertainty regarding the quarterly earnings season and the outcome of a tightly run U.S. presidential race threaten market valuations. At 9:36 a.m. ET (1336 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 136.39 points, or 0.75 percent, at 18,235.33. The S&P 500 was up 12.23 points, or 0.57 percent, at 2,144.78 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 32.62 points, or 0.63 percent, at 5,245.96. McDonald's fell 1.1 percent and was the biggest drag on the S&P after the fast-food chain operator announced charges related to strategic changes it had outlined last year. HP Inc fell 1.8 percent after the company said it would cut about 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years. "From a fundamental standpoint, investors are really hungry for clarity and a bullish catalyst," said Adam Sarhan, CEO of Sarhan Capital. "That will come from the Fed and from earnings today." Earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to have fallen about 0.7 percent in the third quarter but some investors hope that enough companies will beat analysts' expectations for the index to end the season with a slight gain. The dollar rose 0.35 percent, while prices of gold , a safe haven, dropped 0.34 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,011 to 623. On the Nasdaq, 1,626 issues rose and 526 fell. The S&P 500 index showed three new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded seven new highs and 12 new lows.

REUTERS/Eric Thayer/Files By Sweta Singh and David Henry JPMorgan Chase & Co beat forecasts for revenues and profits on Friday as global bond and currency markets roared back to life in the third quarter following Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Brexit-inspired volatility along with changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as money market reforms boosted trading revenue by 21 percent for JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, prompting pre tax profit to jump by one-third. JPMorgan's after tax income dropped 7.6 percent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of $2.2 billion a year earlier. Both revenues and profits topped analysts' estimates. Earnings per share fell to $1.58 from $1.68 a year ago. Analysts, on average, expected $1.39, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan is the first big U.S. bank to report third-quarter results and its performance gave Wall Street a shot in the arm. The bank's shares were up 1.6 percent at $68.84 in premarket trading while markets-focused rivals, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citi also rose. Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc, the third and fourth biggest U.S. banks by assets, also reported results on Friday. Citi earnings per share and revenues topped estimates. Wells Fargo earnings beat expectations. Bank of America Corp, the second biggest, will report on Monday. In addition to a fillip from Brexit, banks got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide. Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations. JPMorgan's total revenue rose 8 percent to $25.51 billion, beating the average estimate of $23.99 billion. With interest rates at record lows, the banking sector has relied on growing its loan book to boost income. However, total provisions for bad loans rose 86.4 percent to $1.27 billion. JPMorgan posted higher provisions for losses as it added loans and recorded charge-offs for oil and gas loans. Core loans in its commercial banking business grew 14 percent. JPMorgan expects income from lending to be up modestly in the fourth quarter. The Fed last raised rates in December, by 0.25 percentage points, after keeping them near zero for almost a decade. At the start of the year, further rate hikes were widely expected, but now Wall Street expects just one increase in December and possibly one more in 2017 JPMorgan's return on tangible common equity, a key performance measure, was 13 percent in the latest quarter, compared with the bank's longer-term target of about 15 percent.

"We've been talking [to clients] about it as an election of extreme, but a government of moderation, no matter who wins," the global market strategist said in an interview with CNBC's "Squawk Box." Santos conceded that the election will matter in certain "microsectors," but in terms of the larger U.S. economy, returns, and client investments, there is no need to wait for the election's outcome, she said. One area Santos is concerned about is trade, but on a broader scale than the candidates' differences on the matter. "If you think about trade as a big promoter of investment by companies, as a driver of productivity, as a driver of growth, … we are concerned to that extent about this recent rhetoric against trade," she said. show chapters <p>Three reasons to be positive on financials: Pro</p> <p>We expect consumer-related loans to pick up, says Gabriela Santos, J.P.

The strategist said consumer-related loans are overtaking commercial and industrial loans as the main drivers of loan growth for the financial sector. Consumers, who are prone to take out loans for mortgages and credit cards, will likely "pick up the tab" as commercial-driven loan growth takes a back seat, Santos said. Overall, the strategist has a positive outlook for financials for the fourth quarter and next year. ""Finally we're seeing the fading of a lot of the headwinds from the stronger dollar and from low oil prices," Santos said. "As these fade, you expect earnings to start turning positive." One caveat to her vision is that inflation pressures have so far been masked by the strong dollar and low oil prices, though they are causing health care, education, and rent prices to rise. "If we do get a little bit more wage growth with such a tight market, then inflation will definitely creep up next year," she said.

The major index futures are currently pointing to a higher open for the markets, with the Dow futures up by 88 points. Early buying interest may be generated in reaction to earnings from financial giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo all reported quarterly results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The futures remained positive following the release of a report from the Commerce Department showing that retail sales rose in line with economist estimates in the month of September. The Commerce Department said retail sales climbed by 0.6 percent in September after edging down by a revised 0.2 percent in August. Excluding a jump in auto sales, retail sales still rose by 0.5 percent in September after dipping by 0.2 percent in August. The increase in ex-auto sales also matched estimates. A separate report from the Labor Department showed that producer prices increased by slightly more than anticipated in September. The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand climbed by 0.3 percent in September after coming in unchanged in August. Economists had expected prices to edge up by 0.2 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, core producer prices rose by 0.2 percent in September after inching up by 0.1 percent in August. Core prices had been expected to show another 0.1 percent uptick. Shortly after the start of trading, traders will be presented with separate reports on consumer sentiment and business inventories. After falling sharply early in the trading session on Thursday, stocks regained some ground as the day progressed but still closed mostly lower. With the losses on the day, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 set one-month closing lows. The major averages finished the day moderately lower. The Dow dipped 45.26 points or 0.3 percent to 18,098.94, the Nasdaq slid 25.69 points or 0.5 percent to 5,213.33 and the S&P 500 fell 6.63 points or 0.3 percent to 2,132.55. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.5 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced by 0.9 percent. The major European markets have shown strong moves back to the upside. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has climbed by 0.9 percent, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index are up by 1.5 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. In commodities trading, crude oil futures for November delivery are climbing $0.32 to $50.76 barrel after rising $0.26 to $50.44 a barrel on Thursday. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,250.40 an ounce, down $7.20 from the previous session's close of $1,257.60 an ounce. On Thursday, gold rose $3.80. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 104.34 yen compared to the 103.71 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1009 compared to yesterday's $1.1056. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 More Commentary -Global Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary European Markets Pull Back On Light Data Day Stocks Showing A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Stocks May Show A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Wall Street On Slippery Grounds Sensex Falls For Fifth Day; Nifty Dips Marginally European Shares Fall As Banks And Miners Retreat FTSE 100 Drifts Lower As Stronger Dollar Hurts Commodity Stocks CAC 40 Slips Into Red As Banks Retreat DAX Rises As Volkswagen Outlines Turnaround Plan Asian Shares Recoup Early Losses European Shares To Open On Lackluster Note; Bank Stocks In Focus Sensex, Nifty Slip Into Red After Flat Start Asian Markets Mostly Higher Sensex, Nifty Seen Flat To Lower On Cash Crunch Worries <<Previous        82 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Volkswagen To Cut 23,000 Jobs In Germany Cyber Monday Sales Seen Soaring LinkedIn Is Now Blocked In Russia Facebook Stops WhatsApp Data Sharing Across Europe Over EU Criticism Wal-Mart Q3 Profit Declines, But Lifts FY17 Profit View; Stock Down JPMorgan Nears Over $250 Mln Settlement Over China Hiring Probe: Reports Comeback Kid: Donald Trump Hugely Resilient In Business, Too Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates United Airlines Announces Plans For Long-term Earnings Growth FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone LinkedIn Is Now Blocked In Russia AAA: Low Gas Prices Drive Spike In Thanksgiving Travel Upgrade: Steel Stocks In For Trump Renaissance All Is Well With ACRS, First Avastin Biosimilar In The Works, CLRB Abuzz Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Vonovia Offers 0.496645 Shares/conwert Shr Or Alternative Cash Of EUR 16.16/shr United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Novartis Reportedly Considering Sale Of Alcon Eye Care Division Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars United Airlines Announces Plans For Long-term Earnings Growth Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet AT&T Stream Saver To Limit Video Quality To 480p Genentech: Actemra Meets Endpoints In Phase III GiACTA Study Digi Rejects $13.82/shr Proposal From Belden - Quick Facts Schnuck Markets Recalls Ready-to-eat Grilled Chicken Products Kidde Recalls 3.6 Mln Combination Smoke And Carbon Monoxide Detectors Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

The bank's net income fell to $6.29 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $6.80 billion in the same quarter of 2015. Earnings per share fell to $1.58 from $1.68. The year-earlier net profit was boosted by a tax benefit of $2.2 billion. On a pre-tax basis, profit rose 32.8 percent to $8.94 billion, helped by a drop in non-interest expenses and a slight increase in revenue following the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike last December, the first since the financial crisis. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.39 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan is the first big U.S. bank to report third-quarter results. Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc, the third and fourth-biggest U.S. banks by assets, are scheduled to report later on Friday. Bank of America Corp, the second biggest, will report on Monday. JPMorgan's total revenue rose 8.4 percent to $25.51 billion, beating the average estimate of $23.99 billion, helped by volatile trading following Britain's vote on June 23 to leave the European Union and speculation surrounding monetary policies in the United States, Europe and Japan. Revenue from fixed-income trading increased 47.8 percent to $4.33 billion, while investment banking revenue rose 13.7 percent to $1.74 billion. "We delivered strong results this quarter with each of our businesses performing well," Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement. JPMorgan's shares were up 1.65 percent at $68.86 in premarket trading. The bank's non-interest expenses fell 5.9 percent to $14.46 billion. Like other lenders, JPMorgan has been cutting costs to help make up for weak revenue from lending and capital markets as well as near record-low low interest rates. The Fed raised rates by 0.25 percentage points in December. At the start of the year, more hikes were widely expected this year but none have materialized, in part due to the Brexit vote. Low interest rates have been holding down bank profits for years and bank executives have been pining for another increase. Many Fed watchers now believe that will happen in December. JPMorgan's return on tangible common equity, a key performance measure, was 13 percent in the latest quarter, compared with the bank's longer-term target of about 15 percent. Total provisions for bad loans rose 86.4 percent to $1.27 billion. Up to Thursday's close, JPMorgan's shares had risen 2.6 percent since the start of the year.

"I've found no systemic issues," she said. Lake, however, explained that "it's impossible to have zero defects," acknowledging that there have been some instances of cross-selling issues of their own. Attentions are turned to the subject since Wells Fargo become the focus of intense criticism and multiple investigations as a result of a phony bank accounts scandal. That bank paid $185 million in penalties for opening roughly 2 million consumer deposit and credit card accounts without customer authorization. Wells' John Stumpf retired Wednesday as chairman and CEO at the bank, which still faces a number of ongoing investigations by regulators, as well as private lawsuits. On the JPMorgan earnings call, Lake said the bank is focused on developing "deep customer relationships," so cross-selling is an outcome, but not necessarily an objective. JPMorgan announced Friday that it had easily topped expectations for its third-quarter results, saying it had seen strong loan growth. The bank reported quarterly earnings of $1.58 per share on revenue of $25.51 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.39 a share on about $24 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. —CNBC's Wilfred Frost contributed to this report.

 JPMorgan smashed it out of the park thanks to growth in one huge business Portia Crowe Oct. 14, 2016, 7:58 AM 16,897 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Kimberly White/Getty Images JPMorgan kicked off earnings season for banks on Friday and crushed it. The firm beat analyst expectations across investment banking and trading — and had a historically strong quarter in one business in particular. In fixed-income trading, JPMorgan reported revenue of $4.33 billion for the quarter — up 45% from the same quarter a year ago — smashing analyst expectations for $3.17 billion. The beat was driven by higher revenue in rates, credit, and securitized products, the firm said in a statement. Overall, JPMorgan reported earnings of $24.67 billion, better than analyst expectations for $24.25 billion. Earnings per share of $1.58 also beat an expected $1.39. Speaking on a conference call to discuss the results, CFO Marianne Lake said the rates business was the bank's standout performer, with more activity taking place after Britain's vote to leave the European Union. She added that rates performance remained consistently strong throughout the quarter, in part because of central-bank activity. Lake also said credit was "a comeback story" following a challenging period there. JPMorgan's banking and trading revenue breakdown. JPMorgan That's a huge quarter for the division. In fact, it's the biggest for JPMorgan since the first quarter of 2013, when the firm reported fixed-income revenue of $4.8 billion. And it comes in a period that is usually one of the quietest of the year thanks to a summer trading lull. First quarters are usually the strongest for trading businesses. This could be good news for Wall Street. If you've been paying attention to the fixed income, currencies, and commodities, or FICC, world, you know that business has had a terrible run in recent years. FICC revenue fell 9% across major banks in 2015. Many firms have been cutting FICC headcount, including Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, which cut 25% of the division last year. But as most firms began to turn away from the business, JPMorgan said it would stick to its guns. "We're investing in it," CEO Jamie Dimon said at the bank's investor day in February. "We're investing in it more on the technology side." Lake, the CFO, later echoed that sentiment, saying at the time that JPMorgan's fixed-income markets business continued to perform as its rivals retrenched. That seemed to be paying off in the second quarter this year, when JPMorgan reported solid revenue of $3.96 billion for the business. There was some question at the time over whether the so-called Brexit had had a significant impact on banks' FICC trading revenue during that quarter. Coalition When the UK decided in June to leave the European Union, JPMorgan posted record foreign-exchange trading volumes, at one point processing 1,000 trading tickets a second, Dimon said. That would have had an impact on the firm's foreign-exchange revenue, but JPMorgan was up in numerous divisions, including rates, credit, emerging markets, and securitized products. Multiple analysts, including Deutsche Bank's Matt O'Connor, UBS' Brennan Hawken, and Macquarie's Piers Brown predicted a stronger quarter in FICC, especially for JPMorgan.

The bank said earnings were $1.58 a share versus an expected $1.39. Newslook The JPMorgan Chase logo is displayed Oct. 21, 2013., at its headquarters in New York. (Photo: Seth Wenig, AP) Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase posted lower third-quarter profits but easily glided past expectations. JPMorgan (JPM) recorded third-quarter net income of $6.29 billion, down 7.6% from the same period a year earlier. On a per-share basis, earnings were $1.58, beating S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates of $1.38. Citi (C) posted third-quarter net income of $3.84 billion, down 10.% from a year earlier. On a per-share basis, earnings were $1.24, edging S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates of $1.15. Taken together, the performances reflect a measure of underlying resilience despite low interest rates and regulatory pressure that have applied pressure to the bottom line for big banks. Stocks of both companies got a jolt early Friday before relinquishing much of this gains in afternoon trading.  Citi shares were up 0.5% to $48.70 at 1:46 p.m. JPMorgan shares were up a penny to $67.75. For JPMorgan, revenue rose 8.4% to $25.51 billion, smashing expectations of $23.69 billion. The company attributed growth to solid performances in commercial banking, asset management, investment banking, and consumer loans, deposits and credit cards. “We delivered strong results this quarter with each of our businesses performing well," JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement. In the banking industry, all eyes are trained on Wells Fargo after the bank's practice of opening fake customer accounts was exposed, leading to a massive fine and the exit of CEO John Stumpf. Wells Fargo has come under fire for providing incentives to retail bankers to open new accounts. JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told CNBC that the bank will conduct a "deep dive" to assess the bank's own cross-selling practices. But she told investors in a conference call that the bank reviews its own selling practices "at least annually to make sure they continue to be aligned with our objectives." She said cross-selling is an "outcome" stemming from a desire for "deep customer relationships," not an upfront "objective." For Citi, revenue declined 5% to $17.8 billion, outpacing expectations of $17.3 billion. In a statement, Citi CEO Michael Corbat attributed the better-than-expected performance to "underlying momentum across our franchise," especially institutional clients. The institutional clients wing of Citi recorded a 12.9% increase in net income to $2.75 billion. But consumer banking dragged down profit, as its net income fell 23.6% to $1.29 billion. The company's consumer banking in Latin America is especially struggling. In JPMorgan's corporate and investment banking division, net income nearly doubled to $2.91 billion, with revenue increasing 15.8% to $9.46 billion. Profit on the consumer and community banking side fell 16.2% to $2.2 billion, but revenue rose 4.1% to $11.3 billion. "Recovery in the energy sector and central bank actions motivated clients to put money to work and a stronger new issuance environment resulted in a stronger quarter," Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a note to investors. JPMorgan said it expects fourth-quarter net interest income to rise "modestly" quarter-over-quarter "on continued strength in loan growth."

On Friday, Oct. 14, 2016, JPMorgan Chase reports financial results. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) NEW YORK, N.Y. - JPMorgan Chase's third-quarter profits fell 8 per cent from a year earlier, the bank said Friday, as higher revenue in retail and investment banking was offset as the bank had to put aside more money to cover loans that might go bad. The results still beat Wall Street's expectations, however, and JPMorgan Chase's stock rose in early pre-market trading. The largest U.S. bank by assets and revenue said it earned $6.29 billion in the quarter, or $1.58 per share, down from a profit of $6.80 billion, or $1.68 per share, in the same period a year earlier. The results beat the $1.39 per share analysts were looking for, according to FactSet. "We delivered strong results this quarter with each of our businesses performing well," JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon said in prepared remarks. As it has been for several quarters now, JPMorgan remained under pressure from the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates at near record low levels. Banks are directly impacted by low interest rates because it inhibits their ability to charge more in interest when their customers borrow. In JPMorgan's consumer bank, its largest division by revenue, reported a 16 per cent decline in net income from a year ago to $2.20 billion. JPMorgan was able to increase deposits sharply in the quarter and also originated more mortgages, but it had to set aside more money to cover potentially bad loans in its credit card and auto divisions. The bank also said it had increased promotional and new credit card account costs in the quarter, likely tied to the interest in the bank's Chase Sapphire Reserve card which debuted in the quarter to unexpectedly strong demand. JPMorgan's investment bank had a particularly strong quarter, with pre-tax profit of $2.91 billion, double its earnings from a year earlier. A large driver of the gain was the bank's bond trading desks, where revenue rose 48 per cent from a year earlier, compared to the 1 per cent rise in revenue in stock trading. Investment banking advisory fees, which are earned when JPMorgan's bankers help companies issue debt, merge, acquire or issue stock, was up 14 per cent from a year ago. Revenue rose to $24.67 billion, compared with $22.78 billion in the same period a year earlier. JPMorgan's stock rose 1.4 per cent in pre-market trading. ___ Ken Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

Their shares and those of other U.S. banks rose more than 1 percent. * Data from China showed producer prices rose unexpectedly in September, marking the first increase in nearly five years and easing some worries about the health of the world's second largest economy. * Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak at a conference in Boston, where she is likely to address the growing sentiment among policymakers for a U.S. interest rate hike in the near term. Her speech is due at 13:30 p.m. ET (1730 GMT). Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren is also expected to speak at the event. * Investors are also awaiting a reading on September retail sales, which likely rose 0.6 percent after dropping 0.3 percent the previous month. The report will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. * Wall Street slipped on Thursday, as financial stocks fell and a larger-than-expected fall in Chinese exports spooked global markets. * Oil prices, which helped limit losses on Thursday, were up 0.88 percent on a drop in U.S. fuel inventories. * Major U.S. stock indexes have been swinging between losses and gains since Monday as uncertainty regarding the quarterly earnings season and the outcome of a tightly run U.S. presidential race threaten market valuations. * Earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to have fallen about 0.7 percent in the third quarter but some investors hope that enough companies will beat analysts' expectations for the index to end the season with a slight gain. * Deutsche Bank's Frankfurt-listed stock was up 3.4 percent, after senior executives told Reuters that the outflows the German lender had seen in its wealth management business were not significant. Deutsche Bank's U.S. shares rose 2.3 percent in premarket trading. Futures snapshot at 7:04 a.m. ET: * Dow e-minis were up 90 points, or 0.5 percent, with 27,122 contracts changing hands. * S&P 500 e-minis were up 9.75 points, or 0.46 percent, with 154,186 contracts traded. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 21 points, or 0.44 percent, on volume of 21,873 contracts.

The results still beat Wall Street's expectations, however, and JPMorgan Chase's stock rose in early pre-market trading. The largest U.S. bank by assets and revenue said it earned $6.29 billion in the quarter, or $1.58 per share, down from a profit of $6.80 billion, or $1.68 per share, in the same period a year earlier. The results beat the $1.39 per share analysts were looking for, according to FactSet. In this Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2016, photo, a new Chase bank branch opens at the World Trade Center in New York. On Friday, Oct. 14, 2016, JPMorgan Chase reports financial results. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) "We delivered strong results this quarter with each of our businesses performing well," JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon said in prepared remarks. As it has been for several quarters now, JPMorgan remained under pressure from the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates at near record low levels. Banks are directly impacted by low interest rates because it inhibits their ability to charge more in interest when their customers borrow. In JPMorgan's consumer bank, its largest division by revenue, reported a 16 percent decline in net income from a year ago to $2.20 billion. JPMorgan was able to increase deposits sharply in the quarter and also originated more mortgages, but it had to set aside more money to cover potentially bad loans in its credit card and auto divisions. The bank also said it had increased promotional and new credit card account costs in the quarter, likely tied to the interest in the bank's Chase Sapphire Reserve card which debuted in the quarter to unexpectedly strong demand. JPMorgan's investment bank had a particularly strong quarter, with pre-tax profit of $2.91 billion, double its earnings from a year earlier. A large driver of the gain was the bank's bond trading desks, where revenue rose 48 percent from a year earlier, compared to the 1 percent rise in revenue in stock trading. Investment banking advisory fees, which are earned when JPMorgan's bankers help companies issue debt, merge, acquire or issue stock, was up 14 percent from a year ago. Revenue rose to $24.67 billion, compared with $22.78 billion in the same period a year earlier. JPMorgan's stock rose 1.4 percent in pre-market trading. ___ Ken Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press. Follow him on Twitter at @kensweet.

Brexit-inspired volatility along with changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as money market reforms boosted trading revenue by 21 percent for JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, prompting pretax profit to jump by one-third. JPMorgan's aftertax income dropped 7.6 percent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of $2.2 billion a year earlier. Both revenues and profits topped analysts' estimates. Earnings per share fell to $1.58 from $1.68 a year ago. Analysts, on average, expected $1.39, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan is the first big U.S. bank to report third-quarter results and its performance gave Wall Street a shot in the arm. The bank's shares were up 1.6 percent at $68.84 in premarket trading while markets-focused rivals, including Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and Citi also rose. Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc, the third and fourth biggest U.S. banks by assets, also reported results on Friday. Citi earnings per share and revenues topped estimates. Wells Fargo earnings beat expectations. Bank of America Corp, the second biggest, will report on Monday. In addition to a fillip from Brexit, banks got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide. Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations. JPMorgan's total revenue rose 8 percent to $25.51 billion, beating the average estimate of $23.99 billion. With interest rates at record lows, the banking sector has relied on growing its loan book to boost income. However, total provisions for bad loans rose 86.4 percent to $1.27 billion. JPMorgan posted higher provisions for losses as it added loans and recorded charge-offs for oil and gas loans. Core loans in its commercial banking business grew 14 percent. JPMorgan expects income from lending to be up modestly in the fourth quarter. The Fed last raised rates in December, by 0.25 percentage points, after keeping them near zero for almost a decade. At the start of the year, further rate hikes were widely expected, but now Wall Street expects just one increase in December and possibly one more in 2017 JPMorgan's return on tangible common equity, a key performance measure, was 13 percent in the latest quarter, compared with the bank's longer-term target of about 15 percent.

The bank's net income fell to $6.29 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $6.80 billion in the same quarter of 2015. Earnings per share fell to $1.58 from $1.68. The year-earlier net profit was boosted by a tax benefit of $2.2 billion. On a pre-tax basis, profit rose 32.8 percent to $8.94 billion, helped by a drop in non-interest expenses and a slight increase in revenue following the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike last December, the first since the financial crisis. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.39 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear if the reported figures were comparable. JPMorgan is the first big U.S. bank to report third-quarter results. Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc, the third and fourth-biggest U.S. banks by assets, are scheduled to report later on Friday. Bank of America Corp, the second biggest, will report on Monday.

In a landmark case, the Financial Services Authority is challenging a lower court decision that it improperly identified Achilles Macris when it fined JPMorgan 138 million pounds ($170 million) over the so-called "London Whale" scandal in 2013. The hearing in the Supreme Court, which could take three months to publish a judgment, is being closely watched by lawyers as it will set a precedent for seven similar cases in which traders say they were unfairly criticised in FCA penalty notices but were unable to contest findings. Macris was the former chief investment officer of JPMorgan's synthetic credit portfolio team in London, which ran up $6.2 billion in losses in 2012 in what were called the "London Whale" trades because of their magnitude. The bank was fined $1.0 billion by U.S. and UK regulators for management failings. The 55-year-old Greek citizen has so far argued successfully that the FCA's reference in its JPMorgan enforcement notice to "CIO London management" referred to a particular individual and not to a body of people. Former Deutsche Bank trader Christian Bittar won a similar case last year after arguing that although he had not been named, he had been identified when the FCA fined the bank in a rate rigging investigation in 2015. The debate hinges in part on how the identification principle should be broadened beyond the use of proper names or unique job titles, as those working in financial services can be more easily identified by peers than ordinary readers. THIRD PARTY RIGHTS The FCA's enforcement notices do not name individuals but they often use references such as "Trader A" or "Manager B" when publishing details of electronic messages or emails to illustrate wrongdoing. Individuals who are identified have a right to respond to the FCA before notices are published, can refer adverse comment to a tribunal and ask the FCA to disclose relevant material. Some lawyers say the legal debate risks disrupting the regulatory process and limiting the FCA's scope to criticise companies. Others say there are bigger issues at stake. "The real concern is not third party rights but the regulators' practice of investigating and settling with the institutions before dealing with any individuals caught up in the case," said Harvey Knight, a lawyer at Withers in London. "Consequently, individuals have to contend with a case that their former employer has already settled with their regulators and the die is cast before these individuals are given any right of reply." Macris was fined almost 800,000 pounds by the FCA in February for failing to be "open and cooperative" with the regulator as losses mounted in the JPMorgan division he oversaw between March and April 2012. Macris, who has spent the last four years trying to clear his name, at the time called the fine a "major climbdown" by the FCA. Bittar, along with five other former traders, faces a criminal trial next September over alleged conspiracy to manipulate Euribor interest rates.

The Financial Conduct Authority asked the Supreme Court to overturn a ruling that it failed to properly hide the identity of Achilles Macris, the former JPMorgan Chase & Co. manager of the so-called London Whale trader, in a settlement with the bank three years ago. If the Macris ruling is upheld, the FCA may have to overhaul how it presents all its reports. For years the FCA has used monikers such as “Trader A” in settlement notices with firms to get around a requirement that a person must be given the chance to respond to allegations if they’re identified. The anonymity allows the agency to illustrate misconduct by publishing real chatroom transcripts that demonstrate the behavior.  "The person who is prejudiced has to be identified,” Jonathan Crow, a lawyer for the FCA, told the five-judge panel Thursday, arguing that Macris was never identified in any regulatory notices. "If a collective label is used, a person has not been identified." Traders have fought back over recent years, claiming the FCA doesn’t go far enough in disguising them. Macris’s lawsuit is one of a number the FCA is facing, but the first to reach the U.K.’s top court. London Whale In Macris’s case, JPMorgan was fined 138 million pounds ($168 million) in 2013 after a trader nicknamed the London Whale incurred $6.2 billion in losses. The FCA referred throughout the notice to “CIO London management,” which Macris contended easily identified him because he was responsible for JPMorgan’s chief investment office in Europe and was based in London. So far, the U.K. courts have agreed with him. "If you use generic phrases like management and senior management and you have to find out from outside the notice what the management structure was, then the notice is not doing the identifying," Crow said. Lawyers for Macris said that he was clearly identified in the notice and that he should’ve been allowed to respond to the FCA’s findings before they were published in the JPMorgan settlement documents. Other traders suing the FCA over the issue include ex-Deutsche Bank AG trader Christian Bittar, who claims he was identifiable in the German lender’s Libor settlement last year, and Julien Grout, another former JPMorgan trader involved in the London Whale case. The issue isn’t necessarily identification, but that regulators settle with banks before dealing with individuals making it difficult to defend their actions, according to Harvey Knight, a London lawyer who isn’t involved in the lawsuit. "The real concern is not third-party rights, but the regulators’ practice of investigating and settling with the institutions before dealing with any individuals caught up in the case," said Knight, a partner at Withers. "Consequently individuals have to contend with a case that their former employer has already settled with their regulators and the die is cast before these individuals are given any right of reply." Macris oversaw JPMorgan’s Chief Investment Office in Europe where trader Bruno Iksil made market-distorting bets on derivatives. Iksil’s bad bets led to more than $900 million in penalties from regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the FCA. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:40 AM, October 15, 2016 Updated: 5:55 AM, October 16, 2016 NEW YORK - JPMorgan Chase <JPM.N> and Citigroup <C.N> trounced third-quarter estimates on Friday on a sharp rebound in trading revenues while Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N> barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank. Wells Fargo is under pressure to keep its profit engine humming while dismantling the aggressive sales culture at the heart of its woes, since unlike JPMorgan and Citigroup it does not have a big trading arm. "We're prepared for things to get worse before they get better," Chief Executive Tim Sloan, who took over as boss on Wednesday after John Stumpf, the bank's veteran leader, announced he was leaving amid a public furor over the scandal. Revelations that Wells' branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge to meet internal sales targets has shattered the bank's folksy image. Once a Wall Street darling for its ability to sell multiple products to individual customers, Wells Fargo said on Friday that new account openings had dropped sharply. New consumer checking accounts were 30 percent lower than in August, and applications for consumer credit cards fell 30 percent in September from the prior month. Wells Fargo's staff are in a period of flux after the bank scrapped sales targets for branches last month and in a note following Sloan's presentation, Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at KBW, said, “Management doesn’t know what the consumer bank will look like in the future." The bank has said the scandal will minimally affect its wealth management business and was unlikely to alter its plans to return capital to shareholders. On Friday, the state of Ohio joined a growing list of municipalities to suspend business relationships with Wells Fargo. The bank makes less than 1 percent of its revenue from working with local governments but Ohio's decision is a blow, coming days after Stumpf, a lightning rod for much of the criticism around the scandal, had departed. Sloan must navigate federal and state investigations in coming months. The scandal has renewed left-leaning lawmakers' attacks on Wall Street and bolstered their mission to introduce stricter oversight. JPMORGAN MOMENTUM CONTINUES While Wells Fargo's overall profit dropped for a fourth straight quarter, net income in the third quarter topped estimates, helped in part by lower-than-expected loan-loss provisions. JPMorgan and Citi also beat expectations as bond trading roared back in the third quarter, boosted by Brexit-inspired volatility along with changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as money market reforms. Banks got a fillip from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, which moved to a seven-year high during the quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings of short-term bank debt in advance of new U.S. regulations. JPMorgan's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said the fourth quarter so far is showing positive signs. "The momentum that I just characterized as fairly broad and fairly consistent across the (third) quarter, has somewhat continued so far," she told journalists. JPMorgan's after-tax income dropped 7.6 percent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of $2.2 billion a year earlier. But revenues and profits both topped analysts' estimates. Citigroup, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, beat expectations for third-quarter net profit after trading revenue surged 35 percent. While net income fell 11 percent to $1.24 per share, it exceeded the average estimate of $1.16 per share. Total adjusted revenue fell 4 percent to $17.76 billion, but beat the average estimate of $17.36 billion. The strong trading performance helped U.S. financial stocks snap a three-day losing streak, with markets-focused bank shares such as Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and Morgan Stanley <MS.N> up 2 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, ahead of their results next week. Citigroup was up over 0.8 percent in late trade after earlier rising as much as 3 percent. JPMorgan tipped into negative territory after earlier gaining as much as 2 percent. Wells Fargo was up 0.25 percent. The S&P financial index <.SPSY> gained 0.85 percent. The British government's tougher line on immigration in the wake of the Brexit vote has bankers preparing for a scenario in which London loses access to the single market, meaning they would have to move parts of their operations elsewhere in Europe. "As a result, we will be starting to build out technology systems and operations in Europe," JPMorgan's Lake said.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) FILE - In this Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2014, file photo, American flags fly in front of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are falling early Thursday, Oct. 13, 2016, and following global markets lower after a steep drop in China’s exports, a troubling sign for the second-largest economy in the world. Banks and mining companies are taking some of the largest losses. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • U.S. stocks gave up large gains and finished barely higher Friday. Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the U.S. and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. "The retail sales numbers on the surface looked pretty good but when you dig into them they were not that great," said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "It seems like every good report we get, we get an offsetting weaker report." VIDEOS TOP JOBS The Dow Jones industrial average, which had jumped as much as 162 points in the morning, finished up 39.44 points, or 0.2 percent, at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 inched up 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.83 points to 5,214.16. Goldman Sachs was responsible for most of the Dow's gains. It rose $3.10, or 1.9 percent, to $170.52 after Britain's High Court threw out a $1 billion lawsuit against the company. Libya's sovereign wealth fund had accused Goldman Sachs of duping the fund into making risky deals. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.80 percent from 1.75 percent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, and that allows banks to make bigger profits from lending. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results were better than investors expected. The reports may have raised investor hopes for companies that will report their results next week, like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock. "It was a good kickoff to earnings season" for banks, said Baele. "It was actually some decent revenue as well with both investment banking and trading." Rising bond yields attracted investors' attention, and they sold utilities, real estate investment trusts, and other stocks that pay large dividends as a result. Those payments are more appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields are low. PG&E Corp. fell 57 cents to $59.80 and Duke Energy slid 73 cents to $77.21. The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, which helped technology companies recover some of Thursday's losses. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.42 while Intel rose 48 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.45 and Apple picked up 68 cents to $117.66. While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department's report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl's lost $1.44, or 3.2 percent, to $43.68 and Macy's fell $1.23, or 3.3 percent, to $35.57. Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. HP stock lost 67 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $14.48. Twitter fell 91 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $16.88 after Salesforce.com told the Financial Times it isn't interested in buying the company.

ALSO READ Wall St. sets another record as JPMorgan leads banks higher Wall Street banks remain top choice for new MBAs - survey Wall Street ends flat as banks gain, Apple drags Wall Street falls as investors fret about big banks By David Henry and Dan Freed NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup trounced third-quarter estimates on Friday on a sharp rebound in trading revenues while Wells Fargo & Co barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank. Wells Fargo is under pressure to keep its profit engine humming while dismantling the aggressive sales culture at the heart of its woes, since unlike JPMorgan and Citigroup it does not have a big trading arm. "We're prepared for things to get worse before they get better," Chief Executive Tim Sloan, who took over as boss on Wednesday after John Stumpf, the bank's veteran leader, announced he was leaving amid a public furore over the scandal. Revelations that Wells' branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge to meet internal sales targets has shattered the bank's folksy image. Once a Wall Street darling for its ability to sell multiple products to individual customers, Wells Fargo said on Friday that new account openings had dropped sharply. New consumer checking accounts were 30 percent lower than in August, and applications for consumer credit cards fell 30 percent in September from the prior month. Wells Fargo's staff are in a period of flux after the bank scrapped sales targets for branches last month and in a note following Sloan's presentation, Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at KBW, said, "Management doesn't know what the consumer bank will look like in the future." The bank has said the scandal will minimally affect its wealth management business and was unlikely to alter its plans to return capital to shareholders. On Friday, the state of Ohio joined a growing list of municipalities to suspend business relationships with Wells Fargo. The bank makes less than 1 percent of its revenue from working with local governments but Ohio's decision is a blow, coming days after Stumpf, a lightning rod for much of the criticism around the scandal, had departed. Sloan must navigate federal and state investigations in coming months. The scandal has renewed left-leaning lawmakers' attacks on Wall Street and bolstered their mission to introduce stricter oversight. JPMORGAN MOMENTUM CONTINUES While Wells Fargo's overall profit dropped for a fourth straight quarter, net income in the third quarter topped estimates, helped in part by lower-than-expected loan-loss provisions. JPMorgan and Citi also beat expectations as bond trading roared back in the third quarter, boosted by Brexit-inspired volatility along with changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as money market reforms. Banks got a fillip from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, which moved to a seven-year high during the quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings of short-term bank debt in advance of new U.S. regulations. JPMorgan's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said the fourth quarter so far is showing positive signs. "The momentum that I just characterized as fairly broad and fairly consistent across the (third) quarter, has somewhat continued so far," she told journalists. JPMorgan's after-tax income dropped 7.6 percent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of $2.2 billion a year earlier. But revenues and profits both topped analysts' estimates. Citigroup, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, beat expectations for third-quarter net profit after trading revenue surged 35 percent. While net income fell 11 percent to $1.24 per share, it exceeded the average estimate of $1.16 per share. Total adjusted revenue fell 4 percent to $17.76 billion, but beat the average estimate of $17.36 billion. The strong trading performance helped U.S. financial stocks snap a three-day losing streak, with markets-focused bank shares such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley up 2 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, ahead of their results next week. Citigroup was up over 0.8 percent in late trade after earlier rising as much as 3 percent. JPMorgan tipped into negative territory after earlier gaining as much as 2 percent. Wells Fargo was up 0.25 percent. The S&P financial index <.SPSY> gained 0.85 percent. The British government's tougher line on immigration in the wake of the Brexit vote has bankers preparing for a scenario in which London loses access to the single market, meaning they would have to move parts of their operations elsewhere in Europe. "As a result, we will be starting to build out technology systems and operations in Europe," JPMorgan's Lake said.

USA TODAY Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 7, 2016. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) Stocks closed higher Friday but pulled back from earlier highs after three big U.S. banks reported quarterly profits that topped forecasts, boosting hopes on Wall Street that third-quarter earnings will be better than feared and mark the end of the so-called earnings recession. Powered by upbeat bank earnings, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 39 points, or 0.4%, to 18,138 after being up as much as 160 points earlier. The broad Standard & Poor's 500 stock index was up less than 0.1% to 2133 and the Nasdaq composite added less than 0.1% to 5214. Before the opening bell, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC), which is embroiled in a crisis over fraudulently opening customer accounts, all posted profit and sales numbers that exceeded analyst expectations. Bank shares were mixed after sharp early gains. Shares of JPMorgan were down 0.3% and Citigroup stock was 0.3% higher. Wells Fargo was flat. USA TODAY Ghosts of Octobers past haunt Wall Street Wall Street is hoping the S&P 500 will break a string of four straight quarters of contracting profit growth when the third-quarter earnings season is complete. Investors also digested remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. She said in prepared remarks the Fed may want to keep interest rates lower for longer to reverse the prolonged negative effects of the Great Recession. USA TODAY Yellen: Keeping rates low may heal economy U.S. retail sales rose 0.6% in September, coming in line with forecasts, another signal that the U.S. consumer is holding up well. Inflation at the producer level rose 0.3% last month, more than the 0.2% consensus estimate, according to the latest monthly reading on the producer price index. The trio of bank beats in the U.S. provided a lift to stocks in Europe. The broad Stoxx Europe 600 index was 1.3% higher, and the German DAX was up 1.6% and the CAC 40 in Paris was 1.5% higher.

The scandal has renewed left-leaning lawmakers' attacks on Wall Street and bolstered their mission to introduce stricter oversight.JPMORGAN MOMENTUM CONTINUES While Wells Fargo's overall profit dropped for a fourth straight quarter, net income in the third quarter topped estimates, helped in part by lower-than-expected loan-loss provisions. JPMorgan and Citi also beat expectations as bond trading roared back in the third quarter, boosted by Brexit-inspired volatility along with changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as money market reforms.Banks got a fillip from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, which moved to a seven-year high during the quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings of short-term bank debt in advance of new U.S. regulations.JPMorgan's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said the fourth quarter so far is showing positive signs."The momentum that I just characterized as fairly broad and fairly consistent across the (third) quarter, has somewhat continued so far," she told journalists.JPMorgan's after-tax income dropped 7.6 percent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of $2.2 billion a year earlier. But revenues and profits both topped analysts' estimates. Citigroup, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, beat expectations for third-quarter net profit after trading revenue surged 35 percent.While net income fell 11 percent to $1.24 per share, it exceeded the average estimate of $1.16 per share. Total adjusted revenue fell 4 percent to $17.76 billion, but beat the average estimate of $17.36 billion.The strong trading performance helped U.S. financial stocks snap a three-day losing streak, with markets-focused bank shares such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) up 2 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, ahead of their results next week. Citigroup was up over 0.8 percent in late trade after earlier rising as much as 3 percent. JPMorgan tipped into negative territory after earlier gaining as much as 2 percent. Wells Fargo was up 0.25 percent. The S&P financial index .SPSY gained 0.85 percent.The British government's tougher line on immigration in the wake of the Brexit vote has bankers preparing for a scenario in which London loses access to the single market, meaning they would have to move parts of their operations elsewhere in Europe."As a result, we will be starting to build out technology systems and operations in Europe," JPMorgan's Lake said.

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive Dow closes up 39 points Friday Oct 14, 2016 at 11:41 AM Oct 14, 2016 at 4:51 PM The Associated Press NEW YORK  — U.S. stocks gave up large gains and finished barely higher Friday. Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the U.S. and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. "The retail sales numbers on the surface looked pretty good but when you dig into them they were not that great," said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "It seems like every good report we get, we get an offsetting weaker report." The Dow Jones industrial average, which had jumped as much as 162 points in the morning, finished up 39.44 points, or 0.2 percent, at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 inched up 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.83 points to 5,214.16. Goldman Sachs was responsible for most of the Dow's gains. It rose $3.10, or 1.9 percent, to $170.52 after Britain's High Court threw out a $1 billion lawsuit against the company. Libya's sovereign wealth fund had accused Goldman Sachs of duping the fund into making risky deals. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.80 percent from 1.75 percent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, and that allows banks to make bigger profits from lending. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results were better than investors expected. The reports may have raised investor hopes for companies that will report their results next week, like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock. "It was a good kickoff to earnings season" for banks, said Baele. "It was actually some decent revenue as well with both investment banking and trading." Rising bond yields attracted investors' attention, and they sold utilities, real estate investment trusts, and other stocks that pay large dividends as a result. Those payments are more appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields are low. PG&E Corp. fell 57 cents to $59.80 and Duke Energy slid 73 cents to $77.21. The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, which helped technology companies recover some of Thursday's losses. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.42 while Intel rose 48 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.45 and Apple picked up 68 cents to $117.66. While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department's report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl's lost $1.44, or 3.2 percent, to $43.68 and Macy's fell $1.23, or 3.3 percent, to $35.57. Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. HP stock lost 67 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $14.48. Twitter fell 91 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $16.88 after Salesforce.com told the Financial Times it isn't interested in buying the company. Twitter has lost 32 percent of its value since October 5th on reports that potential buyers were not going to make offers. Salesforce investors were not enthusiastic about the potential offer, and its stock jumped $3.64, or 5.2 percent, to $74.27. U.S. crude oil gave up 9 cents to $50.35 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 8 cents to $51.95 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost $1.39, or 3.7 percent, and closed at a three-year low of $36.49. Cancer drug maker Celgene sank $2.13, or 2.1 percent, to $98.50. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 1 cent to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas slumped 6 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold fell $2.10 to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver lost 2 cents to $17.44 an ounce. Copper slipped 1 cent to $2.11 a pound. The dollar rose to 104.18 yen from 103.60 yen. The euro rose to $1.0983 from $1.1053. France's CAC 40 jumped 1.5 percent and Germany's DAX rose 1.6 percent. In Britain the FTSE 100 advanced 0.5 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.4 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.9 percent. Thailand's SET index climbed 4.7 percent in the second day of trading after the death of Thailand's king. The SET fell 4 percent in September as investors worried about the monarch's health and even with the rally Friday the index fell 1.8 percent this week.

Healthcare shares led declines.Yellen, in a speech at a conference of policymakers and academics, laid out the deepening concern at the Fed that U.S. economic potential is slipping - and may need aggressive steps to rebuild it."In looking at the market, I think, yes, (Yellen's speech) had a dovish tilt to it if you took it literally," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said Yellen's speech could suggest the U.S. central bank will stay accommodative for longer.Yellen did not address interest rates or immediate policy concerns directly. Traders have currently priced in a 67-percent chance of a rate hike in December.The S&P 500 financial index .SPSY was up 0.5 percent. JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) trounced third-quarter estimates. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank. Shares of JPMorgan ended down 0.3 percent, however, while Citigroup (C.N) ended up 0.3 percent and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) was down 0.1 percent.Wells Fargo has been under pressure following recent revelations that branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge. The bank earnings somewhat helped shore up Wall Street's confidence on the outlook for third-quarter earnings after some disappointing results from industrial and healthcare companies. S&P 500 earnings for the quarter are still expected to have declined 0.4 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed up 39.44 points, or 0.22 percent, to 18,138.38, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.43 points, or 0.02 percent, to 2,132.98 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.83 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,214.16.For the week, the Dow was down 0.6 percent, the S&P 500 was down 1 percent and the Nasdaq fell 1.5 percent.Shares of Twitter (TWTR.N) fell 5.1 percent to $16.88 after Salesforce.com's (CRM.N) chief executive ruled out bidding for Twitter. Salesforce.com shares jumped 5.2 percent to $74.27.HP Inc (HPQ.N) fell 4.4 percent to $14.48 after the company said it would cut about 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years. About 6.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favoured decliners.The S&P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 27 new highs and 80 new lows.

Reuters Published Friday, Oct. 14, 2016 4:22PM EDT Last updated Friday, Oct. 14, 2016 4:55PM EDT Comments AA Canada’s benchmark stock index fell on Friday as lower oil and gold prices weighed on the shares of key resource companies. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index unofficially closed down 58.72 points, or 0.40 per cent, at 14,584.99. Seven of the index’s 10 main industry groups ended lower. Wall Street's gains fade as Yellen questions economy’s resilience U.S. stocks ended little changed on Friday, losing ground late after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s comments on the economy unnerved investors. Financial shares finished up, giving the S&P 500 its biggest boost after stronger-than-expected bank results, but gave up most of their early gains. Healthcare shares led declines. Yellen, in a speech at a conference of policymakers and academics, laid out the deepening concern at the Fed that U.S. economic potential is slipping – and may need aggressive steps to rebuild it. “In looking at the market, I think, yes, (Yellen’s speech) had a dovish tilt to it if you took it literally,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said Yellen’s speech could suggest the U.S. central bank will stay accommodative for longer. Yellen did not address interest rates or immediate policy concerns directly. Traders have currently priced in a 67-per cent chance of a rate hike in December. The S&P 500 financial index was up 0.5 per cent. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup trounced third-quarter estimates. Wells Fargo & Co barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank. Shares of JPMorgan ended down 0.3 per cent, however, while Citigroup ended up 0.3 per cent and Wells Fargo was down 0.1 per cent. Wells Fargo has been under pressure following recent revelations that branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge. The bank earnings somewhat helped shore up Wall Street’s confidence on the outlook for third-quarter earnings after some disappointing results from industrial and healthcare companies. S&P 500 earnings for the quarter are still expected to have declined 0.4 per cent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 39.44 points, or 0.22 per cent, to 18,138.38, the S&P 500 gained 0.43 points, or 0.02 per cent, to 2,132.98 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.83 points, or 0.02 per cent, to 5,214.16. For the week, the Dow was down 0.6 per cent, the S&P 500 was down 1 per cent and the Nasdaq fell 1.5 per cent. Shares of Twitter fell 5.1 per cent to $16.88 after Salesforce.com’s chief executive ruled out bidding for Twitter. Salesforce.com shares jumped 5.2 per cent to $74.27. HP Inc fell 4.4 per cent to $14.48 after the company said it would cut about 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years. About 6.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 27 new highs and 80 new lows.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 2/3 left right A Wells Fargo Bank is shown in Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S., September 26, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake 3/3 By David Henry and Dan Freed | NEW YORK NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) trounced third-quarter estimates on Friday on a sharp rebound in trading revenues while Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank. Wells Fargo is under pressure to keep its profit engine humming while dismantling the aggressive sales culture at the heart of its woes, since unlike JPMorgan and Citigroup it does not have a big trading arm. "We're prepared for things to get worse before they get better," Chief Executive Tim Sloan, who took over as boss on Wednesday after John Stumpf, the bank's veteran leader, announced he was leaving amid a public furor over the scandal. Revelations that Wells' branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge to meet internal sales targets has shattered the bank's folksy image. Once a Wall Street darling for its ability to sell multiple products to individual customers, Wells Fargo said on Friday that new account openings had dropped sharply. New consumer checking accounts were 30 percent lower than in August, and applications for consumer credit cards fell 30 percent in September from the prior month. Wells Fargo's staff are in a period of flux after the bank scrapped sales targets for branches last month and in a note following Sloan's presentation, Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at KBW, said, “Management doesn’t know what the consumer bank will look like in the future." The bank has said the scandal will minimally affect its wealth management business and was unlikely to alter its plans to return capital to shareholders. On Friday, the state of Ohio joined a growing list of municipalities to suspend business relationships with Wells Fargo. The bank makes less than 1 percent of its revenue from working with local governments but Ohio's decision is a blow, coming days after Stumpf, a lightning rod for much of the criticism around the scandal, had departed. Sloan must navigate federal and state investigations in coming months. The scandal has renewed left-leaning lawmakers' attacks on Wall Street and bolstered their mission to introduce stricter oversight. JPMORGAN MOMENTUM CONTINUES While Wells Fargo's overall profit dropped for a fourth straight quarter, net income in the third quarter topped estimates, helped in part by lower-than-expected loan-loss provisions. JPMorgan and Citi also beat expectations as bond trading roared back in the third quarter, boosted by Brexit-inspired volatility along with changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as money market reforms. Banks got a fillip from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, which moved to a seven-year high during the quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings of short-term bank debt in advance of new U.S. regulations. JPMorgan's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said the fourth quarter so far is showing positive signs. "The momentum that I just characterized as fairly broad and fairly consistent across the (third) quarter, has somewhat continued so far," she told journalists. JPMorgan's after-tax income dropped 7.6 percent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of $2.2 billion a year earlier. But revenues and profits both topped analysts' estimates. Citigroup, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, beat expectations for third-quarter net profit after trading revenue surged 35 percent. While net income fell 11 percent to $1.24 per share, it exceeded the average estimate of $1.16 per share. Total adjusted revenue fell 4 percent to $17.76 billion, but beat the average estimate of $17.36 billion. The strong trading performance helped U.S. financial stocks snap a three-day losing streak, with markets-focused bank shares such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) up 2 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, ahead of their results next week. Citigroup was up over 0.8 percent in late trade after earlier rising as much as 3 percent. JPMorgan tipped into negative territory after earlier gaining as much as 2 percent. Wells Fargo was up 0.25 percent. The S&P financial index .SPSY gained 0.85 percent. The British government's tougher line on immigration in the wake of the Brexit vote has bankers preparing for a scenario in which London loses access to the single market, meaning they would have to move parts of their operations elsewhere in Europe. "As a result, we will be starting to build out technology systems and operations in Europe," JPMorgan's Lake said.

The three main equity benchmarks finished the week with a second-straight weekly loss. On the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.25% ended up 0.2% at 18,138, closing well of its highs of the session, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.29% wrapped up little-changed at 2,132 and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.28% was flat at 5,214. Better-than-expected quarterly results from the likes of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.56% delivered an initial jolt to the banking sector and the broader market, with strength in J.P. Morgan's trading unit hinting at a possibly solid quarter for trading powerhouse Goldman Sachs Group GS, +0.35% Goldman's rise led gains for the Dow industrials. Goldman is set to report its results Oct. 18. Although financial institutions set an upbeat tone, Wells Fargo & Co.'s WFC, +0.41% fake-account scandal overshadowed its solid results. Comments from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen midday Friday, where she suggested the fed could overshoot its 2% inflation target, and a strengthening dollar DXY, +0.27% up 0.6%, helped to limit gains for U.S. equities. For the week, the Dow closed off 0.6%, the S&P 500 ended with a weekly decline of 1% and the Nasdaq Composite closed off 1.5%. Meanwhile, the buck ended up 1.5% on the week. A rising dollar can be viewed as a headwind for multinational companies, which rely on selling goods abroad.

(JPM) reported a solid third quarter of 2016 (3Q16), according to Fitch Ratings, as a 13% return on tangible equity was supported by 15% core loan growth, record third-quarter revenue in the commercial & investment bank (CIB), record consumer deposit growth, expense controls, and a continuation of a relatively benign credit environment. JPM recorded a $50 million net reserve release related to oil & gas in 3Q16, as a reserve build in CIB was more than offset by a reserve release in the commercial bank. Management indicated that paydowns, opportunistic sales, and upgrades more than offset the impact of downgrades. Should the current energy environment remain consistent, JPM does not anticipate further significant reserve builds in 4Q16. Net revenues in CIB set a record for a fiscal third quarter, with 13.2% growth in investment banking and 32.6% growth in markets. Debt underwriting had its highest third quarter ever and equity underwriting fees were up 38% year over year. Fixed income markets were up 47.8% from a relatively weak 3Q15, driven, in part, by strong activity in rates due to post-Brexit activity and uncertainty around central bank actions. Equities were up a more modest 0.8%, given tougher year-over-year cash equity volume. Segment provision expense was down meaningfully from a year ago, despite a modest reserve build for oil & gas in CIB, and net charge-offs matched 3Q15 levels, at 0.01%. Operating expense reductions reflected lower legal expenses and tight expense controls, yielding an overhead ratio of 52%. The Consumer and Community Banking (CCB) segment posted net revenue growth of 4.1% versus the prior year, but net income declined 16.2% given a $225 million reserve build, higher card origination costs, the impact of card program renegotiations, and higher FDIC surcharges. The segment also included $175 million of unusual expenses related to liabilities assumed for a merchant in bankruptcy and an increase in reserves for mortgage servicing. Still, core loan growth was a strong 19% and deposits grew at a record 11% pace, with more than half of that growth coming from existing customers. Segment credit trends remained relatively benign, with net charge-offs of 1%; up 1 bps sequentially, but down 2 bps year over year. The mortgage business had a solid quarter, with growth in production margins, net interest income, and mortgage servicing rights risk management. Mortgage originations were down 9.4% in 3Q16 year over year, but on-balance sheet loans were up 9.1% as JPM continued to retain high-quality loans, adding about $19.4 billion over the past year. Card sales volume was up 10% year over year and new accounts opened increased by 700,000, due, in part, to positive response to JPM's launch of the Sapphire Reserve card. Strong growth in card loans and portfolio seasoning combined to push card losses up 10 bps year over year, while 30- and 90-day delinquencies were up 15 bps and 9 bps, respectively. JPM built credit card reserves by $200 million in the quarter. While Fitch expects the bank's card loss ratio to increase over time, it is likely to be a gradual up-tick to a new normal, reflecting an improved customer profile versus the pre-crisis portfolio. The topic of cross-selling and structuring appropriate employee compensation has been an area of interest for customers and investors in recent weeks, given industry news. In its conference call, JPM reiterated that its goal is not purely volume based; instead its strategy is to develop deep and engaged customer relationships in order to gain client wallet share over time. Compensation structures are designed accordingly and reviewed annually to ensure alignment with objectives. A $121 million reserve release in commercial banking, which included $50 million of oil & gas releases, in 3Q16 helped support record net income for the segment. Revenues were also up, as 13.3% average growth in the loan book fueled an increase in net interest income and several large transactions pushed gross investment banking fees up 57%, year over year, to $600 million. Segment credit performance remained strong with net charge-offs of 10 bps; half of which was oil & gas related. Asset management was a solid contributor to overall results, with higher net income driven by improved spreads and loan growth. Assets under management were up 3.6% annually, with higher markets and inflows into long-term products. From a liquidity perspective, JPM's high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) remained strong, at $539 billion in the quarter, which was up $23 billion from the prior quarter. However, management indicated that liquid assets were up significantly more and that excess liquidity at the bank is not included in HQLA. Loans-to-deposits were 64.5% at quarter-end, which is up modestly from a year ago, but remains below the peer average. JPM's Basel III Tier 1 Common equity (CET1) ratio was flat, at 11.9% for the quarter, as earnings retention offset loan growth. The bank's capital ratio was 12.1% under the fully phased-in standardized approach and JPM believes the standardized ratio will eventually be the binding constraint. The supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) was 6.6% and 6.6% at the firm and bank level, respectively. JPM paid a dividend of $0.48 per share in the quarter, equating to a payout of about 30%. The bank repurchased $2.3 billion of equity in the quarter, leaving approximately $8.3 billion of repurchase authority for the next three quarters, based on the results of last year's CCAR process. Including share repurchases, the total payout in the quarter was about 70%. JPM recently submitted its 2016 resolution filing. Areas of deficiency on the prior submission included liquidity, legal entity rationalization, governance mechanisms, and derivatives and trading activities. Fitch believes the bank has and will continue to work diligently to address all deficiencies noted in regulatory feedback.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 14, 2016 at 1:31PM Bank of America's headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. The narrative about bank earnings in the third quarter just became much more upbeat, suggesting that Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) could exceed analysts' expectations when it reports results on Monday. Low expectations going into the quarter Going into earnings season, there was a belief among analysts and commentators that this would be yet another disappointing quarter for the nation's biggest banks. And there were plenty of reasons to think they were right. The Federal Reserve released data suggesting that growth in commercial loans, the foundation of commercial banking, had decelerated during the quarter. This seemed to have been confirmed when Bank of America's management said that credit-line utilization fell compared to the second quarter. Both developments were presumably due to concerns among businesses about the United Kingdom's pending exit from the European Union. There was also reason to believe that banks would make less money from their loans, as the gap between how much they pay to borrow money and how much they earn by lending it out has narrowed over the past 12 months. The federal funds rate, the primary short-term interest rate benchmark in the United States, rose 0.25% last December. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bonds dropped by 0.25% over the past year. Investment banking fees were also expected to be broadly lower. Dealogic, a financial analytics company, estimated that global mergers and acquisitions activity dropped 20% last quarter, presumably because of the unfolding banking catastrophe in Europe. This hits universal banks like Bank of America, which operate both investment and commercial banking operations. To make matters worse, bank stocks had recently surged in anticipation of a rate hike from the Federal Reserve, which many believe to be in the cards for the central bank's upcoming meeting in December. The price surge seemed to leave bank stocks especially vulnerable to a retreat at the first sign of bad news. A better-than-expected quarter But we now know that these concerns were much ado about nothing. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) both reported better-than-expected earnings on Friday, one trading day ahead of Bank of America's scheduled announcement on Monday. JPMorgan beat estimates by 14%, earning $1.58 per share compared to the consensus estimate of $1.39 per share. And Citigroup outperformed expectations by 7%. The two banks didn't just narrowly top the Street's forecasts; in fact, they comfortably exceeded them. Notably, loan demand grew faster than expected. JPMorgan Chase's commercial loan portfolio expanded by 10%, with commercial real estate loans surging 19%. By contrast, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods had predicted an increase in the former by only 6%. Meanwhile, total loans at Citigroup were up 7% year over year. Even more important were the performances of JPMorgan's and Citigroup's trading units. Trading revenue at Citigroup, excluding accounting adjustments, rose 16%. The figure for the same category at JPMorgan was up 33%. "We delivered strong results this quarter with each of our businesses performing well," said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in the bank's third-quarter earnings release (link opens PDF). "It's a testament to the power of our platform and our people." Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat sounded an equally optimistic tone. "I am very encouraged by the underlying momentum across our franchise, notably in several areas where we have been investing," the executive said in prepared remarks. "The acquisition of the Costco portfolio and the recently announced sales of our retail operations in Argentina and Brazil are the latest examples of how we are shifting resources to the areas we believe will generate the best returns for our shareholders." It probably goes without saying, but this is good news for Bank of America, which operates many of the same business lines as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup do. This optimistic outlook explains why Bank of America's shares are up 1.4% halfway through today's trading day. It also suggests that the nation's second-biggest bank by assets will top expectations as well. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Stocks were higher Friday but off their earlier highs after three big U.S. banks reported quarterly profits that topped forecasts, boosting hopes on Wall Street that third-quarter earnings will be better than feared and mark the end of the so-called earnings recession. Powered by the upbeat bank earnings, around 1 p.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average was up 70 points, or 0.4%, but was off earlier highs of about 160 points. The broad Standard & Poor's 500 stock index was 0.2% higher and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.2%. Before the opening bell, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo(WFC), which is embroiled in a crisis over fraudulently opening customer accounts, all posted profit and sales numbers that exceeded analyst expectations. Bank shares were mixed after sharp early dains. Shares of JPMorgan were down 0.1% and Citigroup stock was 0.3% higher. Wells Fargo was down 0.7%. Wall Street is hoping the S&P 500 will break a string of four straight quarters of contracting profit growth when the third-quarter earnings season is complete. Investors will also be listening for further clues on the Federal Reserve's timetable for interest rate hikes, as chair Janet Yellen delivers a speech at 1:30 pm. ET. U.S. retail sales rose 0.6% in September, coming in line with forecasts, another signal that the U.S. consumer is holding up well. Inflation at the producer level rose 0.3% last month, more than the 0.2% consensus estimate, according to the latest monthly reading on the producer price index. The trio of bank beats in the U.S. provided a lift to stocks in Europe. The broad Stoxx Europe 600 index was 1.3% higher, and the German DAX was up 1.6% and the CAC 40 in Paris was 1.5% higher.

The nation’s biggest bank by assets handily beat estimates on both its top and bottom lines for the third quarter. Revenue rose 8.4% from a year ago as bond trading revenue surged 48%. JP Morgan also saw strong performance in its consumer lending, commercial banking and asset management businesses. Wells Fargo (WFC) shares were on the move this morning. Even though the embattled lender delivered earnings and revenue that topped forecasts. Profit fell nearly 4% from a year ago as the bank set aside funds for legal costs related to its sales practices scandal that forced CEO John Stumpf to step down earlier this week. The stock has been hit hard since the sales scandal broke in early September. Citigroup (C) also posted better than expected third quarter results. However, both earnings and revenue fell from a year ago. A jump in its bond trading and underwriting division was not enough to offset weakness in some of its other businesses. Yahoo (YHOO), our parent company, is on investors’ watch list.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive US stocks rise as banks and tech companies lead the way Friday Oct 14, 2016 at 2:21 PM Oct 14, 2016 at 2:21 PM Marley Jay The Associated Press NEW YORK — U.S. stocks are slightly higher Friday. Technology stocks are rising as investors were pleased with economic reports from the U.S. and China. Financial stocks are up after several major U.S. banks reported strong third-quarter results, while energy companies are down as the price of oil falls.  KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 80 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,179 as of 1:10 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 5 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,138. The Nasdaq composite edged up 11 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,224. The Dow was up as much as 162 points earlier. US ECONOMY HOPES: The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger.   FindTheCompany | Graphiq The Labor Department said producer prices rose in September as the cost of energy and food increased, but inflation appeared to remain limited. CHINA INFLATION: Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, while the national producer price index, which measures inflation, rose for the first time since 2012. That could result in factories in China starting to pass rising costs to their consumers. Stocks fell Thursday as a report on imports and exports caused investors to worry that China's economic is weakening. Some of the largest losses went to tech companies, as China is a major market for them. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.43 while Intel rose 50 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.47 and Apple picked up 52 cents to $117.50. BANKS MAKE IT COUNT: JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup's results were better than investors expected. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, set aside more money to cover loans that could go bad, but it reported a big gain in deposits and originated more mortgages. Citigroup reported better results from its consumer banking business. Their stocks did not move much, but the reports may have raised investor hopes for the banks that will report their results next week. Citigroup added 9 cents to $48.57. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs gained $2.67, or 1.6 percent, to $170.09 and Morgan Stanley gained 32 cents, or 1 percent, to $32.06. DEPARTMENT STORE BLUES: While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department's report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl's lost $1.42, or 3.1 percent, to $43.70 and Macy's fell $1.30, or 3.5 percent, to $35.50. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged up to 1.76 percent from 1.75 percent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, which lets banks make bigger profits from lending. PRINTER JAM: Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. The company is trying to sell more high-end PCs, office printers and 3D printing systems as more people use smartphones and store documents and photos online. HP stock lost 48 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $14.67. INFOSYS IN TROBLE: Business consulting services company Infosys again cut its annual revenue projections after its second-quarter sales fell short of estimates. The stock shed 91 cents, or 5.5 percent, to $15.74. QUEASY: Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost $1.13, or 3 percent, to $36.75 and drug and generic ingredient maker Perrigo fell $1.76, or 2 percent, to $86.14. ENERGY: U.S. crude oil gave up 36 cents to $50.08 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 38 cents to $51.65 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. EOG Resources sank 71 cents to $94.79 and Devon Energy declined 48 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $43.42. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 103.91 yen from 103.60 yen. The euro rose to $1.10995 from $1.1053. OVERSEAS: France's CAC 40 jumped 1.5 percent and Germany's DAX rose 1.6 percent. In Britain the FTSE 100 advanced 0.5 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.4 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.9 percent. Thailand's SET index climbed 4.7 percent in the second day of trading after the death of Thailand's king. The SET fell 4 percent in September as investors worried about the monarch's health and even with the rally Friday the index fell 1.8 percent this week.

Posted 15 Oct 2016 02:11 Wells Fargo net profit was US$5.6 billion, down 2.6 per cent from the year-ago period. (Photo: AFP/Andrew Caballero-Reynolds) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Wells Fargo warned on Friday (Oct 14) that a bogus accounts scandal will likely dent earnings in coming quarters as the bank's new chief executive faced tough questioning from Wall Street analysts. Wells Fargo, reporting a dip in third-quarter profits, signalled that it expects tens of millions of dollars in additional costs to hire more compliance staff after the scandal. The bank also anticipates a hit to revenues as some customers turn to other banks, executives said. "There was clearly something wrong and we will make the necessary changes to fix it," said chief executive Tim Sloan, who was promoted to the top job on Wednesday with the resignation of embattled John Stumpf. The remarks came as Wells Fargo and fellow US banking behemoths JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup all reported lower third-quarter results compared with the year-ago period, as margins continue to suffer from ultra-low interest rates. But profits at all three bested analyst expectations. Net profit at Wells Fargo was US$5.6 billion, down 2.6 per cent from the year-ago period. Revenues rose two per cent to US$22.3 billion, on a seven per cent rise in loans. Customer visits with branch bankers were down 10 per cent in September, while newly opened checking accounts fell 25 per cent, although Wells Fargo stopped short of attributing the declines to the scandal. "Customer experience scores trended down but were in-line with historic performance," the bank said. Shares of Wells Fargo have fallen almost 11 per cent since US and California regulators on Sep 8 announced US$185 million in fines for opening some two million deposit and credit card accounts in customers' names without their approval. Since the scandal broke, Wells Fargo has been savaged by consumer advocates and leading politicians, with Stumpf enduring two bruising hearings on Capitol Hill. The bank has come under fire not only for opening the fake accounts, but for a sluggish and politically tone-deaf response to the scandal after the Los Angeles Times spotlighted the problem in 2013. The bank had announced it had fired some 5,300 mid- and low-ranked employees linked to the bogus accounts, while Stumpf and other executives reaped bonuses for the purported growth in account numbers. Critics said the management had created the high-pressure sales culture that led to the scandal. Wells Fargo announced last month that Stumpf would forfeit US$41 million in compensation and receive no bonus for the year. It has also taken steps to address employee incentives that were seen as a factor, announcing it would eliminate product sales goals for retail staff. TOUGH QUESTIONING A contrite Sloan declined comment Friday on many questions and said he wanted to wait for an investigation commissioned by the bank's board before elaborating on why it took Wells Fargo so long to take meaningful action. Sloan said he didn't know if the report, by an outside law firm, would be released publicly, saying "I wouldn't jump to a conclusion about whether it's a transparency issue or not." Sloan said the bank would redouble efforts to retain employees after acknowledging many had been "put through the ringer" this year. While Sloan said the full lessons of the debacle are not known, he vowed to take swifter action in the future. "We've got to escalate issues sooner," he said. Sloan, a 29-year Wells veteran, was also questioned on whether the bank should turn to more company outsiders after his promotion. He said that the bank had remade its staff after the 2008 acquisition of Wachovia and that the team had performed well during the financial crisis and beyond. Shares of Wells Fargo were down 0.5 per cent to US$44.54 at midday. JPMorgan lost 0.5 per cent at US$67.42, while Citigroup added 0.1 per cent at US$48.53. - AFP Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore By David Henry and Dan Freed NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup trounced third-quarter estimates on Friday on a sharp rebound in trading revenues while Wells Fargo & Co barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank. Wells Fargo is under pressure to keep its profit engine humming while dismantling the aggressive sales culture at the heart of its woes, since unlike JPMorgan and Citigroup it does not have a big trading arm. "We're prepared for things to get worse before they get better," Chief Executive Tim Sloan, who took over as boss on Wednesday after John Stumpf, the bank's veteran leader, announced he was leaving amid a public furore over the scandal. Revelations that Wells' branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge to meet internal sales targets has shattered the bank's folksy image. Once a Wall Street darling for its ability to sell multiple products to individual customers, Wells Fargo said on Friday that new account openings had dropped sharply. New consumer checking accounts were 30 percent lower than in August, and applications for consumer credit cards fell 30 percent in September from the prior month. Wells Fargo's staff are in a period of flux after the bank scrapped sales targets for branches last month and in a note following Sloan's presentation, Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at KBW, said, “Management doesn’t know what the consumer bank will look like in the future." The bank has said the scandal will minimally affect its wealth management business and was unlikely to alter its plans to return capital to shareholders. On Friday, the state of Ohio joined a growing list of municipalities to suspend business relationships with Wells Fargo. The bank makes less than 1 percent of its revenue from working with local governments but Ohio's decision is a blow, coming days after Stumpf, a lightning rod for much of the criticism around the scandal, had departed. Sloan must navigate federal and state investigations in coming months. The scandal has renewed left-leaning lawmakers' attacks on Wall Street and bolstered their mission to introduce stricter oversight. JPMORGAN MOMENTUM CONTINUES While Wells Fargo's overall profit dropped for a fourth straight quarter, net income in the third quarter topped estimates, helped in part by lower-than-expected loan-loss provisions. JPMorgan and Citi also beat expectations as bond trading roared back in the third quarter, boosted by Brexit-inspired volatility along with changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as money market reforms. Banks got a fillip from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, which moved to a seven-year high during the quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings of short-term bank debt in advance of new U.S. regulations. JPMorgan's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said the fourth quarter so far is showing positive signs. "The momentum that I just characterized as fairly broad and fairly consistent across the (third) quarter, has somewhat continued so far," she told journalists. JPMorgan's after-tax income dropped 7.6 percent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of $2.2 billion a year earlier. But revenues and profits both topped analysts' estimates. Citigroup, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, beat expectations for third-quarter net profit after trading revenue surged 35 percent. While net income fell 11 percent to $1.24 per share, it exceeded the average estimate of $1.16 per share. Total adjusted revenue fell 4 percent to $17.76 billion, but beat the average estimate of $17.36 billion. The strong trading performance helped U.S. financial stocks snap a three-day losing streak, with markets-focused bank shares such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley up 2 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, ahead of their results next week. Citigroup was up over 0.8 percent in late trade after earlier rising as much as 3 percent. JPMorgan tipped into negative territory after earlier gaining as much as 2 percent. Wells Fargo was up 0.25 percent. The S&P financial index <.SPSY> gained 0.85 percent. The British government's tougher line on immigration in the wake of the Brexit vote has bankers preparing for a scenario in which London loses access to the single market, meaning they would have to move parts of their operations elsewhere in Europe. "As a result, we will be starting to build out technology systems and operations in Europe," JPMorgan's Lake said.

Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the U.S. and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. "The retail sales numbers on the surface looked pretty good but when you dig into them they were not that great," said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "It seems like every good report we get, we get an offsetting weaker report." The Dow Jones industrial average, which had jumped as much as 162 points in the morning, finished up 39.44 points, or 0.2 per cent, at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 inched up 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.83 points to 5,214.16. Goldman Sachs was responsible for most of the Dow's gains. It rose $3.10, or 1.9 per cent, to $170.52 after Britain's High Court threw out a $1 billion lawsuit against the company. Libya's sovereign wealth fund had accused Goldman Sachs of duping the fund into making risky deals. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.80 per cent from 1.75 per cent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, and that allows banks to make bigger profits from lending. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results were better than investors expected. The reports may have raised investor hopes for companies that will report their results next week, like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock. "It was a good kickoff to earnings season" for banks, said Baele. "It was actually some decent revenue as well with both investment banking and trading." Rising bond yields attracted investors' attention, and they sold utilities, real estate investment trusts, and other stocks that pay large dividends as a result. Those payments are more appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields are low. PG&E Corp. fell 57 cents to $59.80 and Duke Energy slid 73 cents to $77.21. The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, which helped technology companies recover some of Thursday's losses. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.42 while Intel rose 48 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $37.45 and Apple picked up 68 cents to $117.66. While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department's report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl's lost $1.44, or 3.2 per cent, to $43.68 and Macy's fell $1.23, or 3.3 per cent, to $35.57. Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. HP stock lost 67 cents, or 4.4 per cent, to $14.48. Twitter fell 91 cents, or 5.1 per cent, to $16.88 after Salesforce.com told the Financial Times it isn't interested in buying the company. Twitter has lost 32 per cent of its value since October 5th on reports that potential buyers were not going to make offers. Salesforce investors were not enthusiastic about the potential offer, and its stock jumped $3.64, or 5.2 per cent, to $74.27. U.S. crude oil gave up 9 cents to $50.35 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 8 cents to $51.95 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost $1.39, or 3.7 per cent, and closed at a three-year low of $36.49. Cancer drug maker Celgene sank $2.13, or 2.1 per cent, to $98.50. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 1 cent to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas slumped 6 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold fell $2.10 to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver lost 2 cents to $17.44 an ounce. Copper slipped 1 cent to $2.11 a pound. The dollar rose to 104.18 yen from 103.60 yen. The euro rose to $1.0983 from $1.1053. France's CAC 40 jumped 1.5 per cent and Germany's DAX rose 1.6 per cent. In Britain the FTSE 100 advanced 0.5 per cent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.5 per cent and South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.4 per cent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.9 per cent. Thailand's SET index climbed 4.7 per cent in the second day of trading after the death of Thailand's king. The SET fell 4 per cent in September as investors worried about the monarch's health and even with the rally Friday the index fell 1.8 per cent this week. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business The Canadian Press 2016         Business Videos         Most Popular canada.com E-mailed Shared     Sponsored By           FP Business Wire »   FP Business Wire   Zoho Launches Industry's First Context-Aware Help Desk Software The Pioneers and New Generation of the Payments and Digital Identity Industry Meet in Cannes The Zed Horde Descends Upon Gamers World-Wide as KILLING FLOOR 2 Launches for PC, PlayStation®4 Pro and PlayStation®4           News Business Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Health Travel Technology Don't Miss: Happening Now Video Centre Live chats Blogs on canada.com canada.com on Facebook Most Popular Formats Sitemap / RSS Contests Blogs Photo Galleries Videos Canada.com About Us Contact Us Advertise with Us FAQs Tools Canada.com Search for a Job Buy / Sell a Car Infomart Place a Classified Ad Newsletters and Alerts My Account Flyercity.ca About canada.com | Privacy Statement | Terms | Copyright & Permissions © 2010-2016 Postmedia Network Inc.

Technology stocks are rising as investors were pleased with economic reports from the U.S. and China. Financial stocks are up after several major U.S. banks reported strong third-quarter results, while energy companies are down as the price of oil falls. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 80 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,179 as of 11:10 a.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 5 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,138. The Nasdaq composite edged up 11 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,224. The Dow was up as much as 162 points earlier. VIDEOS TOP JOBS US ECONOMY HOPES: The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. The Labor Department said producer prices rose in September as the cost of energy and food increased, but inflation appeared to remain limited. CHINA INFLATION: Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, while the national producer price index, which measures inflation, rose for the first time since 2012. That could result in factories in China starting to pass rising costs to their consumers. Stocks fell Thursday as a report on imports and exports caused investors to worry that China's economic is weakening. Some of the largest losses went to tech companies, as China is a major market for them. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.43 while Intel rose 50 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.47 and Apple picked up 52 cents to $117.50. BANKS MAKE IT COUNT: JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup's results were better than investors expected. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, set aside more money to cover loans that could go bad, but it reported a big gain in deposits and originated more mortgages. Citigroup reported better results from its consumer banking business. Their stocks did not move much, but the reports may have raised investor hopes for the banks that will report their results next week. Citigroup added 9 cents to $48.57. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs gained $2.67, or 1.6 percent, to $170.09 and Morgan Stanley gained 32 cents, or 1 percent, to $32.06. DEPARTMENT STORE BLUES: While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department's report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl's lost $1.42, or 3.1 percent, to $43.70 and Macy's fell $1.30, or 3.5 percent, to $35.50. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged up to 1.76 percent from 1.75 percent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, which lets banks make bigger profits from lending. PRINTER JAM: Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. The company is trying to sell more high-end PCs, office printers and 3D printing systems as more people use smartphones and store documents and photos online. HP stock lost 48 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $14.67. INFOSYS IN TROBLE: Business consulting services company Infosys again cut its annual revenue projections after its second-quarter sales fell short of estimates. The stock shed 91 cents, or 5.5 percent, to $15.74. QUEASY: Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost $1.13, or 3 percent, to $36.75 and drug and generic ingredient maker Perrigo fell $1.76, or 2 percent, to $86.14. ENERGY: U.S. crude oil gave up 36 cents to $50.08 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 38 cents to $51.65 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. EOG Resources sank 71 cents to $94.79 and Devon Energy declined 48 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $43.42. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 103.91 yen from 103.60 yen. The euro rose to $1.10995 from $1.1053. OVERSEAS: France's CAC 40 jumped 1.5 percent and Germany's DAX rose 1.6 percent. In Britain the FTSE 100 advanced 0.5 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.4 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.9 percent. Thailand's SET index climbed 4.7 percent in the second day of trading after the death of Thailand's king. The SET fell 4 percent in September as investors worried about the monarch's health and even with the rally Friday the index fell 1.8 percent this week.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows NHL: Coyotes F Brad Richardson carted off ice on stretcher Utah lawmakers: Time to take 'training wheels' off booming solar industry, retire tax credit BYU football: UMass' struggles as independent, FBS newcomer, paint a cautionary tale Garrison Keillor: Politics is not everything.

REUTERS/Mike Blake By David Henry and Dan Freed NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup trounced third-quarter estimates on Friday on a sharp rebound in trading revenues while Wells Fargo & Co barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank. Wells Fargo is under pressure to keep its profit engine humming while dismantling the aggressive sales culture at the heart of its woes, since unlike JPMorgan and Citigroup it does not have a big trading arm. "We're prepared for things to get worse before they get better," Chief Executive Tim Sloan, who took over as boss on Wednesday after John Stumpf, the bank's veteran leader, announced he was leaving amid a public furor over the scandal. Revelations that Wells' branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge to meet internal sales targets has shattered the bank's folksy image. Once a Wall Street darling for its ability to sell multiple products to individual customers, Wells Fargo said on Friday that new account openings had dropped sharply. New consumer checking accounts were 30 percent lower than in August, and applications for consumer credit cards fell 30 percent in September from the prior month. Wells Fargo's staff are in a period of flux after the bank scrapped sales targets for branches last month and in a note following Sloan's presentation, Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at KBW, said, “Management doesn’t know what the consumer bank will look like in the future." The bank has said the scandal will minimally affect its wealth management business and was unlikely to alter its plans to return capital to shareholders. On Friday, the state of Ohio joined a growing list of municipalities to suspend business relationships with Wells Fargo. The bank makes less than 1 percent of its revenue from working with local governments but Ohio's decision is a blow, coming days after Stumpf, a lightning rod for much of the criticism around the scandal, had departed. Sloan must navigate federal and state investigations in coming months. The scandal has renewed left-leaning lawmakers' attacks on Wall Street and bolstered their mission to introduce stricter oversight. JPMORGAN MOMENTUM CONTINUES While Wells Fargo's overall profit dropped for a fourth straight quarter, net income in the third quarter topped estimates, helped in part by lower-than-expected loan-loss provisions. JPMorgan and Citi also beat expectations as bond trading roared back in the third quarter, boosted by Brexit-inspired volatility along with changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as money market reforms. Banks got a fillip from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, which moved to a seven-year high during the quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings of short-term bank debt in advance of new U.S. regulations. JPMorgan's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said the fourth quarter so far is showing positive signs. "The momentum that I just characterized as fairly broad and fairly consistent across the (third) quarter, has somewhat continued so far," she told journalists. JPMorgan's after-tax income dropped 7.6 percent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of $2.2 billion a year earlier. But revenues and profits both topped analysts' estimates. Citigroup, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, beat expectations for third-quarter net profit after trading revenue surged 35 percent. While net income fell 11 percent to $1.24 per share, it exceeded the average estimate of $1.16 per share. Total adjusted revenue fell 4 percent to $17.76 billion, but beat the average estimate of $17.36 billion. The strong trading performance helped U.S. financial stocks snap a three-day losing streak, with markets-focused bank shares such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley up 2 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, ahead of their results next week. Citigroup was up over 0.8 percent in late trade after earlier rising as much as 3 percent. JPMorgan tipped into negative territory after earlier gaining as much as 2 percent. Wells Fargo was up 0.25 percent. The S&P financial index <.SPSY> gained 0.85 percent. The British government's tougher line on immigration in the wake of the Brexit vote has bankers preparing for a scenario in which London loses access to the single market, meaning they would have to move parts of their operations elsewhere in Europe. "As a result, we will be starting to build out technology systems and operations in Europe," JPMorgan's Lake said.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) Share Written by Jason Karaian Obsession Future of Finance October 14, 2016 Welcome to the weird and wonderful world of bank accounting. In the third quarter, like the two others before it, JPMorgan Chase somehow made money from litigation. That is, over the first nine months of the year it has reported a negative “legal expense” worth nearly $550 million, boosting its bottom-line earnings. The bank made a cool $6.3 billion in the three months ended in September (pdf). In the previous five years, the world’s top investment bank (by fees) reported some $27 billion in legal costs, stemming from lawsuits and settlements for market manipulation, mortgage mis-selling, and much else besides. At the end of last year, the bank said that “several hundred” legal cases that were still looming against it could cost up to $3.6 billion. The gory details span seven pages in the bank’s latest annual report, starting on page 297. So what gives? CEO Jamie Dimon told shareholders recently that the legal problems dogging his bank, and big banks in general, “have been resolved or are receding.” On current evidence, he has a point—when JPMorgan closes cases in its favor, or in a less costly way than it once thought, it can reduce its legal reserves. This is reflected in various parts of a company’s accounts, including its earnings statement. JPMorgan is tight-lipped about the details of its reversal of legal fortune, noting only the “net legal benefit reflecting some favorable developments.” Given its recent history, the bank is cautious about the future; CFO Marianne Lake said last quarter that “there’s no real way, obviously, of forecasting a run rate” for the bank’s future legal costs. Indeed, this unusual run of legal luck may soon run out; JPMorgan faces some $200 million in fines for allegedly hiring of the children of Chinese officials in hopes of winning business from state-owned companies. The recent travails of Wells Fargo also suggest that scandals could be lurking in the retail units of big banks, and not just in the racier investment-banking divisions. For its part, JPMorgan is conducting a “deep dive” into the cross-selling of retail products, Lake said on a conference call today. “It’s impossible to have zero defects,” she said.

Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the U.S. and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. “The retail sales numbers on the surface looked pretty good but when you dig into them they were not that great,” said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve. “It seems like every good report we get, we get an offsetting weaker report.” The Dow Jones industrial average, which had jumped as much as 162 points in the morning, finished up 39.44 points, or 0.2 per cent, at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor’s 500 inched up 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.83 points to 5,214.16. Goldman Sachs was responsible for most of the Dow’s gains. It rose $3.10, or 1.9 per cent, to $170.52 after Britain’s High Court threw out a $1 billion lawsuit against the company. Libya’s sovereign wealth fund had accused Goldman Sachs of duping the fund into making risky deals. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.80 per cent from 1.75 per cent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, and that allows banks to make bigger profits from lending. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results were better than investors expected. The reports may have raised investor hopes for companies that will report their results next week, like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock. “It was a good kickoff to earnings season” for banks, said Baele. “It was actually some decent revenue as well with both investment banking and trading.” Rising bond yields attracted investors’ attention, and they sold utilities, real estate investment trusts, and other stocks that pay large dividends as a result. Those payments are more appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields are low. PG&E Corp. fell 57 cents to $59.80 and Duke Energy slid 73 cents to $77.21. The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, which helped technology companies recover some of Thursday’s losses. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.42 while Intel rose 48 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $37.45 and Apple picked up 68 cents to $117.66. While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department’s report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl’s lost $1.44, or 3.2 per cent, to $43.68 and Macy’s fell $1.23, or 3.3 per cent, to $35.57. Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. HP stock lost 67 cents, or 4.4 per cent, to $14.48. Twitter fell 91 cents, or 5.1 per cent, to $16.88 after Salesforce.com told the Financial Times it isn’t interested in buying the company. Twitter has lost 32 per cent of its value since October 5th on reports that potential buyers were not going to make offers. Salesforce investors were not enthusiastic about the potential offer, and its stock jumped $3.64, or 5.2 per cent, to $74.27. U.S. crude oil gave up 9 cents to $50.35 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 8 cents to $51.95 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost $1.39, or 3.7 per cent, and closed at a three-year low of $36.49. Cancer drug maker Celgene sank $2.13, or 2.1 per cent, to $98.50. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 1 cent to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas slumped 6 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold fell $2.10 to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver lost 2 cents to $17.44 an ounce. Copper slipped 1 cent to $2.11 a pound. The dollar rose to 104.18 yen from 103.60 yen. The euro rose to $1.0983 from $1.1053. France’s CAC 40 jumped 1.5 per cent and Germany’s DAX rose 1.6 per cent. In Britain the FTSE 100 advanced 0.5 per cent. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.5 per cent and South Korea’s Kospi advanced 0.4 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.9 per cent. Thailand’s SET index climbed 4.7 per cent in the second day of trading after the death of Thailand’s king. The SET fell 4 per cent in September as investors worried about the monarch’s health and even with the rally Friday the index fell 1.8 per cent this week. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

The S&P 500 financial index was up 0.44 percent, after rising as much as 1.5 percent following JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo market-beating results. However, Wells Fargo shares fell 0.7 percent as the bank struggles with a sales scandal that cost Chief Executive John Stumpf his job. JPMorgan and Citi were flat. Yellen is due to speak at a conference in Boston where she could offer her thoughts on the growing support for an interest rate hike in the near term. A sustained growth in the labor market and improving inflation have encouraged policymakers such as Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who said on Friday that placing "very high" odds on a rate hike in December seemed appropriate. Traders have currently priced in a 67 percent chance of a rate hike in December, while the odds for November are minimal as the Fed's meeting falls just days before the Nov.8 U.S. presidential election. "We don't expect a departure from the script, which was laid out at the minutes of the September meeting, and expect the Fed to continue moving on a path towards a December rate hike," said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the Private Client Group of U.S. Bank. Major U.S. stock indexes have been swinging between losses and gains since Monday due to uncertainty regarding the quarterly earnings season and the outcome of a tightly run U.S. presidential race. The three indexes are on track for the second straight weekly loss. While earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to fall 0.7 percent - marking the fifth straight quarter of decline - some investors hope that enough companies will beat analysts' expectations for the index to end the season with a slight gain. At 12:27 p.m. ET (1627 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 54.3 points, or 0.3 percent, at 18,153.24. The S&P 500 was up 2.38 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,134.93 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 4.77 points, or 0.09 percent, at 5,218.10. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with technology rising the most by 0.47 percent. Microsoft was its biggest driver, rising 0.8 percent after Cowen & Co raised its price target. McDonald's fell 0.6 percent after the fast-food chain operator announced charges related to strategic changes it had outlined last year. HP Inc fell 2.9 percent after the company said it would cut about 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,575 to 1,300. On the Nasdaq, 1,369 issues rose and 1,318 fell. The S&P 500 index showed three new 52-week highs and one new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 21 new highs and 58 new lows.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. owns Chase Commerical Bank and JPMorgan Investment Bank. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoMore By Sweta Singh and David Henry (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co beat forecasts for revenues and profits on Friday as global bond and currency markets roared back to life in the third quarter following Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Brexit-inspired volatility along with changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as money market reforms boosted trading revenue by 21 percent for JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, prompting pretax profit to jump by one-third. JPMorgan's aftertax income dropped 7.6 percent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of $2.2 billion a year earlier. Both revenues and profits topped analysts' estimates. Earnings per share fell to $1.58 from $1.68 a year ago. Analysts, on average, expected $1.39, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan is the first big U.S. bank to report third-quarter results and its performance gave Wall Street a shot in the arm. The bank's shares were up 1.6 percent at $68.84 in premarket trading while markets-focused rivals, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citi also rose. Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc, the third and fourth biggest U.S. banks by assets, also reported results on Friday. Citi earnings per share and revenues topped estimates. Wells Fargo earnings beat expectations. Bank of America Corp, the second biggest, will report on Monday. In addition to a fillip from Brexit, banks got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide. Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations. JPMorgan's total revenue rose 8 percent to $25.51 billion, beating the average estimate of $23.99 billion. With interest rates at record lows, the banking sector has relied on growing its loan book to boost income. However, total provisions for bad loans rose 86.4 percent to $1.27 billion. JPMorgan posted higher provisions for losses as it added loans and recorded charge-offs for oil and gas loans. Core loans in its commercial banking business grew 14 percent. JPMorgan expects income from lending to be up modestly in the fourth quarter. The Fed last raised rates in December, by 0.25 percentage points, after keeping them near zero for almost a decade. At the start of the year, further rate hikes were widely expected, but now Wall Street expects just one increase in December and possibly one more in 2017 JPMorgan's return on tangible common equity, a key performance measure, was 13 percent in the latest quarter, compared with the bank's longer-term target of about 15 percent.

X JPMorgan Chase third-quarter profits above estimates Revenue rose to $25.5bn, beating the $24.2bn average estimate of analysts Fri, Oct 14, 2016, 15:53 JPMorgan Chase stock gained 2.6% this year through Thursday, outpacing the 24-company KBW Bank Index, which fell 3%. Photograph: iStock         JPMorgan Chase posted profit that beat analysts’ estimates on a 48 per cent surge in fixed-income revenue, fuelled by trading of government bonds after the UK voted to leave the EU. Third-quarter net income declined to $6.29 billion (€5.71bn) , or $1.58 a share, from $6.8 billion (€6.18bn), or $1.68, a year earlier, when results got a boost from $2.2 billion in tax benefits, New York-based JPMorgan said on Friday in a statement. Earnings excluding legal and accounting adjustments were $1.59 a share, topping the $1.39 average estimate. JPMorgan, the biggest US bank, kicks off earnings season for the industry, offering insight into how Wall Street’s trading and advisory operations performed during the typically slow summer months. JP Morgan sees new Scottish currency near parity with sterling US inflation is on the rise - JP Morgan Bank of Ireland shares fall following JP Morgan caution Beset by low growth and low interest rates for years, banks suffered a weak start to 2016 as falling energy prices triggered an equity rout. Bond trading recovered in the second quarter, driven by interest rate and currency desks, a trend that analysts expected to continue into the period ended September 30th. Revenue rose to $25.5 billion (€23.16bn)), beating the $24.2 billion (€21.98bn) average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, while expenses fell 5.9 per cent to $14.5 billion, compared with the $14.1 billion estimate. Revenue Fixed-income trading revenue jumped to $4.33 billion, more than $1 billion higher than the average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Equities-trading revenue advanced less than 1 per cent to $1.41 billion, compared with analysts’ $1.35 billion estimate. Trading tied to government bonds and other assets linked to interest rates “was particularly strong with good client activity as markets remained active throughout the quarter post the Brexit vote and in anticipation of central bank actions” and changes in money-market regulation, the firm said. ADVERTISEMENT Credit and securitised products desks gained on “improving market sentiment” and robust issuance, the bank said. JPMorgan climbed 2 per cent to $69.09 in early trading in New York on Friday. The stock had gained 2.6 per cent this year through Thursday, outpacing the 24-company KBW Bank Index, which fell 3 per cent.       Topics: Cork Harbour Alliance for a Safe Environment European Union Bloomberg Jpmorgan Kbw Bank New York City United Kingdom Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Energy & Resources Draghi warns against allowing Central Bank to cap mortgage rates Economy John FitzGerald: Long way to go in fight against climate change Politics Pat Hickey to deposit €410,000 bond needed to regain passport International Rory Best: We need our best performance ever Sponsored Designing the F-Pace: the story of Jaguar's best-seller HR managers need a simplified approach to pensions World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Airbnb takes on tourism industry with move into excursions 17:10 Three UK hit by data breach but no risk to Irish customers 16:28 Abercrombie & Fitch shares slide as sales miss estimates 15:52 Draghi warns against allowing Central Bank to cap mortgage rates 15:50 Germany says Commission has no right to decide on its fiscal space 15:39 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 Ireland’s biggest landlord: ‘I feel bad for the Irish people’ 2 Public sector pay rises?

Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Citi all released earnings Friday morning, with Wells Fargo underperforming relative to its two competitors. Cassidy, the managing director of RBC Capital Markets' equity research division, said the primary reason for the bank's underperformance was that JPMorgan and Citi's capital markets businesses were extremely strong. "In particular, the debt underwriting and the FICC trading areas were extremely strong for both JPMorgan and CitiGroup, and of course, Wells Fargo is not in those businesses," Cassidy told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Friday. FICC trading refers to fixed income, currencies and commodities trading. Cassidy commented on Sloan's comments Friday morning regarding the future of Wells Fargo's business, calling the tone of the comments "very positive" and "contrite" and saying that the company is "going in the right direction under this new leadership." While Cassidy said it was difficult to predict what the eventual cost of Wells Fargo's malpractices will be, he said the bank is likely to begin building reserves for payouts over the coming months. show chapters <p>Harte: Good quarter for big banks</p> <p>Jeff Harte, Sandler O&#039;Neill, shares his take on financials, amid Citi, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan third-quarter earnings out today.

"You look at the big [banks]: They're growing loans, they're getting more efficient, capital markets has become a tailwind as opposed to a drag, credit quality is remaining pretty good," Harte told CNBC's "Fast Money Halftime Report" on Friday. What Harte is waiting for next is "what's going to give us the next kind of kick up as opposed to a kick down," he said. The picture Harte sees, with upticks in inflation and the Consumer Price Index (CPI), could suggest higher rates in the near future, which would certainly benefit the banks, he said, though he would not recommend speculating. "It's tough to make your money betting on what the Fed's going to do or what interest rates are going to do, because it's kind of been surprising people forever," the analyst said. What he would bet on is Citi, which Harte predicted will benefit from expanding its core international consumer base in the near future, calling the move into non-U.S. areas of business "something the market will look sustainably on."

The S&P 500's financial index surged 1.16 percent, its best showing in seven days, after JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo reported quarterly revenue and profit that beat market expectations. JPMorgan and Citi rose slightly, while the scandal-hit Wells reversed course to trade down 0.15 percent. Bank of America was the top influence on the S&P, while Goldman Sachs had a similar impact on the Dow. The two banks are scheduled to report results along with Morgan Stanley next week. While earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to fall 0.7 percent, marking the fifth straight quarter of decline, some investors hope that enough companies will beat analysts' expectations for the index to end the season with a slight gain. The early part of the earnings season is dominated by financials and the positives from the sector set the tone for the rest of the period, said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the Private Client Group of U.S. Bank. The KBW Bank index rose 0.6 percent, snapping a three-day losing streak. Investors are also awaiting Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech at noon in Boston, where she is likely to offer more insight into the growing sentiment among policymakers to raise interest rates relatively soon. Sustained growth in the labor market and improving inflation have encouraged Fed officials such as Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren, who told CNBC on Friday that the "very high" odds for a rate increase in December was appropriate. "We don't expect a departure from the script which was laid out at the minutes of the September meeting and expect the Fed to continue moving on a path towards a December rate hike," Northey said. At 11:05 a.m. ET (1505 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 114.88 points, or 0.63 percent, at 18,213.82. The S&P 500 was up 8.99 points, or 0.42 percent, at 2,141.54 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 27.93 points, or 0.54 percent, at 5,241.26. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher. Energy fell 0.16 percent as oil prices dropped 0.83 percent. Microsoft rose 1.1 percent after Cowen & Co raised price target on the stock. McDonald's fell 1.1 percent after the fast-food chain operator announced charges related to strategic changes it had outlined last year. HP Inc fell 1.8 percent after the company said it would cut about 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,813 to 998. On the Nasdaq, 1,562 issues rose and 993 fell. The S&P 500 index showed three new 52-week highs and one new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded seven new highs and 41 new lows.

UNITED-KINGDOM BELGIUM FRANCE GERMANY LUXEMBOURG MOSCOW NETHERLANDS PORTUGAL SOUTH AFRICA SPAIN SWITZERLAND UNITED KINGDOM Country Guide Moving to uk Visas & Permits Working in uk Finance Housing Healthcare Education Family About uk Insider Views Out & About British News Features Country News Jobs Find a job in uk Working in uk Find a House Find a house in uk Housing Guide in uk Community Ask the Expert Forum Dating Events Newsletter Directory Classifieds Listings Expatica home  ❱  News  ❱  World stocks rally on cheap money, US banks earnings Tweet ShareThis World stocks rally on cheap money, US banks earnings 14th October 2016, 0 comments European stock markets rebounded Friday, with London's benchmark index headed back towards its record-high level on upbeat Chinese data, while bank results boosted Wall Street. The death of Thailand's king meanwhile sparked bargain-buying in the country after Bangkok stocks suffered sell-offs in his final days. Europe's rally Friday "has probably taken many people by surprise, although this shouldn't be the case given that the markets in both the UK and US are still very close to their all-time highs", said Forex.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada. London's FTSE 100 index this week hit an intra-day high of 7,129.83 points, fuelled by a plunging pound in the wake of Britain's vote earlier this year in favour of quitting the European Union. "There is a reason why the markets are still elevated despite all the doom and gloom out there, and it continues to be this: cheap central bank money," Razaqzada added. The situation could soon change however, if only in the US, as the Federal Reserve prepares to possibly hike interest rates before the end of the year. - US banks shine - US retail sales data released Friday coming in as expected with a 0.6 monthly gain in September after a summer in which consumers had shown a slackening appetite to spend kept alive the possibility of a December rate hike. Wall Street stocks opened higher as a trio of leading banks beat analyst forecasts for third quarter earnings despite the tough low interest rate environment. The three -- Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup -- all saw net profits fall as low rates pared lending margins, but they beat forecasts from analysts, driving their shares higher in early trade. Citigroup led a rebound in banking shares, adding 2.2 percent; Wells Fargo rose 0.4 percent and JPMorgan 1.4 percent. Ahead of the US numbers, Beijing said China's producer price index rose last month after 54 consecutive months of falling -- providing some much-needed hope for the Chinese economy a day after market-sapping trade figures. Chinese firms have for years been battered by falling prices for their goods in the face of chronic overcapacity and weak demand, putting a damper on growth in a key driver of the world economy. Consumer prices also rose more than expected. "Markets were in more positive spirits on Friday," said CMC Markets analyst Jasper Lawler. "Higher than expected inflation data (from China) has unwound some of the global growth concerns brought about by its ugly trade data." - Thai stocks, baht bounce - The Thai king's death this week saw a recovery in the country's stocks Friday, but analysts warned uncertainty over the nation's future without its uniting figure posed fresh risks for an economy already battered by a decade of political turmoil. Thai stocks plunged around six percent this week and the baht lost around three percent as investors grew uneasy about political and economic stability following the death of the monarch who reigned for seven decades. In Seoul, Samsung Electronics rose 1.3 percent as investors brushed off its warning that it expects another $3.0-billion-plus hit to profit over the next two quarters owing to the impact of its exploding Note 7 crisis. It said it hoped a pick-up in sales of its other flagship handset would help cushion the impact. The warning came two days after it slashed its operating profit outlook for the third quarter by $2.3 billion as it announced it was scrapping the model entirely. - Key figures around 1330 GMT - London - FTSE 100: UP 0.9 percent at 7,037.87 points Frankfurt - DAX 30: UP 1.7 percent at 10,586.44 Paris - CAC 40: UP 2.0 percent at 4,493.23 EURO STOXX 50: UP 1.8 percent at 3,029.60 New York - DOW: UP 0.8 percent at 18,235.42 New York - S&P 500: UP 0.5 percent at 2,143.86 New York - Nasdaq: UP 0.5 percent at 5,241.18 Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.5 percent at 16,856.37 (close) Hong Kong - Hang Seng: UP 0.9 percent at 23,233.31 (close) Shanghai - Composite: UP 0.1 percent at 3,063.81 (close) Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.1006 from $1.1056 Thursday Dollar/yen: UP at 104.35 yen from 103.66 yen Pound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2213 from $1.2253 Euro/pound: DOWN at 90.07 pence from 90.25 pence Oil - West Texas Intermediate: UP 15 cents at $50.59 per barrel Oil - Brent North Sea: DOWN 10 cents at $51.93 burs-rl/jh © 2016 AFP 0 Comments To This Article Leave a Reply Most Read Low-cost air carriers spreading wings ov...

The major averages have all moved to the upside, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 bouncing off their lowest closing levels in a month. In recent trading, the major averages have moved roughly sideways, hovering firmly in positive territory. The Dow is up 147.78 points or 0.8 percent at 18,246.72, the Nasdaq is up 39.50 points or 0.8 percent at 5,252.83 and the S&P 500 is up 14.88 points or 0.7 percent at 2,147.43. The early strength on Wall Street partly reflects a positive reaction to earnings news from financial giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Before the start of trading, JPMorgan Chase reported third quarter earnings that fell year-over-year but exceeded analyst estimates. The company also reported better than expected revenues. Citigroup and Wells Fargo also reported third quarter results that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. On the U.S. economic front, the Commerce Department released a report showing that retail sales rose in line with economist estimates in the month of September. The Commerce Department said retail sales climbed by 0.6 percent in September after edging down by a revised 0.2 percent in August. Excluding a jump in auto sales, retail sales still rose by 0.5 percent in September after dipping by 0.2 percent in August. The increase in ex-auto sales also matched estimates. However, the report also said closely watched core retail sales, which exclude autos, gasoline, building materials and food service, edged up by a smaller than expected 0.1 percent. A separate report from the Labor Department showed that producer prices increased by slightly more than anticipated in September. The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand climbed by 0.3 percent in September after coming in unchanged in August. Economists had expected prices to edge up by 0.2 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, core producer prices rose by 0.2 percent in September after inching up by 0.1 percent in August. Core prices had been expected to show another 0.1 percent uptick. ING Senior Economist James Knightley, said, "Overall, the reasonably firm retail sales number and slightly higher inflation data support the idea of a Federal Reserve rate hike in December." "The only things that can really stop momentum building for such a move would be a market unfriendly election outcome and softness in the two payrolls reports between now and the December FOMC," he added. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan released a report showing that consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell to its lowest level in a year in October. Steel stocks have shown a strong move back to the upside after falling sharply in the previous session. After plunging by 2.9 percent on Thursday, the NYSE Arca Steel Index is climbing by 1.8 percent. Semiconductor, housing, and telecom stocks are also seeing significant strength, moving higher along with most of the other major sectors. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.5 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced by 0.9 percent. The major European markets have shown strong moves back to the upside. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has climbed by 0.8 percent, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index jumping by 1.8 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries are pulling back following the rebound that was seen in the previous session. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by 3 basis points at 1.768 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 More Commentary -Global Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary European Markets Pull Back On Light Data Day Stocks Showing A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Stocks May Show A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Wall Street On Slippery Grounds Sensex Falls For Fifth Day; Nifty Dips Marginally European Shares Fall As Banks And Miners Retreat FTSE 100 Drifts Lower As Stronger Dollar Hurts Commodity Stocks CAC 40 Slips Into Red As Banks Retreat DAX Rises As Volkswagen Outlines Turnaround Plan Asian Shares Recoup Early Losses European Shares To Open On Lackluster Note; Bank Stocks In Focus Sensex, Nifty Slip Into Red After Flat Start Asian Markets Mostly Higher Sensex, Nifty Seen Flat To Lower On Cash Crunch Worries <<Previous        82 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Volkswagen To Cut 23,000 Jobs In Germany Cyber Monday Sales Seen Soaring LinkedIn Is Now Blocked In Russia Facebook Stops WhatsApp Data Sharing Across Europe Over EU Criticism Wal-Mart Q3 Profit Declines, But Lifts FY17 Profit View; Stock Down JPMorgan Nears Over $250 Mln Settlement Over China Hiring Probe: Reports Comeback Kid: Donald Trump Hugely Resilient In Business, Too Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates United Airlines Announces Plans For Long-term Earnings Growth FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone LinkedIn Is Now Blocked In Russia AAA: Low Gas Prices Drive Spike In Thanksgiving Travel Upgrade: Steel Stocks In For Trump Renaissance All Is Well With ACRS, First Avastin Biosimilar In The Works, CLRB Abuzz Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Vonovia Offers 0.496645 Shares/conwert Shr Or Alternative Cash Of EUR 16.16/shr United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Novartis Reportedly Considering Sale Of Alcon Eye Care Division Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars United Airlines Announces Plans For Long-term Earnings Growth Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet AT&T Stream Saver To Limit Video Quality To 480p Genentech: Actemra Meets Endpoints In Phase III GiACTA Study Digi Rejects $13.82/shr Proposal From Belden - Quick Facts Schnuck Markets Recalls Ready-to-eat Grilled Chicken Products Kidde Recalls 3.6 Mln Combination Smoke And Carbon Monoxide Detectors Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is conducting a “deep dive” into its sales practices after rival Wells Fargo & Co. settled a probe into the opening of unauthorized accounts. While JPMorgan found some lapses, the problem wasn’t “systemic,” Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said Friday in a conference call with journalists, adding that the review is ongoing. “We will occasionally find issues,” she said. “The important thing is we are focused on finding them. We’re not seeing anything rising to the level where we would be concerned.” Banks are under increased pressure from lawmakers and customers to avoid abuses after Wells Fargo agreed to pay $185 million to resolve investigations into bogus accounts. Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf, who stepped down this week, had promoted the cross-selling of products, such as pitching credit cards to deposit account customers. Wells Fargo said it fired 5,300 employees over fake accounts, and Lake said that JPMorgan has already taken action in instances of staff misbehavior. ‘Right behaviors’ “We can’t have zero defects,” Lake said. “Our incentive compensation is designed for the right behaviors.” Wells Fargo is eliminating products sales goals for members of the retail banking team, and new CEO Tim Sloan said that he is “deeply committed” to restoring trust in the San Francisco-based company. Customer visits to branches declined about 4% in September, the month that the settlement was announced, compared with August, the lender said Friday in a presentation. There was a 30% reduction in the number of consumer checking accounts opened, and a decline in credit-card applications. Wells Fargo shares have lost 18% this year through Thursday. Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said rivals need to be sensitive to risk of employee abuses in an era of increased scrutiny. “When regulators start digging deep, they like to find things," Miller said in a Bloomberg Television interview Friday. “We’re very concerned that regulators really dig, coming after these banks too aggressively."

Finance Search Sat, Nov 19, 2016, 4:32 AM AEDT - Australia Markets closed World stocks rally on cheap money, US banks earningsAFP – Fri, Oct 14, 2016 3:24 PM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo The British pound's big jump weighed on London's benchmark FTSE 100 index European stock markets rebounded Friday, with London's benchmark index headed back towards its record-high level on upbeat Chinese data, while bank results boosted Wall Street. The death of Thailand's king meanwhile sparked bargain-buying in the country after Bangkok stocks suffered sell-offs in his final days. Europe's rally Friday "has probably taken many people by surprise, although this shouldn't be the case given that the markets in both the UK and US are still very close to their all-time highs", said Forex.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada. London's FTSE 100 index this week hit an intra-day high of 7,129.83 points, fuelled by a plunging pound in the wake of Britain's vote earlier this year in favour of quitting the European Union. "There is a reason why the markets are still elevated despite all the doom and gloom out there, and it continues to be this: cheap central bank money," Razaqzada added. The situation could soon change however, if only in the US, as the Federal Reserve prepares to possibly hike interest rates before the end of the year. - US banks shine - US retail sales data released Friday coming in as expected with a 0.6 monthly gain in September after a summer in which consumers had shown a slackening appetite to spend kept alive the possibility of a December rate hike. Wall Street stocks opened higher as a trio of leading banks beat analyst forecasts for third quarter earnings despite the tough low interest rate environment. The three -- Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup -- all saw net profits fall as low rates pared lending margins, but they beat forecasts from analysts, driving their shares higher in early trade. Citigroup led a rebound in banking shares, adding 2.2 percent; Wells Fargo rose 0.4 percent and JPMorgan 1.4 percent. Ahead of the US numbers, Beijing said China's producer price index rose last month after 54 consecutive months of falling -- providing some much-needed hope for the Chinese economy a day after market-sapping trade figures. Chinese firms have for years been battered by falling prices for their goods in the face of chronic overcapacity and weak demand, putting a damper on growth in a key driver of the world economy. Consumer prices also rose more than expected. "Markets were in more positive spirits on Friday," said CMC Markets analyst Jasper Lawler. "Higher than expected inflation data (from China) has unwound some of the global growth concerns brought about by its ugly trade data." - Thai stocks, baht bounce - The Thai king's death this week saw a recovery in the country's stocks Friday, but analysts warned uncertainty over the nation's future without its uniting figure posed fresh risks for an economy already battered by a decade of political turmoil. Thai stocks plunged around six percent this week and the baht lost around three percent as investors grew uneasy about political and economic stability following the death of the monarch who reigned for seven decades. In Seoul, Samsung Electronics rose 1.3 percent as investors brushed off its warning that it expects another $3.0-billion-plus hit to profit over the next two quarters owing to the impact of its exploding Note 7 crisis. It said it hoped a pick-up in sales of its other flagship handset would help cushion the impact. The warning came two days after it slashed its operating profit outlook for the third quarter by $2.3 billion as it announced it was scrapping the model entirely. - Key figures around 1330 GMT - London - FTSE 100: UP 0.9 percent at 7,037.87 points Frankfurt - DAX 30: UP 1.7 percent at 10,586.44 Paris - CAC 40: UP 2.0 percent at 4,493.23 EURO STOXX 50: UP 1.8 percent at 3,029.60 New York - DOW: UP 0.8 percent at 18,235.42 New York - S&P 500: UP 0.5 percent at 2,143.86 New York - Nasdaq: UP 0.5 percent at 5,241.18 Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.5 percent at 16,856.37 (close) Hong Kong - Hang Seng: UP 0.9 percent at 23,233.31 (close) Shanghai - Composite: UP 0.1 percent at 3,063.81 (close) Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.1006 from $1.1056 Thursday Dollar/yen: UP at 104.35 yen from 103.66 yen Pound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2213 from $1.2253 Euro/pound: DOWN at 90.07 pence from 90.25 pence Oil - West Texas Intermediate: UP 15 cents at $50.59 per barrel Oil - Brent North Sea: DOWN 10 cents at $51.93 @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Water fight could drench backpacker billAAP A stoush over water reform could sink the government's hopes of getting its backpacker tax through parliament. … VW to cut 30,000 jobs, 23,000 in GermanyAAP European stocks falter; euro hits dollar low for yearAFP Kogan welcomes prospect of AmazonAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7345 -0.0071 -0.95% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.5957 -0.0012 -0.20% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6932 -0.0045 -0.64% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Golden pheasant Health insurance ISIS Melbourne Cheap international flights 457 visa program Mobile phone Leonard Cohen Adelaide Accommodation Brendan Dassey iPad Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.
