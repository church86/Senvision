 Millennials aren't spending money like their parents did Matt Turner Sep. 14, 2016, 12:31 AM 35,434 facebook linkedin twitter email print A millennial at the Burning Man festival. Aly Weisman/Business Insider Millennials are spending their money differently from their parents and grandparents. Gordon Smith, chief executive for consumer and community banking at JPMorgan, gave a presentation on Monday at the Barclays Financial Services Conference discussing the spending patterns of millennials. JPMorgan is especially focused on this group, and we've written before about the bank spending big to land younger customers. The chart below shows what millennials and non-millennials purchased using Chase debit and credit cards in 2015. To clear up any confusion, JPMorgan defined millennials as those born between 1981 and 1997, while non-millennials are those born before 1981. You'll see that millennials spend a lot more on "experiences" — things like travel, entertainment, and dining. JPMorgan The spending patterns of the millennial generation are important, as they'll be shaping consumer demand for years to come. The compound annual growth rate in retail spending from this group is forecast to be 15% from 2014 to 2020, versus a 4% increase for those ages 35 and up.

That’s the first back-to-back reduction in so-called net short positions in sterling since Britain voted to leave the European Union in June. The U.K. currency gained versus all except one of its 16 major peers before a report Tuesday that economists forecast will show annual consumer-price inflation accelerated in August from a year ago at the fastest pace since November 2014. JPMorgan Chase & Co. revised up its year-end forecasts for the pound against the dollar and the euro, citing a resilient growth outlook. Monetary Policy Committee members led by Governor Mark Carney will announce their decision on Sept. 15. “We do sense a period of sterling stability, at least for now,” said Neil Jones, head of hedge fund sales at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in London. “U.K. economic performance after the Brexit vote is proving better than expected. On the political front, sentiment is shifting from immediate hard Brexit to a more prolonged but softer one.” The pound rose 0.3 percent to $1.3308 as of 4:06 p.m. in London, after sliding 1.3 percent in the previous three days. It strengthened 0.4 percent to 84.34 pence per euro, having depreciated 0.9 percent last week after the European Central Bank refrained from extending its monetary stimulus. Resilient Economy Sterling has outperformed all of its 16 major counterparts in the past month as reports from services to construction showed the U.K. economy was holding up better than some economists predicted, marking a turnaround from when the Brexit vote and the resulting stimulus from the BOE made it the worst performer. It touched a 31-year low of $1.2798 on July 6 and is still down 11 percent versus the dollar since the June 23 referendum. Short positions, or bets on the currency’s decline, outnumbered bullish wagers by 89,969 contracts last week, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. That’s down from record 94,978 contracts in August, the most since Bloomberg started compiling the data in 1992. JPMorgan now sees the pound at $1.32 by the end of this year from $1.28 in its previous forecast, according to a report published on Monday. The bank revised its year-end forecast for the U.K. currency versus the euro to 87 pence from 90 pence previously. Sign up to receive the Brexit Bulletin, a daily briefing on the biggest news related to Britain's departure from the EU. BOE Outlook The BOE cut its main interest rate to a record in August and resumed its bond-buying program to head off the risk of an economic slowdown after the referendum, while lowering its growth forecasts. Data since have suggested that the U.K. economy is holding up. All the analysts in separate Bloomberg surveys predict the central bank will keep its key rate and asset-purchase target unchanged on Thursday. “The combination of Carney ruling out negative rates and better economic data has not left much room for maneuver for the market, which is not priced for much additional easing this year,” said Jane Foley, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank International in London. “Any signal that the MPC could be seriously looking to ease in November is set to undermine the pound this week.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Sep 16, 2016 at 8:20PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. The Dow Jones Industrial Average contains 30 of the United States' biggest and best-known companies. Included among them are three banks: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and American Express (NYSE:AXP). Bank Market Capitalization Net Income (TTM) Share Price JPMorgan Chase  $237.7 billion  $23.9 billion $65.82 Goldman Sachs  $67.3 billion  $5.2 billion $166.00 American Express  $237.7 billion  $23.9 billion $65.82 *As of Sept. 16, 2016. Data source: YCharts.com. Why did these three banks make the cut? There are multiple reasons why these three banks are included on the Dow while other banks are not. To this end, here's the selection criteria for Dow stocks: The index ... is a price-weighted measure of 30 U.S. blue-chip companies. The index covers all industries with the exception of transportation and utilities... While stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules, a stock typically is added to the index only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors. Maintaining adequate sector representation within the indices is also a consideration in the selection process The reasons why JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and American Express made the cut relate to their size, reputation, popularity, and the specific niches in which they operate. JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in America based on market cap, which easily qualifies it as a blue chip company. It's been known since its founding more than a century ago for prudence and profitability. Most recently, while competitors such as Bank of America and Citigroup have had to retreat and retrench since the financial crisis, JPMorgan Chase took the opportunity to gain market share and continue growing, most notably through its government-assisted acquisitions of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual in 2008. Goldman Sachs plays a similar role among stand-alone investment banks, being the biggest and most admired on Wall Street. As such, not only does it satisfy the blue chip requirement, but it also offers a pure play on a bank that makes its money from capital markets businesses -- trading and investment banking. Finally, although many people don't think of American Express as a bank, that's exactly what it is. Unlike Visa, which provides only the payment system's infrastructure -- connecting merchants, customers, and banks -- American Express also finances the loans underlying its credit card holders' accounts. In the most recent quarter, American Express earned $1.5 billion in net interest income alone, which supplemented its $6.8 billion in noninterest income -- things like annual fees and late fees. In short, it's no coincidence that these are three of the biggest and best-known bank stocks in the country, and that they're also included on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Over the past few weeks, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, JPMorgan Asset Management, and Nuveen have all marked respective “firsts” with regard to exchange-traded funds. The JPMorgan Disciplined High Yield (JPHY) is J.P. Morgan's first fixed-income ETF. The ETF will face stiff, established competition from the Pimco Total Return Active ETF (BOND), and the SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF (TOTL), as well as passive high-yield bond ETFs, SPDR Barclays High-Yield (JNK), and iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bonds (HYG). The Goldman Sachs Treasury Access 0-1 Year (GBIL) is the first ETF to offer same-day settlement of creation and redemption in the short-term Treasury market, which essentially makes it a money market substitute. And Nuveen's NuShares Enhanced Yield U.S. Aggregate Bond (NUAG) is the first product launched on the NuShares ETF Platform. The recent launches follow patterns of expansion in the ETF space by firms such firms as John Hancock Financial Services, Legg Mason, and Franklin Templeton, according Todd Rosenbluth, director ETF research at S&P Global Market Intelligence. “You don't just enter the ETF market lightly, and a lot of companies have started paying more attention to building ETF lineups,” he said. In terms of the recent string of bond ETFs, Mr. Rosenbluth said, “The appeal of getting in is the significant money that has gone into fixed-income ETFs, and these active-management firms like JPMorgan have a lot of prowess in that area.” JPMorgan, which launched its first ETF in June 2014, now has 10 products and $850 million in ETF assets. But they are just getting started, according to Joanna Gallegos, head of product development for ETFs at JPMorgan. The company currently has a multi-sector global fixed income ETF, and an ultra-short bond ETF in registration. “The appeal of ETFs for us is we're able to reach new client segments and expand our business,” Ms. Gallegos said. “We will continue to launch products over the next few years.” It's a similar story at Nuveen, which is an operating division of TIAA Global Asset Management. Nuveen's new strategic-beta ETF, which is designed to squeeze maximum yield out of a broad bond universe is just the beginning, according to Martin Kremenstein, managing director and head of ETFs at Nuveen. “We're bringing strategic-beta methodology to the fixed-income world, and this is quite different from anything we already offer,” he said. “There are lots more planned, but what we've done with this new ETF is a good guide of what we have planned.” So far, none of these firms are suggesting a move away from traditional open-end mutual funds as they migrate into the ETF space, and the mutual-fund industry at $12.5 trillion still towers over the $2.4 trillion ETF market. But the trend toward ETFs continues to mount. According to Morningstar, U.S. open-end mutual fund assets are sitting at an all-time high, but so far this year the industry has suffered more than $8.7 billion in net outflows, which follows $35.1 billion in net outflows last year. The total number of distinct funds, not counting multiple share classes, stands at 8,155, down from 8,208 in December. ETFs, meanwhile, are in the midst of a growth spurt, including net flows this year of more than $141 billion, following two consecutive years of more than $240 billion in net inflows. Morningstar counts a total of 1,927 ETFs, up from 1,848 in December. “It's nice to see some legitimate firms coming into the ETF space,” said Matt Collins, head of U.S. product operations at ETF Securities. “Generally, it seems like what the fund companies are offering in the form of ETFs is what they've done for decades, but some of the business dynamics of active management and/or higher fees is putting pressure on the way they've always done things,” he added. Since roughly 80% of his firm's $22 billion in ETF assets is in specialized commodity strategies, Mr. Collins doesn't yet see a major threat from the giant asset managers pushing deeper into ETFs. But, he said, the potential to have an impact on the ETF space is there. “Their presence will be felt in the marketing dollars they spend, because they have the ability to allocate huge amounts of money,” Mr. Collins said. “They also have huge distribution networks, but the trick for them might be finding a way to leverage that distribution by giving each product enough attention.” 0 Comments What do you think?

(Photo: Thinkstock) (Bloomberg) — Just when the world is most craving clarity on the future of Japan’s monetary policy, currency markets show it has become particularly hard to predict. With so little consensus on what Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will come up with for the Sept. 21 policy decision, Eaton Vance Corp. and a unit of Bank of New York Mellon Corp. are abstaining from any positions in the yen, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. says some investors have closed out bets on declines in the dollar versus the Asian currency. Such is the consternation that the options premium on contracts to buy the yen in a month’s time disappeared for the first time since November, before reversing course this week. Japan became the epicenter of a global bond selloff this month, amid speculation the central bank will pull back from buying long-term bonds after Kuroda ordered a comprehensive review of its easing program. The governor acknowledged last week that low long-term yields hurt returns on pension and insurance investments, even as he signaled there would be no reduction in easing. The Federal Reserve will decide on interest rates just hours after the BOJ’s meeting, adding to the quandary about the yen’s direction. No position “There is a chance that the yen weakens from these levels if the BOJ is more aggressive in new monetary easing than people expect, but getting the timing of that right is difficult,” said Eric Stein, Boston-based co-director of global fixed income at Eaton Vance, which oversees about $330 billion. “Given the current risk-reward and all other variables in the world such as the trend in the dollar and U.S. rates, we don’t currently have a position in the yen.” The currency, as well as the central bank, has the potential to surprise. Kuroda’s shock announcement of a negative deposit rate on Jan. 29 weakened the yen only briefly, to the low for the year of 121.69 per dollar. After that it strengthened — reaching as high as 99.02 in June for the first time since 2013 after Britain voted to leave the European Union. The exchange rate was at 101.86 as of 6:55 a.m. in New York. Related: Treasuries gain as Brexit vote dampens bets on higher U.S. rates Just over half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg anticipate expanded easing next week, with a rate cut seen as the most likely option. “There is an expectation that the BOJ might do something, but the problem is the market is mixed on what that might be or whether it’s something new that we haven’t even seen yet,” said Laura Fitzsimmons, Sydney-based vice president for rates and foreign-exchange sales at JPMorgan, the world’s second-largest currency trader. “Dollar-yen, if anything, probably has a slight bias higher still from these levels.” Mixed messages Options traders are also sending mixed messages. The premium for contracts to buy the yen versus the dollar in one month, over the cost of those to sell, was at 0.5 percentage point Thursday, after largely disappearing from end-August through last week. Shorter term they have turned more bearish, paying a premium of 0.8 percentage point for one-week contracts to buy the dollar against the yen over those allowing for sales. On June 22, the right to purchase the Japanese currency cost 4.5 percentage points, the most in more than seven years. Yield curves The Japanese currency has traded within a six-yen range versus the dollar since the last BOJ gathering on July 29, when the central bank underwhelmed markets with a stimulus boost that fell short of analyst expectations. Its  announcement of a comprehensive review of its policy framework then intensified concern that Kuroda had few tools left to revive the economy as his goal of raising inflation to 2 percent proved to be elusive. Related: Taiwan mulls shielding insurers from callable corporate bonds Fluctuations in the debt market have been more volatile than the yen before next week’s meeting. Yields on Japan’s long-term government bonds climbed Wednesday to a six-month high on speculation policy makers would seek a steepening in the curve that plots yields of different maturities to mitigate the pain on banks and savers from negative interest rates. While it’s unclear what a steeper yield curve that might be sought by the BOJ would mean for the yen, the threat of a pullback in higher-yielding assets could fuel demand for the Japanese currency as a haven, said Paul Lambert, the London-based head of currencies at Insight Investment Management Ltd., a unit of Bank of New York Mellon, which manages about $580 billion. Bullish bets on the currency remained close to the record high reached in April as hedge funds and other large speculators added to wagers that sought to profit from its strength since the start of the year, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed. “The market’s already very long the yen so that would make you cautious to buy,” Lambert said. “Our conclusion is the best place to be in the short term is on the sidelines and let these things play out.” Related: Pimco at odds with Goldman on Yellen as September rate bets rise Life insurers swap liquidity for yield Have you followed us on Facebook?

Shares in Credit Suisse Group AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Barclays Plc and UBS Group AG fell after Deutsche Bank AG disclosed that the U.S. Department of Justice is seeking $14 billion to settle claims it sold faulty securities before the financial crisis. While U.S. rivals including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. have reached settlements, banks across the Atlantic have yet to resolve similar probes. While Deutsche Bank said it’s not willing to pay “anywhere near” $14 billion to resolve the DOJ case, the claim has added to concerns about the ultimate size of the agreements and whether European banks will need to raise more funds to cover them, analysts said. The region’s largest lenders have seen a slump in earnings, hurt by volatile markets and negative rates, with the U.K.’s vote to exit the European Union adding to uncertainty about Europe’s growth prospects. “News flow over last couple of months has been centered on one major topic: Brexit,” said Joseph Dickerson, an analyst at Jefferies International Ltd. in London. “The market may have become slightly complacent, and this serves as a reminder the numbers could prospectively be quite large.” Stock Drops Deutsche Bank fell 7.9 percent to 12.06 euros at 12:05 p.m. in Frankfurt, the biggest drop in almost three months. Credit Suisse fell 4.7 percent to 12.72 Swiss francs in Zurich, while RBS, Barclays and UBS also slid. The Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index has tumbled 24 percent this year, eroding about 215 billion euros ($241 billion) of market value. The DOJ and the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA, have been probing whether the biggest banks sold shoddy mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Six European banks, including HSBC Holdings Plc, sold almost $80 billion of securities that have been subject to FHFA complaints, according to data collected by Bloomberg Intelligence. The $14 billion sought by U.S. authorities is quadruple the $3 billion to $3.5 billion that JPMorgan analysts led by Kian Abouhossein said would be in line with their litigation estimates. It would also be more than what U.S. banks with larger mortgage operations paid. ‘Pushing Back’ “It seems that with every settlement the DOJ wants to get more from European companies,” said Andreas Domke, a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors whose fund holds about 2 million Deutsche Bank shares. “It’s good Deutsche Bank is pushing back while asking to lower the fine.” The amount of securities subject to the FHFA’s complaints can serve as a guide as to how much the DOJ will seek in penalties, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. RBS, based in Edinburgh, sold $32.1 billion, more than Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse combined. RBS has set aside about $7 billion to cover the probes, Abouhossein wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan said last month that his bank has yet to enter talks over a settlement amount with the DOJ. An agreement is one of the biggest issues the bank must overcome before it can pay dividends. Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, both in the midst of lengthy overhauls to boost profit, sold about $14 billion each of the mortgage-backed securities that were included in the FHFA complaints. While analysts said the DOJ’s claim was just an initial request in the settlement process, the number has only added to uncertainty. “Everyone’s just stabbing in the dark,” said Andreas Brun, an analyst with Mirabaud Securities LLP. “All there’s to do is wait.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(AP Photo/David Goldman) Share Written by Nicholas Tampio Obsession The Art of Parenting September 17, 2016 According to the grit narrative, children in the United States are lazy, entitled and unprepared to compete in the global economy. Schools have contributed to the problem by neglecting socio-emotional skills. The solution, then, is for schools to impart the dispositions that enable American children to succeed in college and careers. According to this story, politicians, policymakers, corporate executives and parents agree that kids need more grit. The person who has arguably done more than anyone else to elevate the concept of grit in academic and popular conversations is Angela Duckworth, professor at the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania. In her new book, Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance, she explains the concept of grit and how people can cultivate it in themselves and others. According to Duckworth, grit is the ability to overcome any obstacle in pursuit of a long-term project: “To be gritty is to hold fast to an interesting and purposeful goal. To be gritty is to invest, day after week after year, in challenging practice. To be gritty is to fall down seven times and rise eight.” Duckworth names musicians, athletes, coaches, academics and business people who succeed because of grit. Her book will be a boon for policymakers who want schools to inculcate and measure grit. There is a time and place for grit. However, praising grit as such makes no sense because it can often lead to stupid or mean behavior. Duckworth’s book is filled with gritty people doing things that they, perhaps, shouldn’t. Take Martin Seligman, the founder of positive psychology and Duckworth’s graduate school mentor. In a 1967 article, Seligman and his co-author describe a series of experiments on dogs. The first day, the dogs are placed in a harness and administered electrical shocks. One group can stop the shocks if they press their nose against a panel, and the other group cannot. The next day, all of the dogs are placed in a shuttle box and again administered shocks that the dogs can stop by jumping over a barrier. Most of the dogs who could stop the shocks the first day jumped over the barrier, while most of the dogs who suffered inescapable shock did not try, though a few did. Duckworth reflects upon this story and her own challenges in a college course in neurobiology. She decides that she passed the course because she would “be like the few dogs who, despite recent memories of uncontrollable pain, held fast to hope.” Duckworth would be like one of the dogs that got up and kept fighting.  Praising grit as such makes no sense because it can often lead to stupid or mean behavior. At no point, however, does Duckworth express concern that many of the animals in Seligman’s study died or became ill shortly thereafter. Nor does she note that the CIA may have employed the theory of “learned helplessness” to perform enhanced interrogation, regardless of Seligman’s stated opposition to torture. Duckworth acknowledges the possibility that there might be “grit villains” but dismisses this concern because “there are many more gritty heroes.” There is no reason to assume this, and it oversimplifies the moral universe to maintain that one has to be a ‘grit villain’ to thoughtlessly harm people. A second grit paragon in Duckworth’s book is Pete Carroll, the Super Bowl-winning coach of the Seattle Seahawks American football team. Carroll has created a culture of grit where assistant coaches chant: “No whining. No complaining. No excuses.” She also commends Seahawk defensive back Earl Thomas for playing with “marvelous intensity.” Duckworth has apparently not read any of the articles or seen any of the movies or television programs detailing the long-term harm caused by playing professional football. President Barack Obama, among others, has said that he would not want a son, if he had one, to play football. Duckworth might have talked with football players who suffer from traumatic brain injuries. Another role model, for Duckworth, is Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Dimon’s alma mater prep school has the motto of “grytte,” and Duckworth attributes JPMorgan Chase’s success to the grit of its leader: “In the 2008 financial crisis, Jamie steered his bank to safety, and while other banks collapsed entirely, JPMorgan Chase somehow turned a $5 billion profit.” There is no basis for the word “somehow” in this sentence. The Troubled Asset Relief Program provided JPMorgan Chase with $25 billion in 2008. In general, neither Duckworth nor the protagonists in her book dwell upon the political conditions that enable or thwart individual success. Duckworth gives many more troublesome examples. The CEO of Cinnabon who never reflects on how she contributes to the obesity epidemic in the US. The Spelling Bee champs who don’t love to read. The West Point cadets who have to endure a borderline-hazing initiation rite called Beast.  The opposite of grit, often enough, is thinking, wondering, asking questions, and refusing to push a boulder up a hill. Why don’t these people ever stop to think about what they are doing? We should not celebrate the fact that “paragons of grit don’t swap compasses,” as Duckworth puts it in her book. That might signal a moral failing on their part. The opposite of grit, often enough, is thinking, wondering, asking questions, and refusing to push a boulder up a hill. Right now, many Americans want the next generation to be gritty. Already, school districts in California are using modified versions of Duckworth’s Grit Survey to hold schools and teachers accountable for how well children demonstrate “self-management skills.” Duckworth herself opposes grading schools on grit because the measurement tools are unreliable. But that stance overlooks the larger problem of how a grit culture contributes to an authoritarian politics, one where leaders expect the masses to stay on task. Democracy requires active citizens who think for themselves and, often enough, challenge authority. Consider, for example, what kind of people participated in the Boston Tea Party, the Seneca Falls Convention, the March on Washington, or the present-day test-refusal movement. In each of these cases, ordinary people demand a say in how they are governed. Duckworth celebrates educational models such as Beast at West Point that weed out people who don’t obey orders. That is a disastrous model for education in a democracy. US schools ought to protect dreamers, inventors, rebels and entrepreneurs—not crush them in the name of grit.

Investors continue to remain on edge regarding the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at its meeting next week. Banks also fell, led by a plunge in Deutsche Bank after the giant German lender said it wouldn't settle with the Department of Justice over its handling of mortgage securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 88.68 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,123.80. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8.10 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,139.16 and the Nasdaq composite fell 5.12 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,244.57. The U.S.-listed shares of Deutsche Bank dropped $1.38, or 9 percent, to $13.38 after the bank said it did not intend to pay the $14 billion settlement that the U.S. government asked for. Federal regulators have been looking to settle with Deutsche Bank, as it has done with the other major Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co., for its role in the mortgage bubble and financial crisis. Other European banks fell as well. Royal Bank of Scotland Group fell 30 cents, or 6 percent, to $4.86. The news out of Deutsche Bank dragged European stocks lower, with Germany's DAX closing down 1.5 percent, France's CAC-40 index down 0.9 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index down 0.3 percent. Stocks have been volatile this week, with the Dow moving more than 100 points four out of five days. Most of the volatility has come as investors prepare for next week's Fed meeting. While most investors do not expect a rate increase, there is a small but noticeable likelihood there will be one. "By the Fed's own criteria, everything is in place for them to raise rates. But still, people don't think they are going to raise rates, so the market is in conflict," said David Kelly, chief global investment strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. In other company news, pharmaceutical company Novavax plunged $7.05, or 85 percent, to $1.29 after the company said its experimental vaccine failed in late-stage clinical testing. Novavax has no active products on the market and this drug was their furthest in development. Intel rose $1.11, or 3 percent, to $37.67 after the company raised its revenue forecasts, citing stronger-than-expected demand for personal computers. The S&P 500 is adding a new industry to its traditional groups for the first time since the dotcom era. The benchmark stock index will now have a real estate sector, which will be split off from the financial services component. The new industry component will be effective at the end of trading Friday. After the split, the S&P 500 will have 11 industry sectors. The 10 current sectors of the S&P 500 are: financial services, information technology, energy, industrials, consumer discretionary companies, materials, telecommunications, consumer staples, health care and utilities. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 88 cents to $43.03 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 82 cents to $45.77 per barrel. Heating oil fell 1 cent to $1.41 a gallon, wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents to $1.46 a gallon and natural gas rose 2 cents to $2.948 per 1,000 cubic feet. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was mostly unchanged at 1.69 percent. The euro fell to $1.1151 from $1.246 and the dollar rose to 102.42 yen from 102.16 yen. In metals, gold fell $7.80 to $1,310.20 an ounce, silver fell 18 cents to $18.86 an ounce and copper was unchanged at $2.16 a pound. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

What's Killing Branches Can Make Them Stronger By Tanaya Macheel September 16, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email 1 Comments Print Reprints Related  Enlarge This Image Related B of A Digital Team Has a Fat Budget and a Whole Bunch of Plans UMB Emulates Apple in Push to Encourage Mobile, Online Use Bank Branches Don't Die, They Evolve JPM Introduces Mobile Authentication at ATMs How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue Smaller, yet service-oriented. Compatible with digital banking. Profitable. That is the vision increasingly being painted of the bank branch of the future. And before dismissing it as a delusion of the glass-is-half-full crowd, consider that notably tech-savvy companies like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and UMB Financial are among those making the case that branches are still essential to setting a bank apart from its rivals. JPMorgan's branches have been crucial in building long-term relationships with more lucrative customers, even in today's high-tech world, said Erin Hill, the company's head of consumer branch banking and wealth management. Its younger, "more digitally active" employees spend time helping customers with more complex questions, using mobile phones and tablets to provide service and develop a rapport, she explained. "If we were trying to shift to an all-digital channel I don't think we'd have nearly the success we've had," Hill said. The future-of-the-branch debate took a new twist this month after Wells Fargo agreed to pay $190 million to settle charges that thousands of employees created unauthorized bank and credit card accounts for customers from 2011 to 2014 in order to meet sales goals and collect bonuses for themselves. It has sparked a discussion about whether banks, worried about the crushing overhead from quieter branches, are putting too much pressure on employees to generate revenue. "The declining transaction volumes render sales more difficult," said Steven Reider, founder and president of the marketing and branch-planning adviser Bancography. "Can we keep rationing sales goals inexorably upward when branch traffic is declining? The answer is no." Yet equating transaction decline with branch decline misses the fundamental point that branches no longer exist to cash checks, Reider said. More consumers receive direct deposits now, they pay bills electronically and withdraw cash from ATMs. Business receive less cash now or perhaps offload it through cash back at the point of sale. Branches are starting to shrink in square footage and number of staff, and the average salary for branch employees will increase so they can keep who employees who can deliver more sophisticated services, Reider said. JPMorgan's Hill painted a similar picture, and said it's not necessarily a dire reality. "The truth is: if you look at the activity from customers coming in for basic transactions at the teller line, those are not necessarily the people growing their balances and leading to the growth of the overall business," Hill said. "We try to help our bankers understand the lessening of foot traffic does not at all affect their ability to deepen relationships with customers." Moreover, the point is not to see the branch and digital as antithetical, she and others said. "We cannot be naive to the fact that our customers want to be able to engage with us when and where they want in a very easy manner, hence the continued investment in the other channels," Hill said of mobile, digital and other innovation efforts and initiatives. "You can't have a successful branch network without those." It's still a people business at heart, and the branch is the place to provide a higher level of service that breeds customer loyalty, said Joe Salesky, chief executive of CRMNEXT, a customer-engagement software provider for financial services. "There's no ability to differentiate the self-service. … What's it going to take to be a bank of service, to help the bank transform?" His answer? Bring the physical and digital worlds together in customer interactions, Salesky said. Like Apple Stores, where bank associates would help customers side by side instead of face to face, using mobile devices as tools for service. It would be more comfortable yet still personal. Customers could book appointments with branch representatives in advance or walk in off the street for hands-on digital banking demos. Bank of America is already doing that. Its 3,800 "digital ambassadors," easily identifiable by the lanyards they wear to customers who enter their branches, are trained to help customers better understand and navigate the mobile app or website for themselves — a sort of service for self-service. Inspired by Apple's Genius Bar and Best Buy's Geek Squad, the year-old initiative at B of A also lets customers book appointments to digital ambassador bars. Similarly, in March 2014 UMB in Kansas City, Mo., put tech support specialists in its branches to help customers understand how to make mobile deposits and use online bill pay and other digital services. "In-branch traffic is going down across the country," Christine Pierson, head of UMB's financial consumer division, said at the time. "[We're] interested in ways to get customers to be engaged with the bank." That kind of side-by-side learning would give banks more opportunity to cross-sell. There is also an understanding gap between customers and the products banks are selling — which amount to far more than the number of products Apple has to sell, and with which many customers are largely unfamiliar. Hill emphasized the importance of empathy, acknowledging the personal conversations, sometimes emotional and sometimes uncomfortable, that occur between bankers and clients when the latter are purchasing a home, saving for retirement, funding a child's education or financing a business. She pointed to JPMorgan's branch in the retail area of the new World Trade Center complex in New York. At 2,700 square feet, it's about 35% smaller than the company's typical branch. But there are 11 ATMs throughout the large shopping area that can perform about 60% of basic bank transactions, giving customers a self-service option so JPMorgan can reallocate its branch space for one-on-one meetings. Inside the branch, there are just two teller windows, four offices for customers to discuss their more complex needs with bankers, and a private-banking team. JPMorgan has no plans to incorporate its own Genius Bars or remodel branch floors into a coffee house environment, Hill said, but its philosophy has nuances of Apple's old "Think Different" mantra. "We're continuing to think differently as to what would make something easier for our customer" through focus groups, its innovation lab and feedback from 250,000 employees, she said. "It's not just that we're going to keep doing what we're doing. We're going to continue to think differently."

The challenge still relies on the digital interaction for cross-sell because the customer that choose those channels usually is interested in completing the required operation as fast as possible without spending time to look at different offers.

Photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint A study by JPMorgan Chase Bank’s India economists says the sharp rise in currency holdings with the public in India is explained by a rise in rural wages. “The real growth of currency-in-circulation has a stable, long-run relationship with the rural economy, as proxied by real rural wages,” wrote economists Sajjid Z. Chinoy and Toshi Jain in a 14 September report. Their model shows 67% of the recent increase in higher cash holdings in the economy can be explained by rural wages alone.  At the end of August, annual growth of currency in circulation was 17.6%, a clear 7 percentage points higher than a year ago. The growth in cash holding started around September 2015, led to tighter liquidity conditions and has been one of the reasons for the central bank to shift its liquidity stance.  Click here for enlarge Conventional wisdom said currency holdings with the public shoots up during elections. But public currency holdings growth continued to accelerate after the assembly elections in May.  New reasons came into vogue. Some economists said it was owing to a rise in service taxes, while others said it was driven by the government’s stricter rules for purchase of gold jewellery, leading to people holding on to cash. The JPMorgan economists said the currency holdings growth seems to mimic the rural economy. As rural growth accelerated sharply in the mid-2000s because of government programmes such as Bharat Nirman and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, currency holdings also grew.  Conversely, the rural economy slowdown since led to a moderation in currency holding growth till the end of 2015.  That the currency growth can be explained by the rural economy is also “consistent with the fact that other indicators (motorcycle sales) suggest the rural economy may be inflecting,” wrote Chinoy and Jain. Why is this important?  As rural incomes grow even more—on the back of a better monsoon and good harvests —there is a possibility that currency holdings growth will accelerate even more. Thus, if the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stays committed to its stance of keeping the liquidity deficit neutral, it will make the process of liquidity management more challenging. That will either necessitate more dollar purchases (releasing rupees into the system), which appears difficult because of the coming repatriation of FCNR(B) deposits or buying more bonds though open market operations. RBI has already purchased Rs1 trillion worth of bonds this fiscal.  To be sure, a balance of payments surplus and robust capital inflows will reduce the pressure on open market bond purchases. But a large amount of bond buying from RBI will help transmission, Chinoy and Jain added.  However, that also adds to RBI’s problems. If rural growth accelerates, it pushes up inflation and currency in circulation. “But that’s a potential conundrum for a later date,” they wrote.

The settlement proposal, made during negotiations between the U.S. Department of Justice and Deutsche Bank over claims that the German bank missold mortgage-backed securities, was larger than expected. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed shares were down 8.5 percent in premarket trading. Dow component Goldman Sachs fell 0.6 percent, while JPMorgan dropped 0.5 percent. Oil prices fell 1.6 percent on worries of oversupply. Energy stocks were among the biggest losers among S&P 500 components. Dow e-minis were down 59 points, or 0.33 percent at 8:33 a.m. ET, with 29,133 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were down 8 points, or 0.37 percent, with 262,735 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 16 points, or 0.33 percent, on volume of 39,386 contracts. Investors also await the Federal Reserve's meeting starting next Tuesday. While traders have very low expectations of an interest rate hike, investors will be keen for commentary on how the central bank views on the recent sluggish economic data. The data and contrasting comments from Fed officials on rate hikes have caused the markets to oscillate and volatility to spike in the past few days. "Like it has been before, Mr. Market gets it right in the long term but tends to over react in the short term, and that's what we have seen all this week," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Volatility may rise again on as Friday, which marks the quadruple witching day, a day when investors unwind interests in futures and options contracts prior to expiration. Data showed consumer prices increased more than expected in August, pointing to a steady build-up of inflation - a key factor that the Fed considers while deliberating over monetary policy. Exxon was down 1.28 percent at $83.99 after the Wall Street Journal said the New York Attorney General was investigating the company's accounting practices. Apple was flat at $115.01. The stock has rallied for four days and been the one bright spot in the market on strong demand for the new iPhones, which hit stores on Friday. Oracle dropped 2.72 percent to $39.75 after the company forecast lower-than-expected quarterly profit.

All the benchmark's major sectors were lower. The Nasdaq Composite was down 14.61 points, or 0.28 percent, at 5,235.08. Helping the tech-heavy index was Intel's 3.14 percent gain after the chipmaker raised its third-quarter revenue forecast.

News Advice Career Coaching Interviews Qualifications Students About the Industry All Student News Applications & CV’s Graduate Internships Interviews Comment Graduate Guide Asset Management Corporate Banking Hedge Funds Information Services Insurance Investment Banks Private Equity Professional Services ☰ Menu News Advice Career Coaching Interviews Qualifications Students About the Industry All Student News Applications & CV’s Graduate Internships Interviews Comment Graduate Guide Asset Management Corporate Banking Hedge Funds Information Services Insurance Investment Banks Private Equity Professional Services Will fines finish Deutsche’s investment bank? by Sarah Butcher 16 September 2016 The proposed $14bn DOJ fine looks incredibly ominous for Deutsche’s sales and trading staff. http://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/249246/doom-at-deutsche-bank/ Sitting in his office in Frankfurt’s Kaiserhofstraße, Stefan Mueller, a former proprietary trader from Dresdner and Sal Oppenheim who now runs German brokerage DWGA has long been cognizant of the vultures circling Deutsche’s corporate and investment bank. Back in July, he claimed Deutsche’s conservative corporate bankers wanted to spin-off the investment bank into a separate entity. Today’s news that the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) wants to slap a $14bn (€12.5bn) fine on Deutsche for mis-selling mortgaged backed securities before the financial crisis would seem to strengthen their hand. Deutsche intends to fight the fine, but the bank’s shares fell 8% this morning after news of its enormity surfaced. They’ve since recovered slightly, but not enough to reassure the likes of Mueller or the markets. The proposed $14bn fine is a huge deal for Deutsche There are various reasons why the DOJ fine is a big deal for Deutsche Bank and the 24,000 people working in Deutsche’s corporate and investment bank, of whom 4,700 are in front office investment banking jobs. 1. Deutsche had expected the fine to be a lot lower As analysts at J.P. Morgan pointed out in a report yesterday, Deutsche had put aside $6.2bn in litigation reserves at the end of June 2016. J.P.M expected Deutsche to put aside a further $2.1bn in the second half of this year and $1.1bn next year, bringing the reserves to $9.4bn in total by the end of 2017. If the $14bn fine goes through, Deutsche’s reserves will therefore be woefully inadequate. To make matters worse, the DOJ isn’t the only authority with Deutsche in its sights. There’s a possible penalty of between $1bn and $4bn for the bank’s alleged involvement in Russian money laundering in the pipeline, and Deutsche’s second quarter results highlighted six other pending investigations, at least. 2. The fine is equivalent to 74% of Deutsche Bank’s market capitalization  Deutsche Bank’s market capitalization currently stands at €16.9bn ($19bn). The DOJ fine is therefore 74% of the bank’s current value. It’s no surprise Deutsche’s shares are plummeting. 3. The fine threatens Deutsche’s capital base This is the crux of the matter. J.P. Morgan’s analysts suggested yesterday that a settlement with the DOJ in excess of $4bn would raise questions about Deutsche’s capital position. – And Deutsche’s capital position was already questionable. By 2018, Deutsche Bank needs a core equity tier one (CET1) capital ratio of 12.25% under the European Banking Association’s Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP).  Even assuming a successful sale of Postbank, J.P. Morgan’s analysts were expecting that Deutsche would be below that, at just 11.2%. That shortfall now looks like being a lot worse. If fines exceed the $9.4bn of litigation provisions Deutsche is expected to have amassed next year, J.P.M says every $1bn extra will reduce Deutsche’s 2017 CET1 ratio by 24bps. Today’s proposed $14bn fine therefore implies a 120bps reduction in Deutsche’s CET1 ratio. This could be supplemented by a further 96 basis point reduction if the Russian fines come through at the top end of the expected range – To say nothing of additional fines for other misdemeanours. In the worst case scenario (and assuming a successful sale of Postbank), J.P. Morgan’s analysis therefore suggest Deutsche could now arrive in 2018 with a CET1 capital shortfall of 216bps due to the DOJ and Russian fines as well as the 105bps shortfall it was facing already. Put another way, Deutsche was already facing a $2.5bn capital hole. Unless the DOJ cuts today’s fine, the German bank is now facing a capital hole of $7.1bn – and more if other Russian and other fines are levied too. 4. Deutsche will struggle to raise additional capital  The implied 321bps capital shortfall and resulting CET1 ratio of just 9.04% would be an issue for any bank, but for Deutsche Bank it’s potentially disastrous. With the bank’s share price down 47% since the start of this year, another rights issue is out of the question. And with the cost of insuring Deutsche Bank’s debt already high and now rising, tapping bondholders looks impossible too. Of course, there’s always the possibility of selling the asset management division – but Cryan ruled this out earlier this week.  5. Deutsche bank will need to make additional big cuts to its risk weighted assets  The other solution is for Deutsche to cut even deeper than it already planned to. The bank had €402bn of risk weighted assets on its books as of the second quarter of 2016.  Deutsche CEO John Cryan already intended to cut the bank’s RWAs by €120bn, but there’s been little real sign of cuts in the global markets division so far. – At the end of the second quarter, RWAs in global markets were actually up on the previous year, at €170bn, vs. €168bn at Q215. So far, the global markets business has been protected, but the impending capital shortfall resulting from today’s fine (even if that fine is cut dramatically) means Deutsche will need to get much more serious about cutting RWAs in future. And, despite Cryan’s previous protestations that Deutsche is “unreservedly committed” to its markets business, it looks like a good place to start. 6. Meanwhile, Deutsche’s unhappy staff stand to become unhappier still  Deutsche insiders say its investment bank staff are unhappy: “They’re scared, and rightfully so.” Senior managing directors at the bank have their deferred stock bonuses tied up for five years, and are angry with this year’s collapse in the bank’s share price. The bank also operates an unusually punitive clawback policy under which the entire tranche of bonuses due to vest in any particular year is wiped out if the bank makes a loss at group level. Not only are 2016 bonuses at Deutsche likely to be awful, and not only have past year’s deferred bonuses collapsed, but past year’s deferred payouts now look likely to be withheld entirely. Deutsche risks having its best salespeople and traders poached by rivals as a result. “Other banks are feeding on our people,” complains one insider. “Remaining employees are super-concerned, again further impacting performance.” Berenberg analyst James Chappell raised eyebrows in May when he said Deutsche was stuck in a “vicious circle” of falling revenues, impaired profitability and limited options for raising more capital. That circle suddenly looks more vicious than ever. 7. Will Deutsche become RBS? In the worst of worse case scenarios, the German government could come to the rescue. This is what the ever-pessimistic Mueller is expecting. “The German banking sector will be the number one story in Europe over the next few years,” he predicts. “The big German banks are not in a position to raise more capital and they need to. At the end of the day, both Deutsche and Commerzbank will be moved under an umbrella run by the German government. Fundamentally, this is their only chance of survival.” Of course, the fine might always be reduced…. The other alternative is for the DOJ to cut the proposed $14bn fine to something more manageable. The fine itself is widely seen as a tit-for-tat response by the U.S. government to the equally large fine slapped on Apple by the European Union at the end of August. If the EU cuts Apple’s fine, maybe the DOJ will cut Deutsche’s too? BreakingViews suggests Deutsche is in a strong bargaining position: perversely, the German bank’s capital weakness and systemic importance should make governments think twice before destabilising it further. The problem is that the DOJ will need to cut the fine by a lot. J.P. Morgan’s analysts think a $2.4bn settlement would be manageable for Deutsche, and that the bank could accommodate a $4bn fine, max. Anything more is an issue. Will the DOJ really cut its proposed fine by 70%? The WSJ says there could be “court battles” on the subject. The problem for Deutsche is that court battles take time – and the bank will need to reassure investors on its capital hole as soon as possible.

Back in July, he claimed Deutsche’s conservative corporate bankers wanted to spin-off the investment bank into a separate entity. Today’s news that the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) wants to slap a $14bn (€12.5bn) fine on Deutsche for mis-selling mortgaged backed securities before the financial crisis would seem to strengthen their hand. Deutsche intends to fight the fine, but the bank’s shares fell 8% this morning after news of its enormity surfaced. They’ve since recovered slightly, but not enough to reassure the likes of Mueller or the markets. The proposed $14bn fine is a huge deal for Deutsche There are various reasons why the DOJ fine is a big deal for Deutsche Bank and the 24,000 people working in Deutsche’s corporate and investment bank, of whom 4,700 are in front office investment banking jobs. 1. Deutsche had expected the fine to be a lot lower As analysts at J.P. Morgan pointed out in a report yesterday, Deutsche had put aside $6.2bn in litigation reserves at the end of June 2016. J.P.M expected Deutsche to put aside a further $2.1bn in the second half of this year and $1.1bn next year, bringing the reserves to $9.4bn in total by the end of 2017. If the $14bn fine goes through, Deutsche’s reserves will therefore be woefully inadequate. To make matters worse, the DOJ isn’t the only authority with Deutsche in its sights. There’s a possible penalty of between $1bn and $4bn for the bank’s alleged involvement in Russian money laundering in the pipeline, and Deutsche’s second quarter results highlighted six other pending investigations, at least. 2. The fine is equivalent to 74% of Deutsche Bank’s market capitalization  Deutsche Bank’s market capitalization currently stands at €16.9bn ($19bn). The DOJ fine is therefore 74% of the bank’s current value. It’s no surprise Deutsche’s shares are plummeting. 3. The fine threatens Deutsche’s capital base This is the crux of the matter. J.P. Morgan’s analysts suggested yesterday that a settlement with the DOJ in excess of $4bn would raise questions about Deutsche’s capital position. – And Deutsche’s capital position was already questionable. By 2018, Deutsche Bank needs a core equity tier one (CET1) capital ratio of 12.25% under the European Banking Association’s Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP).  Even assuming a successful sale of Postbank, J.P. Morgan’s analysts were expecting that Deutsche would be below that, at just 11.2%. That shortfall now looks like being a lot worse. If fines exceed the $9.4bn of litigation provisions Deutsche is expected to have amassed next year, J.P.M says every $1bn extra will reduce Deutsche’s 2017 CET1 ratio by 24bps. Today’s proposed $14bn fine therefore implies a 120bps reduction in Deutsche’s CET1 ratio. This could be supplemented by a further 96 basis point reduction if the Russian fines come through at the top end of the expected range – To say nothing of additional fines for other misdemeanours. In the worst case scenario (and assuming a successful sale of Postbank), J.P. Morgan’s analysis therefore suggest Deutsche could now arrive in 2018 with a CET1 capital shortfall of 216bps due to the DOJ and Russian fines as well as the 105bps shortfall it was facing already. Put another way, Deutsche was already facing a $2.5bn capital hole. Unless the DOJ cuts today’s fine, the German bank is now facing a capital hole of $7.1bn – and more if other Russian and other fines are levied too. 4. Deutsche will struggle to raise additional capital  The implied 321bps capital shortfall and resulting CET1 ratio of just 9.04% would be an issue for any bank, but for Deutsche Bank it’s potentially disastrous. With the bank’s share price down 47% since the start of this year, another rights issue is out of the question. And with the cost of insuring Deutsche Bank’s debt already high and now rising, tapping bondholders looks impossible too. Of course, there’s always the possibility of selling the asset management division – but Cryan ruled this out earlier this week.  5. Deutsche bank will need to make additional big cuts to its risk weighted assets  The other solution is for Deutsche to cut even deeper than it already planned to. The bank had €402bn of risk weighted assets on its books as of the second quarter of 2016.  Deutsche CEO John Cryan already intended to cut the bank’s RWAs by €120bn, but there’s been little real sign of cuts in the global markets division so far. – At the end of the second quarter, RWAs in global markets were actually up on the previous year, at €170bn, vs. €168bn at Q215. So far, the global markets business has been protected, but the impending capital shortfall resulting from today’s fine (even if that fine is cut dramatically) means Deutsche will need to get much more serious about cutting RWAs in future. And, despite Cryan’s previous protestations that Deutsche is “unreservedly committed” to its markets business, it looks like a good place to start. 6. Meanwhile, Deutsche’s unhappy staff stand to become unhappier still  Deutsche insiders say its investment bank staff are unhappy: “They’re scared, and rightfully so.” Senior managing directors at the bank have their deferred stock bonuses tied up for five years, and are angry with this year’s collapse in the bank’s share price. The bank also operates an unusually punitive clawback policy under which the entire tranche of bonuses due to vest in any particular year is wiped out if the bank makes a loss at group level. Not only are 2016 bonuses at Deutsche likely to be awful, and not only have past year’s deferred bonuses collapsed, but past year’s deferred payouts now look likely to be withheld entirely. Deutsche risks having its best salespeople and traders poached by rivals as a result. “Other banks are feeding on our people,” complains one insider. “Remaining employees are super-concerned, again further impacting performance.” Berenberg analyst James Chappell raised eyebrows in May when he said Deutsche was stuck in a “vicious circle” of falling revenues, impaired profitability and limited options for raising more capital.

(NYSE: JPM)'s J.P. Morgan Asset Management unit added its second new exchange-traded fund this week with the debut of the firm's first fixed income ETF on Thursday. The JPMorgan Disciplined High Yield ETF (NYSE: JPHY) is actively managed. JPHY holds only dollar-denominated high-yield credit of U.S. and foreign issuers. More About JPHY “The fund is run by a seasoned and well-resourced high yield investment team with over $35 billion in AUM. Each of the senior managers has more than 20 years of experience navigating multiple market cycles,” said New York-based JPMorgan Asset Management in a statement. Related Link: Less Than 10% Of Actively Managed Equity Funds Managed To Beat The S&P 500 The debut of JPHY follows the launch of the JPMorgan Diversified Alternatives ETF (NYSE: JPHF), a hedge fund strategy ETF, on Wednesday. JPHF features a long/short equity strategy as well as an event-driven strategy designed to benefit from catalysts that could affect future share prices, including merger arbitrage opportunities. The new ETF also features a global macro strategy that can tap multiple asset classes, including equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities. “With interest rates at historically low levels high yield investments offer increased income potential with lower rate sensitivity and reduced correlations to U.S. Treasuries. However, the high yield universe includes segments where risk has not been rewarded with commensurate return. The Appeal Of 'Junk' “JPHY provides high yield exposure by systematically excluding securities that exhibit what may be considered unattractive risk-reward profiles. The result is a low-cost solution seeking higher risk-adjusted returns and lower credit risk relative to existing passive options,” added JPMorgan Asset Management. Junk bond ETFs have been popular with investors this year as oil prices have rebounded and the Federal Reserve has consistently held off on raising interest rates. JPHY charges 0.4 percent per year, or $40 on a $10,000 investment. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

RISING STARS Why Millennials Are Freaking Out Over a Credit Card With a $450 Annual Fee It's the perks, man. By Justin Bariso Justin Bariso is an author and the founder of INSIGHT, a consultancy that helps organizations think differently and communicate with impact. In 2015, LinkedIn named him one of their top three management writers of the year. His first book, scheduled for release late 2016, serves as a practical guide to developing emotional intelligence and making it work for you. @JustinJBariso Founder, Insight@JustinJBariso WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement It's official: The Chase Sapphire Reserve has gone viral. JPMorgan Chase, which launched the credit card just a few weeks ago, told Bloomberg it approved "tens of thousands" of applications in the first two days--despite the fact that it carries ... wait for it ... a $450 annual fee. But what's really interesting about this story is who wants these cards. According to Chase spokeswoman Lauren Francis, the majority of cards are going to Millennials. Say what? The same Millennials who are (supposedly) much less interested in credit cards than their older counterparts? Just last month, The New York Times reported that Millennials "aren't pulling out the plastic" like previous generations, under the headline "How Millennials Became Spooked by Credit Cards." Take a closer look. The Times continues: Data from the Federal Reserve indicates that the percentage of Americans under 35 who hold credit card debt has fallen to its lowest level since 1989, when the Fed began collecting data in a standardized way, according to an analysis by The New York Times. The problem is, this data doesn't talk about Millennials' possession of credit cards, but only about how much debt they carry. It's the perks, man But if the younger generation doesn't want credit cards for debt management, why do they want them? Put simply, for the perks. For example, I know Millennials who use their credit cards for every single purchase--and pay off their account balance in full every month. They do this solely to rack up points and earn free rewards. (My younger brother, for example, built an entire wardrobe from Old Navy through rewards certificates.) The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card is further proof of this. Despite the hefty fee, the card offers the following benefits. (Special shout out to The Points Guy for breaking this all down for us.) 100,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points (with a minimum of $4,000 spend on the card within the initial three months). Points can be transferred to various partners, including multiple airlines and hotels (estimated value: at least $1,500). 3 points per dollar on all travel and dining, worldwide (including money spent on Uber and Airbnb). Automatic $300 annual rebate for travel expenses. Priority Pass Select, allowing access to over 900 travel lounges around the world. $100 Global Entry credit every five years. Enhanced travel protections under the Visa Infinite program. No foreign transaction fees. Just a little understanding of the Millennial mindset gives insight into why the credit card blew up on the internet (with one thread discussing the card on Reddit attracting 10,000 comments). So many Millennials love to travel. And they love finding bargains even more. Looking back at those figures from the Fed, there's a lesson to be learned. The data may have been right, but the conclusion was wrong: Millennials don't dislike credit cards. They just dislike credit card debt. Like this column?

The hottest new plastic is metal Ken Sweet, Associated Press 4:49 p.m. CDT September 17, 2016 The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card has become the hottest credit card on the market after being available only two weeks. It’s in such demand that the manufacturer ran out of the alloy from which it’s made. (Photo: JPMorgan Chase via AP) 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE NEW YORK - The demand has been so overwhelming that the manufacturer ran out of raw material in just a few days. Enthusiasts extol its virtues all over the internet. Millennials are clamoring for it. It’s not a new video game, some fancy food craze or even Apple’s latest iPhone. It’s a credit card. Calling it plastic wouldn’t do it justice. It is a high-end, high-fee, high-reward card made of a metallic alloy that gives it a satisfying heft and an impressive thunk when you toss it onto the table to pick up the check. The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card became the hottest card on the market just two weeks after being introduced, even though it came out during the slow, end-of-summer period, it carries a hefty $450 annual fee, and JPMorgan Chase spent nothing on advertising it. “I’m telling all my friends about it,” said Maddy Novich, 33, of New York, who applied for the card, as did her husband. Like so many crazes these days, this one has been fueled by social media, word-of-mouth and the internet. Frequent travelers and those who try to game travel-loyalty programs have been writing extensively about the card on blogs and forums. “I have never seen such interest in a credit card, and I’ve been doing this for 15 years,” said Gary Leff, who runs the travel and points blog View From the Wing. Chase has approved tens of thousands of applications for the card, said spokeswoman Lauren Francis. Most of the customers are millennials, who typically shun credit cards and are not usually a target for high-fee, ultra-premium plastic. The demand has been so high that Chase ran out of the alloy, whose composition is a trade secret. Customers are being issued temporary plastic cards. “We quickly ordered more, but because they are handcrafted, they take more time to make,” said Lisa Walker, general manager of Chase’s Sapphire credit card program. Credit cards with high fees but generous rewards are aimed at well-to-do customers who spend and travel extensively. The market has long been dominated by American Express with its Platinum Card. So why is the Chase card so hot? Chase offers a 100,000-point sign-up bonus if the customer meets certain spending targets. Those points can be worth up to $1,500 in travel rewards. They can also be converted to hotel or airline points that could secure, oh, a dreamy hotel suite in the Maldives or a first-class ticket for, say, a honeymoon. The card also comes with a $300 annual credit toward travel, which effectively makes the annual fee really $150. It has a generous points-earning program, with triple points on travel and dining, and gives access to airport lounges. “It’s one of the best offers I’ve ever seen. With the amount of travel and dining we do, I saw it as a worthwhile card to get,” Novich said. The card’s metal composition is also clearly part of the appeal. Only a handful of other credit cards are metal, including the American Express Centurion Card, commonly known as the AmEx “black card,” which is typically available only to millionaires, billionaires and celebrities. Kayla Kania, a 33-year-old manager at an accounting firm from Rockville, Maryland, proudly posted a picture of her new Chase card on Instagram and said she has received compliments about it from cashiers and a co-worker. “The metal part of it, people get excited about it. It’s weird,” she said. “It’s such a conversation piece.” 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://post.cr/2d9d59a

IIIT) back in October of 2014, 12 starts ago. Last time out she was third behind Dacita in a blanket finish in the Diana Stakes (gr. IT) at Saratoga Race Course, and missed the win by just a head. "Last time they were only separated by a head, and today again they were a head apart, so they're pretty much two fillies on the same level," said jockey Julien Leparoux, who landed his first graded stakes score since injuring his wrist in a mishap at Saratoga in August. He returned to riding Sept. 8 and later on the Sept. 17 card rode champion Tepin to victory in the Ricoh Woodbine Mile (Can-IT). Dacita closed up the rail well from a tracking position near the back of the pack on turf rated "good "on a rainy day at Woodbine, after 11-1 shot Midnight Miley galloped away to set early fractions of :23.85 and ;46.42. But the even-money favorite just missed getting to the 9-2 winner, who tracked second all the way around before making her move off the turn. "She didn't mind it either way; they went fast and she ran good," Leparoux said. "She didn't mind the little softer ground." Irad Ortiz Jr., who was looking for his third straight win aboard Dacita, offered no excuses for the defeat. "I had a good trip; we just got beat. She had a good kick; she ran good. She liked the turf. But, we got beat by a good filly," he said. The final time for the race, about 1 1/8 miles, was 1:45.42. Faufiler completed the trifecta, followed by Strut the Course, Steip Amach, Midnight Miley, and Goodyearforroses.  Rainha Da Bateria was bred in Kentucky by Alexander Groves Matz out of the Dixieland Band mare Amelia, and sold for $435,000 to Borges Torrealba Holdings from the Gainesway consignment to the 2013 Keeneland September yearling sale. She is a half sister to grade I stakes-placed He's Had Enough. The Canadian victory improved her record to 3-4-2 from 16 starts. Rainha da Bateria not only pulled the $180,000 share of the $303,000 purse to extend her career earnings to $520,060, but also earned a fees-paid berth to the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf (gr. IT) at Santa Anita Park as part of the Breeders' Cup Challenge "Win and You're In" program.

 10 things you need to know today Jonathan Garber Sep. 14, 2016, 6:47 AM 3,698 facebook linkedin twitter email print A dance group performing on the cliffs in Zhangjiajie, in China's Hunan province. Reuters/China Daily China Daily Information Corp - CDIC Here is what you need to know. Something very unusual happened in the markets. The S&P 500 index has fallen by over 1% while yields on the benchmark US 10-year note have risen by 3% from its previous closing level (not nominal terms). This is something that has happened only 36 times dating back to 1962, according to analysis from sentimenTrader. UK jobless claims unexpectedly rose. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed 2,400 people claimed jobless benefits in July, above the 1,800 claims that economists had anticipated. The British pound is little changed near 1.3195 against the dollar. India's wholesale price index hit a 2-year high. Producer prices rose 3.74% year-over-year in August but missed the 4.01% print that economists had forecast. The Indian rupee is stronger by 0.1% at 66.8900 per dollar. Monsanto's board likes Bayer's offer. The deal is worth about $66 billion, or $128 a share, according to multiple reports. JPMorgan is now the biggest bank in the world by assets. Shares of Wells Fargo slid 3.3% on Tuesday to close at $46.96 a share, giving the company a market capitalization of $236.9 billion, compared with JPMorgan's $240.3 billion, Bloomberg reports. Carl Icahn wants to own half of Herbalife. The activist investor says that he is asking the Federal Trade Commission for permission to increase his Herbalife stake to 50% from 35% and that the company would be better off going private. Hank Greenberg's trial has begun. Opening arguments began Tuesday in the trial of former AIG head Hank Greenberg. According to Reuters, Greenberg faces "civil charges from the New York attorney general's office of orchestrating a $500 million transaction to inflate the insurer's reserves and a $200 million transaction to hide underwriting losses." Investors are skeptical of the world's oldest bank's plan to raise cash. Monte dei Paschi di Siena needs to raise up to 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) to remain afloat and stave off a default that could have wide-ranging implications in Europe, but investors are skeptical to back the bank's third recapitalization in three years, Reuters reports. Stock markets around the world are mixed. China's Shanghai Composite (-0.7%) and Japan's Nikkei (-0.7%) led the losses in Asia, while Britain's FTSE (+0.7%) paces the gains in Europe. S&P 500 futures are up 3.00 points at 2,125.25. US economic data is light. The Department of Energy's oil inventory data will be released at 10:30 a.m. ET. The US 10-year yield is down 1 basis point at 1.72%. Follow 10 Things Before the Opening Bell and never miss an update! Get updates in your Facebook news feed. Get updates in your inbox.

The Mumbai-based bank also chose HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, SBI Capital Markets and IDBI Capital Market Services, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The deal is expected to include an institutional share sale and a separate offering of preferential securities, people with knowledge of the matter said earlier Friday. The preferential shares could be sold to a large investor who may also take over management of the bank, according to those people. IDBI Bank's fundraising could help bolster its balance sheet and rein in bad debts that totaled 7.47 per cent of loans at the end of June, according to a presentation on its website. IDBI had a capital adequacy ratio of 11.80 per cent, compared with 13.2 per cent for the country's banking system as of March, according to the Reserve Bank of India. Representatives for IDBI Bank didn't immediately answer phone calls and e-mails seeking comment on the selection of arrangers. IDBI Bank has solicited bids for capital-raising advice, the lender said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg queries on the fundraising plan earlier Friday. "The mandate would cover an advisory on the possible avenues for mobilising part or whole of this amount," the bank said in the statement. "At this stage it is not possible to comment on the actual structuring or timing of transactions." In January, IDBI Bank was planning a smaller institutional share sale of as much as Rs 3,770 crore, though it didn't proceed with the offering at that time, people with knowledge of the matter said earlier. It had approached investors including the World Bank's International Finance Corp., according to the people. IDBI Bank shareholders in July approved raising as much as Rs 8,000 crore through fundraising methods that could include a mix of a rights issue, preferential stock offering and an institutional share placement.
