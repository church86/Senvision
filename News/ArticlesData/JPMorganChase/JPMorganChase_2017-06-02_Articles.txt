Besides economics, trade and education, “there should be a consistent political and defence dialogue about the world”, not just about the South China Sea, but also issues from North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme to the Middle East peace process, he said. “We all have a common interest in getting these things right, and you’re not going to get them right if you don’t talk about it,” Dimon said during an interview in Hong Kong with the South China Morning Post. The US and China had been conducting half-yearly meetings called the strategic economic dialogue since 2006 during the administrations of George W. Bush and former Chinese president Hu Jintao. Headed by treasury and finance ministry officials in both countries, five such dialogues were held between 2006 and 2008. During the Barack Obama administration and the years under Hu and his successor Xi Jinping, the strategic economic dialogue was expanded to give the US State Department a greater role and renamed the strategic and economic dialogue. Trump, who came to occupy the White House with no prior experience in public office and governing, has surrounded himself with military men, business leaders and Wall Street executives for advice and counsel, in addition to the family members who form his inner circle. Several of them make up the business advisory council, led by Blackstone Group’s chief executive Stephen Schwarzman and comprising Dimon, PepsiCo’s chief executive Indra Nooyi and General Motors chief executive Mary Barra. Things have not gone well with Trump’s new administration, leading to three business advisers quitting since February. Uber Technologies co-founder Travis Kalanick was first to resign after he faced blowback from Uber drivers and riders over Trump’s executive order on immigration. Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk and Walt Disney’s chief executive Bob Iger both quit their advisory roles this week after Trump announced he would pull the US from the Paris climate accord. Dimon himself does not agree with everything that Trump says or does and “absolutely disagreed” with Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris pact. “I don’t know anyone who agrees with everything that a president or prime minister says,” Dimon said. The key was to “engage each other and have more open dialogue”, he said. Head of the largest US bank since 2004, Dimon, 61, has spent his career making deals all over the world, with years in Asia and China. Some of the experience may offer alternatives to the new president and help him ditch his campaign rhetoric for the art of governance. China was not a currency manipulator although the country had engaged in trade practices that were not entirely free or fair, Dimon said, citing cybersecurity, intellectual property, tariffs and the non-fulfilment of World Trade Organisation obligations. “I think the Chinese know that, and I don’t think they deny that. But it’s not about yelling and screaming and pointing fingers, it’s about sitting down, having a constructive dialogue”, and recognising that “what might have been fair 15 years ago may not be fair today”, he said. The country was also making efforts and progress towards becoming a market economy, he said. What matters to American businesses, including the ones headed by Trump’s corporate advisers, is the WTO’s principle of reciprocal right to markets, particularly one with the size of China’s 1.3 billion people. “I don’t think many people among the US business community operating in China were particularly concerned about whether China was manipulating the yuan,” said Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis, Greater China and North Asia, at Control Risks. “They are more concerned about reciprocity.” China’s banking regulator in March loosened the licensing requirement on foreign banks, part of the process of liberalising the financial industry, a move that is lauded by the man whose bank reports US$700 million in revenue from China. “One day as China opens, I want to own 100 per cent of our activities in China, not 49 per cent, and do anything,” he said. “I honestly believe that 49 per cent ownership could be a structural issue.” An open market would help China improve the efficiency of state enterprises and nip corruption in the country, he said, adding that his bank could play an important part in helping to improve corporate disclosure and enhance corporate standards of Chinese companies. Dimon, who got an earful from investors during JPMorgan’s shareholders’ meeting three weeks ago for his advisory role in the Trump circle, said he would continue to offer his counsel. “I am a patriot, I want to help the president to do a better job,” he said. The president is the pilot of a plane, and “if you’re in an air plane, you’d better be rooting for that pilot”.

First conducted by the Federal Reserve in 2009 to increase confidence in the system, bankers say the tests have morphed into a mysterious, laborious and time-consuming process from what was once a straightforward exam of financial strength. The outcome determines how much capital banks must hold, and how they can use what is left. But getting a passing grade can be tough. JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest U.S. bank, calls on hundreds of employees to work on stress test submissions each year. Morgan Stanley, the sixth largest, submits a file of over 25,000 pages. Reducing the tests’ complexity and frequency could not only save man-hours, but help the U.S. economy by stimulating more lending, bankers and lobbyists said in recent interviews. "While we believe that stress-testing is the best way to gauge capital adequacy, we also believe that a fresh look at how stress-testing is conducted could produce significant benefits for economic growth," said Greg Baer, president of industry trade group The Clearing House Association. Bankers have been making their case in meetings with legislators, in reports sent to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is stewarding the financial overhaul by the Republican administration, and in public comments to investors and securities analysts. Easing up on stress tests could significantly boost returns. For example, Nomura Instinet analyst Steven Chubak estimates JPMorgan could increase annual profits by about $2.5 billion, or 10 percent, under a more relaxed framework. There are more than a few skeptics pushing back on the industry's pleas. Hawkish regulators and former regulators oppose the idea of lightening stress tests too much. "As proposals for regulatory change swirl about, it is crucial that the strong capital regime be maintained, especially as it applies to the most systemically important banks,” former Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo, who led regulatory matters, said in April. “Neither regulators nor legislators should agree to changes that would effectively weaken that regime." Consumer advocates, anti-Wall Street groups and influential lawmakers such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, have also fought any loosening of bank regulations, arguing the industry would embrace reckless practices again. While bond investors and ratings agencies are happy to see robust capital levels, stock investors are clamoring for banks to boost share buybacks and dividends. Wall Street analysts have been asking what banks would do with unleashed capital, and the picture is mixed. JPMorgan has said it would like to extend more credit to small businesses and home buyers if the government eases up on lending restrictions. Citigroup Inc, in contrast, has emphasized buying back stock because its shares are trading for less than the company is worth. The industry's stress-test offensive is happening as Washington re-examines financial reforms, in what will likely be a lengthy and heated debate. The Treasury Department is expected to release its first in a series of reports on overhauling regulations early next week, while House Republicans are scheduled to vote on their own financial regulatory reform bill. Despite assurances by Trump that rules will be rewritten, there appears to be insufficient support in Congress. At least eight Senate Democrats would be needed to pass any broad law rewrite, which is unlikely. However, the Fed has broad discretion to make changes to the stress tests. POOR EXECUTION When it comes to the stress tests, bankers argue that the goal is noble, but the execution is poor. For instance, the Fed scores loan portfolios for losses under hypothetical economic catastrophes but does not explain its methodology, which changes year-to-year. Even if banks pass numerically, they can fail for "qualitative" problems like risk management. And, in their own calculations, lenders cannot consider steps they would take to conserve capital, something bankers describe as irrational. "The world will end three times over, but you need to factor in the fact that you probably paid dividends in that time, and you wouldn't shrink your balance sheet, and you would continue to pursue mergers and acquisitions," one executive said. Bankers say they sweat through every year's process, worried they will miss unseen hurdles. The uncertainty causes them to lend less than they otherwise would, they argue. The Fed has resisted any wholesale reimagining of stress tests, and major revisions are unlikely until new Fed governors are confirmed. Three board seats including the supervisory post are open. But there are signs the Fed could become more accommodative. For instance, banks will receive "more guidance" on qualitative matters when stress test results are announced on June 22, Fed Governor Jerome Powell said on Thursday. Bankers are hoping bigger changes will happen before the Fed issues instructions for the 2018 stress tests early next year.

JPMorgan upgraded shares of Deere after the agricultural equipment manufacturer's announcement that it would buy Wirtgen Group. By Ben Levisohn June 2, 2017 12:54 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large In December, I recommended buying shares of Deere (DE) after the farm equipment manufacturer traded a new all-time high. It's hit another one today after JPMorgan upgraded it to Neutral from Underperform today. Illustration: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Deere's shares are up 24% since my call--50% during the past 12 months--so what are JPMorgan's Ann Duignan and Thomas Simonitsch seeing that made them upgrade it now? How about yesterday's announced acquisition of Wirtgen Group? They explain: Yesterday DE announced the planned acquisition of Wirtgen Group, the private, German-based road construction equipment company; the stock was up 1.8% vs. S&P 500 up 0.8%. Management has agreed to pay a total consideration of €4.6B (or ~$5.2B) in an all cash transaction, representing 9.5x EV/EBITDA on Wirtgen’s 2017 estimates or 7.9x EV/EBITDA including DE’s 2022 synergy assumptions. Overall, we appreciate the strategic fit of the acquisition to the extent that Wirtgen should improve the reach and breadth of DE’s C&F product offering, opening up new markets for growth; at the same time, the pro forma exposure reduces DE’s dependence on A&T, mitigating some of the key risks underlining our prior UW rating (our view on the next cycle in US agriculture especially). At first glance, synergies of €100MM by year five appear very conservative despite limited overlap between the businesses; we estimate savings in strategic sourcing alone may be worth €180MM. We like the strategic rationale behind the deal and Wirtgen appears to be a good company based on its product quality and reputation as well as the financial history available to us; whether it is a good investment for DE is harder to gauge at this point, though we would expect the market to view the deal favorably. As such, we can no longer justify an UW rating on DE, despite the continued risks to its core businesses; we are upgrading to Neutral and raising our Dec-17 price target to $122 (from $103) Shares of Deere have risen 0.6% to $125.47 at 12:51 p.m. today, while the Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLI) has gained 0.9% to $68.52.

(Photo: Getty via iStock/Thinkstock) 600 CONNECTTWEET 11 LINKEDIN 139 COMMENTEMAILMORE After every major financial crisis over the past century, policymakers in the executive and legislative branches of the United States government have passed sweeping legislation to overhaul the way banks do business. The Panic of 1907 prompted the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which created our central bank. The Great Depression led to the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and prohibited the cohabitation of investment and commercial banks. And the litany of crises throughout the 1970s and 1980s convinced Congress to broadly deregulate the bank industry through a series of wide-ranging legislative acts. USA TODAY Trump to dismantle Dodd-Frank Wall Street rules through executive orders It's only through this lens of historical context that one can truly appreciate the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which came on the heels of the financial crisis that erupted two years earlier. Fighting the last war Generals are often accused of "fighting the last war," in that they set their strategies going forward based on their most recent combat experience. This can be a mistake, of course, because times change. Strategies evolve. Adversaries adjust. Weapons systems advance. The same can be said of the intent behind the Dodd-Frank Act, which was conceived with the best of intentions. Fissures in global financial markets were first exposed in August 2007 when a leading bank in Europe, France's BNP Paribas, stopped allowing investors to withdraw capital from two funds that held mortgage-backed securities. The situation escalated seven months later when Bear Stearns experienced a liquidity crisis. The investment bank's institutional clients stopped providing the funds the bank needed to stay afloat. Things got so dire that the federal government offered JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) a $30 billion loan to facilitate its acquisition and thus rescue. But it wasn't until September 2008 that the crisis climaxed with the failure of Lehman Brothers, the nation's fourth-biggest investment bank at the time. The stock market plummeted. Credit markets froze. And countless companies, both within the financial sector and outside of it, found themselves on the brink of failure. The fear pulsing through the credit markets was particularly alarming because it made it impossible for even the most creditworthy of companies such as General Electric to access the funds needed to cover its payroll and other ordinary operating costs. The government's initial response was swift. It arranged Bank of America's (NYSE: BAC) purchase of Merrill Lynch. It nationalized all but a small sliver of American International Group, the massive insurance company that had insured vast swaths of investment securities backed by subprime mortgages. And it injected tens of billions of dollars' worth of capital into the nation's leading banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup (NYSE: C), and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC). These were stopgap measures, however, more akin to CPR than to a long-term solution to cardiac problems. The latter came in the form of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed two years later in a heavily partisan vote spearheaded by Democrats and opposed by Republicans. "The White House will call this a victory," said then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. "But as credit tightens, regulations multiply, and job creation slows even further as a result of this bill, they'll have a hard time convincing the American people that this is a victory for them." CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Donald Trump will sign an executive order that will rollback some of the financial sector regulations put in place following the global crisis in 2008. Newslook The too big to fail problem The Dodd-Frank Act was designed to ensure that a financial crisis like that in 2008 won't happen again. As such, it sought to attack the principal problem that policymakers believed had caused the crisis in the first place – the growth and proliferation of too-big-to-fail banks. The notion of banks being too big to fail has a rich history. Almost all of the greatest financial crises in American history were aggravated by the failure of large financial institutions, which further sapped confidence in the financial sector and, prior to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's founding, led to the destruction of countless peoples' liquid wealth. This is why the eponymous founder of JPMorgan Chase worked tirelessly during the Panic of 1907 to stop the bank runs occurring up and down Wall Street at the time. His actions were vindicated 25 years later when an otherwise ordinary recession transformed into the Great Depression due to a tsunami of bank failures. USA TODAY 5 signs you can trust your financial adviser But it wasn't until 1984 that the term "too big to fail" became part of our broader lexicon with the failure of Continental Illinois, one the country's largest banks at the time. In an almost identical series of events to the ones that brought down Bear Stearns more than 30 years later, Continental Illinois saw its funding sources evaporate after rumored problems at the bank led institutional investors to empty their accounts. Explaining the Dodd-Frank Act In an effort to prevent crises like these in the future, the policymakers behind the Dodd-Frank Act underwrote a series of critical reforms. The act increases the amount that capital banks must hold in reserve, giving the banks an added cushion to absorb loan losses in future downturns. It similarly requires banks to keep a larger portion of their assets invested in things that can be easily liquidated in the event of a bank run – namely, cash and government securities as opposed to term loans. The act also subjects the nation's biggest banks to a series of heightened regulatory requirements not faced by regional and community banks. Under Dodd-Frank, every bank with more than $50 billion worth of assets on its balance sheet must submit to annual stress tests administered by the Federal Reserve, which then determines if they would survive a hypothetically severe crisis akin to the one in 2008. As a part of the stress tests, these banks must also seek regulatory approval to increase their dividends or authorize new share repurchase programs. Even among the biggest banks, moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act makes distinctions. The biggest among them are classified as global systemically important banks, or G-SIBs, which must hold an additional tranche of capital, known as the G-SIB surcharge. This is particularly burdensome for JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup which have to keep as much as 3% their shareholders' equity laying fallow in cash or low-yielding but highly liquid securities. These banks must also submit resolution plans to regulators each year, detailing how they could be resolved without causing harm to the financial markets in the event they go bankrupt. The Dodd-Frank Act has reintroduced central tenets of the Glass-Steagall Act as well, which had been gradually eroded over the years after originally forbidding commercial banks from running trading operations. The iteration of the rule in Dodd-Frank, known as the Volcker Rule, outlaws proprietary trading at universal banks and thereby limits their trading operations to serving as market makers for institutional clients. And last but certainly not least among the major changes introduced by the Dodd-Frank Act was the founding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is vested with the authority to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive financial products and services. At the end of the day, in turn, while one can argue about the prescience and necessity of the Dodd-Frank Act, there's simply no doubt that it has fundamentally transformed the banking and financial services industry. The main question now is whether or not this transformation will be permanent, or, as has been promised by policymakers of late, just a temporary blip in the history of banking that could soon go away.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe By Allison Arieff Detroit has a way with comebacks. In 1933, the city began emerging from the Great Depression with a little help from public-private-partnerships. Spurred by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the federal agency mandated with stabilizing U.S. banks, the National Bank of Detroit (NBD) was formed. On its opening day on March 24, 1933, customers swarmed the new NBD to open 562 accounts, bringing in bundles of currency and coins ranging from a few hundred dollars to hundreds of thousands. America’s “Motor City” was on the mend. JPMorgan Chase Detroit’s recovery demonstrates how targeted efforts fueled by data and collaboration can work to solve a city’s problems. Today, Detroit’s recent revitalization bears some resemblance to the past. Despite shifts in the city’s biggest industry, residents of the Motor City spend money with local businesses at a rate greater than other U.S. cities, powering the local economy. It’s clear that any solution to Detroit’s challenges has to start at the community level. This is also why public-private-partnerships continue to play a crucial role. In 2013, the Mayor’s office and a range of local groups including JPMorgan Chase – which has been in Detroit for more than 80 years and acquired the NBD during that time – helped fuel a recovery focused on stabilizing neighborhoods, re-training the workforce for today’s job market and bolstering local small businesses, all while attracting new investors. JPMorgan Chase was an early leader in this strategy, committing $100 million in 2014 with plans to expand that to $150 million by 2019. And the work underway in the city has helped JPMorgan Chase develop and refine its approach to creating economic opportunity – resulting in a model that can be applied elsewhere. For a city that was losing population just four years ago, the latest indicators are encouraging: Unemployment has nearly halved and 8,000 more Detroiters are working now than at this time last year. The downtown area, once blighted and abandoned, is flourishing with restaurants and businesses. Some 2,000 vacant homes are being rehabbed and reoccupied. But Detroit’s recovery is not just the feel-good story of America’s rustbelt – it’s a lesson in urban revival. The city’s revitalization is about more than access to capital. It’s about collaboration and public-private-partnership. A thriving city means thriving companies and an evolving, growing workforce that calls that place home. Data-Driven Workforce Development While governments, planners and economists have long sought to help cities grow smart, there are few precedents for managing the ones that have shrunk. This is partly because of the evolving demands of the labor market. Here, Detroit’s use of data is an example for other cities. Detroit partnered with the Corporation for Skilled Workforce and JPMorgan Chase to research employment barriers. Their research produced two reports in early 2016 evaluating the city’s untapped labor potential and solutions for increasing the employment rate. The data stemming from the reports helped inform a reconstituted Mayor’s Detroit Workforce Development Board, a team of workforce professionals in Detroit that pinpoint high demand industries so training programs can tailor their offerings to meet the market demands. The board’s efforts are also supported by the Workforce Intelligence Network in Detroit, which keeps track of open jobs by location and industry, to provide the city and trainers with actionable market data. To date, 15,000 Detroiters have received career and technical training. One example is The Greening of Detroit, a nonprofit devoted to restoring the city's tree infrastructure while providing training for skilled jobs in forestry, urban agriculture and landscaping. By aligning its programs with available jobs and workforce data, the organization boasts an 83 percent job placement rate. “We are helping to make these folks work-ready so they can get into the workforce and earn a decent living wage,” says Devon Buskin, workforce development director, the Greening of Detroit. Of course, a model for recovery not only addresses the workforce, it must be inclusive of the businesses that sustain it. Open For Business In Detroit, 43 percent of consumer purchases came from residents shopping in the same neighborhood where they live, according to 2016 research by the JPMorgan Chase Institute. Although this measure is higher than any other U.S. city, not all of Detroit’s small businesses were thriving. In 2014, when JPMorgan Chase made its initial $100 million investment in Detroit, they focused on growing incubators, such as TechTown and Eastern Market, to provide local ventures with the resources and skills training needed to succeed. The incubators spurred growth, but research soon showed that a portion of Detroit’s most important small businesses were being left behind. Many of the minority-owned small businesses weren’t expanding or even surviving because they couldn’t get access to funding. Minority-owned construction companies, for example, couldn’t bid on higher-end development projects because they didn’t have the funds to get more employees or equipment. This deeper understanding of the city’s needs led JPMorgan Chase to reposition its public-private partnerships with small businesses, a core part of their philosophy of testing and refining ideas over time. Out of these circumstances emerged the Entrepreneurs of Color (EOC) program, a fund designed expressly to help minority-owned small businesses. It has awarded over 40 small businesses with $3.3 million in critical capital since it began making loans just over a year ago. Today, Detroit’s minority-owned small businesses are expanding, not just surviving. Half of EOC loans have been to women minority-owned companies, like Marlene Brooks who was able to open a new hair salon, Dymond Designs, in downtown Detroit and Benkari, a plumbing company owned by the first African American female master plumber in Michigan. “There are a lot of factors at play in Detroit,” says Detroit Development Fund president Ray Watters, “A lot that needs to be helped. It’s not just the lending that we do. JPMorgan Chase has gotten involved in the mortgage program to help more residents own homes. They’ve moved into education to help with education of young residents. This broad approach has ripple effects.” Stabilizing Detroit’s Neighborhoods One sign of strong communities is population growth and neighborhood development. And while the populations of big cities like New York, London and San Francisco have been growing, Detroit’s was rapidly dwindling, due in part to failing neighborhood infrastructure. Like many cities, Detroit was overrun with unoccupied properties – approximately 91,000 vacant lots and 78,000 abandoned properties. That’s why JPMorgan Chase directed $50 million of its investment to building and supporting two new community development funds with Invest Detroit, a local community development organization, and Capital Impact Partners, a national organization focused on revitalizing neighborhoods. The funds finance community development projects in and adjacent to Detroit’s urban core with the goal of creating livable and workable spaces that attract and retain residents. These two development funds used the company’s initial investment to leverage $147 million in outside investment, supporting over $270 million worth of development projects completed or underway in Detroit. The investment in these two funds created or preserved 800 units of housing, 800 jobs, and over 175,000 square feet of commercial space. One such project included converting an abandoned midtown warehouse of the iconic Detroit motor company, Willys Overland, into new residential and retail space. The now thriving community development proudly display’s the original motor company’s logo and boasts modern residential lofts and storefronts for local small businesses like Shinola Detroit, the Jolly Pumpkin and RUNDetroit. JPMorgan Chase Detroit residents sit outside of Jolly Pumpkin, a local craft brewery, enjoying the spring weather and Jolly’s locally-renowned brews. The Jolly Pumpkin sits in the new Willys Overland development, which was previously an abandoned warehouse of an old Detroit motor company. It is now the site of modern residential lofts and small business storefronts. The downtown and Woodward Ave corridors are also seeing development with the rehabilitation of the 1212 Griswold building in Capital Park and the creation of The Shoppes at Woodward Park, which will become an epicenter of small business retail along the new Detroit light rail. To further stabilize Detroit’s neighborhoods, JPMorgan Chase invested $5 million toward a new $30 million Strategic Neighborhoods Fund that will dedicate critical resources towards commercial and residential real estate, jobs and community infrastructure in several Detroit neighborhoods over the next decade. The company also partnered with the Detroit Land Bank Authority to expand the program’s reach and help Detroit fight neighborhood blight. The Land Bank in turn partnered with a local Detroit entrepreneur, Jerry Paffendorf, and his start-up, Loveland Technologies. After 180 Detroiters took to the streets surveying over 376,000 parcels of land, the group launched the Motor City Mapping Project (MCM), an online map showing all of Detroit’s property information. The information has since helped the city and community groups devise plans to remove blighted properties and rehabilitate abandoned ones. The quality of life in Detroit’s communities improves with each such development. At this pace, Detroit’s population will continue to stabilize – and flourish. Connecting Detroit: The M-1 Rail Blighted neighborhoods were not Detroit’s only signature challenge. The city’s automobile legacy bears the consequence of a historically underfunded and under-prioritized public transportation system. Until recently. In 2014, JPMorgan Chase provided $1.5 million in direct funds and facilitated raising $13.5 million in New Markets Tax Credits to help the city finance its new light rail, a 3.3-mile project to connect Detroit’s downtown to the cultural district. The light rail is expected to serve 5,400 riders a day, according to Michigan’s Department of Transportation, and has brought in new investors to develop housing and commercial opportunities along the light rail’s path. In addition to partnering on public infrastructure, the company has sent over 100 employees to Detroit to advise on economic growth opportunities and help the city expand its global footprint through trade. The Detroit Service Corps, as it’s called, is a three-week program that matches employees from a variety of cities worldwide with local nonprofit projects. In addition to helping build capacity for nonprofits in Detroit, the program helps globalize lessons learned in different cities. JPMorgan Chase Detroit’s recovery demonstrates how targeted efforts fueled by data and collaboration can work to solve a city’s problems. Cities can’t have small businesses if they don’t have a workforce to support them. And a workforce can’t thrive without stable communities and the means to get to and from them. While every city is unique in its own way and requires tailored solutions, Detroit’s comeback is a model for other cities to follow.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe In recent years, the city of Detroit, Michigan has earned the nickname “America’s Comeback City”—and rightfully so. Detroit’s unemployment rate dropped to 5.3 percent in 2016, down from a high of 19 percent. The poverty rate is now 13.4 percent, a full point below the national average. This transformation is proving that America’s industry cities can move forward and thrive as the economy evolves. JPMorgan Chase In Detroit’s Midtown neighborhood, a wave of development is bringing new life to the community and spurring the city's rebirth. Through private sector investments, including an expected $150 million commitment from JPMorgan Chase by 2019, and collaboration with the public sector, the city is rebuilding from the ground up, and revitalization is coming faster than anyone could have imagined when the city filed for bankruptcy in 2013. The city is creating more reasons for locals to stay while also attracting new residents, a combination that is stabilizing and growing the local economy. The Midtown neighborhood has bounced back particularly quickly: adding nearly 150 new businesses and 1,500 new residents since 2013. More than 50,000 people now work in the area—and through new developments projects, many are starting to live there, too. As recently as 2014, 30 percent of Detroit’s residential buildings stood vacant or only partially occupied. A 1920s-era, 56-unit building on Alexandrine Street was one of them—about 40 percent occupied, partly by squatters who didn’t pay rent. The rest of the units were uninhabitable, with crumbling walls and long-outdated plumbing and wiring. “It was almost a detriment to the community,” says Jacob Horner, a vice president at PK Development, the firm that undertook the renovation. “The fourth floor had such extensive water damage, it was uninhabitable.” PK completed a gut renovation of Rainer Court in just 18 months, a pace made possible by a $6 million investment from JPMorgan Chase. Now, the 19th century masonry is once again an ode to the neighborhood’s storied past. A repaired skylight sends light streaming into the lobby, and its 36 new apartments feature much more than a fresh coat of paint. “They are blown away,” property manager La’Nore Rice says of her tenants, most of whom previously lived within a five-mile radius and yet had never seen a transformation like the one at Rainer Court. Just three months after reopening in September 2015, the building was already close to full occupancy. Now, the entire neighborhood is at 98-percent occupancy. It’s a welcome change from 2014, and Rice is looking forward to seeing what new growth Rainer Court’s renovation and other investments bring to her long-neglected block. “It’s getting better,” she says,“ and it’s going to continue to get better—but I’d like to see it stay that way.” When Norman Silk and Dale Morgan opened their flower shop Blossoms in the late 1970s along a stretch of Third Avenue not far from Rainer Court, the area was part of the red light district. Nonetheless, Blossoms built up a loyal following, from neighborhood regulars to the board and patrons of the nearby symphony hall. Over time, though, Midtown’s rising crime and the city’s economic distress made it hard to keep employees—and harder still to find willing new ones. “When they heard it was in Midtown, they’d say, ‘Oh no, I’m not working there,’” Norm recalls. Eventually Blossoms left Third Avenue for a suburb, a move many businesses were taking by the early 1990s. Norm kept close tabs on Detroit as the city’s revival took hold, and especially when the buzz started to focus on Midtown. “That’s when we started thinking about coming back,” he says. This year, he turned that thought into action. Blossoms reopened on Third Avenue in August 2016, shortly after the renovated Rainer Court started leasing new units and the neighborhood started drawing in new coffee shops, groceries, and retail stores—all within walking distance, in a neighborhood where walking wasn’t even safe just a few years before. The biggest change, though, is who comes through the door. Lots of Blossoms’ clientele are regulars and long-time Detroiters, some from local families spanning three generations, but new customers come in every day, recently including a few residents of Rainer Court who came in looking for wedding bouquets. Blossoms’ new-old neighborhood is a community now, he says, and he thinks that sense of home will anchor the neighborhood into the indefinite future. “You walk up and down this block, and these places are owned by real people,” he says. “This neighborhood is authentic, and it’s real.” Much like Rainer Court, the 19th-century Victorian building on the opposite corner of Third Avenue and Alexandrine was also unoccupied and showing its age by 2014. But with so many new businesses opening and development plans cropping up, neighborhood veteran Jason Peet saw an opportunity. All of these new residents would likely have family and friends coming to visit, and these new businesses would attract new customers. Surely, they’d need somewhere to stay—why not provide that right within the neighborhood? In 2016, after extensive renovation, the once-crumbling Victorian reopened as the El Moore. It serves now as half hotel, half residential apartments. In the morning, as hotel guests and residents share breakfast in the parlor, those conversations turn into recommendations—and sometimes even invitations to explore Detroit together. That’s exactly the effect Jason hoped the renovation would have. “It’s so important that each project not only take care of that building,” he says, “but also start to stitch communities back together.” Before Rainer Court and the El Moore were renovated, he recalls, “there was no one out on the street. Now people will pass each other, stop, have a conversation. Having those gatekeeper buildings makes that happen.” Mid-sentence, Jason had to excuse himself to answer his phone. The caller turned out to be a resident of Rainer Court, looking to book a hotel stay for her father, who would soon be visiting from Spain. “Those visitors will go home and talk to other people about their experience in Detroit,” he said later. “Being able to share that with people starts to break down a lot of barriers.” Changing the perception of Detroit starts here, on this block, he says, with the “passion and hope” he saw in the new neighborhood’s residents when he first arrived. “It’s always been here,” he says, “it’s just getting people comfortable enough to experience it.” Paula Guthat and her husband, Tim, moved Cinema Detroit from elsewhere in Midtown after noticing new blips of activity west of the Cass Corridor, including Rainer Court’s renovation. The theater is the only one in Midtown open seven days a week, and, not coincidentally, the Guthats chose a location just down the block from Rainer Court. “Just by virtue of more people living here, we have a greater customer base to draw from,” Paula explains, and as a new expression of community spirit, the theater inspires customer loyalty. Some regulars, including a couple at Rainer Court, stop in after work just to buy popcorn and chat. “Someone said to me, ‘I feel like you’re inviting us into your house,’” she recalls. "That’s why we’re here, for this neighborhood.” Building by building and block by block, Detroiters are “starting to see ourselves in a different, better way,” she says. “I think that’s the first step.” Having lived there for only a week, Rachel Darling is Rainer Court’s newest face, but she’s no stranger to Detroit. She’s been coming to the city for years, drawn by her love of techno music, Detroit’s latest musical specialty. She’s been attending the Movement music festival here since 2012, and each visit let her mark the city’s changes. “Restaurants started getting better, the hotels started to be built up,” she says, and she was drawn most of all by “how nice people are here.” Add the new M-1 train and a forthcoming bike share, and it’s easy to see why Rachel followed Detroit’s siren call all the way from Chicago. About a quarter of people who signed new leases in Midtown in 2016 were transplants from other cities, states, or countries, some of them seeking the new jobs in this flourishing neighborhood. Rachel landed a job as a tax advisor, a job that would have been exceedingly rare in this neighborhood before 2014. Rainer Court sold itself. She showed up without an appointment, fell in love, and signed for her unit on the spot. Her new job started five days later. After a week, she’s already figured out how to contribute to her new city, volunteering in the public schools and helping to bring techno, the passion that first brought her here, to the music venues of Midtown. “I’m itching to give back to the community,” she says, adding that the scope of projects happening across Detroit “makes you want to be immersed in the city that much more.” The Next Frontier Detroit’s boom doesn’t seem to be slowing anytime soon: In 2016 alone, the city opened 110 development sites in greater downtown. With each new development, says Paula, the excitement was coupled with a “tinge of worry” among regulars that they could soon be pushed out. Even Rachel couldn’t believe her luck with Rainer Court; she’s outpriced on most of Alexandrine Street. Property in Detroit now sells for 30 percent more than it did in the wake of the recession. Sue Mosey of Midtown Detroit Inc. helps manage the neighborhood’s balance of old and new residents through two initiatives: “Live Midtown” offers subsidies to employees of Midtown businesses who want to move to the area, and “Stay Midtown” does the same for residents who are spending a third of their income or more on housing. As of mid-April, Stay Midtown’s pilot program had raised enough money from institutions and non-profits to subsidize 50 households, half its ultimate goal. Extending and stabilizing new neighborhoods while sustaining community spirit is how projects such as Rainer Court have made a difference to Detroit’s overall rebound, says Jacob Horner of PK Development. With enough resources and commitment, developments throughout the neighborhood will keep raising the bar, making for a community with a sense of family and a city that feels like home. As part of an expected $150 million philanthropic investment in the city of Detroit by 2019, JPMorgan Chase supports Rainer Court and similar projects that contribute to the city’s revitalization. Emphasizing neighborhood stabilization as part of that recovery, the company’s targeted lending helps launch development and infrastructure projects, grow new and existing small businesses, and support community nonprofits and organizations. JPMorgan Chase’s continued commitment to Detroit has helped the company refine and reimagine its commitment to the city – leading to the creation of a new corporate responsibility model designed to create impact by focusing on some of the crucial drivers of inclusive growth: workforce training, small business development, financial health, and neighborhood revitalization.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe By JPMorgan Chase A car stops at an empty house on a Detroit street. Three passengers get out and approach the house, snapping pictures of different details that need renovation. They return to the car and then repeat the process at the next house. The passengers aren’t snooping neighbors. They’re Detroit residents who are knee deep in a data gathering initiative called The Motor City Mapping Project, led by Loveland Technologies. JPMorgan Chase Businesses across the country are recognizing data-driven initiatives as prime opportunities to contribute to effective, localized, and measurable change. Loveland Technologies is a software company solving urban development problems using interactive mapping and crowdsourcing. With these technologies Loveland is focusing on solving the issue of blight in a new way. “Applying a startup mentality to solving Detroit’s challenges means taking the best of the rapid-fire ‘innovate-test-iterate’ cycle and bridging it with a vision for creating long-term change,” says Jerry Paffendorf, the company’s CEO and co-founder. This vision would be difficult to execute, though, without support from a new kind of corporate philanthropy partnership. “JPMorgan Chase provides that kind of bridge: patient capital for innovative solutions to deep problems.” The concept of private companies donating data and analytical skills emerged on the global scene at the 2011 World Economic Forum in Davos, where attendees concluded that corporations with troves of data should know more about the benefits of sharing that data for public good. Since then, the United Nations Global Pulse initiative has promoted the model as a way to both spark innovation and address public interest issues across the globe. Insights from corporate-funded studies or the donation of proprietary data can be used to address challenges from disease outbreaks to economic stressors to fallout from natural disasters. The UN, for example, has accumulated data studies on macroeconomic issues in Cambodia, Ugandan community radio, and social attitudes toward biofuels. As evidenced by Motor City Mapping, data can make a profound difference at the hyper-local level too, particularly in finding solutions to issues like urban blight and unemployment. In Detroit, JPMorgan Chase donated data and analytics resources that are contributing to economic rebuilding efforts, closing the skills gap, and informing urban planning. It’s part of a broader effort by JPMorgan Chase to take a data-driven approach and use the firm’s talent and resources to make a lasting impact on the communities it works with. As a funder and partner to Motor City Mapping, JPMorgan Chase is helping ensure that the work of the photo-snapping volunteers—who have surveyed 380,000 parcels to date—has the maximum effect. The information has now been digitized, thanks to support from the company and Data Driven Detroit. The result is a fascinating interactive map of the city that shows the number of structures versus vacant lots, the condition of those structures (whether they’ve been affected by fire or illegal dumping), and their occupancy status. The map is visible on a house-by-house level—users can search an address and see a photo of what it looks like—and individual residents can contribute their own photos to keep the map updated. Data from the project provided the backbone for a report produced by the Detroit Blight Removal Task Force, an organization that has a goal of removing every blighted vacant structure in the city. As the world recognizes the full power of data, it’s emerged as a key aspect of a new corporate responsibility model that combines various capabilities to do the most good. Instead of handing over a check and calling it a day, corporate responsibility has evolved to be more strategic and multi-faceted in its approach. JPMorgan Chase is at the forefront of this new holistic approach, pioneering a model that offers a mix of money, employee expertise, and data with the belief that the same things that contribute to business success should also shape the way companies think about solving problems in civil society. A recent two-part report (pdf) published by the company in partnership with the Corporation for a Skilled Workforce presents data from the US Census and job postings to identify specific opportunities in Detroit’s job market. Part of what it revealed was that Detroit’s employment issue isn’t a lack of jobs; it’s that the skills of the unemployed don’t align with open positions. This skills gap is of particular concern for middle-skill jobs—or jobs that require a high school diploma and technical training. Among Detroit residents, 22% lack a high school diploma or GED. Whereas in the past a strategy for getting those diplomas in-hand might have been dictated by history or hunches, today’s data-based approach helps organizations optimize their resources and efforts. The aforementioned report has already informed several initiatives to address the skills gap in the city: its identification of the most desirable skills helped the mayor’s Detroit Workforce Development Board train more than 3,800 Detroit residents with in-demand skills and ultimately contributed to adding 8,000 more Detroiters to the workforce in 2016. It also prompted the creation of the Detroit Workforce System Leadership Academy, a year-long program that joins 22 of the city’s most prominent established businesspeople to solve universal employment issues. Mayor Mike Duggan praised the report as “giving us an invaluable tool in supporting our new Workforce Development Board as it tackles the challenges ahead.” And the value of the data provided by the Motor City Mappers has already proven persuasive enough to inspire spin-offs in Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus. The data-driven approach is spreading to the places that need it most, and, increasingly, businesses are recognizing that their philanthropic efforts can offer more than money alone. Businesses across the country are recognizing data-driven initiatives as prime opportunities to contribute to effective, localized, and measurable change. House by house, person by person, data can help transform a city.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox Business Home Markets Politics Features Media & Advertising Cloud Innovation Business Leaders Technology FBN TV SHOWS ANCHORS & REPORTERS SCHEDULE VIDEO Search AmEx to Issue Hilton Cards Alone -- WSJ ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More AmEx to Issue Hilton Cards Alone -- WSJ By AnnaMaria Andriotis Published June 02, 2017 Features Dow Jones Newswires Facebook Twitter Print Company will become the single issuer for the hotelier, muscling out Citigroup Continue Reading Below American Express Co. has won the rights to become the exclusive issuer of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. credit cards, according to executives from both companies, a much-needed victory for the card issuer. The deal ends a long-held arrangement in which AmEx and Citigroup Inc. had each issued the hotel's credit cards. Hilton more than a year ago had opened a bidding process for exclusive rights to its cards and decided to move to a single issuer. AmEx will become sole issuer of the Hilton Honors cards in the U.S. beginning in January 2018, according to both companies. This is a boost for AmEx, which has lost several card partnerships since 2015, including Costco Wholesale Corp., JetBlue Airways Corp., and Fidelity Investments. Costco and JetBlue accounted for 23% of AmEx's U.S. balances at the end of 2015. While Hilton is a loss for Citigroup, it was the issuer that wrested Costco away from AmEx, a far bigger arrangement. The loss of partnerships like Costco dented investor confidence in AmEx's ability to grow and pushed the issuer to increase lending to help boost revenues. The setbacks also occurred as AmEx has come under increasing pressure in the high-end rewards card space, notably from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and its Sapphire Reserve rewards card. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT The last time AmEx won a new credit-card partnership in the U.S. was in 2015, when it announced an exclusive agreement with Charles Schwab Corp. Yet co-branded cards remain important for AmEx. Such cards accounted for 34% of the company's world-wide loan balances and 15% of its billings during the last half of last year. Its largest co-brand portfolios are with Delta, which accounts for 20% of world-wide loan balances, and Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., which accounts for 5% of balances, according to AmEx data. All of its other co-brands comprise 9% of balances. "Co-brands are very important for AmEx...and this particular arrangement is meaningful for us," said Denise Pickett, president of U.S. consumer services at AmEx. Meanwhile, Jud Linville, chief executive at Citi Cards, played down the loss, saying in a statement that "during negotiations, it became clear that terms of exclusivity given the relatively small size of the portfolio were not economically viable." While Hilton is now in AmEx's win column, investors are also awaiting news about the fate of its Starwood relationship. Marriott International Inc. completed its acquisition of Starwood last year and the hotel is reviewing several scenarios, including whether to merge the Marriott and Starwood credit-card programs, or to leave them separate. Marriott's credit cards are issued by J.P. Morgan Chase. A decision will likely be made about the Marriott and Starwood cards by the end of the year, according to a person familiar with the matter. In terms of the Hilton deal, it isn't immediately clear for AmEx investors how much of a financial boost the victory will bring. It wasn't known how much AmEx paid for the deal. Nor has the future of Citi's Hilton card balances been decided, said Mark Weinstein, global head of customer engagement, loyalty and partnerships at Hilton. Also unknown is whether Citi Hilton card users will be able to continue using the cards after 2017. Those discussions are still under way, said Mr. Weinstein, adding that card users' relationship with Hilton Honors will continue. "This is a preview of what's coming in 2018," he said. Competition for travel credit-card partnerships has intensified in recent years. Banks want airfare and hotel cards because most consumers who sign up for them have high credit scores and are high spenders. For some issuers, this is also an opportunity to sell other services to affluent consumers. "The competition...is at the highest pitch I've ever seen it," said Michael Abbott, digital lead at Accenture Financial Services. "It's a war for distribution for the issuers." And card issuers often have to give up a lot to get a deal. Hotels in recent years, for example, have been demanding that issuers pay them a higher amount for each point that consumers rack up on their cards. And the prices for these arrangements have been rising since the recession, Mr. Abbott said. Another potential downside: Hotels typically want assurances from issuers that they will commit to getting more consumers to sign up for the cards and to use them a lot. That can lead to increased marketing spending at issuers, which has been an issue for AmEx in recent quarters. Ms. Pickett of AmEx declined to talk about marketing expenses associated with this deal and said the company "already had a marketing partnership with Hilton and this is obviously continuing at a different level." Such costs could become even more of an issue as banks and others have ramped up the rewards offerings on their high-end general purpose credit cards. That potentially diminished the allure of using, say, a hotel-specific card. "Airline and hotel co-brands are a snoozefest...[they] are under pressure," said Brian Kelly, founder and chief executive of ThePointsGuy.com, which tracks rewards-card programs. But there are pluses. Clinching a deal like this on an exclusive basis gives AmEx exposure to a large number of desirable consumers. Hilton's loyalty program has approximately 63 million members, according to the hotel. That includes a mix of consumers who have Hilton co-branded cards and those who earn hotel perks without the credit card. "The deals are wins even if the positive impact isn't to the same degree it might have been about 10 years ago," said Craig Maurer, an analyst who covers AmEx at Autonomous Research Corrections & Amplifications Hilton's full company name is Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. A previous version of this story referred to it as Hilton Inc.

But Dimon doesn’t plan to follow Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney boss Bob Iger by stepping down from President Trump’s business advisory council. “We have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people’s lives and protect our environment,” Dimon said. A JPMorgan spokeswoman confirmed that Dimon does not plan to leave the the council, which is called the Strategic and Policy Forum. By contrast, Musk followed through on his threat to quit that forum as well as the president’s manufacturing jobs initiative. “Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk said on Twitter shortly after Trump’s White House announcement on leaving the climate deal. Dimon did express disappointment with Trump, echoing concerns raised by fellow Wall Street bigwig Lloyd Blankfein. The Goldman Sachs CEO sent his first-ever tweet on Thursday to call Trump’s Paris move a “setback for the environment and for the U.S.’s leadership position in the world.” Blankfein is not a member of Trump’s advisory council. Dimon’s statement suggests he wants to continue to have a voice in Trump’s agenda, which includes plans to rip up rules governing Wall Street. The stocks of JPMorgan and other banks spiked after the election, in part because of Trump’s pledge to “do a big number” on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. Bank stocks have given back some of their post-election gains amid disappointment with slow progress on tax reform and deregulation. JPMorgan stock is up 19% since Trump’s victory.

The IPO would be the first by a U.S. e-commerce company in two years, as stock market investors have been wary of betting on companies in the sector that, unlike Stitch Fix, are not already profitable. San Francisco-based Stitch Fix has hired investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to lead the IPO, four people said this week, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Stitch Fix, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment. Founded in 2011 by Harvard Business School graduate Katrina Lake, Stitch Fix has over 5,700 employees. It had $730 million in sales in its fiscal year for 2016, its third year of profitability. Stitch Fix sends its customers five personalized apparel and accessories items based on size, budget and style. Customers fill out a survey of their preferences, which the company then uses to select items for them with the aid of a personal stylist. Customers can return what they do not like in the company’s prepaid packaging. Stitch Fix works with more than 250 women’s fashion brands, including Joie and Citizens for Humanity, and more than 30 men’s brands including Scotch & Soda. Stitch Fix is a variant on the popular e-commerce “subscription box” model, in which customers pay to have regular – often monthly – shipments of goods.

Reuters Several major US companies, including WalMart Stores Inc, JP Morgan Chase & Co and IBM Corp, on Friday said their CEOs will remain in an influential presidential advisory group despite objecting to President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. Citing the need to stay engaged with the administration, business leaders said they would remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies. Trump, a Republican, on Thursday said he would pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger reacted by leaving White House advisory councils after Trump's move. “Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Asked about CEOs’ criticism of the US withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets. Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, added he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council. A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the largest US retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council. McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was “disappointed in today’s news about the Paris Agreement. We think it’s important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord. “IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration – as we do with governments around the world,” a company spokeswoman said. Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said. Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co, criticized Trump’s decision. The company acknowledged Friday that he would not step down from Trump’s business group. “I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment,” Dimon said in a statement. PepsiCo Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is “disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table.” Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Goldman Sachs. General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump’s manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added, “Industry must now lead and not depend on government.” Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal “a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people.” Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said. Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration’s efforts to boost US economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for US goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. “If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption.” The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders. Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have “a statistically insignificant impact on the environment.” “If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,” she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group. Blackrock Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump’s business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co’s new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group. In February, Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump’s immigration policies.

A scientist's perspective 15th-century Chinese sailors have a lesson for Trump about climate policy Will the Paris Agreement still be able to deliver after the US withdrawal? Trump's move to withdraw from Paris accord cedes global leadership to China Time for China and Europe to lead, as Trump dumps the Paris climate deal Several major US companies, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, JP Morgan Chase & Co and IBM Corp, on Friday said their CEOs will remain in an influential presidential advisory group despite objecting to President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. Citing the need to stay engaged with the administration, business leaders said they would remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies. Trump, a Republican, on Thursday said he would pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger reacted by leaving White House advisory councils after Trump's move. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President's Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Asked about CEOs' criticism of the U.S. withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets. Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, added he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council. A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the largest U.S. retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council. McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was "disappointed in today's news about the Paris Agreement. We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions." IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord. "IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration - as we do with governments around the world," a company spokeswoman said. Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said. Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co, criticized Trump's decision. The company acknowledged Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group. "I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said in a statement. PepsiCo Inc Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table." 'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL' Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Goldman Sachs. General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump's manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added: "Industry must now lead and not depend on government." Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people." Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said. Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost U.S. economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for U.S. goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. "If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption." The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders. Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment." "If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP. Blackrock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group. In February, Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies.

(NYSE: BXP), a real estate investment trust, announced today that it has renewed its “at the market” equity offering program through which it may sell up to an aggregate of $600 million of its common stock.

The sales, if any, would be made in „at the market” equity offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act.

"I absolutely disagree with the Administration" on its choice to pull out of the landmark accord on climate change, Dimon said in a statement Friday, "but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment." Dimon is one of many CEOs to serve as a member of the White House's Strategic and Policy Forum, and unlike SpaceX and Tesla entrepreneur Elon Musk and Disney head Bob Iger, he doesn't intend to leave that table, a spokesperson for JPMorgan confirmed with CNN Money. This isn't the first dust-up Dimon has endured as a member of the White House's business council. Facing critiques for his participation, he told shareholders at JPMorgan's annual meeting: "I’d try to help any President of the U.S. because I’m a patriot."

The lease is for 15 years, the Wall Street Journal reported. JPMorgan already has space there, but is expanding for FinTech, its financial technology arm, according to an earlier report from Bloomberg. The lease means the bank is expanding office space for its digital teams from 125,000 square feet to 428,000 square feet. Between 2,000 and 2,500 JPMorgan employees will eventually work at 5 Manhattan West, the bank said. The company has one floor, and will take three more in the new lease deal. Office asking rents at the building are reportedly the $90s per square foot. Amazon is also rumored to be taking space at 5 Manhattan West. The e-commerce giant, which occupies space at 7 West 34th Street, would take 350,000 square feet for its offices there, according to a Commercial Observer report from April. Whole Foods is taking 60,000 square feet at the base of the building, and London-based global financial data provider Markit signed up for 140,000 square feet at 5 Manhattan West in 2015. The 1.7 million-square-foot building at 450 West 33rd Street, which has undergone major renovations, is part of Brookfield’s five-building Manhattan West megaproject. The development also includes two other office buildings, a retail building, a garden and plaza, and a 62-story, 844-unit residential tower called the Eugene. [WSJ] — Miriam Hall Tags: Commercial Real Estate Short URL Subscribe to our e-Lerts New York Real Estate News Daily Updates Weekly Roundup South Florida Real Estate News Daily Updates Weekly Roundup Los Angeles Real Estate News Daily Updates Weekly Roundup China Watch Coming soon!

The VJF Jobs Kitchen program provides entrepreneurs with professional and educational resources to accelerate their business plans to the point of qualifying for capital. In return, companies must commit to bringing low- and mid-skill jobs to workers in challenged neighborhoods. “Access to capital is crucial for businesses in communities like Rochester and conventional small business loans can often times be hardest to get. This is especially true for many low-wealth entrepreneurs who wind up struggling and sometimes failing as a result of the lacking financial support,” said Matthew Tipple, market executive-middle market commercial banking at JPMorgan Chase. “We also know that small businesses are the primary drivers of job growth, contributing about two-thirds of all new jobs in the private sector. That’s why we support nonprofit organizations such as the Venture Jobs Foundation and programs such as the VJF Jobs Kitchen.” The program was announced at VJF’s annual Rochester Prosperity Conference. To learn more about the organization and its programs, visit www.venturejobs.org. “Broader access to professional resources and funding is critical to driving more inclusive economic growth in Rochester,” said Dennis DeLeo, VJF president and founder.  “We’re grateful to JP Morgan Chase for its support of the Jobs Kitchen program. This is a great next step toward getting local entrepreneurs started on the right foot to achieve the ultimate goal of job growth and prosperity in our community.” VJF makes impact investments in support of its charitable purpose, funding small businesses that will its capital to create jobs in higher poverty neighborhoods.

Bank stocks slid Wednesday after Bank of America and JPMorgan executives announced lower second-quarter trading revenues compared to last year. Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman is now saying the same for his firm. “We all have similar clients, if not the same clients,” Gorman told Bloomberg in a video interview.  Trading revenue is expected to drop at least 10% in the second quarter at Morgan Stanley, Gorman said. This mirrors a 15% drop in trading revenue at JPMorgan which CFO Marianne Lake announced Wednesday at an investor conference. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan also said trading revenues would be lower. Those executives all point to lower volatility as a key factor for the lower revenues. Brexit and the surprise rise election of Donald Trump contributed to higher uncertainty and volatility in the markets in the summer of 2016, according to Gorman. “There is enormous uncertainty which typically would breed tremendous volatility and it’s not,” Gorman said. Economic growth at large is relatively strong, but business-friendly moves promised by Trump, like tax and healthcare reform, have not been implemented as quickly as Trump would have hoped. Normally, this type of political uncertainty would breed higher volatility but that hasn't happened yet, according to Gorman. "Right now, people are trying to unravel the conundrum where globally, the economic picture looks relatively robust," Gorman said. "[But] globally, the geopolitical picture looks relatively unstable. How does one trade in that environment?" Morgan Stanley shares have not moved much this year, and are trading 0.5% higher than the start of 2017. Shares closed Wednesday at $41.74.

Still, Dimon signalled he won’t follow Tesla Inc’s chief executive Elon Musk and Walt Disney’s CEO Bob Iger in quitting the council, which provides the president with advice on everything from tax reforms to employment and business policies. “I absolutely disagree with the Administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people’s lives and protect our environment,” Dimon said in an emailed statement. Trump said overnight he would withdraw the US from the global climate accord, saying it favours countries like China and India at the expense of American workers. He had campaigned on a pledge to exit the landmark accord that was one of the signature achievements of his predecessor Barack Obama, calling the agreement a “hoax.” “We are getting out, but we will start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal, and if we can, that’s great,” Trump said in televised remarks on Thursday. “And if we can’t, that’s fine.” While the withdrawal process will take years to unfold -- the earliest the US can extricate itself is in November 2020 -- Trump’s plan immediately drew condemnation from European allies and the captains of American industry. Lloyd Blankfein, chairman of Dimon’s competitor bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said on Tweeter that Trump’s decision was a “setback for the environment and for the US’s leadership position in the world.” General Electric’s CEO Jeff Immelt tweeted his disappointment with the decision. “Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government,” he tweeted. Tesla’s Musk said withdrawal from the accord was “not good for America or the world,” and announced he’s quitting Trump’s council, as did Disney’s Iger. That makes three members who have withdrawn from the task of providing advice to Trump. In February, Uber Technologies Inc’s CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick withdrew from the council, responding to the blowback from drivers and Uber riders who criticised Trump’s executive order on immigration. Besides Dimon, the other members who remain on Trump’s business advisory council include Blackstone Group LP’s CEO Stephen Schwarzman, PepsiCo’s CEO Indra Nooyi and General Motors Corp’s CEO Mary Barra.

In an emailed statement to CNBC, Dimon said, "I absolutely disagree with the Administration on this issue." He added, "But we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment." Win McNamee | Getty Images Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, speaks at the Economic Club of Washington September 12, 2016 in Washington, DC. Dimon is one of the CEOs to participate in White House councils and in his statement he did not indicate if he would remain in that post. On Thursday, Disney CEO Robert Iger said he quit the business advisory council over the decision, while Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk also said he'll leave his positions on presidential councils. The president said he would start talks to re-enter the agreement, but with terms that he called a more "fair" deal to his country. His comment was rebuked by several European governments. Many business leaders in the U.S. said they were disappointed by, or disagreed with, the decision, including Apple chief Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. Last month, at JPMorgan's annual shareholder meeting, Dimon had urged the business community and the administration to work together to find meaningful solutions to critical issues confronting the U.S. In response to a question on Trump's tighter immigration policy, Dimon had said, "He is the president of the United States. I believe he is the pilot flying our plane. I would try to help any president of the United States because I am a patriot." — CNBC's Dawn Giel contributed to this report.

From left are, Trump, UAW president Dennis Williams, Ford CEO Mark Fields, and EPA administrator Scott Pruitt. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Photo Credit: AP advertisement | advertise on newsday Several news outlets have reported about the tremendous access chief executives have to the Trump administration. According to many of the accounts, corporate titans are exercising a moderating influence on President Donald Trump — a counterweight, presumably, to the nationalist agenda of Steve Bannon and other administration hard-liners. But this analysis misses the mark. CEOs are not headed to the White House for the good of anything beyond their companies’ bottom lines. And, in many cases, they have positioned their companies to benefit from Trump’s agenda. In short, the Trump agenda is not being softened by billionaires. It is designed for billionaires. Most Popular Opinion: Want a good ally? Then be a good ally. Editorial: The key issue for Nassau fall vote Editorial: Population decline could reshape LI Essay: Where did the old-time doctors go? Dobie: Now, California takes the lead Trump’s budget and tax proposals offer the most obvious signs. His budget proposal would eviscerate the nation’s social safety net, including more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and public benefits. Don't miss outSign up for The PointCartoonDavies' latest cartoon: Climate clownsCommentSubmit your letter Meanwhile, Trump’s sweeping tax cuts would benefit billionaires and large corporations first and foremost. And, the gutting of environmental and financial regulations would pad the pockets of the ultra-wealthy. Score one for the billionaires. The same is true for health care. The American Health Care Act, or TrumpCare, that passed the House would strip 23 million Americans of their health insurance and simultaneously would give billions in tax breaks to the nation’s highest earners. advertisement | advertise on newsday The pattern holds when it comes to proposals to attack immigrant communities and criminalize people of color. When you examine which companies and corporate leaders are cozying up to Trump, you’ll see that many are positioned to benefit from his agenda. Take JPMorgan Chase. Since the election, the company contributed $500,000 to Trump’s inaugural committee, and chief executive Jamie Dimon accepted a seat on Trump’s business advisory council. Some say Dimon is a moderating influence on Trump — arguing, for instance, against labeling China a currency manipulator and potentially sparking a trade war. But Dimon recently declared that Trump’s economic platform is “the right agenda.” And responding to angry shareholders about his support for Trump, Dimon said he was a “patriot” for working with the administration. OpinionNational cartoon roundup Dimon’s company also stands to benefit from Trump’s anti-immigrant dragnet. As Trump pursues a mass deportation strategy that will rely upon rapid expansions in private immigrant detention centers, JPMorgan Chase is financing the very private prison companies, such as the Geo Group and CoreCivic, most eager to meet that demand. In short, the company has a financial interest in the companies that Trump is relying on to implement his anti-immigrant agenda. Tweets from @sguzik/newsday-editorial-board That’s why a new national campaign has labeled JPMorgan Chase, as well as eight other companies, the “Corporate Backers of Hate.” While many of their leaders pursue a close relationship with the Trump administration, these companies stand to profit from the administration’s policies. Members of Congress who have stood with Trump have felt the wrath of angry constituents at town halls, or faced forceful protest when they refused to hear from voters in their districts. Major companies standing with Trump’s agenda are now starting to feel this same citizen anger, and their CEOs and corporate board members would be foolish to ignore the reputational risk. When citizens and consumers see corporate leaders cozying up to a president advancing a hateful agenda, or when we see companies positioned to benefit from such an odious platform, we are not fooled into thinking that these companies are acting to moderate an extremist. Instead, we know that they are thinking first and foremost of their own bottom lines, regardless of the damage being inflicted on our communities.

Labour market appears to be losing momentum despite unemployment rate falling to 16-year low WASHINGTON, June 3:   US job growth slowed in May and employment gains in the prior two months were not as strong as previously reported, suggesting the labour market was losing momentum despite the unemployment rate falling to a 16-year low of 4.3 per cent. Non-farm payrolls increased 138,000 last month as the manufacturing, government and retail sectors lost jobs, the Labor Department said on Friday. The economy created 66,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in March and April. Last month's job gains could still be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. “While the message was a little muddied today, the evidence generally suggests the labor market is cyclically tightening, and the Fed will need to continue to lean against that,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “We still believe it is very likely that the Fed will hike later this month. Perhaps more in question is the signal coming out of that meeting regarding subsequent hikes.” Details of the employment report were weak. Though the unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to its lowest level since May 2001, that was because 429,000 people dropped out of the labour force. Average hourly earnings The survey of households from which the unemployment rate is derived also showed a drop in employment. The jobless rate has declined five-tenths of a percentage point this year. Average hourly earnings rose four cents or 0.2 percent in May after a similar gain in April, leaving the year-on-year increase in wages at 2.5 percent. Job growth has decelerated from the 181,000 monthly average over the past 12 months as the labour market nears full employment. There is growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find qualified workers. Economists also believe that companies might be holding off hiring amid worries political scandals engulfing President Donald Trump could imperil his economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. “Political uncertainty in Washington is another factor holding back the job market,” said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo. “The probability that any of the Trump stimulus would become reality has decreased significantly in recent weeks.” Economists had forecast payrolls increasing 185,000 last month and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.4 percent. The Fed raised interest rates in March. A Reuters survey of banks that do business directly with the Fed, conducted after the employment report, showed all 18 primary dealers polled expected the U.S. central bank to raise rates this month. Ten forecast further monetary policy tightening in September and only six saw a rate hike in December. The dollar hit a seven-month low against a basket of currencies on the diminishing rate hike prospects in the second half of the year. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell to nearly seven-month lows, and short-dated yields touched their lowest in more than two weeks. U.S. stocks closed at new highs. Shrinking labour market The modest payrolls gain could temper expectations of a sharp acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter after gross domestic product increased at a tepid 1.2 percent annualized rate at the start of the year. While consumer spending picked up in April, a second report on Friday showed the trade deficit widening 5.2 percent to $47.6 billion. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increasing at a 3.4 percent pace in the second quarter. There was some good news in the employment report. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.4 percent, the lowest since November 2007. As a result, the spread between the jobless rate and this broad unemployment gauge, considered a better measure of labor market slack, was the smallest since early 2008. But the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent. The volatile 16-24 age group accounted for much of the drop in the participation rate last month, suggesting a rebound is likely. Manufacturing employment fell by 1,000 jobs last month as payrolls in the automobile sector dropped 1,500 amid declining sales. Ford Motor Co said last month it planned to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives. Construction payrolls rose 11,000 last month after decreasing by 1,000 jobs in April. Retail employment fell 6,100, declining for a fourth straight month, with department stores shedding 3,700 jobs. Department store chains like J.C. Penney Co Inc, Macy's Inc and Abercrombie & Fitch are struggling against stiff competition from online retailers led by Amazon . Nonstore retailers, including online merchants, hired 2,900 workers last month. Government employment decreased 9,000 last month, with state and local governments accounting for all the decrease.

Trump decided to pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement designed to fight climate change despite entreaties from U.S. allies and corporate leaders in an action that fulfilled a major campaign pledge. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post. He is a member of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, and Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week Musk said on Wednesday that he had done "all I can" to convince Trump to stay in the accord, and threatened to leave the presidential advisory councils if Trump announced a U.S. exit from the accord. Iger wrote on Twitter that "as a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal." He is leaving the business advisory group. Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration's immigration policies. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The group is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP and includes Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo Inc and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co . Late on Thursday, BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said he would continue to serve on Trump's CEO Forum, despite reservations about the White House decision to withdraw from the Paris accord. "I accepted the invitation to serve on the President's CEO Forum because I believe I can contribute to the policy dialogue in Washington and serve as a voice for investors," Fink said in a statement. "I am a strong believer that our industry needs to have a voice with governments around the world," said Fink, whose company is the world's largest asset manager, with $5.4 trillion under management. "I do not agree with all of the president's policies and decisions, including today's announcement to exit the U.S. from the Paris Agreement which I believe is a critical step forward in addressing climate change." Asked about Musk's resignation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox News that "anybody who read the agreement and understood it would realize that this was not really about climate, this was about U.S. money going to other countries and it didn’t solve the climate problem." Musk has met with Trump several times and spoken with him about the long-term goal of his company SpaceX for flights to Mars carrying humans. The White House is planning to a hold a meeting with technology leaders on June 19, an administration spokesman said Wednesday. General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra would remain on the presidential advisory panel, adding that her participation "provides GM a seat at an important table to contribute to a constructive dialogue about key policy issues." In 2013, GM signed a declaration joining other major companies arguing that responding to climate change was good business. The automaker said on Thursday that despite the withdrawal it "will not waver from our commitment to the environment." It was unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join Trump's panel. Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said on Thursday the No.2 U.S. automaker believes "climate change is real, and remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities."

But look a little more closely and the signs of unease in the stock market are hard to ignore. It’s visible in fund flows, where investors are rotating from US stocks to the rest of the world at the fastest pace in two years. And short sellers are getting aggressive, raising bearish bets in three of the past four months. US stocks climbed this week, led by by phone companies and materials producers. The S&P 500 increased 1 per cent to 2,438.91 and Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent to 21,204.58. While the gains built on the previous week’s breakout, neither index is more than 2 per cent above the all-time highs reached on March 1. In other words, benchmark indexes are at records, but they also haven’t advanced much since March, one of the longer periods of stasis since Donald Trump’s election. For all their resilience, equity investors remain anxious about an economy that has recently given uneven evidence of its vigor just as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates.  After yesterday’s employment report, three-month US jobs growth is now the lowest since 2012. Housing demand weakened more than expected in April, and while manufacturing gauges remain firm, a series of reports on inflation continue to show corporate pricing power is muted. “It is a warning that, as with asset prices, the key question is not the level you are at, but the prospects for growth from here,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds in New York. “Investors should consider whether overseas economies with greater growth potential may provide better equity market returns.” Meanwhile, investors in exchange-traded funds turned net sellers of US stocks in May for the first time in a year, with withdrawals approaching US$2 billion (RM8.5 billion), data compiled by Bloomberg show. They added US$22 billion to equity funds that invest in markets from Europe to Asia. The divergence in flows, the widest since April 2015, marked a turnaround from last year, when almost US$10 went for American equities for every one that went elsewhere. Even as stocks vaulted to new highs, bears aren’t deterred.  Short interest as a proportion of total shares outstanding has expanded since January, rising by 0.3 percentage point to 3.9 per cent. Never before has an equity advance as big as this year’s occurred simultaneously with more short sales, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg that goes back to 2008. Spotty demand for American stocks coincided with hiccups in economic data. Rather than picking up pace as expected by many at the start of the year, Citigroup’s Economic Surprise Index for the US, which measures the difference between actual releases and economist expectations, peaked in March and has since fallen to the lowest level since February 2016. By contrast, similar gauges for the rest of the world have fared better as Brazil and Russia emerged from recessions while the populist political tide receded in Europe. Since the global financial crisis, the US had dominated equity gains worldwide, with rallies underpinned by easier monetary policy and a steady recovery. Now that growth is poised to accelerate from Europe to Japan, American assets are losing some of their appeal. In Bank of America Corp’s latest survey of money managers, 82 per cent called the US the most expensive market. While the S&P 500 is up 8.9 per cent this year, it’s poised to trail the MSCI World ex-US Index for the first time since 2009. The dollar is heading for the worst annual decline in a decade after losing about 6 per cent of its value against a basket of currencies. Even within the US market itself, the preference for overseas exposure is evident. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket tracking shares with the highest leverage to international growth has risen 17 per cent this year, compared with 6 per cent for a similar gauge for domestic-focused companies. “The dollar weakness and non-US economic strength is being replayed all over the world,” said Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at US Trust in New York. “Rarely have times been better for US firms with global exposure. The auspicious omens are plain to see.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Malaysia Airlines close to deal for more widebody Airbus planes Pound falls after London terror attacks raise political tensions Ringgit opens higher against US dollar PBOC has economy's back even as it squeezes leverage from market Oil subdued as rising US output undermines Opec effort to cut supply Ringgit likely to trade higher versus US dollar next week RHB-AmBank to take No. 1 spot in asset management, insurance, broking Petronas Q1 2017 pre-tax profit more than doubles to RM15.5b British pound in thrall to election projections as market jitters rise Bursa to be firmer next week Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Tech leads Wall Street higher; jobs data falls short Dow, S&P little changed as job growth slows in May Wall Street higher as strong private jobs data boosts confidence Wall Street opens slightly lower as investors digest data Global stocks meander in holiday-hit trading; pound rises Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

Continuing their long record of support for equality, major employers Citibanamex, Accenture, Google, Kellogg and Mastercard have already committed to participate in the Mexico-focused survey and report. The survey was announced at an event on May 23 hosted by Citibanamex and comes during a time of significant progress in LGBTQ workplace inclusion around the globe. In the coming months, Mexico-based HRC Equidad MX will collect responses to the survey, which will run parallel to HRC's annual Corporate Equality Index (CEI) survey (http://www.hrc.org/campaigns/corporate-equality-index), and release the results during the Fall of 2017. The forthcoming report will evaluate major Mexican business and multinational companies on three core pillars of LGBT inclusion: o Adoption of nondiscrimination policies; o Creation of employee resource groups or diversity and inclusion councils; o Engagement in public activities to support LGBT inclusion. Highly rated employers will receive a designation similar to the 'Best Places to Work' certification offered through the CEI. 'Businesses around the world continue to lead for LGBT equality,' said Mary Beth Maxwell, HRC's Vice President for Programs, Research and Training. 'From the companies taking the Equidad MX survey on inclusion to the HRC Global Business Coalition raising the bar, private sector partners around the world are sending a clear message that equality and inclusion are good for business.' 'Having these five important companies support this effort by the Human Rights Campaign represents a significant step in raising awareness of workplace equality among Mexican companies,' said Deena Fidas, Director of HRC's Workplace Equality Program. 'Mexico is a great commercial and social partner for the United States, and replicating the work we have done with companies over the past 15 years in the U.S. through our Corporate Equality Index will be a watershed moment for Mexican and multinational companies operating here.' 'Citibanamex is an institution committed to giving the best of Mexico and the best in the world to our clients and employees. This commitment goes hand in hand with respect and job inclusion of the LGBT population,' said Liliana Iñigo, Citibanamex's LGBT Ambassador for Latin America and Citibanamex's Executive Director of Marketing. 'We establish a culture that promotes integrity and confidence so that our collaborators can enhance their talent, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Participating in the HRC Equidad MX certification shows the conviction we have to build the best working environment for the LGBT population in Mexico and in our Financial Group.' 'Accenture is an inclusive company that promotes an environment of trust and motivates each one of its members to be authentic. We are proud to be a multinational firm that works every day to provide a fair work environment, regardless of the sexual orientation or gender identity of the people. With this, we formally declare our commitment to continue working towards the LGBT inclusion supported by the HRC Equity MX certification,' said Jorge Torres, Accenture's Chief Technology Officer. 'Google's mission is to organize information and make it accessible and useful for everyone. In this sense, our search for diversity is a natural extension of this mission as we seek to increase access to opportunities, breaking down barriers and empowering people through technology,' said Delfina Grossi, Google Marketing Solutions Manager and Diversity Ambassador for Google Mexico. 'Kellogg seeks to foster a culture of inclusion for all its employees and generate a work environment in which people are appreciated and can be authentic,' said Guillermo González Guerra, Director of Human Resources at Kellogg Latin America. 'Through its K-Pride & Allies program, the company works to become the employer of choice for the LGBT community by promoting equity, solidarity and respect. Getting the HRC Equidad MX badge will be a very important step in this regard.' 'Mastercard is proud to participate in HRC's Global Business Coalition and to promote inclusive and diverse corporate culture with different actions that reinforce our commitment with our most important capital, the human and in the community in which we work,' said Brenda Hernandez, Director of Human Resources for Mastercard Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. Accenture, Google and Mastercard are members of HRC's Global Business Coalition (http://www.hrc.org/resources/global-business-coalition), a cohort of global employers publicly committed to inclusion everywhere they do business. Through its Corporate Equality Index (http://www.hrc.org/campaigns/corporate-equality-index), the HRC Foundation has established a roadmap for the adoption of LGBTQ-inclusive policies, benefits and practices across major corporations. Last year, for the second year in a row, HRC launched its international CEI in Mexico City along with the U.S. Embassy in Mexico, The Dow Chemical Company, J.P. Morgan Chase, and the Mexican state-owned petroleum company, PEMEX. In conjunction with the launch of the 2017 CEI, HRC Equidad MX released a Spanish-language toolkit for workplaces in Mexico and around Latin America. The guide provides predominantly Spanish-language workplaces with a resource to help train and equip employees to build LGBT-inclusive environments. HRC Equidad MX: Global Workplace Equality Program, which launched last year, works to increase awareness about the importance of LGBTQ diversity and inclusion in Mexico's workplaces by developing consulting and education models for Mexican companies and organizations. It also utilizes HRC's tools and relationships to engage interested companies in aligning their corporate policies on LGBTQ inclusion to international standards.

But even a reliable paycheck no longer delivers a reliable income. Like Casares, who works at a Victoria’s Secret store in Ocala, Fla., more and more employees across a growing range of industries find the number of hours they work is swinging giddily from week to week — bringing chaos not only to family scheduling, but also to household finances. And a new wave of research shows that the main culprit is not the gig economy, but shifting pay within the same job. This volatility helps unravel a persistent puzzle: why a below-average jobless rate — 4.4 percent in April — is still producing an above-average level of economic anxiety. Turbulence has replaced the traditional American narrative of steady financial progress over a lifetime. “Since the 1970s, steady work that pays a predictable and living wage has become increasingly difficult to find,” said Jonathan Morduch, a director of the U.S. Financial Diaries project, an in-depth study of 235 low- and moderate-income households. “This shift has left many more families vulnerable to income volatility.” Latest business videos Ever-changing schedules at Victoria’s Secret, for example, make it difficult for Casares, 27, to find care for her 2-year-old and 6-year-old, and to cover the bills. “The lowest hours I’ve gotten is 15 and the highest I’ve gotten is 39,” said Casares, who started in October, earning $10 an hour. The schedule is usually posted a month in advance, she said, but there are frequently last-minute changes. Stability is worth a lot to workers. On average, employees are willing to give up a fifth of their weekly wage to avoid a schedule set by an employer on a week’s notice, according to a field experiment where workers were offered a range of alternative hours at different pay levels. “That is totally the story,” said Morduch, who watched household incomes in his study rise and fall. “And that instability and insecurity are increasingly a part of middle-class life, too.” In the course of a year, for example, the monthly income of a California family with one child that Morduch’s team tracked jumped to $5,279 from as low as $1,175. The husband supplemented his steady $400-a-week salaried construction job with extra remodeling work that could add from $323 to $1,588 a month to his total. His wife brought in up to $1,824 a month from babysitting and from selling jewelry, clothing and flowers. Monthly expenses can pendulum as much as income, but the two do not necessarily move in tandem. An analysis of 250,000 bank accounts by the JPMorgan Chase Institute, a nonprofit research arm of the bank, found that roughly 80 percent of households had an insufficient cash buffer to manage the mismatch between income and expenses in a given month. Few people can comfortably ride out the inevitable financial bronco ride. “Only households that earn $105,000 or more a year are secure against the volatility they are exposed to,” said Diana Farrell, the institute’s president and CEO. “It’s not just about the unemployed or the poor.” Middle-income households, for example, saw their monthly expenses deviate by nearly $1,300, the equivalent of a month’s rent or mortgage payment. And one uh-oh expense — usually in the form of a medical, tax or car repair bill — can wreck a family’s balance sheet for a year or more. Even a single month’s volatility can have a cascading effect. One month, a family copes by using the money earmarked for, say, the utility bill to cover the cost of replacing a busted water heater. The next month, it is the telephone company that goes unpaid as the family struggles to make up the missed utility bill plus late fees and interest — and so on. Emergencies are not the only source of expense spikes. So are bridal showers, Christmas gifts and outgrown winter coats. May turned out to be an expensive month for Tomika Waggoner, 44, a nursing home aide in Newport, Ky. Her daughter was graduating from high school, and she needed a few hundred dollars to pay for her cap and gown, commencement fees, a prom ticket and a dress. Waggoner’s work schedule depends on her ability to find care for her 15-year-old son, who has epilepsy. So sometimes she works a weekend at $17 an hour and sometimes three $15-an-hour weekdays. For the Waggoner family, and many others with low and moderate incomes, a tax refund offered a once-a-year lifeline. That $700 check and a contribution from her mother covered most of the graduation costs and helped pay off the debt on some furniture. (Doctor’s visits and medical payments are frequently scheduled to coincide with tax refunds, according to the JPMorgan Chase Institute.) “I also went to a couple of food pantries,” Waggoner added. “We ate a lot of bologna.” Rather than causing jolts in income, the gig economy is, for many people, what smooths them out. Only about 0.5 percent of the labor force is working in the gig economy. And while bonuses, extra commissions and overtime bump up a worker’s average income, unwelcome reductions in hours, particularly at the lower end of the income ladder, more often shrink an expected paycheck. “Stable, predictable work schedules are essential to economic security,” said Susan Lambert, a professor at the University of Chicago who is studying new data supplied by the General Social Survey, a respected national survey that began asking in-depth questions about work schedules only last year. The latest data shows that 41 percent of all hourly workers say they are not given more than a week’s notice of their schedule; nearly half have little or no say on their work hours. “It’s not just service, or female-dominated jobs, but some of the most challenging schedules are production and construction jobs,” Lambert said. The ubiquity of the phenomenon has frequently been masked by annual measures of income and spending or one-time snapshots of savings and debt that fail to capture fluctuations week to week or month to month. Casares said that when she had to turn down an inconvenient shift at Victoria’s Secret, like staying until midnight to close, her schedule the following week would suffer. “I would be facing fewer hours,” she said. To supplement the light weeks, Casares started picking up a shift as a part-time server at Olive Garden ($5.39 an hour plus tips). The number of Americans living comfortably or doing all right financially has grown since the recession. Still, the new Fed report found that 30 percent — roughly 73 million adults — say they are finding it difficult to get by financially, or are just getting by. To Morduch and his co-author, Rachel Schneider, the rise in income volatility is an indication of how businesses in an era of advancing technology and global competition have shifted risk onto employees. Consider the cost of saving for retirement and medical care. When health insurance premiums for employers soared between 2003 and 2013 (before the Affordable Care Act went into effect), workers picked up 93 percent of the extra cost. Asked whether her job at Victoria’s Secret provided benefits, Casares said it did: “We’re given three bras and a bottle of Bombshell, their No. 1 selling perfume.” Health or retirement contributions are not part of the package.

ALLISON MCNEELY TORONTO — Bloomberg News Published Friday, Jun. 02, 2017 6:02PM EDT Last updated Friday, Jun. 02, 2017 6:02PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print In a world where corporate bonds look expensive and it’s tough to find yield, one firm has been digging around in an overlooked corner of the bank-bond market. Phil Mesman and his colleagues at Picton Mahoney Asset Management have been scooping up subordinated debt issued by the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays PLC and Crédit Agricole SA in the 1980s and 90s that is trading at a discount to face value. The goal is to get repaid early at a premium to the current price. This strategy, which began almost two years ago with a spreadsheet plotting the rather tiny universe of the asset class, has handed the firm’s funds returns of more than 20 per cent, Mr. Mesman said. These legacy hybrid capital notes were originally issued to convert to equity in the event of a bank failure. They trade at a discount primarily because of the low coupon, which is based on a spread over the London interbank offered rate, and uncertainty around whether they will be repaid early, Mr. Mesman said. The bonds, which also have a liquidity discount, have a maturity of 25 years or longer in most cases and some are perpetual bonds, he said. The bond covenants and structures are good for investors, because they make it difficult for a bank to convert the bonds to equity in the event it needs to shore up capital levels. Regulators have said that banks need to take out the bonds before Jan. 1, 2022, Mr. Mesman said, putting a deadline on opportunities in the trade. “It’s an incredible risk-reward,” Mr. Mesman, senior partner and portfolio manager, said by phone from Toronto. He manages more than $700-million in fixed income of Picton’s $6.8-billion of assets. “Typically they would be rated BB or higher-quality high-yield instruments, but the bank issuers are all investment grade.” Stamp collecting Mr. Mesman estimates that his firm is one of only a few players in the $5-billion (U.S.) to $7-billion market, with most of the investors and dealers concentrated in Europe. The bonds represent about 30 per cent of both Picton Mahoney’s main fund, the Fortified Income Fund and the Income Opportunities Fund, as well as about 50 per cent of the firm’s special-situations fund, he said. It’s a strategy that can only be pursued by knowledgeable investors who have flexibility with their investment horizon and don’t have to follow an index, Roger Francis, a credit analyst at Mizuho International PLC in London, said by phone. He said he’s heard the strategy compared to stamp collecting. The main risks with these old bank bonds is liquidity – they’re difficult to trade in tough market conditions – and that a bank will opt not to call or tender for them early, Mr. Francis said. The strategy hinges on correctly identifying which bonds are candidates to be repaid early, or which banks might be willing to negotiate, Mr. Mesman said. Direct approach “If we find a bond where perhaps 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the issue has already been tendered over the years, then we’ll approach them directly and offer them our bonds at a certain price,” he said. Crédit Agricole recently tendered for €371.2-million of a perpetual bond at 78 euro cents on the euro, but investors only took them up on part of the offer, suggesting that they’re waiting for a higher payout, Mr. Mesman said. His firm sold 25 per cent of their €25-million position in the bond and are waiting for a higher price for the rest, he said. To be sure, there has been some headline uncertainty with some banks in Europe, Mr. Mesman said. Deutsche Bank AG, UniCredit SpA and other European banks have in the past been at risk of not paying the coupons on their bonds. While failure to pay interest would be tantamount to default for most debt securities, coupon payments on newer contingent convertible bonds, known as CoCos, are discretionary. Once missed, though, they are gone forever.

(New York Times) By News Editorial Board Published Fri, Jun 2, 2017 SHARE TWEET EMAIL With an ill-considered stroke of the pen, President Trump has turned the country’s back on its own people, its business leaders, its scientists and most of the rest of the world. His rejection of the Paris climate accord also carries the real risk of allowing China to supplant the United States in world leadership. His decision could defeat the world’s best hope of preventing catastrophic climate change or at least buying time so that coastal areas, including New York City, have an opportunity to adapt. That’s bad for America and it’s bad for Buffalo, home to what will be the hemisphere’s largest solar panel manufacturing plant. There may be opportunities to mitigate the damage Trump is inviting, but the risks are undeniably higher today than they were on Wednesday. Few doubt at this point that the climate is warming; the argument is over the causes, and whether the warming can be stemmed. But, in the worst case, what is the downside to better gas mileage, cleaner air and a chance to avoid the calamities that could await? After all, there really is a fast-growing crack in the Antarctic ice shelf. Something really is happening to the planet that deserves the attention of the world, including the United States. Consider the breadth of American interests that favored remaining in the pact. Start with Trump’s own secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who, as chief executive officer of Exxon, supported the Paris agreement. So does his successor, Darren Woods. So does Elon Musk, whose company owns SolarCity, which will produce solar panels in Buffalo. So do the leaders of ConocoPhillips and British Petroleum. So do General Electric, Dow Chemical, 3M, Disney, Coca-Cola, JPMorgan Chase and many other influential businesses whose leaders understand that America’s interests lie in an interconnected world in which science is not kicked to the curb as a political inconvenience. In a Rose Garden speech replete with misstatements, Trump stiff-armed American interests and joined Syria and Nicaragua, the only two countries that didn’t sign the accord – and Nicaragua only because it didn’t go far enough. The decision also puts the United States at odds with the other 194 nations that signed the agreement, including our closest allies. With that, Trump is tilting those countries away from the United States and eroding our influence in the world. The void is liable to benefit China, which is eager to expand its influence. Fortunately for Americans, this matter is not solely up to Trump or even Congress. The governors of New York, California and Washington state have formed the U.S. Climate Alliance and announced that their large and influential states will continue to abide by the agreement. Other governors are also expressing interest. New York and California, alone, comprise nearly 20 percent of the country’s population. This alliance means research and investment in clean energy will continue to exert a useful influence on commerce and the environment. Voters may also have a chance to weigh in. The process of backing out of the agreement could take as much as four years, making Trump’s decision an issue in the 2020 presidential election, and perhaps a key one. It’s hard to escape the sense that Trump’s decision was based in some significant part on his thirst to project the image of the “winner” that he promised during last year’s campaign. He has been largely stymied on anything requiring legislation – repealing the Affordable Care Act, enacting tax reform – and even thwarted thus far on his executive effort to ban Muslims from traveling here. Trump has left the door open a crack, saying he will try to negotiate “a deal that’s fair.” It’s a puzzling comment, since the existing agreement is voluntary and already allows each country to set its own commitments. Still, Americans, 70 percent of whom supported staying in the agreement, should let the president, governors and their legislative representatives know that they are interested in the condition of the country and the planet they leave to their children and grandchildren.

Nonfarm payrolls increased 138,000 last month as the manufacturing, government and retail sectors lost jobs, the Labor Department said on Friday. The economy created 66,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in March and April. Last month's job gains could still be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. "While the message was a little muddied today, the evidence generally suggests the labor market is cyclically tightening, and the Fed will need to continue to lean against that," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. "We still believe it is very likely that the Fed will hike later this month. Perhaps more in question is the signal coming out of that meeting regarding subsequent hikes." Details of the employment report were weak. Though the unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to its lowest level since May 2001, that was because 429,000 people dropped out of the labor force. The survey of households from which the unemployment rate is derived also showed a drop in employment. The jobless rate has declined five-tenths of a percentage point this year. Average hourly earnings rose four cents or 0.2 percent in May after a similar gain in April, leaving the year-on-year increase in wages at 2.5 percent. Job growth has decelerated from the 181,000 monthly average over the past 12 months as the labor market nears full employment. There is growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find qualified workers. Economists also believe that companies might be holding off hiring amid worries political scandals engulfing President Donald Trump could imperil his economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. "Political uncertainty in Washington is another factor holding back the job market," said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo. "The probability that any of the Trump stimulus would become reality has decreased significantly in recent weeks." Economists had forecast payrolls increasing 185,000 last month and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.4 percent. The Fed raised interest rates in March. A Reuters survey of banks that do business directly with the Fed, conducted after the employment report, showed all 18 primary dealers polled expected the U.S. central bank to raise rates this month. Ten forecast further monetary policy tightening in September and only six saw a rate hike in December. The dollar hit a seven-month low against a basket of currencies on the diminishing rate hike prospects in the second half of the year. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell to nearly seven-month lows, and short-dated yields touched their lowest in more than two weeks. U.S. stocks closed at new highs. The modest payrolls gain could temper expectations of a sharp acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter after gross domestic product increased at a tepid 1.2 percent annualized rate at the start of the year. While consumer spending picked up in April, a second report on Friday showed the trade deficit widening 5.2 percent to $47.6 billion. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increasing at a 3.4 percent pace in the second quarter. There was some good news in the employment report. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.4 percent, the lowest since November 2007. As a result, the spread between the jobless rate and this broad unemployment gauge, considered a better measure of labor market slack, was the smallest since early 2008. But the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent. The volatile 16-24 age group accounted for much of the drop in the participation rate last month, suggesting a rebound is likely. Manufacturing employment fell by 1,000 jobs last month as payrolls in the automobile sector dropped 1,500 amid declining sales. Ford Motor Co said last month it planned to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives. Construction payrolls rose 11,000 last month after decreasing by 1,000 jobs in April. Retail employment fell 6,100, declining for a fourth straight month, with department stores shedding 3,700 jobs. Department store chains like J.C. Penney Co Inc, Macy's Inc and Abercrombie & Fitch are struggling against stiff competition from online retailers led by Amazon. Nonstore retailers, including online merchants, hired 2,900 workers last month. Government employment decreased 9,000 last month, with state and local governments accounting for all the decrease. © (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2017.

Lu Wang — Bloomberg News Published Friday, Jun. 02, 2017 5:32PM EDT Last updated Friday, Jun. 02, 2017 7:06PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print The bulls are back in charge after a second weekly advance pushed the S&P 500 Index to a fresh record. But look a little more closely and the signs of unease in the stock market are hard to ignore. It’s visible in fund flows, where investors are rotating from U.S. stocks to the rest of the world at the fastest pace in two years. And short sellers are getting aggressive, raising bearish bets in three of the past four months. U.S. stocks climbed this week, led by by phone companies and materials producers. The S&P 500 increased 1 per cent to 2,438.91 and Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent to 21,204.58. While the gains built on the previous week’s breakout, neither index is more than 2 per cent above the all-time highs reached on March 1. In other words, benchmark indexes are at records, but they also haven’t advanced much since March, one of the longer periods of stasis since Donald Trump’s election. For all their resilience, equity investors remain anxious about an economy that has recently given uneven evidence of its vigour just as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates. After Friday’s employment report, three-month U.S. jobs growth is now the lowest since 2012. Housing demand weakened more than expected in April, and while manufacturing gauges remain firm, a series of reports on inflation continue to show corporate pricing power is muted. “It is a warning that, as with asset prices, the key question is not the level you are at, but the prospects for growth from here,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds in New York. “Investors should consider whether overseas economies with greater growth potential may provide better equity market returns.” Meanwhile, investors in exchange-traded funds turned net sellers of U.S. stocks in May for the first time in a year, with withdrawals approaching $2-billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They added $22-billion to equity funds that invest in markets from Europe to Asia. The divergence in flows, the widest since April 2015, marked a turnaround from last year, when almost $10 went for American equities for every one that went elsewhere. Even as stocks vaulted to new highs, bears aren’t deterred. Short interest as a proportion of total shares outstanding has expanded since January, rising by 0.3 percentage point to 3.9 per cent. Never before has an equity advance as big as this year’s occurred simultaneously with more short sales, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg that goes back to 2008. Spotty demand for American stocks coincided with hiccups in economic data. Rather than picking up pace as expected by many at the start of the year, Citigroup’s Economic Surprise Index for the U.S., which measures the difference between actual releases and economist expectations, peaked in March and has since fallen to the lowest level since February 2016. By contrast, similar gauges for the rest of the world have fared better as Brazil and Russia emerged from recessions while the populist political tide receded in Europe. Since the global financial crisis, the U.S. had dominated equity gains worldwide, with rallies underpinned by easier monetary policy and a steady recovery. Now that growth is poised to accelerate from Europe to Japan, American assets are losing some of their appeal. In Bank of America Corp.’s latest survey of money managers, 82 per cent called the U.S. the most expensive market. While the S&P 500 is up 8.9 per cent this year, it’s poised to trail the MSCI World ex-U.S. Index for the first time since 2009. The dollar is heading for the worst annual decline in a decade after losing about 6 per cent of its value against a basket of currencies. Even within the U.S. market itself, the preference for overseas exposure is evident. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket tracking shares with the highest leverage to international growth has risen 17 per cent this year, compared with 6 per cent for a similar gauge for domestic-focused companies. “The dollar weakness and non-U.S. economic strength is being replayed all over the world,” said Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust in New York. “Rarely have times been better for U.S. firms with global exposure. The auspicious omens are plain to see.” Report Typo/Error Also on The Globe and Mail Gen Y Money: What you need to know about owning and buying a condo (The Globe and Mail)   SPXS&P 500 INDEX Latest Price2,439.07 +9.01 (+0.37%) Updated June 2 4:44 PM EDT. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

A scientist's perspective 15th-century Chinese sailors have a lesson for Trump about climate policy Will the Paris Agreement still be able to deliver after the US withdrawal? Trump's move to withdraw from Paris accord cedes global leadership to China Time for China and Europe to lead, as Trump dumps the Paris climate deal Several major US companies, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, JP Morgan Chase & Co and IBM Corp, on Friday said their CEOs will remain in an influential presidential advisory group despite objecting to President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. Citing the need to stay engaged with the administration, business leaders said they would remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies. Trump, a Republican, on Thursday said he would pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger reacted by leaving White House advisory councils after Trump's move. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President's Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Asked about CEOs' criticism of the U.S. withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets. Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, added he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council. A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the largest U.S. retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council. McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was "disappointed in today's news about the Paris Agreement. We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions." IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord. "IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration - as we do with governments around the world," a company spokeswoman said. Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said. Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co, criticized Trump's decision. The company acknowledged Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group. "I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said in a statement. PepsiCo Inc Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table." 'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL' Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Goldman Sachs. General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump's manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added: "Industry must now lead and not depend on government." Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people." Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said. Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost U.S. economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for U.S. goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. "If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption." The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders. Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment." "If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP. Blackrock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group. In February, Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies.

MarketWatch recently spoke with Lee Kranefuss, one of the founders of industry giant iShares, about the state of the industry and where it may go from here. Read the first part of MarketWatch’s interview with Lee Kranefuss MarketWatch: ETFs have been around for more than 20 years. What do you see when you look out to the next 20? Lee Kranefuss: Well 20 years is a long time. I think one thing you might see is that fund launches will slow over time. More people will realize they can’t write a hit song. The flip side of that is that a lot of money managers and institutions who missed out of the wave will come out with their own products. We’re starting to see that with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.51%  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -0.79% which have recently launched their own ETFs. MarketWatch: Has the space gotten over-proliferated? Kranefuss: There are too many funds. Advisers come to us saying, “I don’t know about these, I don’t understand them, there are just too many.” The over-proliferation is supply driven, not demand driven, but I’m not inclined to say that there should be artificial constraints of some sort; I just wish people would be more rational about it. MarketWatch: Is it possible we’ll see fewer funds as we look out into the future? Kranefuss: I think we will. What determines whether a fund provider will be able to keep operating, or whether its funds will become zombie ETFs, is the diversity and breadth of the family it offers. If a smaller provider doesn’t have a healthy family of funds, you’ll see them close up or get absorbed into bigger names. MarketWatch: Given the growth in the industry, has your answer to whether ETFs are putting the nail in the coffin of mutual funds changed? Kranefuss: I think that active management, by which I mean security selection, is a dying business. It won’t ever completely die, because there’s some value to it, but I don’t think that traditional mutual funds are a growth field. It’s just too hard to pull real returns out of security selection, and the performance numbers are very damning. Related: How unloved is active management?

Kranefuss: Certainly you’ll never see a big firm come out with index mutual funds ever again—that doesn’t make sense.

You can easily implement those at the portfolio level. Value, for example, is largely a matter of sector orientation. There’s no need to spend more on a value fund. Most of these funds seem developed to stand out in marketing. There are always times when you can say something outperforms when back tested over a specific period. MarketWatch: What are your concerns for the industry going forward? Kranefuss: One issue that comes up is how there are both too many funds and too few. There’s a lot of concentration in the industry, but we’re missing some building blocks. We don’t need the hot new thing; we don’t need smaller players chasing hot spots of the market. One example I give is with emerging markets. A lot of major EM companies have a high correlation to developed markets because they’re international. So why would you pay high fees to get exposure to a part of the market that has a high correlation to something you can get cheaply here? I can imagine a way of investing in emerging markets where you get the correlated part of the market through cheap domestic proxies, and then the rest is unbundled and purchased separately. That seems like a useful thing to have.

MarketWatch recently spoke with Lee Kranefuss, one of the founders of industry giant iShares, about the state of the industry and where it may go from here. Read the first part of MarketWatch’s interview with Lee Kranefuss MarketWatch: ETFs have been around for more than 20 years. What do you see when you look out to the next 20? Lee Kranefuss: Well 20 years is a long time. I think one thing you might see is that fund launches will slow over time. More people will realize they can’t write a hit song. The flip side of that is that a lot of money managers and institutions who missed out of the wave will come out with their own products. We’re starting to see that with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.51%  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -0.79% which have recently launched their own ETFs. MarketWatch: Has the space gotten over-proliferated? Kranefuss: There are too many funds. Advisers come to us saying, “I don’t know about these, I don’t understand them, there are just too many.” The over-proliferation is supply driven, not demand driven, but I’m not inclined to say that there should be artificial constraints of some sort; I just wish people would be more rational about it. MarketWatch: Is it possible we’ll see fewer funds as we look out into the future? Kranefuss: I think we will. What determines whether a fund provider will be able to keep operating, or whether its funds will become zombie ETFs, is the diversity and breadth of the family it offers. If a smaller provider doesn’t have a healthy family of funds, you’ll see them close up or get absorbed into bigger names. MarketWatch: Given the growth in the industry, has your answer to whether ETFs are putting the nail in the coffin of mutual funds changed? Kranefuss: I think that active management, by which I mean security selection, is a dying business. It won’t ever completely die, because there’s some value to it, but I don’t think that traditional mutual funds are a growth field. It’s just too hard to pull real returns out of security selection, and the performance numbers are very damning. Related: How unloved is active management? Even outperformance is being snubbed MarketWatch: Is it possible that ETFs will become the venue for indexing while active stays in mutual funds, and that’s the primary different between the two? Kranefuss: Certainly you’ll never see a big firm come out with index mutual funds ever again—that doesn’t make sense. They’ll go straight to ETFs, where there are advantages of scale and of being the first mover. Active management will stay in mutual funds. There will be a middle ground in retirement assets, some of which is being done in the form of life-cycle funds. See also: Retirement accounts a ‘Holy Grail’ that remain out of reach for ETFs MarketWatch: What do you make of the smart-beta category, where the components are selected by rules designed to deliver specific strategies? “We don’t need the hot new thing; we don’t need smaller players chasing hot spots of the market.” Lee Kranefuss, iShares pioneer Kranefuss:There are some interesting ideas in the category, but only a handful of documented factors—momentum, low-volatility, and so forth. You can easily implement those at the portfolio level. Value, for example, is largely a matter of sector orientation. There’s no need to spend more on a value fund. Most of these funds seem developed to stand out in marketing. There are always times when you can say something outperforms when back tested over a specific period. MarketWatch: What are your concerns for the industry going forward? Kranefuss: One issue that comes up is how there are both too many funds and too few. There’s a lot of concentration in the industry, but we’re missing some building blocks. We don’t need the hot new thing; we don’t need smaller players chasing hot spots of the market. One example I give is with emerging markets. A lot of major EM companies have a high correlation to developed markets because they’re international. So why would you pay high fees to get exposure to a part of the market that has a high correlation to something you can get cheaply here? I can imagine a way of investing in emerging markets where you get the correlated part of the market through cheap domestic proxies, and then the rest is unbundled and purchased separately. That seems like a useful thing to have.

Heads of delegations at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. (Wikimedia Photo / Presidencia de la República Mexicana). Dozens of the country’s biggest corporations are mounting a last-ditch attempt to dissuade President Donald Trump from abandoning the Paris Agreement, a pledge to reduce carbon emissions and stem the tide of global warming. In full-page ads running in today’s New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and New York Post, 25 companies have signed an open letter detailing the economic benefits of adhering to the agreement. Those companies include Microsoft, Apple, Google, Adobe, Facebook, Intel, and Salesforce. In a related TV ad, “America’s biggest CEOs,” including the leaders of JPMorgan Chase, GE,  Johnson & Johnson, and Disney, make a similar case. Both ads claim the Paris Agreement will lead to job creation and will boost the U.S. economy. Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk is one of the CEOs named in the TV ad. An outspoken supporter of the Paris Agreement, Musk has pledged to abandon his post as an advisor to Trump if the president pulls out of the climate deal. Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2017 Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. committed to reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025. If Trump exits the Paris Agreement, the U.S. will join Syria and Nicaragua as the only non-participants. The entreaties from the business community appeal to Trump’s sense of nationalism, stressing the economic and financial benefits of remaining in the agreement while underplaying the environmental factors. “By expanding markets for innovative clean technologies, the agreement generates jobs and economic growth,” the newspaper ad says. “U.S. companies are well-positioned to lead in these markets. Withdrawing from the agreement will limit our access to them and could expose us to retaliatory measures.” Two of the world’s biggest oil producers, Exxon Mobile and ConocoPhillips, also oppose pulling out of the agreement, arguing it’s better to have a seat at the table to influence global climate policy, according to Bloomberg News. The Guardian reports EPA chief Scott Pruitt and Trump advisor Steve Bannon support an exit. Most reports say Trump is leaning toward leaving the Paris Agreement. He is expected to deliver his decision this afternoon.

(AAPL) Stock Recent Posts: 3 Reasons Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Could Catch Fire 3 Ways Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Can Go Off the Rails 3 Reasons Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Is Dangerous to Your Portfolio’s Health View All Posts Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) is proof that in the markets, a lot can happen in just a few short months. Between early October and late February, BAC stock logged an impressive 60% gain — this after about three years of essentially running in place. Source: Shutterstock Since then, however, BofA dropped by double digits, and has been stuck in neutral ever since. Bank of America isn’t suffering in a bubble, of course. The rest of the banking sector — including Big Four rivals Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) — have been cooling off, too. That caused a lot of alarm, but it’s not often that mega-banks act like fast-growing dot-coms. And besides, it was for good reason. Much of the enthusiasm over President Donald Trump’s promised financial deregulation waned as his other policies began to lag, leaving many to wonder when exactly a freer, easier environment for banks would open up. Still, that leaves investors wondering: What can we expect out of BAC stock now? Is the giant bank still a value, or is the recent flatlining a sign that investors should still be cautious. I don’t think the bull run is over, and I have three reasons why. Reason #1: Bank of America Is on Solid Footing If it wasn’t for the help of the federal government, BofA might not be around today. The company had deep exposure to toxic mortgages, thanks in large part to the disastrous Countrywide Financial acquisition. Yet Bank of America has made tremendous strides in restructuring the overall business, including deep cuts in headcount and its retail footprint. BAC also has implemented more rigorous systems to better manage risk. BofA is very different than it was 10 years ago, but don’t get the impression that it lost all of its tremendous scale. Consider that Bank of America still boasts … 47 million consumer and small business relationships About $2.6 trillion in assets Roughly 1 million high net worth clients Bank of America also has made important investments in new technologies, amounting to about $3 billion per year. The results are there, too, as the bank boasts 22.2 million mobile customers and 34.5 million active digital users. These consumers have been drawn in by innovations such as P2P payments (via the Zelle app), its artificial intelligence unit (Erica) and cardless-enabled ATMs. Reason #2: Net Interest Income Net interest income is at the heart of Bank of America’s performance. NII is calculated as the difference between the revenues of core banking services — such as providing loans — and the costs of paying interest on deposits. Historically low interest rates after the financial crisis have been a major drag on the performance of BAC stock. But the Federal Reserve has been changing its policies, engaging in more tightening. It’s difficult to predict interest rates, but some important factors should keep them on the rise. Unemployment — though it decelerated in May — is still at all-time low levels, and the Fed also wants to lessen its balance sheet. The interesting thing about the net interest income is that the fees on deposits tend to remain depressed whereas loan rates have much larger increases. The result is a nice expansion in margins.

Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council.Asked about CEOs' criticism of the U.S. withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets.Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, said he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council.A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the largest U.S. retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council.McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was "disappointed in today's news about the Paris Agreement. We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord. "IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration – as we do with governments around the world," a company spokeswoman said.Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said.Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), criticized Trump's decision, but suggested in a statement on Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group. "I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said.PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table." 'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL' Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N). GE's CEO, Jeff Immelt, is on Trump's manufacturing council.AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people."Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost U.S. economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for U.S. goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. "If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption."The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders. Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment.""If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP (BX.N). Blackrock Inc (BLK.N) Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors Co (GM.N) said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's (F.N) new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group. In February, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies.

Nonfarm payrolls increased 138,000 last month as the manufacturing, government and retail sectors lost jobs, the Labor Department said on Friday. The economy created 66,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in March and April. Last month's job gains could still be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. "While the message was a little muddied today, the evidence generally suggests the labor market is cyclically tightening, and the Fed will need to continue to lean against that," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. "We still believe it is very likely that the Fed will hike later this month. Perhaps more in question is the signal coming out of that meeting regarding subsequent hikes." Details of the employment report were weak. Though the unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to its lowest level since May 2001, that was because 429,000 people dropped out of the labor force. The survey of households from which the unemployment rate is derived also showed a drop in employment. The jobless rate has declined five-tenths of a percentage point this year. Average hourly earnings rose 4 cents or 0.2 percent in May after a similar gain in April, leaving the year-on-year increase in wages at 2.5 percent. Job growth has decelerated from the 181,000 monthly average over the past 12 months as the labor market nears full employment. There is growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find qualified workers. Economists also believe that companies might be holding off hiring amid worries political scandals engulfing President Donald Trump could imperil his economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. "Political uncertainty in Washington is another factor holding back the job market," said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo. "The probability that any of the Trump stimulus would become reality has decreased significantly in recent weeks." Economists had forecast payrolls increasing 185,000 last month and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.4 percent. The Fed raised interest rates in March. A Reuters survey of banks that do business directly with the Fed, conducted after the employment report, showed all 18 primary dealers polled expected the U.S. central bank to raise rates this month. Ten forecast further monetary policy tightening in September and only six saw a rate hike in December. The dollar hit a seven-month low against a basket of currencies on the diminishing rate hike prospects in the second half of the year. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell to nearly seven-month lows, and short-dated yields touched their lowest in more than two weeks. U.S. stocks closed at new highs.[MKTS/GLOB] SHRINKING LABOR MARKET SLACK The modest payrolls gain could temper expectations of a sharp acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter after gross domestic product increased at a tepid 1.2 percent annualized rate at the start of the year. While consumer spending picked up in April, a second report on Friday showed the trade deficit widening 5.2 percent to $47.6 billion. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increasing at a 3.4 percent pace in the second quarter. There was some good news in the employment report. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.4 percent, the lowest since November 2007. As a result, the spread between the jobless rate and this broad unemployment gauge, considered a better measure of labor market slack, was the smallest since early 2008. But the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent. The volatile 16-24 age group accounted for much of the drop in the participation rate last month, suggesting a rebound is likely. Manufacturing employment fell by 1,000 jobs last month as payrolls in the automobile sector dropped 1,500 amid declining sales. Ford Motor Co said last month it planned to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives. Construction payrolls rose 11,000 last month after decreasing by 1,000 jobs in April. Retail employment fell 6,100, declining for a fourth straight month, with department stores shedding 3,700 jobs. Department store chains like J.C. Penney Co Inc , Macy's Inc and Abercrombie & Fitch are struggling against stiff competition from online retailers led by Amazon . Nonstore retailers, including online merchants, hired 2,900 workers last month. Government employment decreased 9,000 last month, with state and local governments accounting for all the decrease.

The best credit card rewards and bonuses David Slotnick, Insider Picks Jun. 2, 2017, 2:15 PM 32,436 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. Chase/Business Insider The Insider Pick: Credit cards with good rewards programs and great sign-up bonuses make it easier than ever to rack up a lot of points and use them to travel in style. These are the best credit card rewards programs and sign-up bonuses that are available now. Last summer’s launch of the Sapphire Reserve credit card by J.P. Morgan Chase stirred up a frenzy usually reserved for the newest iPhone. Millennials and Gen X-ers jumped into the once-obscure world of credit card rewards and bonuses, drawn by Chase’s introductory offer of 100,000 bonus points if you spent $4,000 in your first three months of card membership. Now that the big bonus is gone and many of the points likely spent, what’s the next move for someone seeking to boost their stock of credit card points and frequent flyer miles? Here are some of the top credit card sign-up bonuses still available. But first, a word of warning: Credit cards play a big role in maintaining a healthy credit profile and score. Make sure you’re aware of the impact that opening a new card can have, especially if you’re planning to apply for a mortgage or finance a major purchase anytime soon. It’s also important to practice financial discipline when targeting credit card rewards — paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay is the best course of action. After all, interest and late charges can cancel out the value you get from your rewards. The Chase Sapphire Reserve card, the Chase Sapphire Preferred card, the Chase Unlimited Freedom card, the American Express Platinum card, the American Express Preferred Rewards Gold card, the Capital One Venture Rewards card, and various airline rewards credit cards offer the best rewards.  View As: One Page Slides Chase Sapphire Reserve Spencer Platt/Getty Images Why you'll love it: The Chase Sapphire Reserve Credit Card makes it easy to earn rewards for travel and more with a great sign-up bonus. Sign-up Bonus: 50,000 points (after spending $4,000 in the first three months) The huge introductory bonus might have made way for a smaller incentive, but the Chase Sapphire Reserve is still a great card to keep in your wallet. Earning three times Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent on dining and any travel, and one point per dollar on everything else, the Sapphire Reserve earns points quickly through your everyday spending, and it comes with a slew of perks.  Points are worth 1.5¢ each towards travel booked through Chase, but can also be transferred to a number of frequent flyer and hotel loyalty programs. Benefits include access to airport lounges through the Priority Pass network, trip delay coverage, purchase protection, a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck credit, and car rental primary coverage. However, while the airport lounge access can be great, most Priority Pass lounges are in international terminals, which isn't helpful when you're flying domestically. The annual fee is a hefty $450, but that’s offset by a $300 travel credit each year, good for things like taxis, subway fare, parking, tolls, and flights. There aren’t many downsides to this card. Chase has invested heavily in making the Ultimate Rewards program competitive. Booking flights by transferring points to frequent flyer partners is generally more lucrative — that’s usually how people use points to fly in first and business class — but it can be complicated because you have to decipher award charts, find availability, and work around complicated airline rules.  However, because the Sapphire Reserve allows you to get 1.5¢ for each point, if you use them to book travel through Chase’s online or phone travel agent, there’s a simpler and still-valuable option.  Pros: Solid sign-up bonus, easy to earn points, points work with frequent flier and hotel loyalty programs, good airport benefits Cons: High annual fee, Priority Pass lounges are typically in international terminals  Sign up for a Chase Sapphire Reserve Credit Card now Chase Sapphire Preferred Spencer Platt/Getty Images Why you'll love it: The Chase Sapphire Preferred Credit Card has a lower annual fee than the Reserve card and it's easy to rack up points. Sign-up Bonus: 50,000 points (after spending $4,000 in the first three months) The Reserve’s older sibling, the Sapphire Preferred offers a number of similar features and an identical sign-up bonus for a lower annual fee. The card earns 2 times the Ultimate Rewards points instead of the Reserve’s 3 times the points on dining and travel, and one times the points on everything else. Points are worth a lower 1.25¢ on travel booked through Chase, but can still be transferred to frequent flyer and hotel loyalty programs. There’s no annual travel credit, but there’s still car rental primary coverage, as well as slightly less-generous trip delay coverage and purchase protection. The annual fee is a more manageable $95, which is waived the first year. The Sapphire Preferred was the all-around best card for a long time, but the Reserve has changed the landscape. The Preferred earns fewer points on bonus spending categories than the Reserve, and the value of the points on travel booked through Chase is less. The no-hassle travel credit on the Reserve makes the annual fee on that card effectively $150 (accounting for the $300 you get back through the credit), so — depending on your spending habits — it can be worth paying more up front for the Reserve. Pros: Good sign-up bonus, transferable points, travel perks, lower annual fee than Sapphire Reserve card Cons: Lower point value, no annual travel credit, no as good as Sapphire Reserve Sign up for a Chase Sapphire Preferred Credit Card now  Chase Freedom Unlimited John Gress/Reuters Why you'll love it: The Chase Unlimited Freedom Credit Card helps you earn points for normal purchases and get cash back with no annual fee. Sign-up Bonus: 15,000 points/$150 (after spending $500 in the first three months) If you already have the Sapphire Reserve and are saving your points for something, the Freedom Unlimited can give your balance a nice boost. While Chase markets the card as “cash back,” it actually earns Ultimate Rewards points that you can redeem for cash (1 point = 1¢).  If you have a premium card like the Sapphire Reserve, you can pool your points from the two cards. The Freedom Unlimited earns 1.5 points per dollar spent, so paired with a Sapphire Reserve, it’s a great card to use for purchases that aren’t made on travel expenses or dining.  Best of all, the card has no annual fee and often has zero percent APR for the first 15 months on purchases and balance transfers. The Chase Freedom Unlimited is a fantastic all-around card. However, to get the most value when it’s time to spend your points, you need the Sapphire Reserve or Preferred card, too, so you can pool your points. Otherwise, points are only worth 1¢ each no matter how you use them and they can’t be transferred to airline or hotel partners. Pros: Decent sign-up bonus, earn points on regular purchases, no annual fee, zero percent APR for first 15 months Cons: One point only equals one cent for cash back Sign up for a Chase Unlimited Freedom Credit Card now American Express Platinum Mario Tama/Getty Images Why you'll love it: The American Express Platinum Rewards Credit Card offers a big sign-up bonus and lots of perks for travelers. Sign-up Bonus: 60,000 points (after spending $5,000 in the first three months) American Express has made some big moves recently in the credit cards rewards war. The company fired shots at Chase by upping its standard sign-up bonus offer. Previously, it was only 40,000 points, and now it's 60,000. AmEx is also offering 5 times the Membership Rewards points per dollar spent on airfare directly with airlines and a monthly $15 credit on Uber, which was boosted to $35 in December. Like Chase Ultimate Rewards points, American Express Membership Rewards points can be used to purchase travel, gift cards, or products directly through from the issuer, or they can be transferred to certain airline and hotel loyalty programs. The card includes access to the same lounges as the Sapphire Reserve, plus Delta SkyClubs and the proprietary American Express Centurion Lounges. It carries a number of perks similar to its rival from Chase, including purchase protections and a $200 annual credit on incidental airline fees — think checked bags, drinks, and upgrades. Cardholders also qualify for elite status with Hilton and Starwood hotels. That can help you stomach the $550 annual fee. However, $550 is a lot to pay out each year. The $200 airline fee credit and $200 Uber credit certainly help, but the airline credit can be difficult to use if you aren’t checking bags or buying drinks on flights. Some people have found that buying gift cards from the airline of your choice counts as a qualifying purchase. The bonus spending categories on this card are less generous than on the Sapphire Reserve, meaning it can take longer to earn points unless you book a lot of flights. The spending requirement in the first three months is higher than most other cards, and Membership Reward points are worth less than Chase’s Ultimate Rewards points when used to book travel through the card issuer — only 1¢ per point. Pros: High sign-up points bonus, perks at airlines, points can go toward purchases, points are transferable to airline and hotel rewards programs Cons: High $550 annual fee, only 1¢ per point, high spending requirement, less generous than Chase Sapphire Reserve Sign up for an American Express Platinum Rewards Credit Card now American Express Preferred Rewards Gold Glassdoor Why you'll love it: The American Express Preferred Rewards Gold Credit Card has a lower annual fee and you can easily earn points on travel and other purchases. Sign-up Bonus: 25,000 points (after spending $2,000 in the first three months) If the high annual fee turns you away from the Platinum card, you may want to consider the Preferred Rewards Gold card instead. While it comes with fewer perks, it still offers a $100 annual credit on incidental airline fees, and earns three times points on airfare, two times points on groceries, restaurants and gas stations, and one times the points on everything else. There are a few other benefits as well, including purchase protection and baggage insurance. While the card carries a $195 annual fee, it’s waived for your first year. Note that it’s often possible to find a higher sign-up bonus offer simply by visiting the American Express website. However, it's worth noting that for a card with a $195 annual fee, you would expect a higher standard sign-up bonus like the ones Chase offers. The bonus spending categories overlap heavily with the Chase Sapphire Preferred and Reserve cards, but with a higher annual fee. If you can maximize the airline credit, the fee is effectively the same as the Sapphire Preferred, but points are only worth 1¢ each on travel booked through American Express, while the Preferred card’s Ultimate Rewards points are worth more on travel booked through Chase. Pros: Easy to earn points, good for travelers, airline perks Cons: $195 annual fee, smaller sign-up bonus, only 1¢ per point Sign up for an American Express Preferred Rewards Gold Credit Card now Capital One Venture Rewards REUTERS/ Brendan McDermid Why you'll love it: The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card has a low annual fee and makes it easy to earn points for travel. Sign-up Bonus: 40,000 miles (after spending $3,000 in the first three months) Capital One’s travel rewards program isn’t necessarily as lucrative as what other banks offer. The points can’t be transferred to hotel or airline partners, and they’re worth a fixed value of 1¢ each. The flip side, though, is that they’re easy to earn and easy to use. The Venture Rewards card earns two times the miles per dollar on all purchases. The points can be redeemed as a statement credit to “erase” travel purchases. For example, if you buy a $400 plane ticket, you can apply 40,000 points to cancel out that charge. The annual fee of $59 is waived the first year. However, you won’t find outsized value with Capital One’s travel rewards, since you don’t even get the option to transfer miles to a hotel or frequent flyer program. Each mile is worth 1¢, and that’s that. On the other hand, that means there’s no ambiguity or confusion when it’s time to spend your miles. Pros: Low annual fee, easy to earn points, decent sign-up bonus Cons: Points are non-transferable, only 1¢ per point Sign up for a Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card now Airline Rewards Programs United Why you'll love it: Airlines often have decent rewards programs through major credit card providers that will help you travel more. Sign-up Bonus: Varies If you often travel with the same airline or live in a major hub city, you might want to consider signing up for a co-branded airline credit card. American Express issues Delta’s credit cards, Citibank offers American’s, and Chase partners with United. Sign-up bonuses often vary through the year, but they generally fall between 30,000 and 60,000 miles after spending $3,000 in the first three months. Perks vary by card and are often valuable even if you only fly a few times a year, generally including a form of early boarding, free checked bags, and extra miles earned on purchases from that airline. While each airline offers a few cards, the most popular ones tend to come with annual fees of $95, which are waived the first year. However, with these cards, there’s no option to redeem your miles for cash or book travel hassle-free. Nor is there an option to choose which frequent flyer program offers the most value and flexibility for the trip you’re planning. Instead, you’re stuck booking travel with one airline and dealing with whatever restrictions it might impose. If the airline chooses to devalue their frequent flyer program or raise costs for a particular type of award flight, you’re stuck. The upside comes mainly with the perks like the free checked bag, and the fact that with a little bit of work, it can be possible to get an incredible value for your miles by booking an unforgettable trip in first or business class.

Pros: Airlines offer good deals, travel perks, low annual fees Cons: There's still an annual fee, you're stuck with that airline and have less flexibility If you want to see more from Insider Picks, we're collecting emails for an upcoming newsletter.

By David Shepardson and Susan Heavey WASHINGTON — Reuters Published Friday, Jun. 02, 2017 1:59PM EDT Last updated Friday, Jun. 02, 2017 6:48PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Several major U.S. companies, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>, JP Morgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> and IBM Corp <IBM.N>, on Friday said their CEOs will remain in an influential presidential advisory group despite objecting to President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. Citing the need to stay engaged with the administration, business leaders said they would remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies. Trump, a Republican, on Thursday said he would pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. Tesla Inc <TSLA.O> Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co <DIS.N> CEO Robert Iger reacted by leaving White House advisory councils after Trump's move. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Asked about CEOs' criticism of the U.S. withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets. Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, added he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council. A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>, the largest U.S. retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council. McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was "disappointed in today's news about the Paris Agreement. We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions." IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord. "IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration – as we do with governments around the world," a company spokeswoman said. Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said. Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N>, criticized Trump's decision. The company acknowledged Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group. "I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said in a statement. PepsiCo Inc <PEP.N> Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table." 'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL' Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc <FB.O>, Alphabet Inc <GOOGL.O> and Goldman Sachs <GS.N>. General Electric Co <GE.N> CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump's manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added: "Industry must now lead and not depend on government." Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people." Boeing Co <BA.N> Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said. Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost U.S. economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for U.S. goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. "If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption." The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders. Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment." "If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP <BX.N>. Blackrock Inc <BLK.N> Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors Co <GM.N> said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's <F.N> new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group. In February, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies.

Google, GE, Apple, Dozens Of Other Companies Denounce Withdrawal From Paris Climate Accord Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Google, GE, Apple, Dozens Of Other Companies Denounce Withdrawal From Paris Climate Accord Image courtesy of James LeVeque June 2, 2017 2:01 pm EDT By Kate Cox@kcoxdc money is green climate change capitalism sustainability The biggest news of the week, so far, has been President Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the landmark Paris Agreement. And while politicians’ support or condemnation of the withdrawal is predictably split along party lines, one surprising consensus has emerged: The business world, including the corporations that run basically everything, really wish we would stay in. The decision, which Trump announced in a Rose Garden speech yesterday, starts the several-year process for taking the U.S. out of the international agreement, also called the Paris Climate Accord. The agreement was finalized in Paris (hence the name) in 2015. 195 nations — basically, the entire world save two — have signed on to the non-binding accord, agreeing to take voluntary steps to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change. NPR has a full, easy-to-read explainer of the terms the nations all agreed to. Basically, it’s a voluntary pledge to do something by 2020, and then work toward a global goal of zero greenhouse gas emissions by some vague “mid-century” date. However, the President decided the U.S. should not remain in the planet-wide agreement. “As of today,” he said in his speech yesterday, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.” The D.C. rumor mill had signaled for a while that this withdrawal was probably coming, and so businesses began to stake out their positions ahead of the formal speech. Earlier in May, the CEOs for 30 major corporations signed an open letter all but begging the administration to leave well enough alone. Why? Not out of any deep moral sentiment; business is business. Instead, staying in the agreement, they argue, is what’s best for capitalism. “Based on our vast experience doing business all over the world,” the CEOs write, “we believe there is strong potential for negative trade implications if the United States exits from the Paris Agreement.” “Our business interests are best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced response to reducing global GHG emissions. The Paris Agreement gives us that flexible framework to manage climate change while providing a smooth transition for business.” The letter wasn’t signed by a bunch of startups and newbies, but rather by the biggest names in banking, manufacturing, media, and agriculture including: 3M, Dow Chemical, Bank of America, Procter & Gamble, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Johnson & Johnson, Tesla, Coca-Cola, JP Morgan Chase, Unilever, Morgan Stanley, and Disney, among others. After the announcement was made, several CEOs voiced their disappointment and vowed that their businesses would continue to act believing that climate change is a real threat. Several took to Twitter to voice their displeasure. General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt Tweeted, “Disappointed with today’s decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government.” Disappointed with today’s decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government. — Jeff Immelt (@JeffImmelt) June 1, 2017 He was joined by Tesla’s Elon Musk, who Tweeted that the withdrawal was enough to make him resign from Presidential advisory councils he sits on. Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 “Climate change is real,” Musk said. “Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.” Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein made his first-ever Tweet yesterday, and used it to voice disappointment with the administration’s choice: “Today’s decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.’s leadership position in the world,” he Tweeted. Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreement — Lloyd Blankfein (@lloydblankfein) June 1, 2017 The major players in the tech world also nearly universally condemned the choice. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, like many others, took to Twitter to make a statement, saying, “Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all.” Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all. — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) June 1, 2017 Microsoft’s Brad Smith said nearly the same, also on Twitter, saying, “We’re disappointed with the decision to exit the Paris Agreement. Microsoft remains committed to doing our part to achieve its goals.” We’re disappointed with the decision to exit the Paris Agreement. Microsoft remains committed to doing our part to achieve its goals. — Brad Smith (@BradSmi) June 1, 2017 Amazon joined the fray in a four-part Tweetstorm from the company’s official news account saying, “Amazon continues to support the Paris climate agreement and action on climate change. We believe that robust clean energy and climate policies can support American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth.” Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, of course, posted his statement on Facebook, for obvious reasons. “Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children’s future at risk,” Zuck posted. “Stopping climate change is something we can only do as a global community, and we have to act together before it’s too late.” Apple CEO Tim Cook was even more blunt in a company-wide email to employees. “I know many of you share my disappointment with the White House’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement,” Cook wrote. After outlining steps Apple is currently taking toward sustainability, Cook concluded, “Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it. … Our mission has always been to leave the world better than we found it. We will never waver, because we know that future generations depend on us.” And lest you think it’s just the new, modern vanguard of tech businesses objecting, those CEOs were joined by stalwarts Dow Chemical, Shell Oil, and Exxon Mobil — none of which exactly enjoy public reputations for environmental friendliness. But for public-facing condemnation, the most visible has been The Weather Channel. Although the cable network itself is still owned by a consortium of NBCUniversal and investment groups, since 2016 its website, Weather.com, has been owned by IBM. And that website has been basically as scathing as it is possible for website layout to be. While the formal announcement was taking place yesterday, this was how it looked: And it hasn’t eased up today.

Apple announced developers have earned over $70 billion since the App Store went live in 2008. Taking the tech giant's 70/30 revenue split into account, that means customers have spent over $100 billion in App Store purchases. Apple didn't stop with an earnings number boast as it also revealed App Store downloads grew by over 70% in the past 12 months, and active paid subscriptions are up 58% since the same time last year.

The Wall Street Journal.3:51 UP NEXT As oil prices sag despite OPEC’s renewed efforts to shore up world crude markets, Wall Street banks have more bad news for the producer group: the outlook for next year isn’t great either. Quotes in the article Morgan Stanley MS ▼ 42.52 -0.09 -0.21% Goldman Sachs Group Inc GSPRA ▲ 23.72 +0.20 +0.85% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 82.64 -0.42 -0.51% Citigroup Inc C ▲ 61.11 +0.03 +0.05% AdChoices Oil futures have lost 8 percent since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies agreed on May 25 to keep output constrained through the first quarter of 2018 in a bid to clear a global glut. While Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects their strategy to ultimately succeed, they warn the surplus may re-appear once the curbs end. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. say the group will have little choice but to stick with the cuts even longer. Resurgent supplies from U.S. shale drillers and fading growth in fuel demand mean that world oil markets could face another overhang next year, the banks predict. That means Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two biggest producers in the 24-nation coalition, may need to deliver on their promise to do “whatever it takes” to restore equilibrium. “If OPEC wants to keep the market balanced next year, they will probably need to extend the production cut to all of 2018,” Martijn Rats, managing director at Morgan Stanley in London, said by email. “Demand growth has slowed somewhat recently, and with U.S. production growing strongly, there doesn’t seem to be much room for OPEC production to grow in 2018.” Slow Recovery Production cuts are taking longer than expected to eliminate the surplus as U.S. shale drillers boost production with surprising speed. American oil explorers, having learned to operate more efficiently during a two-year market slump, have restored almost all the output lost during the downturn. As a result, the market may be unable to absorb the return of production halted by OPEC and its partners when their pact ends in April.© Bloomberg/Bloomberg OPEC Has a 2018 Problem “The market isn’t able to see how OPEC exits production cuts without creating huge surpluses in 2018,” said Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs in New York. “We see risks for a renewed surplus later next year if OPEC and Russia’s production rises to their expanded capacity and shale grows at an unbridled rate.” Still, even if a surplus re-emerges in 2018, OPEC’s current efforts to deplete stockpiles will make their task of managing it easier, according to Citigroup Inc. While shale’s recovery means next year’s supply situation “looks weighty,” OPEC’s output cuts now mean that if inventories accumulate again, it would be from a lower level, said Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup in New York. Those increases in inventories may nonetheless prove substantial enough to prevent prices gaining, said David Martin, an analyst at JPMorgan, who slashed his 2018 forecast for Brent crude by $10 a barrel to $45 on May 25. Brent traded near $49 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London on Friday. Even if OPEC extends their output accord for all of next year, it may only succeed in stopping further stockpile increases, he said. “OPEC may be shackled to its deal for a long time,” said Martin.

That’s what First Federal Lakewood, a $1.7 billion-asset mutual in Ohio, is doing. Recently, First Federal was one of the founders of an Ohio-based fintech accelerator. It’s also invested in Numerated Growth Technologies — a commercial lending technology that lets banks make lending decisions in as little as five minutes. It was created by Eastern Labs, the innovation unit of the Boston mutual Eastern Bank, and spun out recently. While each project has its specific draw, they both speak to a common motivation: the opportunity for First Federal to punch above its weight by collaborating on technology. “We have to be open-minded" about pursuing technology "so we can make sure we can continue to deliver a great experience our customers,” said Thomas Fraser, First Federal's president and CEO. “Why can’t a group of 10 community banks figure out how to make investments in an innovative platform down the road?” he said. “Or a group of banks being part of a development fund to steer a variety of tech initiatives?” Prime spot "Having a seat at the table and access to fintech solutions is certainly a benefit to us," says Thomas Fraser, president and CEO of First Federal Lakewood, about its decision to team up with larger banks on a startup accelerator. Indeed, increased collaboration among community banks is a “logical next step” in the advancement of technology in the industry, said Christine Barry, senior analyst with Aite Group. “You see this more commonly in the credit union industry, with things like a shared branch network and shared technology,” she said. “It makes perfect sense for community banks, and I’m surprised they haven’t been doing it sooner.” Barry expects to see more cooperation between community banks as a strategy to compete against larger banks. “It’s kind of an us-against-them mentality,” she said. With the accelerator, First Federal is teaming up with larger banks. Its partners in the accelerator include Fifth Third Bancorp, Huntington Bancshares, KeyCorp and the insurer Progressive. JPMorgan Chase and Silicon Valley Bank are also part of the initiative. Fraser said the bank’s participation in the fintech accelerator is in part to help spur economic growth in the state and is “part of our role as a bank in fostering local communities economically.” Still, it is a prime chance to give fintechs a place to test their technology with an eye toward bringing it formally into the bank. “Having a seat at the table and access to fintech solutions is certainly a benefit to us,” Fraser said. “For ideas that fit into our business model, we can be in a position to deploy those solutions rapidly.” Fraser says regulators are becoming more open to collaboration between banks and “looking at how we can use existing rules to help banks work together.” Community banks should be at the forefront, Fraser said. “Look at what some of the larger banks are doing with Zelle,” he said. “There’s no reason why smaller banks can’t band together. Forty years ago, the payments system was built by banks in regional areas on a small scale, and then connected by nodes over time. The lesson from the past is banks can work together on innovation.” The investment in Numerated was another chance for First Federal to improve its offerings. “We saw great value in the technology, how they were using the data to deliver credit decisions,” Fraser said. “And we liked that they also had mutual-bank roots.” Fraser said First Federal was familiar with Eastern Bank, as executives from the two institutions would see each other "at various industry events. We had a good networking relationship.” After realizing how well the Numerated technology was working at Eastern, First Federal decided to become an investor when Eastern spun it out and licensed the technology for its own use. Fraser said the technology will help the bank compete against the customer experience offered by “the high-priced, nonbank solutions.” While First Federal’s moves will certainly give it a front row to some shiny new innovations, Fraser said the bank will stay focused on products that stand to benefit its core services. “Small-business lending is a big area for us, and we want those customers to have a great experience,” he said. “We look for what is a good cultural fit.” Areas the bank is considering for tech investment and partnership in the future include payments and mortgage lending, Fraser said. Expect other community bankers to go down the tech path together, says Frank Sorrentino, CEO of ConnectOne Bank in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., another tech-savvy community bank. (Sorrentino, however, declined to say what collaborations ConnectOne has in the works.) “You’re going to continue to see a pooling of resources" as community banks share the cost of technology, he said. “Or you’ll see a series of community banks come together with a technology partner to solve a particular issue.” Article The mortgage search goes digital Search habits and online lenders are forcing loan officers to step up their digital game to compete.

Oil futures have lost 8 per cent since the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies agreed on May 25 to keep output constrained through the first quarter of 2018 in a bid to clear a global glut. While Goldman Sachs Group Inc expects their strategy to ultimately succeed, they warn the surplus may re-appear once the curbs end. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. say the group will have little choice but to stick with the cuts even longer. Resurgent supplies from US shale drillers and fading growth in fuel demand mean that world oil markets could face another overhang next year, the banks predict. That means Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two biggest producers in the 24-nation coalition, may need to deliver on their promise to do “whatever it takes” to restore equilibrium. “If Opec wants to keep the market balanced next year, they will probably need to extend the production cut to all of 2018,” Martijn Rats, managing director at Morgan Stanley in London, said by email. “Demand growth has slowed somewhat recently, and with US production growing strongly, there doesn’t seem to be much room for Opec production to grow in 2018.” Slow Recovery Production cuts are taking longer than expected to eliminate the surplus as US shale drillers boost production with surprising speed. American oil explorers, having learnt to operate more efficiently during a two-year market slump, have restored almost all the output lost during the downturn. As a result, the market may be unable to absorb the return of production halted by Opec and its partners when their pact ends in April. “The market isn’t able to see how Opec exits production cuts without creating huge surpluses in 2018,” said Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs in New York. “We see risks for a renewed surplus later next year if Opec and Russia’s production rises to their expanded capacity and shale grows at an unbridled rate.” Still, even if a surplus re-emerges in 2018, Opec’s current efforts to deplete stockpiles will make their task of managing it easier, according to Citigroup Inc. While shale’s recovery means next year’s supply situation “looks weighty,” Opec’s output cuts now mean that if inventories accumulate again, it would be from a lower level, said Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup in New York. Those increases in inventories may nonetheless prove substantial enough to prevent prices gaining, said David Martin, an analyst at JPMorgan, who slashed his 2018 forecast for Brent crude by $10 a barrel to $45 on May 25. Brent traded near $49 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London on Friday. Even if Opec extends their output accord for all of next year, it may only succeed in stopping further stockpile increases, he said. “Opec may be shackled to its deal for a long time,” said Martin.

The ribbon cutting at the project's centerpiece urban village is a milestone for one of North Texas' most ambitious real estate endeavors. "This project took an army to develop," said Legacy West's Fehmi Karahan. "A project like this one has consumed me - night and day, seven days a week for about three years." Developed by Karahan, KDC and Columbus Realty Partners, Legacy West is located on the Dallas North Tollway and State Highway 121. Dallas' Sam Moon family switches orbits, from handbags to a Legacy West hotel in Plano The project was built on 250 acres of surplus land surrounding retailer J.C. Penney's headquarters. This weekend's celebration is to debut the Legacy West Urban Village, which has more than 300,000 square feet of shops and restaurants, about 300,000 square feet of office space, more than 1,000 apartments and a high-rise hotel. The retail and restaurant center and most of the office space is already rented.

Legacy West's retailers include Bonobos, Coach, Fabletics, Filson, Johnny Was, Peter Millar, Pockets Menswear, Suitsupply, Tesla, Tommy Bahama, TUMI, and West Elm. "You can make great projects, but if you don't lease it doesn't work," Karahan said. "On the office leasing, we've been attracting some of the best names in the country." Aerospace giant Boeing recently announced plans to locate a new division headquarters in the Legacy West Urban Village. And Toyota has just started moving the first of thousands of workers into its new North American headquarters located just up the street. Liberty Mutual Insurance and JPMorgan Chase will start moving thousands more employees into Legacy West late this year. Plano's Legacy West adds Madewell, J. Crew, M.A.C and Levi's to store lineup More than 20,000 people will soon work in the development. "Welcome to the center of the universe," said Plano's mayor Harry LaRosiliere. "What makes this special is the sense of place created. "Anybody can build strip shopping centers," LaRosiliere said. "Only Fehmi Karahan can building Legacy West." Karahan developed Legacy West after having great success with the Shops at Legacy retail center he built on the east side of the tollway at Legacy Drive. "I had this dream to someday build something across the street," Karahan said. After petitioning Penney for years to develop its vacant land, the team of Karahan Cos., KDC and Columbus Realty were picked from a field of competing developers in early 2014. Just three months later in April of 2014 Toyota stunned the market when it announced it would build its new headquarters in Legacy West - joining FedEx Office as the first major companies in the mixed-use project. After Toyota's announcement, Legacy West took off. What was supposed to be a 10-year project is almost out of land and is recognized as one of the most successful such projects in the country. Plano's Legacy West celebrates grand opening with free bites and more delights "I'm proud to be involved in the partnership building this project," said Roger Staubach, the former Dallas Cowboys' star quarterback and a partner in Legacy West's apartments. "Legacy West is going to be outstanding. "People who live in the apartments are going to be able to walk to the finest retail experience in the Dallas area." Designed by architect Gensler, the $400 million Legacy West Urban Village was financed by JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Invesco Real Estate is a financial partner in the development. This weekend's grand opening events for the Legacy West Urban Village include live entertainment and drink tastings. Some of the retailers will be offering store discounts. Legacy West Urban Village includes more than 300,000 square feet of shops and restaurants and hundreds of new apartments.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad British shares near records on week before general election By Reuters Published: 12:59 EDT, 2 June 2017 | Updated: 12:59 EDT, 2 June 2017 e-mail By Helen Reid and Danilo Masoni LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - British shares climbed to fresh all-time peaks on Friday but pared most of their gains following disappointing jobs growth data in the U.S. that weighed on global equities. The FTSE 100 index of top UK blue chips rose 0.05 percent, off a peak of 7,598.99 points hit earlier in the day, while the domestically focused mid cap FTSE 250 index inched down 0.04 percent, reversing earlier gains. Britain holds a general election next Thursday that is likely to have an impact on how the country tackles talks on its exit from the European Union. "Clearly the upcoming election is a short term focus for the market, but the UK market is very international in its make-up ... and therefore insulated from domestic politics," said JPMorgan portfolio manager James Illsley. "As we have seen through the referendum last year, sterling will act as a natural shock absorber for the market - if the domestic outlook weakens or the political landscape becomes more challenged, sterling weakens thereby boosting the sterling value of those overseas earnings to domestic investors," he added. Some opinion polls point to a tighter-than-expected race, with the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Theresa May seeing its lead over the opposition Labour party dwindling. Consumer staples were the biggest boost to the FTSE, adding 10 points to the index with British American Tobacco and Unilever both up more than 1 percent. While the broader market was weighed down by the lackluster U.S. jobs data, gold prices rose near a six-week peak as the figures lowered expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year. That in turn boosted shares in precious metal miners Randgold and Fresnillo to the top of the FTSE with gains of 4 and 3.8 percent respectively. Energy stocks, however, weighed with oil major BP down 1.5 percent as Brent crude tumbled on worries that U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to abandon a climate pact could spark more crude drilling, worsening a global glut. Acacia Mining was a top mid-cap gainer, up 2.1 percent, after it maintained its full-year production guidance. The stock has lost a third of its value after a Tanzanian government investigation report found last month that the miner had under-declared precious metals in its exports. An upgrade to 'outperform' from Credit Suisse boosted Kaz Minerals by 1.3 percent. "Debt levels are high but, given the strong operational performance, new debt facilities raised, reduced project capex and the around $1.1 billion cash buffer, we see limited risk of a funding gap," said analysts at the Swiss bank. But B&amp;M European Value Retail fell 2.5 percent after major shareholders SSA Investments and CD&amp;R sold a combined 12.5 percent of the company.

Phil Mesman and his colleagues at Picton Mahoney Asset Management have been scooping up subordinated debt issued by the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Plc, and Credit Agricole SA in the 1980s and 1990s that is trading at a discount to face value. The goal is to get repaid early at a premium to the current price. This strategy, which began almost two years ago with a spreadsheet plotting the rather tiny universe of the asset class, has handed the firm’s funds returns of more than 20 percent, Mesman said. These legacy hybrid capital notes were originally issued to convert to equity in the event of a bank failure. They trade at a discount primarily because of the low coupon, which is based on a spread over the London interbank offered rate, and uncertainty around whether or not they will be repaid early, Mesman said. The bonds, which also have a liquidity discount, have a maturity of 25 years or longer in most cases, and some are perpetual bonds, he said. The bond covenants and structures are good for investors, because they make it difficult for a bank to convert the bonds to equity in the event it needs to shore up capital levels. Regulators have said that banks need to take out the bonds before Jan. 1, 2022, Mesman said, putting a deadline on opportunities in the trade. “It’s an incredible risk-reward,” Mesman, senior partner and portfolio manager, said by phone from Toronto. He manages more than C$700 million ($518 million) in fixed income of Picton’s C$6.8 billion of assets. “Typically they would be rated BB or higher-quality high-yield instruments, but the bank issuers are all investment grade.” Stamp Collecting Mesman estimates that his firm is one of only a few players in the $5 billion to $7 billion market, with most of the investors and dealers concentrated in Europe. The bonds represent about 30 percent of both Picton Mahoney’s main fund, the Fortified Income Fund, and the Income Opportunities Fund, as well as about 50 percent of the firm’s special-situations fund, he said. It’s a strategy that can only be pursued by knowledgeable investors who have flexibility with their investment horizon and don’t have to follow an index, Roger Francis, a credit analyst at Mizuho International Plc in London, said by phone. He said he’s heard the strategy compared to stamp collecting. “They’re rare and you find them in the back of drawers,” he said. “It’s a relatively small asset class.” The main risks with these old bank bonds is liquidity -- they’re difficult to trade in tough market conditions -- and that a bank will opt not to call or tender for them early, Francis said. The strategy hinges on correctly identifying which bonds are candidates to be repaid early, or which banks might be willing to negotiate, Mesman said. Direct Approach “If we find a bond where perhaps 50 percent to 60 percent of the issue has already been tendered over the years, then we’ll approach them directly and offer them our bonds at a certain price,” he said. Credit Agricole recently tendered for 371.23 million euros of a perpetual bond at 78 cents on the euro, but investors only took them up on part of the offer, suggesting that they’re waiting for a higher payout, Mesman said. His firm sold 25 percent of their 25 million euro position in the bond and are waiting for a higher price for the rest, he said. To be sure, there has been some headline uncertainty with some banks in Europe, Mesman said. Deutsche Bank AG, UniCredit SpA, and other European banks have in the past been at risk of not paying the coupons on their bonds. While failure to pay interest would be tantamount to default for most debt securities, coupon payments on newer contingent convertible bonds, known as CoCos, are discretionary. Once missed, though, they are gone forever. With their strategy, Mesman and colleagues focus on buying older notes generally from U.K. and U.S. banks. They also hedge using tools including bank stock and currencies, he said. The bonds generally pay in U.S. dollars. “We’re looking for situations where they’re taking them out sooner, ideally within the next 12 months,” he said. This article was provided by Bloomberg News.

Photos Videos Topics Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News Business News WRAPUP 4-U.S. job growth slows; unemployment rate drops to 4.3 percent Shares0 Fri, 2 Jun 2017-10:09pm , Reuters U.S. job growth slowed in May and employment gains in the prior two months were not as strong as previously reported, suggesting the labor market was losing momentum despite the unemployment rate falling to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent. Nonfarm payrolls increased 138,000 last month as the manufacturing, government and retail sectors lost jobs, the Labor Department said on Friday. The economy created 66,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in March and April. Last month's job gains could still be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. "While the message was a little muddied today, the evidence generally suggests the labor market is cyclically tightening, and the Fed will need to continue to lean against that," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. "We still believe it is very likely that the Fed will hike later this month. Perhaps more in question is the signal coming out of that meeting regarding subsequent hikes." Details of the employment report were weak. Though the unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to its lowest level since May 2001, that was because 429,000 people dropped out of the labor force. The survey of households from which the unemployment rate is derived also showed a drop in employment. The jobless rate has declined five-tenths of a percentage point this year. Average hourly earnings rose four cents or 0.2 percent in May after a similar gain in April, leaving the year-on-year increase in wages at 2.5 percent. Job growth has decelerated from the 181,000 monthly average over the past 12 months as the labor market nears full employment. There is growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find qualified workers. Economists also believe that companies might be holding off hiring amid worries political scandals engulfing President Donald Trump could imperil his economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. "Political uncertainty in Washington is another factor holding back the job market," said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo. "The probability that any of the Trump stimulus would become reality has decreased significantly in recent weeks." Economists had forecast payrolls increasing by 185,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.4 percent. U.S. financial markets are almost pricing in a 25 basis point increase in the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate this month, according to CME FedWatch. The dollar fell to seven-month lows on views the jobs data could portend diminished chances for a Fed rate hike in the second half of the year. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell to nearly seven-month lows, and short-dated yields touched their lowest in more than two weeks, but U.S. stocks edged up to new highs.. SHRINKING LABOR MARKET SLACK The modest payrolls gain could temper expectations of a sharp acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter after gross domestic product increased at a tepid 1.2 percent annualized rate at the start of the year. While consumer spending picked up in April, a second report on Friday showed the trade deficit widening 5.2 percent to $47.6 billion. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increasing at a 3.4 percent pace in the second quarter. There was some good news in the employment report. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.4 percent, the lowest since November 2007. As a result, the spread between the jobless rate and this broad unemployment gauge, considered a better measure of labor market slack, was the smallest since early 2008. But the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent. The volatile 16-24 age group accounted for much of the drop in the participation rate last month, suggesting a rebound is likely. Manufacturing employment fell by 1,000 jobs last month as payrolls in the automobile sector dropped 1,500 amid declining sales. Ford Motor Co said last month it planned to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives. Construction payrolls rose 11,000 last month after decreasing by 1,000 jobs in April. Retail employment fell 6,100, declining for a fourth straight month, with department stores shedding 3,700 jobs. Department store chains like J.C. Penney Co Inc, Macy's Inc and Abercrombie & Fitch are struggling against stiff competition from online retailers led by Amazon .

No pricing details were given in the filing, but the offering is valued up to $75 million. The company intends to list its shares on the Nasdaq under the symbol MRSN. The underwriters for the offering are JPMorgan, Cowen, Leerink Partners and Wedbush PacGrow. This clinical stage biopharmaceutical company is focused on developing antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) that offer a clinically meaningful benefit for cancer patients with significant unmet need. Mersana has leveraged 20 years of industry learning in the ADC field to develop proprietary technologies that enable it to design ADCs to have improved efficacy, safety and tolerability relative to existing ADC therapies. Its most advanced platform, Dolaflexin, has been used to generate a pipeline of proprietary ADC product candidates to address patient populations that are not currently amenable to treatment with traditional ADC-based therapies. The lead product candidate, XMT-1522, is a HER2-targeted ADC currently in a Phase 1 dose escalation study in primarily breast cancer patients, with interim safety results expected by the end of 2017. Upon the completion of dose escalation, Mersana plans to expand clinical development of XMT-1522 into additional breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and gastric cancer patient populations, all of which are not addressed by existing HER2 therapies. The second product candidate, XMT-1536, is an ADC targeting NaPi2b, an antigen broadly expressed in ovarian cancer and NSCLC. The firm expects XMT-1536 to enter clinical development in early 2018. Its current product candidates, all based on the Dolaflexin platform. Mersana intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for: Phase 1 clinical trial of XMT-1522 Preclinical activities and Phase 1 clinical trial of XMT-1536 New and ongoing research activities The remainder of the net proceeds will be put toward working capital and other general corporate purposes.

Climate pact pull-out suggests ‘America Alone’ 2 Jun 2017 Companies JPMorgan’s Dimon says he disagrees on Paris accord exit 2 Jun 2017 US President Donald Trump insisted withdrawing the country from the Paris climate accord would stave off an economic crisis and protect American jobs – but plenty of American companies seemed to disagree. Criticism of his decision rolled in from blue-chip firms while the response from fossil fuel groups was muted. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils. “Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk wrote on Twitter. Trump pulls US out of climate pact: is China set to lead? Iger followed suit, saying he was resigning from the panels “as a matter of principle.” Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, also disagreed with Trump’s decision. “I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people’s lives and protect our environment,” Dimon said in a statement. Other business leaders were even more emphatic in their criticism of the decision. “Today’s decision is a setback for the environment and for the US’s leadership position in the world,” said Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein. General Electric’s Jeff Immelt tweeted: “Disappointed with today’s decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead.” Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote: “Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet” and “Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver”. Catastrophic climate change is more likely, Donald Trump has just made sure of that There is a pathway here where the rest of America in reaction to, really, what is an insane decision by President Trump, takes the kind of steps needed California Governor Jerry Brown Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted: “Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children’s future at risk.” Meanwhile, the president of the World Coal Association, Benjamin Sporton, offered an opaque response. “What we really need to see, if the president wants to re-enter the deal, is that he can change the agreement to recognise the role of all sources of energy, including coal,” Sporton said, adding his group had outlined to administration officials the benefits of remaining in the agreement. Within hours of Trump announcing his decision, a coalition emerged of state governors and city mayors who declared they would adhere to the Paris agreement, even if the White House would not. “There is a pathway here where the rest of America in reaction to, really, what is an insane decision by President Trump, takes the kind of steps needed,” said California Governor Jerry Brown, who was joined by the governors of Washington and New York, who also called for a “climate alliance”. Brown was on his way to China overnight, and planned to lead a conference of states and other “sub-national” actors making voluntary commitments to cut greenhouse grasses. Brown said he would also explore the possibility of integrating California and Chinese provincial carbon trading systems. That would be a “heavy lift” Brown said, but “I am going to discuss that with the highest officials in China this week”.

Bosses from the likes of American banking giants Citigroup and JP Morgan - along with Russia's VTB and France's Societe Generale - bemoaned the effects of Brexit, which they said will continue to plague the UK long after its official departure from the EU in 2019. Speaking at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in Russia, Daniel Pinto, the chief executive of JP Morgan's corporate and investment bank, said: "I think going forward you will be in a scenario where the Europeans want to have a substantial financial services industry in their territory. "So it's likely that the migration will continue in the years to come, probably it will take five to 10 years and you will see the full effect of the decision that the UK is taking today." His comments came after Mrs May claimed that it "would not be sensible" to see a diminished City. "I think they (EU countries) all benefit from the expertise, the skills, the size and the capability of the City and anything that diminished that would not be sensible for them," she said. The Prime Minister also said she would work with the Square Mile to get a good deal for the financial services industry, if she manages to convince the electorate to vote her back into power next week. However, Mr Pinto confirmed that JP Morgan is preparing for a scenario where there is "no deal" with the EU, where passporting rights for financial services are scrapped. "That scenario assumes that there is no change in regulation at all, and I think that over time we will see the real effect," Mr Pinto said. He added: "I think that at the beginning there is an interest on both sides that whatever everyone does in every sector creates the minimum amount of disruption." James Cowles, Citigroup's chief executive for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), said he agreed that the City's fortunes might not be fully revealed for another five to 10 years and said the bank was similarly planning for the "worst case" scenario from Brexit negotiations. He said: "From a financial industries perspective, financial markets, it's unfortunate. "We had a system that worked. I think passporting worked and I think as we move forward we're going to spend the next two years, spending a lot of time and resources trying to get to a position that's not as favourable as we have today." Societe Generale chief executive Frederic Oudea added that Brexit could present an "extraordinary window of opportunity" for the EU. "I think we have an extraordinary window of opportunity to think strategically to think about the financial services in the Eurozone, and which is needed not just for the financial services (industry) or for banks, but for growth." 2 June 2017 3:45PM View comments Most Commented Carlisle couple subjected to online abuse over daughter's temporary tattoo 8 Carlisle school head urges parents to donate paper, pencils and crayons 6 Anti-Tory election campaign launches in Carlisle 3 Carlisle businessman calls for post-Brexit vaping reforms 2 Wembley cup win for Carlisle school youngsters 2 Most Read Carlisle cyclist seriously hurt in crash Cumbrian couple not heard from since they missed flight home Fire "destroys" kitchen of north Cumbrian pub Boy, 11, fell 30ft through roof of Carlisle furniture store Police make arrest after robbery at corner shop More news   Police in Southwark Bridge Road near the scene of Saturday's terrorist incidents London terror attack: Police search two more homes Harry House, pictured, died after Joseph Eke punched or kicked him after losing his temper Man faces sentence for 'losing temper' and murdering two-year-old Harry Amber Rudd won a High Court order last November preventing the disclosure of ''sensitive material'' at the inquest Russian whistleblower's inquest due to start amid poison soup allegations Lotan Carter is one of the Big Brother housemates Big Brother goes head to head with Love Island Ariana Grande, left, and Miley Cyrus performing during the One Love Manchester benefit concert for the victims of the Manchester Arena terror attack Tears as Ariana Grande leads 'night of love' at Manchester benefit concert Quick searches Carlisle Airport Carlisle United Court cases Cumberland Infirmary Sellafield West Cumberland Hospital Featured articles   Olly Murs on the main stage at BBC Radio One's Big Weekend at Carlisle in May 2011 Olly Murs promises madness and craziness at Carlisle gig The Cumberland Show Cumberland Show: All you need to know about this year's event STUART WALKER David Beesley ‘It’s a cruel thing, my dad lasted two years’ Jo Reid and daughter Hannah Reid enjoy a dance together Lost in music.

By Grant Smith As oil prices sag despite OPEC’s renewed efforts to shore up world crude markets, Wall Street banks have more bad news for the producer group: the outlook for next year isn’t great either. Oil futures have lost 8 per cent since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies agreed on May 25 to keep output constrained through the first quarter of 2018 in a bid to clear a global glut. While Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects their strategy to ultimately succeed, they warn the surplus may re-appear once the curbs end. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. say the group will have little choice but to stick with the cuts even longer. Resurgent supplies from US shale drillers and fading growth in fuel demand mean that world oil markets could face another overhang next year, the banks predict. That means Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two biggest producers in the 24-nation coalition, may need to deliver on their promise to do “whatever it takes” to restore equilibrium. “If Opec wants to keep the market balanced next year, they will probably need to extend the production cut to all of 2018,” Martijn Rats, managing director at Morgan Stanley in London, said by email. “Demand growth has slowed somewhat recently, and with US production growing strongly, there doesn’t seem to be much room for Opec production to grow in 2018.” Slow Recovery Production cuts are taking longer than expected to eliminate the surplus as US shale drillers boost production with surprising speed. American oil explorers, having learned to operate more efficiently during a two-year market slump, have restored almost all the output lost during the downturn. As a result, the market may be unable to absorb the return of production halted by Opec and its partners when their pact ends in April. “The market isn’t able to see how Opec exits production cuts without creating huge surpluses in 2018,” said Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs in New York. “We see risks for a renewed surplus later next year if Opec and Russia’s production rises to their expanded capacity and shale grows at an unbridled rate.” Still, even if a surplus re-emerges in 2018, OPEC’s current efforts to deplete stockpiles will make their task of managing it easier, according to Citigroup Inc. While shale’s recovery means next year’s supply situation “looks weighty,” OPEC’s output cuts now mean that if inventories accumulate again, it would be from a lower level, said Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup in New York. Those increases in inventories may nonetheless prove substantial enough to prevent prices gaining, said David Martin, an analyst at JPMorgan, who slashed his 2018 forecast for Brent crude by $10 a barrel to $45 on May 25. Brent traded near $49 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London on Friday. Even if Opec extends their output accord for all of next year, it may only succeed in stopping further stockpile increases, he said. “OPEC may be shackled to its deal for a long time,” said Martin.

By Matt Egan NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Jamie Dimon isn't quitting Team Trump, despite opposing the decision to yank the United States from the Paris climate accord. "I absolutely disagree with the Administration on this issue," the JPMorgan Chase CEO said in a statement on Friday. But Dimon doesn't plan to follow Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney boss Bob Iger by stepping down from President Trump's business advisory council. "We have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said. A JPMorgan spokeswoman confirmed that Dimon does not plan to leave the the council, which is called the Strategic and Policy Forum. By contrast, Musk followed through on his threat to quit that forum as well as the president's manufacturing jobs initiative. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said on Twitter shortly after Trump's White House announcement on leaving the climate deal. Dimon did express disappointment with Trump, echoing concerns raised by fellow Wall Street bigwig Lloyd Blankfein. The Goldman Sachs CEO sent his first-ever tweet on Thursday to call Trump's Paris move a "setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world." Blankfein is not a member of Trump's advisory council. Dimon's statement suggests he wants to continue to have a voice in Trump's agenda, which includes plans to rip up rules governing Wall Street. The stocks of JPMorgan and other banks spiked after the election, in part because of Trump's pledge to "do a big number" on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. Bank stocks have given back some of their post-election gains amid disappointment with slow progress on tax reform and deregulation. JPMorgan stock is up 19% since Trump's victory.

The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.37%  closed up 9.01 points, or 0.4%, at a record 2,349.07, after touching an intraday record at 2,440.23. Tech, with a 1% rise, was the top performing sector. Energy shares finished down 1.2%, largely following oil prices. Financials stocks were another area of weakness on Wall Street, with the sector trading 0.4% lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.29%  rose 62.11 points, or 0.3%, to finish at a record 21,206.29, led higher by shares of Boeing Co. BA, +1.55%  and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.37%  Earlier, the average touched a record intraday high of 21,225.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.94%  climbed 58.97 points, or 0.9%, to close at a record 6,305.80, after touching an intraday high of 6,308.76. Along with all three main indexes closing at records, the Dow industrials finished the week up 0.6%, the S&P 500 advanced 1%, and the Nasdaq gained 1.5%. The May nonfarm payrolls data showed the economy added 138,000 jobs last month, coming in below Wall Street economists’ forecasts. The details of the jobs report were also weaker than expected. The number of job gains for April and March were revised lower. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.3% but the decline was largely due to shrinking labor force. Average wages rose 0.2% to $26.22 an hour, in line with expectations. “This is undoubtedly a weak jobs report, especially with downward revisions. But it’s just one data point that will not change the Fed’s course, which is to raise rates at its June meeting,” said Michael Antonelli, equity sales trader at Robert W. Baird & Co. “Nonfarm payrolls month-to-month is a very jumpy number and a one-off weakness should not be seen as a beginning of a trend. For example, we’ve had a very poor print in May 2016, with 43,000 jobs. Since then, the S&P 500 is up about 400 points,” Antonelli said. Read: The S&P 500 has never had a down year after a start like 2017 Despite the unexpectedly low print on the jobs report, expectations for a rate increase in June didn’t fall. Fed fund futures are pricing in a 91% probability of a rate increase this month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. While a June hike is widely expected, the weak jobs number and tepid wage growth may give the Fed pause when it comes to other rate increases this year, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management, in an interview. “Wage growth is not fabulous, and maybe that gives the Fed room to sit on rates,” Nolte said. “Markets love a near-zero rate.” Should inflation trends and weakness persist then it’s entirely possible that a rate increase in June could be the last one of 2017, and with Treasury yields at unexpected lows, equities become one of the few games in town for a return, said Nolte. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.48%  fell nearly 6 basis points to 2.154%, declining below its 200-day moving average for the first time since October. Meanwhile, the dollar weakened against other major currencies, with the ICE U.S. Dollar index DXY, +0.03%  last down less than 0.1% at 96.68. Other markets: Oil prices CLN7, +1.20%  fell 1.5% to settle at $47.66 a barrel for a three-week low on Friday, partly driven by concerns that President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord will lead to an increase in U.S. oil output. The Nikkei 225 index NIK, +0.09%  closed above the key 20,000 level, adding 1.6% as the Japanese yen eased against the dollar USDJPY, +0.21% European stocks SXXP, +0.23%  finished higher, and the FTSE 100 UKX, +0.05% pared back from an intraday high to close up less than 0.1%. Gold prices GCQ7, +0.25%  rose 0.8% to settle at $1,280.20 an ounce. Individual stocks: Shares of Broadcom Limited AVGO, +8.50%  finished up 8.5% after reporting earnings. Shares of Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU, +11.55%  shot up nearly 12% after the apparel-maker posted first-quarter results that beat expectations and announced a shake-up of its Ivivva brand, late Thursday. Leading the slump in energy were shares of Devon Energy Corp. DVN, -3.33% Newfield Exploration Co. NFX, -5.02% Range Resources Corp. RRC, -3.89% all of which finished down 3% or more, while Transocean Ltd. RIG, -2.17%  shares declined 2.2%. Shares of Cooper Cos. COO, +8.43%  rallied 8.4% after Raymond James raised its price target of medical device company’s stock. Shares of Delta Air Lines DAL, +2.69%  advanced 2.7% after the company reported its monthly operating performance. Shares of RH Inc. RH, -25.69%  sank nearly 26% after the retail chain formerly known as Restoration Hardware cut its earnings outlook for the year.

By: Bloomberg | Published: June 2, 2017 6:10 PM Trump now is alone and isolated. His rhetoric explaining the decision may play well in some working-class precincts in Pittsburgh but in Paris, Emmanuel Macron is all but mocking him: “Make our planet great again,” he tweeted. (Reuters) President Donald Trump’s decision to abandon the Paris climate accord touched off a furious and immediate backlash, igniting condemnation from C-suites and capitals around the world. But one man was left a clear winner. China’s President Xi Jinping now has another opportunity to burnish his country’s image as a clean-energy innovator and global champion in fighting climate change. Not a bad spot for the world’s No. 1 polluter. Xi has been deliberate in moving into the spaces Trump abandons. He runs a command economy but told the global elite at Davos this year that China is now a bastion of free trade. His Belt and Road Forum last month was meant to prove China — not the U.S. — is now in the vanguard of globalization. China’s also getting friendlier with Germany’s Angela Merkel, who can barely hide her growing distaste for Trump. Watch video here: Trump now is alone and isolated. His rhetoric explaining the decision may play well in some working-class precincts in Pittsburgh but in Paris, Emmanuel Macron is all but mocking him: “Make our planet great again,” he tweeted. Now China may be only too happy to grab that slogan for itself. Global Headlines CEO outrage | Normally, global executives applaud attempts to roll back regulation. And Trump’s announcement was hardly a shock. But the reaction from most CEOs was striking in its outrage. Goldman Sachs’s Lloyd Blankfein took to Twitter for the first time to slam it, while Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan said he will continue to press for emissions controls. Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, meanwhile, said the decision made him want to cry. What does it mean for investors? | The biggest winners from Trump’s decision are oil, coal and natural gas producers. And even they aren’t popping Champagne corks. As Joe Ryan and Naureen Malik write today, that’s because individual government policies around the world, changing economics and cheaper solar power are already spurring a shift toward cleaner energy. So while Trump quitting Paris may be a boon for fossil fuels, it’s not necessarily moving markets. Trump asks Supreme Court to revive travel ban | The administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to immediately reinstate its stalled travel ban, aiming to reverse a string of courtroom losses and setting up the biggest legal showdown of the young presidency. The case – Trump’s first initiative to go before the high court – brings the nine justices into a dispute over claims that the president is targeting Muslims. May goes easy on Trump | While Germany, France and Italy protested in unison at Trump’s climate decision, Britain’s Theresa May waited more than three hours to respond and when she did, she merely expressed her “disappointment.” Her reticence was another sign of the distance opening up between the U.K. and Europe ahead of the Brexit talks and showed how careful she’s trying to be with Trump as she eyes an eventual free-trade deal. Is Putin trolling America? | The Russian president yesterday gave his strongest hint yet that Russian hackers could have been involved in interfering with foreign elections. While repeating past denials that he had anything to do with the cyber attacks on Hillary Clinton, Putin told reporters that he couldn’t rule out involvement by free-spirited and patriotic “artists” who want to strike back against foreign criticism of their country. Manila casino horror | At least 36 people died at a casino and hotel in the Philippine capital after a gunman opened fire and torched the complex. The dead appeared to have suffocated in thick smoke, police said, after the assailant killed himself. The incident sparked a security lock down amid fears that Islamist militants from the country’s south were responsible, but authorities have now ruled out terrorism and say the perpetrator may have been mentally disturbed. Mexico’s populists are on the move | The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party has dominated the country’s political landscape for nearly nine decades, and in that time has never lost control of Mexico State. But as Nacha Cattan writes, surging crime, stagnant wages, corruption and Trump mean the governorship is now up for grabs. Should arch-populist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador emerge victorious from Sunday’s vote, it could set him up to win next year’s presidential election. Lewandowski and Kushner hug it out | Ousted Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski’s relationship with Trump’s son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, seems to be on the mend. The pair’s Rose Garden stroll this week ended in a hug, a sign that Kushner may no longer be a barrier to Lewandowski, now a private consultant, working more closely with the White House. And finally… At an economic summit in Russia, newly minted NBC host Megyn Kelly bantered with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as she prepared to host a panel with the two leaders later today. “Are you on Twitter?” she asked Modi in St Petersburg. “Yes!” he boomed.

Oil futures have lost 8 percent since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies agreed on May 25 to keep output constrained through the first quarter of 2018 in a bid to clear a global glut. While Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects their strategy to ultimately succeed, they warn the surplus may re-appear once the curbs end. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. say the group will have little choice but to stick with the cuts even longer. Resurgent supplies from U.S. shale drillers and fading growth in fuel demand mean that world oil markets could face another overhang next year, the banks predict. That means Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two biggest producers in the 24-nation coalition, may need to deliver on their promise to do “whatever it takes” to restore equilibrium. “If OPEC wants to keep the market balanced next year, they will probably need to extend the production cut to all of 2018,” Martijn Rats, managing director at Morgan Stanley in London, said by email. “Demand growth has slowed somewhat recently, and with U.S. production growing strongly, there doesn’t seem to be much room for OPEC production to grow in 2018.” Slow Recovery The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Production cuts are taking longer than expected to eliminate the surplus as U.S. shale drillers boost production with surprising speed. American oil explorers, having learned to operate more efficiently during a two-year market slump, have restored almost all the output lost during the downturn. As a result, the market may be unable to absorb the return of production halted by OPEC and its partners when their pact ends in April. This Is What the Demise of Oil Looks Like. See the graphic. “The market isn’t able to see how OPEC exits production cuts without creating huge surpluses in 2018,” said Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs in New York. “We see risks for a renewed surplus later next year if OPEC and Russia’s production rises to their expanded capacity and shale grows at an unbridled rate.” Still, even if a surplus re-emerges in 2018, OPEC’s current efforts to deplete stockpiles will make their task of managing it easier, according to Citigroup Inc. While shale’s recovery means next year’s supply situation “looks weighty,” OPEC’s output cuts now mean that if inventories accumulate again, it would be from a lower level, said Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup in New York. Those increases in inventories may nonetheless prove substantial enough to prevent prices gaining, said David Martin, an analyst at JPMorgan, who slashed his 2018 forecast for Brent crude by $10 a barrel to $45 on May 25. Brent traded near $49 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London on Friday. Even if OPEC extends their output accord for all of next year, it may only succeed in stopping further stockpile increases, he said. “OPEC may be shackled to its deal for a long time,” said Martin.

Wall Street’s biggest banks are contending with tranquil markets after geopolitical surprises last year — including the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump’s presidential election — that fueled revenue from handling client transactions. On Wednesday, JPMorgan finance chief Marianne Lake said markets revenue tumbled about 15% in April and May from a year earlier. And Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said his firm’s second-quarter trading revenue will be 10% to 12% lower. “What the markets really like, and when we saw things really kick back in last year, it was something to trade against,” Corbat said. That’s something markets currently lack, he said. “There are some things out there, some opportunities that will present themselves, but volatility is low right now.” Article The mortgage search goes digital Search habits and online lenders are forcing loan officers to step up their digital game to compete.

Trump decided to pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement designed to fight climate change despite entreaties from U.S. allies and corporate leaders in an action that fulfilled a major campaign pledge. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post. He is a member of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, and Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Musk said on Wednesday that he had done "all I can" to convince Trump to stay in the accord, and threatened to leave the presidential advisory councils if Trump announced a U.S. exit from the accord. Iger wrote on Twitter that "as a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal." He is leaving the business advisory group. Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration's immigration policies. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The group is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP and includes Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo Inc and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co . Late on Thursday, BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said he would continue to serve on Trump's CEO Forum, despite reservations about the White House decision to withdraw from the Paris accord. "I accepted the invitation to serve on the President's CEO Forum because I believe I can contribute to the policy dialogue in Washington and serve as a voice for investors," Fink said in a statement. "I am a strong believer that our industry needs to have a voice with governments around the world," said Fink, whose company is the world's largest asset manager, with $5.4 trillion under management. "I do not agree with all of the president's policies and decisions, including today's announcement to exit the U.S. from the Paris Agreement which I believe is a critical step forward in addressing climate change." Asked about Musk's resignation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox News that "anybody who read the agreement and understood it would realize that this was not really about climate, this was about U.S. money going to other countries and it didn't solve the climate problem." Musk has met with Trump several times and spoken with him about the long-term goal of his company SpaceX for flights to Mars carrying humans. The White House is planning to a hold a meeting with technology leaders on June 19, an administration spokesman said Wednesday. General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra would remain on the presidential advisory panel, adding that her participation "provides GM a seat at an important table to contribute to a constructive dialogue about key policy issues." In 2013, GM signed a declaration joining other major companies arguing that responding to climate change was good business. The automaker said on Thursday that despite the withdrawal it "will not waver from our commitment to the environment." It was unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join Trump's panel. Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said on Thursday the No.2 U.S. automaker believes "climate change is real, and remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities."

Phil Mesman and his colleagues at Picton Mahoney Asset Management have been scooping up subordinated debt issued by the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Plc, and Credit Agricole SA in the 1980s and 1990s that is trading at a discount to face value. The goal is to get repaid early at a premium to the current price. This strategy, which began almost two years ago with a spreadsheet plotting the rather tiny universe of the asset class, has handed the firm’s funds returns of more than 20 percent, Mesman said. These legacy hybrid capital notes were originally issued to convert to equity in the event of a bank failure. They trade at a discount primarily because of the low coupon, which is based on a spread over the London interbank offered rate, and uncertainty around whether or not they will be repaid early, Mesman said. The bonds, which also have a liquidity discount, have a maturity of 25 years or longer in most cases, and some are perpetual bonds, he said. The bond covenants and structures are good for investors, because they make it difficult for a bank to convert the bonds to equity in the event it needs to shore up capital levels. Regulators have said that banks need to take out the bonds before Jan. 1, 2022, Mesman said, putting a deadline on opportunities in the trade. “It’s an incredible risk-reward,” Mesman, senior partner and portfolio manager, said by phone from Toronto. He manages more than C$700 million ($518 million) in fixed income of Picton’s C$6.8 billion of assets. “Typically they would be rated BB or higher-quality high-yield instruments, but the bank issuers are all investment grade.” Stamp Collecting Mesman estimates that his firm is one of only a few players in the $5 billion to $7 billion market, with most of the investors and dealers concentrated in Europe. The bonds represent about 30 percent of both Picton Mahoney’s main fund, the Fortified Income Fund, and the Income Opportunities Fund, as well as about 50 percent of the firm’s special-situations fund, he said. It’s a strategy that can only be pursued by knowledgeable investors who have flexibility with their investment horizon and don’t have to follow an index, Roger Francis, a credit analyst at Mizuho International Plc in London, said by phone. He said he’s heard the strategy compared to stamp collecting. “They’re rare and you find them in the back of drawers,” he said. “It’s a relatively small asset class.” The main risks with these old bank bonds is liquidity -- they’re difficult to trade in tough market conditions -- and that a bank will opt not to call or tender for them early, Francis said. The strategy hinges on correctly identifying which bonds are candidates to be repaid early, or which banks might be willing to negotiate, Mesman said. Direct Approach “If we find a bond where perhaps 50 percent to 60 percent of the issue has already been tendered over the years, then we’ll approach them directly and offer them our bonds at a certain price,” he said. Credit Agricole recently tendered for 371.23 million euros of a perpetual bond at 78 cents on the euro, but investors only took them up on part of the offer, suggesting that they’re waiting for a higher payout, Mesman said. His firm sold 25 percent of their 25 million euro position in the bond and are waiting for a higher price for the rest, he said. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up To be sure, there has been some headline uncertainty with some banks in Europe, Mesman said. Deutsche Bank AG, UniCredit SpA, and other European banks have in the past been at risk of not paying the coupons on their bonds. While failure to pay interest would be tantamount to default for most debt securities, coupon payments on newer contingent convertible bonds, known as CoCos, are discretionary. Once missed, though, they are gone forever. With their strategy, Mesman and colleagues focus on buying older notes generally from U.K. and U.S. banks. They also hedge using tools including bank stock and currencies, he said. The bonds generally pay in U.S. dollars. “We’re looking for situations where they’re taking them out sooner, ideally within the next 12 months,” he said.

Here's a look at the other prominent names in the Eminent Persons Group and their contributions to the field of world finance: Dr John Taylor, 70 Stanford University professor is one of the highest-regarded thinkers and influential economist of our time. A former Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs of the United States, Dr Taylor's contributions to monetary economics have been huge, including the well known 'Taylor rule' - a simple equation intended as a tool for policymakers to target interest rates. The equation is now essentially seen as the rule of thumb of monetary policy. Dr Taylor has also been active in the field of public policy, and has been listed by Thomson Reuters among 'citation laureates' who are likely to win the Nobel Prize in Economics in future. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet,74 The former European Central Bank president, popular as 'Monsieur Euro' in the Eurozone, has had an illustrious 40-year career in the world of finance. Originally trained as an engineer, he rose through the ranks of French bureaucracy to serve in roles like deputy head of International Monetary Fund (IMF), governor of the Bank of France etc, and has won the Financial Times 'personality of the year award' for his management of the early sub-prime crises in 2007. Mr Trichet is known to talk with his opponents on policy, and try to convince those who disagree with him. He also enjoys the comedy of 'Ali G' - a satirical fictional character created by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up Lord Nicholas Stern, 71 British economist and London School of Economics professor was the former chief economist and senior vice president of the World Bank. His review on Economics of Climate Change released in 2006, was a landmark document which was recognised as a definitive account of economic dangers to the planet due to global warming. Lord Stern, who had warned in the document that the cost of inaction on climate change would be far greater for future generations, has been reported to state in hindsight that he "underestimated the risks and underplayed the dangers" of climate change and that he "should have been much stronger in what (he) said in the report". Dr Jacob Frenkel, 74 The Israeli economist and chairman of JPMorgan Chase International was the former governor of the Bank of Israel. He has had an illustrious career in various banks and financial institutions including Merrill Lynch International, American International Group, the IMF Fund, as well as investment advisory roles in councils for Turkey and China Development Bank. Dr Raghuram Rajan, 54 The youngest economist to be appointed IMF's chief economist in 2003, debonair Dr Rajan was also the winner of the Fischer Black Prize, given every two years to an economists under 40 who has made the most significant contribution to the theory and practice of finance. The 'rockstar' banker from India served two terms as governor of the country's central bank and was also the chief economic adviser at India's Finance Ministry. He was responsible for fending off volatility from US Federal Reserve's tapering in 2013 on India's economy, and initiating the clean up of its banking system which was stinking in bad loans. Mr Zhu Min, 65 The former deputy managing director of the IMF and former deputy governor of the People's Bank of China is now president of the National Institute of Financial Research at Tsinghua University. He has published extensively on a wide range of issues like   39128423_-_19_07_2016_-_xechina20.jpg Related Story G20 group to consult widely, think deeply about review of global financial governance: Tharman macroeconomic management, financial regulation and financial markets.

Dr Otmar Issing, 81 German economist Dr Issing was a founding member of executive board of the European Central Bank and its first chief economist. He is widely regarded as the architect of the euro, having left the Deutsche Bundesbank to join the ECB in 1998 specifically to create the EU currency. He has since criticised ECB as a 'house of cards' which will collapse. In 2010, he slammed the first Greek rescue as little more than a bailout for German and French banks, insisting that it would have been far better to eject Greece from the euro as a salutary lesson for all. Dr Issing headed the Advisory Council on a New Financial Order appointed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in her first term. He also was a member of the High Level Group of the European Commission.

But one man was left a clear winner. China's President Xi Jinping now has another opportunity to burnish his country’s image as a clean-energy innovator and global champion in fighting climate change. Not a bad spot for the world's No. 1 polluter. Xi has been deliberate in moving into the spaces Trump abandons. He runs a command economy but told the global elite at Davos this year that China is now a bastion of free trade. His Belt and Road Forum last month was meant to prove China -- not the U.S. -- is now in the vanguard of globalization. China's also getting friendlier with Germany's Angela Merkel, who can barely hide her growing distaste for Trump. Trump now is alone and isolated. His rhetoric explaining the decision may play well in some working-class precincts in Pittsburgh but in Paris, Emmanuel Macron is all but mocking him: “Make our planet great again,” he tweeted.  Now China may be only too happy to grab that slogan for itself.

Chinese President Xi Jinping attends a ceremony inside the Great Hall of the People on March 25, 2015, in Beijing.  Photographer: Feng Li/Getty Images Global Headlines CEO outrage | Normally, global executives applaud attempts to roll back regulation. And Trump's announcement was hardly a shock. But the reaction from most CEOs was striking in its outrage. Goldman Sachs's Lloyd Blankfein took to Twitter for the first time to slam it, while Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan said he will continue to press for emissions controls. Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, meanwhile, said the decision made him want to cry. What does it mean for investors? | The biggest winners from Trump’s decision are oil, coal and natural gas producers. And even they aren’t popping Champagne corks. As Joe Ryan and Naureen Malik write today, that’s because individual government policies around the world, changing economics and cheaper solar power are already spurring a shift toward cleaner energy. So while Trump quitting Paris may be a boon for fossil fuels, it’s not necessarily moving markets. Trump asks Supreme Court to revive travel ban | The administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to immediately reinstate its stalled travel ban, aiming to reverse a string of courtroom losses and setting up the biggest legal showdown of the young presidency. The case - Trump's first initiative to go before the high court - brings the nine justices into a dispute over claims that the president is targeting Muslims.  May goes easy on Trump | While Germany, France and Italy protested in unison at Trump’s climate decision, Britain's Theresa May waited more than three hours to respond and when she did, she merely expressed her “disappointment.” Her reticence was another sign of the distance opening up between the U.K. and Europe ahead of the Brexit talks and showed how careful she's trying to be with Trump as she eyes an eventual free-trade deal.  Is Putin trolling America? | The Russian president yesterday gave his strongest hint yet that Russian hackers could have been involved in interfering with foreign elections. While repeating past denials that he had anything to do with the cyber attacks on Hillary Clinton, Putin told reporters that he couldn’t rule out involvement by free-spirited and patriotic “artists” who want to strike back against foreign criticism of their country. Manila casino horror | At least 36 people died at a casino and hotel in the Philippine capital after a gunman opened fire and torched the complex. The dead appeared to have suffocated in thick smoke, police said, after the assailant killed himself. The incident sparked a security lock down amid fears that Islamist militants from the country's south were responsible, but authorities have now ruled out terrorism and say the perpetrator may have been mentally disturbed.

Sign Up Mexico's populists are on the move | The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party has dominated the country's political landscape for nearly nine decades, and in that time has never lost control of Mexico State. But as Nacha Cattan writes, surging crime, stagnant wages, corruption and Trump mean the governorship is now up for grabs. Should arch-populist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador emerge victorious from Sunday's vote, it could set him up to win next year's presidential election.  Lewandowski and Kushner hug it out | Ousted Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski's relationship with Trump's son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, seems to be on the mend. The pair's Rose Garden stroll this week ended in a hug, a sign that Kushner may no longer be a barrier to Lewandowski, now a private consultant, working more closely with the White House.  And finally... At an economic summit in Russia, newly minted NBC host Megyn Kelly bantered with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as she prepared to host a panel with the two leaders later today. “Are you on Twitter?” she asked Modi in St Petersburg. “Yes!” he boomed. India's leader actually has has more than 30 million Twitter followers. (For anyone keeping score, Kelly has 2.3 million.)

Trump decided to pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement designed to fight climate change despite entreaties from U.S. allies and corporate leaders in an action that fulfilled a major campaign pledge. “Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk said in a Twitter post. He is a member of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, and Trump’s manufacturing jobs council. Musk said on Wednesday that he had done “all I can” to convince Trump to stay in the accord, and threatened to leave the presidential advisory councils if Trump announced a U.S. exit from the accord. Iger wrote on Twitter that “as a matter of principle, I’ve resigned from the President’s Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal.” He is leaving the business advisory group. Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration’s immigration policies. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The group is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP and includes Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo Inc and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co . Late on Thursday, BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said he would continue to serve on Trump’s CEO Forum, despite reservations about the White House decision to withdraw from the Paris accord. “I accepted the invitation to serve on the President’s CEO Forum because I believe I can contribute to the policy dialogue in Washington and serve as a voice for investors,” Fink said in a statement. “I am a strong believer that our industry needs to have a voice with governments around the world,” said Fink, whose company is the world’s largest asset manager, with $5.4 trillion under management. “I do not agree with all of the president’s policies and decisions, including today’s announcement to exit the U.S. from the Paris Agreement which I believe is a critical step forward in addressing climate change.” Asked about Musk’s resignation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox News that “anybody who read the agreement and understood it would realize that this was not really about climate, this was about U.S. money going to other countries and it didn’t solve the climate problem.” Musk has met with Trump several times and spoken with him about the long-term goal of his company SpaceX for flights to Mars carrying humans. The White House is planning to a hold a meeting with technology leaders on June 19, an administration spokesman said Wednesday. General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra would remain on the presidential advisory panel, adding that her participation “provides GM a seat at an important table to contribute to a constructive dialogue about key policy issues.” In 2013, GM signed a declaration joining other major companies arguing that responding to climate change was good business. The automaker said on Thursday that despite the withdrawal it “will not waver from our commitment to the environment.” It was unclear whether Ford Motor Co’s new chief executive, James Hackett, would join Trump’s panel. Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said on Thursday the No.2 U.S. automaker believes “climate change is real, and remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities.” Reuters Publish date: June 2, 2017 2:52 pm| Modified date: June 2, 2017 2:52 pm Tags: climate change, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Paris, Paris Climate Accord, Robert Iger, Tesla, Trump, Walt Disney Also read President Trump tweets “covfefe”; Twitter has a field day Donald Trump announces America’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord X Recommended For You Earth Hour 2017: Less tweeting and minor lifestyle changes can help you fight climate change Greenpeace calls Apple the greenest tech company, dubs data centres ‘factories of the digital age’ Arctic temperature spikes to 30 degrees Celsius higher than normal, above freezing point of water Obama official urges researchers to raise the alarm if Trump skews science Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

New records in sight?: U.S. stock markets hit record levels on Thursday and the momentum is set to continue. Stock futures are pointing higher. The Dow added 136 points to close at 21,144 on Thursday, its first record close since March 1. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also finished at all-time highs. While many American were focused on the fallout from President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate deal, market analysts said Wall Street's march higher was linked to healthy signals from the U.S. economy. "It's not because of the climate accord. People expected that," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. Investors instead focused on a report from ADP that showed the U.S. added 253,000 private-sector jobs in May. "It was a very strong reading and helps reduce worries the economy had lost momentum," Kelly said. 2. Jobs, jobs, jobs: Investors are hoping for more good news when the U.S. jobs report is published at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists surveyed by CNNMoney predict the U.S. added 179,00 jobs in May. They expect the unemployment rate to remain at 4.4%. "Everything indicates an economy that is at full employment," said Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management. "With full employment reached, the economic focus is whether the labor market can provide higher incomes." A solid jobs report will likely clear the way for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this month. 3. Mind the gap: The U.S. Census Bureau is releasing new trade balance data at 8:30 a.m. The monthly report for April is expected to show the U.S. continued to import more than it exports, leading to a trade gap worth about $44 billion in the month. Trump has seized on America's trade deficit as a serious problem, especially with nations like China and Germany. 4. Global market moves: European markets were rising in early trading. The Dax in Germany led the way with a 1% gain. Asian markets ended the day with gains. The Nikkei in Japan performed particularly well with a 1.6% jump. Crude oil futures were down 2% to trade just below $47.50 per barrel. Gold slipped by 0.5% to trade near $1,265 per ounce. 5.

But business? Not so much. Two of the US’s biggest business leaders, Tesla founder Elon Musk and Disney’s Robert Iger, have quit Trump’s high-powered business advisory panel after the president pressed ahead with plans to pull out of the Paris climate accord. Elon Musk (@elonmusk) Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. June 1, 2017 Robert Iger (@RobertIger) As a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal. June 1, 2017 Trump created his business advisory panel shortly after his election as he sought to show how his administration would revamp the US by “drawing on private sector expertise”. The departures are a disaster for the president. While Trump has claimed an economic rationale for the US’s exit from the most ambitious climate change agreement in history, big business has cried foul. To make matters worse, Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein (who is not on Trump’s business panel but knows a thing or two about making money) chose Thursday to launch his first tweet in condemnation of the move. Lloyd Blankfein (@lloydblankfein) Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreement June 1, 2017 The two defections and Blankfein’s message leave a lot of other people on Trump’s high-powered business council in a very awkward position, given their own – and their companies’ – views on Paris and climate change. Here’s a sample of Trump’s business team and the conflicts they now face. Jamie Dimon – chairman, president and CEO of JPMorgan Chase The banking titan is no fan of regulation but even he clearly thinks some is necessary, especially when it comes to the environment. “Some regulations quite clearly create a common good (e.g. clean air and water),” he wrote in his 45-page letter to shareholders this year. Trump in the meantime has been frantically signing executive orders to repeal Obama-era air and water protections. Trump may have missed Dimon’s buried critique, but he won’t have missed Dimon’s signature alongside fellow councilmembers Musk and Iger, who joined a total of 30 other business leaders in sending a letter to the president that begins: “We are writing to express our strong support for the United States remaining in the Paris climate agreement.” “Based on our vast experience doing business all over the world, we believe there is strong potential for negative trade implications if the United States exits from the Paris agreement,” they wrote. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump flanked by Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman and General Motors CEO Mary Barra, both bosses have expressed concern about climate change. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters Stephen Schwarzman – co-founder, chairman and CEO of Blackstone The billionaire founder of investment group Blackstone is literally Trump’s right-hand man on the council. He’s a New York player who likes Saudi princes, companies that slash worker benefits and throwing lavish parties that would make an emperor blush, so you’d think there would be no tension here. But Schwarzman too is out of step with Trump and believes climate change is real. His Schwarzman Scholars educational program funds research into the impact of climate change, and here’s Blackstone’s vice-chairman Byron Wien on climate change in a blogpost from last year: “The climate change problem is real, but not immediate and it is hard to get policy makers to focus on it, despite rising temperatures and sea levels ... According to some climate experts, in 200 years most major cities will be in danger, but there is not a sense of urgency that will get world leaders to deal with this problem now.” Indra Nooyi – chairwoman and CEO of PepsiCo Pepsi has signed the business world’s version of the Paris climate agreement. Last year the company’s plans to reduce its emissions were approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, a program backed by the UN and others that is in alignment with the Paris agreement and has approved similar plans by another 43 of the world’s biggest companies. “Combating climate change is absolutely critical to the future of our company, customers, consumers – and our world,” Nooyi said in 2014. Trump could switch to Coke, but they signed too. Celebrating 1237! #Trump2016 A post shared by President Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on May 26, 2016 at 2:29pm PDT Mary Barra – chairwoman and CEO of General Motors Barra normally gets to sit to Trump’s left when his business council meets, and that’s clearly where she is in relation to his environmental views. “Environmental stewardship and sustainability are part of our business model and core to our operations,” Barra said in GM’s annual sustainability report last year. The company is aiming for a world of “zero emissions, zero congestion and zero crashes”. Shareholders force ExxonMobil to come clean on cost of climate change Read more Larry Fink – chairman and CEO of BlackRock BlackRock, an investment manager that overseas $5tn in assets, has become increasingly vocal about its concerns on climate change. Fink has warned CEOs he is losing patience with those that fail to account for how they will address the cost of climate change, both from new regulation and a changing planet. Exxon, Occidental Petroleum and PPL, a large utility holding company, have all been forced to be more transparent about the impact of climate change on their businesses after pressure from BlackRock. Ginni Rometty – chairwoman, president and CEO of IBM Rometty’s support of Trump caused consternation at IBM where over 2,300 staff members signed a petition, saying the decision undermined the company’s “core values of diversity, inclusiveness, and ethical business conduct”. In March, IBM was awarded a 2017 Climate Leadership Award by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions and the Climate Registry, its fifth such award in six years. “As IBM stated 10 years ago, ‘Climate change is one of the most critical global environmental challenges facing the planet.’ That is even truer today,” Wayne Balta, vice-president for corporate environmental affairs and product safety, wrote in a blogpost. Doug McMillon – president and CEO of Walmart Stores Walmart is another signatory to the Science Based Targets Initiative, and McMillon has set ambitious targets for reducing the retailer’s emissions. Working with suppliers, it aims to reduce emissions by 1 gigaton (or 1bn metric tons) by 2030, “equivalent to taking more than 211m passenger vehicles off of US roads and highways for a year”, McMillon announced last year. Trump probably thinks a gigaton is a new truck. He likes trucks. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump in the driver’s seat of an 18-wheeler while meeting with truck drivers and trucking CEOs in March.

Kshitij Anand Moneycontrol News The S&P BSE Sensex hit a fresh record high of 31,332.56 while Nifty recorded a fresh lifetime high of 9,673.50 on Friday. The Indian market has already gained over 17 percent so far in the year 2017. Global brokerage firms such as Citigroup remains bullish on India markets, although with the slightly cautious stance. Citi India has upped the Sensex target for FY18 to 32,200. Explaining this upgrade, Surendra Goyal, Director and Head of India Equity Research at Citi Research said that Q4 FY17 earnings have come in slightly ahead of estimates, so this change in the target is more of a roll forward. He is overweight on healthcare, especially in hospitals and midcap pharmaceutical companies. His pecking order for financials is private banks, NBFCs and then public sector banks. “We are positive on financials in general, bigger overweights are still in the private sector banking, we have buy on a lot of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and selective on public sector banks”, he further mentioned. However, BofA-ML raised its cautious stance on Indian market in the short term. The market is expensive and the breadth of re-rating is extraordinary, Sanjay Mookim of Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in an interview with CNBC-TV18. He said the market is expensive and the breadth of re-rating is extraordinary. There is a strong chance the current valuations driven rally turns, Mookim said, adding the brokerage house stayed cautious with a Sensex December 2017 target of 30,000. It looks like benchmark indices are likely to trade in a range but there will be stock specific action. We have collated a list of top 10 stocks recommended by different brokerage firms such as CLSA, JPMorgan and Macquarie in separate notes to their clients in separate notes to their clients for an investment period of 1 year: Maruti Suzuki: BUY| Target Rs 7,400| Upside 4% Deutsche Bank maintains a buy rating on Maruti Suzuki but raised its 12-months target price to Rs 7400 from Rs 7000 earlier. Maruti’s overall volumes including both domestic and exports came at 136,534 units, up over 11 percent on a YoY basis. The domestic volumes were at 130,676 units. Cars grew at 18 percent on a YoY basis while SUV segment grew by 66 percent YoY. However, on a YTD basis, market-share for Maruti is at 51 percent which is higher than FY17 market share of 50 percent. “Maruti continues to be in a sweet spot from a demand perspective as the products launched in the past 2 years continue to have a waiting period. In addition, this year the company is likely to launch the all-new versions of two of its most successful models (Swift & Dzire),” said Deutsche Bank. Astral Poly: BUY| Target Rs 685| Upside 13% CLSA maintains a buy rating on Astral Poly with a 12-months target price of Rs 685. It is one of the top picks in CLSA’s midcap portfolio. Astral reported strong EBITDA/net profit growth of 38%/51% on a year-on-year (YoY) basis in 4QFY17. The EBITDA margin expanded 286bps YoY led by backwards integration benefits in pipes and operating leverage benefits in adhesives. “We believe the competitive advantage of manufacturing its own CPVC compound and scale up in the adhesives business will lead to a robust 33 percent earnings per share (EPS) CAGR over FY17-19,” said the CLSA note. Max Financial: BUY| Target Rs 700| Upside 13% CLSA maintains a buy recommendation on Max Financial but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 700 from Rs 680 earlier. FY17 was a good year for Max Life Insurance with 27 percent growth in premiums, healthy value of new business (VNB) margins of 18 percent and return on enterprise value (ROEV) of 20 percent. Demonetisation helped premium growth and better product mix as well as persistency ratio aided margins. As per management, a tie-up with Axis Bank (58% of premium) will stay until 2021 and management is committed to consummate the merger with HDFC Life; clarity on regulatory approvals will be key. Prestige Estates: BUY| Target 318| Upside 28% CLSA maintains a buy rating on Prestige Estates with a 12-months target price of Rs 318. The company recorded 52 percent QoQ improvement in pre-sales and 22 percent QoQ growth in customer collections show that it has recovered from the demonetisation lows. After sales missing targets for two consecutive years, declining 25 percent on a YoY basis in FY17, management has guided for over 40 percent growth in FY18. “While presales growth may run the risk of new launch revivals, we are much more sanguine on the lease income growth target of 20% YoY, despite recent job slowdown worries,” said the CLSA note. Apollo Hospitals (AHEL): Overweight| Target Rs1537| Upside 23% Morgan Stanley maintains an overweight rating on Apollo Hospitals with a 12-month target price of Rs1537. Apollo Hospitals targets 7 percent volume growth and 4-5 percent improvement in average revenue per occupied bed (ARPOB) (pricing and case mix), which together should translate into 12 percent rise in health-care services revenue (55% of the total sales). “We expect SAP (stand-alone pharmacies; 45% of overall sales) to grow faster driven by new stores, volumes and value. AHEL is planning to take price increases in line with inflation (4-5%) across its network in F2Q18,” said the note. Fortis Healthcare: Outperform| Target Rs270| Upside 38% Macquarie maintains an overweight rating on Fortis Healthcare with a 12-month target price of Rs270 even though the March quarter results were marginally lower than Morgan Stanley’s estimates. The company remains buoyant about its FY18 growth and margin outlook, with the situation having largely normalised by now. With improving efficiencies in FEHI and SRL, FORH is well poised to deliver profitable growth. “We think current levels provide an attractive entry opportunity with a 12-month view on the name. We believe a demerger and separate listing of SRL could help unlock significant value for Fortis shareholders,” said the Macquarie note. Hindalco Industries: Outperform| Target Rs250| Upside 27% Macquarie maintains an Outperform rating on Hindalco Industries with a 12-month target price of Rs250. Management has maintained its low CapEx focus with FY18E CapEx guidance of Rs10bn. With $500mn QIP in 4Q17 and free cash generation, Hindalco has reduced its net debt by 20 percent on a YoY basis in FY17. The management remains focused on deleveraging and plans to spend only towards only low capital intensity projects. “Our commodity team expects aluminium prices to remain strong and we forecast mid-teens FCF yield to further strengthen the balance sheet,” said the Macquarie report. Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M): Overweight| Target Rs 1600| Upside 12% JPMorgan maintains an Overweight rating on M&M with a 12-month target price of Rs 1,600. M&M’s farm equipment market had a good year with Revenues/EBIT growing 23%/31%, respectively. Market share at 42.7 percent and margins at 17 percent are at multi-year high levels. F17 growth was aided by lower base over F16/15 and pent up demand. New product introductions/better distribution helped market share improvement. Jivo range of tractors targeting horticulture application has just been launched. “For F18 as well the company hopes that the industry will deliver double-digit volume growth aided by a normal monsoon,” said the JPMorgan report. Aurobindo Pharma: Overweight| Target Rs 800| Upside 35% JPMorgan maintains an Overweight rating on Aurobindo Pharma with a 12-months target price of Rs 800. Europe sales were muted in the quarter (flat on constant currency) but continued to improve profitability. However, Aurobindo remains confident of improving growth to 5-8 percent in the existing business aided by new launches and increasing supplies from the newly commissioned facility for Europe (transferred 69 products to India and commissioning of Unit 15 in Mar). This should be augmented by the recently concluded Generis acquisition (around 70 million euro annually). “Gross margin expansion in an existing business (from production in India), integration of Generis (~20+% margin) and expected synergies from the deal should improve profitability,” said the report. Britannia Industries: BUY| Target Rs 3,950| Upside 8% Citigroup maintains a buy rating on Britannia Industries but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 3,950 from Rs3700 earlier. Britannia continues to execute, a) distribution/penetration strategies, b) product initiatives, and, c) cost management drive which ensures it to deliver outsized growth in a tough market. The near-term volatility post demonetisation and GST transition aside, it remains one of the best plays in India's packaged foods market. “We estimate 11% / 18% revenue / EPS CAGR over FY17-19E. The management expects the market to pick up in next 3-6 months with which competitive intensity could also ease,” said the Citi report.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post.  Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 He is a member of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, and Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Musk said that he had done "all I can" to convince Trump to stay in the accord, and threatened to leave the presidential advisory councils if Trump announced a US exit from the accord.  Iger wrote on Twitter that "as a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal." He is leaving the business advisory group.  As a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the  #ParisAgreement withdrawal. — Robert Iger (@RobertIger) June 1, 2017 Uber Technologies CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration's immigration policies.  Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions.  The group is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group, and includes Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase.  BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink said last night he would continue to serve on Trump's CEO Forum, despite reservations about the White House decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.  "I accepted the invitation to serve on the President's CEO Forum because I believe I can contribute to the policy dialogue in Washington and serve as a voice for investors," Fink said in a statement.  "I am a strong believer that our industry needs to have a voice with governments around the world," said Fink, whose company is the world's largest asset manager, with $5.4 trillion under management.  "I do not agree with all of the president's policies and decisions, including today's announcement to exit the US from the Paris Agreement which I believe is a critical step forward in addressing climate change."  Asked about Musk's resignation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox News that "anybody who read the agreement and understood it would realise that this was not really about climate, this was about US money going to other countries and it didn’t solve the climate problem." Musk has met with Trump several times and spoken with him about the long-term goal of his company SpaceX for flights to Mars carrying humans.  Meanwhile, General Motors said its CEO Mary Barra would remain on the presidential advisory panel, adding that her participation "provides GM a seat at an important table to contribute to a constructive dialogue about key policy issues." In 2013, GM signed a declaration joining other major companies arguing that responding to climate change was good business.  The car maker said last night that despite the withdrawal it "will not waver from our commitment to the environment." Trump decision gets mixed response from US companies Donald Trump has said that withdrawing the US from the Paris climate accord would stave off an economic crisis and protect American jobs - but many American companies seemed to disagree.  Criticism of his decision rolled in from blue-chip companies like Facebook, Apple and Microsoft. And the response from fossil fuel groups with the most to gain from a relaxation of US carbon emissions standards was muted.  The president of the World Coal Association, Benjamin Sporton, told Reuters that he had mixed feelings about Trump's announcement, adding he was eager to see a US policy that actively promotes a place for coal in the global energy mix.  "What we really need to see, if the president wants to re-enter the deal, is that he can change the agreement to recognise the role of all sources of energy, including coal," Sporton said, He adding that his group had described to administration officials the benefits of remaining in the agreement.  The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's biggest trade group, meanwhile, issued a statement saying it had never taken an official position on the Paris accord. A number of its members, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, had publicly supported the deal.  "For us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change," Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods said. Some other groups expressed measured support for Trump's decision, saying it provided an opportunity to fix problems with the deal. Spokespeople for other extractive oil and mining groups, like the National Mining Association and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers, declined to comment on Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.  But a number of other business leaders derided it in forceful terms.  "Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the US's leadership position in the world," said Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein in his first-ever tweet.   Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreement — Lloyd Blankfein (@lloydblankfein) June 1, 2017 "Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government," tweeted General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt.  Apple's CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, posted to Twitter: "Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet" and "Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver". Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver. — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) June 2, 2017 "Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk," wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post.
