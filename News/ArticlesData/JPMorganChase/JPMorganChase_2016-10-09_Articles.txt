"Following" : "Follow"}} October 10, 2016 11:59am   Comments Share: Related CRM Salesforce's Strong Quarter Buoyed By Rebound In Billings Growth Salesforce's Momentum Improves As It Heads Into A Critical Q4 Salesforce coverage broadly confident subsequent Q3 report (Seeking Alpha) Related TWTR As Troll Hunt Begins, Vetr Upgrades Twitter Does Twitter's New Mute Feature Address Disney, Salesforce Concerns? The Social Messaging App Boom; Finding The Next Snapchat (Seeking Alpha) JPMorgan said in a research note on Monday that the market is undervaluing salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM), which it terms as the most valuable cloud asset. Analyst Mark Murphy said conversations with more than a dozen industry contacts reinforce his confidence in the favorable long-term outlook for the company. The positive opinion is premised on a trio of factors. Demand Going From Strength To Strength JPMorgan noted that partners see no sense of a drop in demand, with some even suggesting tremendous traction. The partners estimate an ongoing 20–30 percent growth trajectory, the firm noted. Einstein Feedback Positive The firm also stated that feedback on the company's news AI product "Einstein" is positive. This, according to the firm, will give salesforce.com controlling interest in some really interesting data. Related Link: Twitter Keeps Fluttering As More Bidders Lose Interest Lightning Bolt = Bright JPMorgan also highlighted the stronger than expected demand for Lightning Bolt and the combination of communities and demandware. Entry Point The firm sees the weakness created by the soft fiscal second quarter and a potentially expensive acquisition of Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) as an opportune entry point. JP Morgan expects the overhangs to fade away with a better pace of business in the third and fourth quarters and an eventual departure from the current Twitter discussion. Rating, Price Target Reiterated While noting that salesforce.com is trading near the bottom of its typical trading range of 5–8x of EV/sales, JPMorgan said it believes its long-term thesis that the company is one of the rare cloud assets with a multi-product success story and a long-term share gainer remains intact. As such, the firm reiterated its Overweight ratings and $95 price target on the shares of the company. At the time of writing, the shares of salesforce.com were up 6.07 percent at $75.19.

"It is my personal opinion that Brexit made the chances of the Eurozone not surviving in the next decade five times higher," JPMorgan Chase head Jamie Dimon said during an annual meeting of the Institute of International Finance in Washington. He was echoed by Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, who linked Brexit-related issues to the problem of the European Union's survival. At the same time, he warned that the British referendum's results would have "broader long-term consequences". "Brexit is an alert signal indicating that the EU should change, but everyone is busy with their own problems and this complicates the situation," according to Chase Vittorio Grilli, former Italian Finance Minister and the current head of JP Morgan Chase's  European division.  I think people sometimes forget the importance of the Eurozone to the UK economy #Brexit #Trade #liamfox pic.twitter.com/GKcdgKVA0B — Ryan Boothroyd (@BoothroydRyan) 29 сентября 2016 г.

Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem, for his part, said earlier this month that the EU-British agreement on the UK leaving the bloc will be a tough deal as Brussels is going to protect the integrity of the internal market, which implies retaining all four freedoms including the freedom of movement.

In July, French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said that the UK's decision to leave the European Union called for closer integration within the 19-nation euro area to curb economic fallout.

On June 23, the nationwide referendum on EU membership was held in the United Kingdom, in which 51.9 percent of voters said the country should leave the bloc.

UK isn't really a lynchpin of the EU; the EU is basically France-Germany. If France leaves, then it's all over. As for theEuro, UK isn't a part of the eurozone.

It takes some time for the corpse to decompose, though. Reply anne00marie 15:45 09.10.2016 | 4 | Edit | Delete Was the UK in the Eurozone? I thought owing to when Soros made £billions, on Black Wednesday, we could not join the Eurozone? These so called financial institutions, seem to ignore the fact that their main bank is bankrupt and the same would happen if BREXIT had not happened. Guess they need a scapegoat though.

By Reuters On 10/7/16 at 4:24 PM Close Hurricane Matthew Moves In A hurricane threatening the first direct hit on the United States in more than a decade could cause insurance losses of $25 billion to $30 billion and be the second costliest U.S. hurricane on record for insurers, according to initial industry estimates. Hurricane Matthew is just off the east coast of Florida near Cape Canaveral, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory on Friday, after killing hundreds of people in Haiti on its move north through the Caribbean. Sign up Sign up to our daily newsletter for up to date global news and features. <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> Data modelling firm RMS told clients earlier this week its initial estimates were a 42 percent chance of a $20 billion insurance loss and a 26 percent chance of a $30 billion loss from the hurricane, a source familiar with the research said. Ben Brookes, vice president capital markets at RMS told Reuters its guidance to clients was based on a single forecast, adding, "to project impact from this alone would be misleading. "We have continued to update our guidance as the situation changes," Brookes said, without giving further details. An estimate from Kinetic Analysis of insured losses of $25 billion would make Matthew "the second most costly hurricane in U.S. history behind Katrina", JPMorgan analysts said in a note late Thursday, referring to the hurricane which hit New Orleans and the surrounding coast in 2005. A Kinetic Analysis spokesman said its $25 billion estimate was made on Thursday and its current estimate was "considerably lower," without giving further detail. An empty highway is seen prior to the arrival of Hurricane Matthew in Miami Beach, Florida, October 6. Javier Galeano/Reuters Market participants were keeping a close track on the hurricane's movements. "People are looking at this literally every minute and working overnight on it," one trader said. The average impact to U.S. property and casualty insurers' book value from $10 billion to $30 billion of insured losses from the hurricane would equate to around a quarter's worth of earnings, the JPMorgan analysts added. Heritage Insurance Holdings gave a preliminary loss estimate on Friday of around $500 million. A $20 billion insured loss would match the insured losses caused by Hurricane Sandy in the northeast of the United States in 2012, which did not make landfall. A loss of this size would lead to "material risks" for Lloyd's of London insurers, analyst Ben Cohen at Canaccord Genuity said in a note on Friday. Cohen calculated a loss equivalent to Sandy would hit Beazley's earnings by $104 million, Hiscox's by 117 million pounds ($145 million) and Lancashire's by $39 million. Beazley estimates an $80 billion storm would cause a $200 million loss, a spokesman said, without specifying losses from a smaller disaster. A Hiscox spokeswoman said it was too early to judge the impact of the hurricane. A Lancashire spokesman also said it was early days, but the firm was feeling "relatively relaxed" about its losses because it was very lightly exposed to risk in Florida compared with other states in which it offers reinsurance for wind damage. The hurricane represented a "real test" of reinsurers' exposure, S&P Global said in a report, but it did not see a ratings impact, due to reinsurers' strong capital buffers.

Joshua Aaron Source: FBI Joshua Aaron, a Maryland native who attended Florida State University, has been held at a facility for illegal immigrants outside Moscow since failing to show police a valid passport during a midnight check at his apartment above the Beverly Hills Diner near downtown in May, court records show. He and two Israelis are suspected of perpetrating what U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara called “securities fraud on cyber steroids” from 2007 to mid-2015. They’re accused of stealing data on more than 100 million customers from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other companies, using it in schemes such as stock manipulation that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit gains. Along the way, members of the ring tried to extract nonpublic information from financial corporations, processed payment information for fake pharmaceuticals and fake anti-virus software, falsified passports and took control of a New Jersey credit union, prosecutors say. They used 75 companies and bank and brokerage accounts around the world to launder money, authorities allege. Mystery Hacker But one mystery of the case has remained: While Aaron, 32, and the two Israelis are described as the architects of a global cyber criminal enterprise, the identity of the hacker behind it all has remained unknown. Aaron’s frequent trips to Russia during the time the alleged schemes took place raises the possibility that he may have met in person with the hacker, who is believed to be Russian or Russian-speaking. His cooperation in the case could provide new insight into the country’s cyber underworld at a moment when U.S. officials are publicly accusing Russia of trying to destabilize the American elections with state-sponsored hacks. For a Q&A on cybersecurity, click here A Russian judge on May 20 ordered Aaron deported and fined him 5,000 rubles ($80) for violating the rules of his three-year visa, which requires holders to exit and re-enter the country every six months. Aaron arrived via Ukraine on May 23, 2015 -- just weeks before the U.S. issued arrest warrants for him and co-defendants Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein. A second judge rejected his appeal of the deportation ruling in June 2016. Russian Reciprocity Aaron applied for a refugee status early June, according to court documents. The argument for the request was that he would be subject to a disproportionate punishment in the U.S., according to people with knowledge of the petition. Russian authorities declined the request and Aaron submitted an appeal that is still being reviewed, these people said. In a statement to Russian prosecutors on the day of his detention, Aaron said he wasn’t aware of the arrest warrant issued about a year earlier and denied breaking any U.S. laws. Russia, which doesn’t extradite its citizens or have an extradition treaty with the U.S., offered to hand him over in exchange for a “reciprocal” act, but received no reply from the U.S. Embassy, according to court transcripts. He is presumably free to leave Russia for a county of his choice. Talks between Aaron’s lawyers and U.S. officials are progressing and a deal paving the way for his return home, where he would be subject to immediate arrest, may be reached this month, the people familiar with the matter said. Aaron’s parents, who live in Potomac, Maryland, didn’t respond to a request for comment and it’s not clear who is serving as Aaron’s lawyer in the U.S. Aaron declined to comment via his Moscow lawyer, Ashot Muradyan. Snowden, Putin Russia has a history of sheltering alleged criminals actively sought by Washington, particularly now that disputes from Ukraine to Syria and U.S. accusations of Russian hacking have driven relations to a post-Cold War low. Edward Snowden, the NSA whistle-blower who was lauded by President Vladimir Putin for disclosing mass surveillance programs, lives comfortably in Russia, as does Semion Mogilevich, who spent years on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list for being “the most dangerous mobster in the world.” For a Q&A on hacking U.S. elections, click here The U.S. Embassy in Moscow and James Margolin, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan, declined to comment, as did Russian Interior Ministry officials. Kelly Langmesser, a spokeswoman for the FBI in New York, said Aaron wasn’t presently in U.S. custody and declined to comment further. Ilya Sachkov, head of Moscow-based cyberforensics firm Group-IB, called Aaron’s case particularly "strange," the first one he knows of involving a U.S. citizen accused of cybercrime who was then detained in Russia. “Naturally, he is not alone, and his group most probably includes Russian citizens,” Sachkov said. "Putin and Obama agreed to cooperate against cybercriminals. This case doesn’t look like there is any cooperation." Fidelity, E*Trade While Russia may consider Aaron little more than a bit player in its contentious relationship with Washington, he may have substantial value for U.S. prosecutors, allowing them to push their case deeper into Russia’s underground. One court document identifies a co-conspirator in the scheme as “a computer hacker who is believed to have resided in Russia.” Two people familiar with the case say his identity is known to U.S. officials and describe him as highly skilled. Aside from JPMorgan, companies that have confirmed being attacked by Aaron’s group include Fidelity Investments Ltd., E*Trade Financial Corp., Scottrade Financial Services Inc. and Dow Jones & Co., a unit of News Corp. Aaron, who has been living in Russia with his Israeli wife, speaks only a few words of Russian. During his immigration proceedings, the court hired an interpreter for Aaron but he couldn’t translate "administrative code violation," according to people who were in the courtroom. If Aaron does return to the U.S, he’ll join his alleged co-conspirators. Israeli authorities detained Shalon and Orenstein within a month of the arrest warrants being issued in the summer of 2015 and extradited them to New York this July.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 10, 2016 10:00am   Comments Share: Related TSN Watch These 3 Huge Put Purchases In Friday Trade Worst Performing Industries For November 9, 2016 Chicken producers hit by price-fixing allegations again (Seeking Alpha) Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN) shares were down 8.9 percent on Friday following a complaint of alleged collusion among chicken producers. Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation (NASDAQ: PPC) and Sanderson Farms, Inc. (NASDAQ: SAFM) shares also sold off more than 4 percent each on the news. JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman doesn’t believe the complaint will ultimately have much of an impact on the companies mentioned above. Instead, he believes that much of Tyson’s Friday selloff can be attributed to a Pivotal downgrade on Friday. The firm cut Tyson’s rating from Buy to Sell. JPMorgan, on the other hand, maintains its Neutral rating for Tyson. Related Link: Tyson Foods Doesn't Like Being Sued Or Downgraded “At this time, there seems to be insufficient evidence in the complaint, in our opinion, of any meetings, conversations, or any actual collusion,” Goldman explains. According to Goldman, the complaint is primarily focused on the fact that the chicken industry pools certain anonymous data on plant efficiency. The complaint alleges that the industry may have cut back production based on this data and artificially restrained supply. In fact, JPMorgan believes this data isn't relied upon to make any important business decisions. Goldman adds that Sanderson’s inclusion in the complaint is puzzling given the fact that the company has increased production by 55 percent since 2008. Ironically, the major reason JPMorgan is not bullish on Tyson is because the firm is expecting chicken fundamentals to worsen in the next year due to increases in production.

Concerns over Deutsche Bank AG’s mounting legal costs deepened the gloom. Mary Callahan Erdoes Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg Slow growth is leaving companies little reason to expand, fueling the public’s frustration and giving rise to extreme political views and nationalism, said Erdoes, 49, who runs JPMorgan’s asset-management operations. Low interest rates -- instead of better fiscal stimulus -- are taking a toll on the entire system, she said. “We had a very smart economist at JPMorgan ask me the following question: How do you have capitalism without any cost of capital? And therein lies the problem.” The 1,600 finance executives attended panel discussions at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, a short walk from the Washington Monument. Among their biggest targets for criticism were international stimulus efforts. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President Gary Cohn called the world’s central banks an “ineffective cartel,” as actions in Europe and Japan lead to negative rates and hamstring other policy makers. The outlook for low growth is long-term, he said. For a QuickTake explainer on the world of low interest rates, click here “I don’t see this changing,” Cohn said Friday. “We keep saying we’re getting closer to the end, but I don’t think we’re getting closer to the end.” Getting Messier Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz SE, agreed that central banks have lost an edge in an era of “ultra-low and negative interest rates.” He said companies have become more risk-averse. “As we look to the next five years, I think that the world of low growth destroys itself,” El-Erian, who is also a columnist for Bloomberg View, said at a panel discussion on Saturday. “Politically it’s getting messier and messier,” influencing rate policy and leading to moves like Brexit. Bank leaders including Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said tougher rules sparked by the 2008 financial crisis, while necessary, may now be another drag on the economy, and firms must figure out a way to prosper. “If you want higher growth, you have got to let banks do what they do,” Gorman said. “This is an industry which is essential to global economic growth. The challenge is, we’re all in this together. So the banks have to collectively raise themselves to a standard of, not perfection, but global professionalism.” Brexit Horror The U.K.’s expected exit from the European Union after a referendum this year looks to be painful and “horrific,” Standard Chartered Plc CEO Bill Winters said at the conference. Others echoed his thoughts. “I’m afraid I don’t see anything good here,” said David Wright, chair of EuroFi, during a Thursday discussion. “I see a host of second- and third-class decisions to be made. It’s bad for the U.K., for sure. It’s bad for Europe, for sure.” Shares of the entire financial industry have swung in recent weeks on news that the U.S. Justice Department asked Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to settle an investigation into mortgage-backed securities. The bank has said it expects U.S. authorities to scale back their initial request, and that it has ample cash. Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank is a counterparty to the largest European and U.S. banks. While the Frankfurt-based firm’s struggles weren’t the focus of the conference on stage, executives acknowledged there are financial and reputational risks whenever a member of the interconnected financial system flails. Bankers huddled around coffee urns or over cocktails in the evening, discussing possible outcomes of the Deutsche Bank situation, whether the German government would be involved financially, what the repercussions for the European economy and their own firms could be. The latest rumors were shared, as well as advice for executives of the embattled firm. The German lender hosted an opening-night reception for conference attendees at Smithsonian’s Renwick Gallery, a stone’s throw from the White House and several blocks from the Department of Justice. CEO John Cryan attended. Over the weekend, German newspaper Bild said he also went to Washington to help negotiate a settlement. The talks are continuing, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Adjusting Businesses “I have little doubt that Deutsche Bank will find its way through these problems,” Winters said in an interview during the conference. “John Cryan is doing exactly the right things to work through a difficult situation. I’m not saying it’s going to be easy, but they seem to be developing a relationship with their own government that’s intended to resolve their open issues.”  The bankers, who gathered from regions including Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe, heard from a panel that global recovery remains slow and uneven, with growth expected to pick up only slightly next year -- mostly on account of emerging markets. Persistently low growth has exposed “underlying structural weaknesses, and risks further dampening potential growth and prospects for inclusiveness,” the panel found. Bank executives said they were trying to adapt to the new environment. “We’re clearly aware of the need to adjust our business models,’’ Societe Generale SA CEO Frederic Oudea said. “We’re managing a transition that’s tough.” Dimon’s Slogan JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said at a Friday discussion that “monetary authorities are trying to figure out” what to do, but that the system lacks coordination. Policy makers failed to pass immigration reform, aren’t spending enough on infrastructure and are enacting onerous regulations, he said. “Fiscal policy and monetary policy -- if we got those things right I think we would have extra growth,” Dimon said. Instead, “wherever I travel in the world, I’m just overwhelmed by comments from clients on what they can’t do because of rules.” Asked if he would want to enter politics one day, Dimon replied that he would “love” to be president but wouldn’t run. He flashed a smile -- a cheerful moment amid the downbeat proceedings. “My slogan: Make America Fun Again.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Skip to main content The Online Recruitment Resource Search form Search MENU Main menu News Directory Events Magazine Forum Advertise Contact Us Subscribe to our newsletter Navigating Brexit: UK recruitment Posted inNews archive on10 Oct 2016 James Local, Director at Livingstone It seems barely a day goes by without the impact of Brexit on the UK economy hitting the news. While most agree that the historic vote in June will have major repercussions for the UK, opinion remains divided on what this might look like, with “uncertainty” the watch-word, especially in recruitment circles. In the immediate aftermath of the leave vote, global stock markets lost $2 trillion, the FTSE lost £100bn in two days and the pound slumped to a 31 year low and. However within a week the FTSE 100 had recouped those losses and by August the FTSE 250 hit record highs. Digging deeper, the impact of Brexit isn’t being felt equally. Shares in RBS and Lloyds were suspended from trading and have continued to fall precipitously. Housebuilders, travel companies and airlines have also fared poorly. In contrast, defensive support services businesses, exporters, commodity players and companies with dollar-denominated revenues have bounced back strongly. This leaves a complicated picture for recruiters to make sense of and requires an understanding of the key moving pieces in the Brexit jigsaw. “Take back control of our borders” was a galvanizing message for Brexiteers throughout the referendum. The impact of immigration (perceived or real) on many communities was a key issue that swung the vote. One contentious argument was that rising immigration from the EU was responsible for reduced employment for UK residents. The March 2016 ONS report on migration does indeed show that “net migration remains at record levels” and that “work remains the main reason for migration”. However, immigration of EU citizens remains lower than that of non-EU citizens, and at the same time, the UK’s unemployment rate of 5.2% in 2015 was the lowest since 2006. These statistics come in to sharp focus in light of Brexit. Mr Tusk was “crystal clear that access to the single market requires acceptance of all four freedoms - including freedom of movement”. This dynamic explains the uncertain outlook for the UK. Which competing force will be felt most keenly around the negotiating table? Will we trade access to the EU single market for a reduction in EU immigrants and if so, is that a sensible trade for UK plc to make? One of the prime beneficiaries of the single market is the UK’s financial and insurance sector. These companies rely on the ability to “passport” their regulatory approvals across the EU without having to re-apply in each country. The FCA recently revealed that over 5,500 UK companies rely on the financial passport to do business with other EEA member states. The foundation of their business is potentially under threat. In a report to the Commons in February 2015, it was reported that the finance sector contributes 75% of the UK services trade balance, 11% of tax receipts and 1.1 million jobs (or 3.4% of the UK total). Before the referendum, JPMorgan, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Deutsche all publicly stated they would relocate employees in the wake of a Brexit vote. JPMorgan alone quoted at least 4,000 would be moved to the continent. Given that “efforts to secure an appropriate arrangement for UK-based firms will be one of the most challenging aspects of the negotiations about the UK’s future relationship with the EU” The immediate negative consequences of the vote should therefore come as no surprise. However, even after time for some calm reflection people remain worried. The OECD has halved its UK growth outlook for 2017 and research from The Federation of Small Businesses reported that UK small business confidence has fallen into negative territory for the first time since 2012 A September report from the CBI report the proportion of asset management firms considering hiring over the next three months has slowed to 11 per cent, down from 68 per cent in March. The August Manpower Employment Outlook Survey reported employers were less optimistic about adding jobs especially in financial services, construction and utilities, and in its half year results, SThree attributed the underperformance of its UK business in Q3 to a slow-down of hiring in the banking and financial markets And yet as stock markets recover, recruiters have cause for optimism. August’s Recruitment & Employment Confederation’s JobsOutlook survey shows 24% of employers will take on more permanent staff in the next three months and 64% said they would maintain their existing headcount. In August, for the first time in 2016, 7% of small firms have reported an increase in headcount. There was good news too from the UK’s listed recruiters in several specific sectors. James Reed reported an 8% jump in new jobs, Empressario have seen good performance in the technical & industrial sector, Staffline reported resilience in its core food and processing business and CPL continues to see strength in clinical hiring. Clearly the impact of Brexit is not being felt evenly. Underlying trends in the UK market persevere. For example, there is still a critical shortage of teachers with 73% of LEA’s complaining there are too few candidates. The problem is spread across the UK and is particularly acute in Maths and languages. Newly qualified teachers in these subjects are commanding £4k “golden hellos” – a sure sign that demand is outstripping supply. Similarly recruiters to the UK manufacturing sector are performing well. The August MarkitCIPS report showed the purchasing managers’ index has risen to 53.3 in August, up from July's figure of 48.3. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. Bouyed by a weakening pound, recruitment in this sector, especially in short term placements, continues to grow. In the run up to the referendum, the Recruitment & Employment Confederation’s Jobs Outlook survey reported two thirds of employers were going to postpone recruitment decisions in the hope the vote would bring clarity to their crystal ball. In reality, it has become clear the UK is entering a prolonged period of uncertainty. We don’t know when Article 50 will be invoked and start the ticking of the two year clock. We also don’t know what Brexit is likely to look like when we eventually get there. If businesses choose to retain a cautious outlook and sit on their hands, they could well find themselves on ice for several years. It is likely the successful recruitment agencies will be the ones focusing on the sectors and clients who are able to disentangle the many opportunities and who are brave enough to go after them.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 10, 2016 at 6:15PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. I've spent most of my waking hours over the past five years immersed in banking. I've read dozens of books, talked to numerous high-level executives at many of the nation's biggest banks, and spent countless hours wading through the impenetrable financial documents that banks file each quarter with the Securities and Exchange Commission. From this, I learned that not all banks and bankers are bad, as many Americans are inclined to believe in light of the abuses that took place in the industry over the past few decades. One bank I always cited as a positive example was Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). But my opinion on Wells Fargo has changed in the wake of its fake-account scandal. I no longer feel comfortable supporting a bank that appears to have treated its employees, not to mention its customers, the way it did. I will reconsider this after Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf is fired or resigns. Why I was a believer in Wells Fargo Let me be clear about one thing: I don't think Wells Fargo's stock is a dud. I own it. Warren Buffett owns it. And I suspect it will continue to provide decent returns for investors in the future. The most impressive thing about Wells Fargo is that, unlike so many of its peers, it's been able to maintain its discipline through thick and thin. Banking, like most industries, is cyclical. When the economy is roaring ahead, banks make a ton of money. The demand for loans soars, and defaults on those loans plunge. But when the economy takes a turn for the worse, these trends reverse course with vigor. You can get a sense for this by looking at what happened to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) in the 2008 financial crisis. "In the boom we pushed cards through the branches and in mass mailings," Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan told Fortune's Shawn Tully in 2011. "To drive growth we gave cards to people who couldn't afford them." This decision went on to cost Bank of America upwards of $60 billion in losses when all was said and done. The key to running a great bank, then, is to navigate through these cycles. This is particularly important when you consider that most banks are leveraged by a factor of 10-to-1, which makes running a bank akin to tap-dancing on a pin top. You want to take advantage of a cycle's upswing but not overdo it by giving loans to anyone and everyone with a pulse. You then want to take advantage of the downswing, as your less prudent peers retreat and retrench to lick their wounds. The bank that has done this best through the years is M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB), a regional lender based in upstate New York that's run by the indomitable Robert Wilmers. M&T Bank has produced one of the best returns in the bank industry, if not the best, since Wilmers took over in 1983. And it's done so in large part by acquiring competitors for pennies on the dollar during downturns in the credit cycle. Most recently, M&T Bank purchased its downstate rival Hudson City Bancorp four years ago for a substantial discount to book value. (Regulators approved the deal last year.) Dimon and Buffett on banking You don't have to take my word for the fact that this is how banking works. "No one has the right to not assume that the business cycle will turn," implored Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, in the lead-up to the last crisis. "Every five years or so, you have got to assume that something bad will happen." And here's Buffett writing on this point in his 1990 letter to shareholders: The banking business is no favorite of ours. When assets are 20 times equity -- a common ratio in this industry -- mistakes that involve only a small portion of assets can destroy a major portion of equity. And mistakes have been the rule rather than the exception at many major banks. Most have resulted from a managerial failing that we described last year when discussing the institutional imperative: the tendency of executives to mindlessly imitate the behavior of their peers, no matter how foolish it may be to do so. The irony is that Buffett wrote this in the course of explaining why Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) acquired 10% of Wells Fargo's outstanding common stock in 1989 and 1990. And at least up until the fake-account scandal hit last month, Buffett has been vindicated. As Stumpf and his predecessor, Richard Kovacevich. wrote in their 2007 shareholder letter, which would have been drafted in early 2008, just before the financial crisis struck with full force: Our company maintained its credit risk discipline reasonably well during the years of excessive risk taking in our industry. Unlike many of our competitors, we did not make option adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) -- consistent with our responsible lending principles. We did not make negative-amortization ARMs. We offered in only a very few instances, below certain credit scores, stated-income mortgages and low- and no-documentation mortgages. Because of our prudent lending to customers with less than prime credit and our decision not to make negative amortization loans, we estimate we lost between two and four percent in mortgage origination market share from 2004 to 2006. That translates into losing between $60 billion and $120 billion in mortgage originations in 2006 alone. We're glad we did. Such lending would have been economically unsound and not right for many borrowers. By avoiding the worst corners of the subprime-mortgage market, Wells Fargo, like M&T Bank, found itself in an enviable position in the aftermath of the crisis. Its chairman at the time, Kovacevich, was even considering rejecting TARP money from the government, until then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson forced the bank to take it by threatening to have regulators deem it capital-deficient if it didn't. But even before Wells Fargo received the government's infusion of capital, it was strong enough in October 2008 to acquire larger rival Wachovia. The deal was consummated at a 70% discount to book value. How Wells Fargo achieved this What is it about Wells Fargo that enabled it to perform so well through the second-worst economic downturn since the Great Depression? Part of it is culture. "When Berkshire bought Wells Fargo, the world was unglued in a real estate lending-driven banking panic," Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger said earlier this year. "We knew their bank lending officers weren't ordinary. They grew up in the garment district as cynics and were careful and better [than others]." Just like Buffett and Dimon, in other words, Wells Fargo's risk-management team has demonstrated throughout the years that it understands how important it is to maintain credit discipline throughout all stages of the credit cycle, not just after everything has come crashing down. But -- and this is an important point -- another reason Wells Fargo has been able to navigate through the unpredictable vicissitudes of the credit cycle is that it operates so efficiently. Most banks spend 60% or more of their net revenue on operating expenses. Wells Fargo, by contrast, tends to come in comfortably below 60%. Its efficiency ratio in the latest quarter, for instance, was only 58%. Because this translates into fatter profits for the California-based bank, it also means that there's less pressure on it to reach for yield in its asset portfolio by underwriting unacceptably risky loans. What we're starting to discover, however, is that Wells Fargo's efficiency ratio may have been artificially inflated by the overly aggressive sales tactics that caused 5,300 of its branch-based employees to open millions of fake deposit and credit card accounts for unwitting customers. This factors into the efficiency ratio because selling additional financial products to customers, whether they want them or not, boosts the bank's revenue. And revenue is the denominator in the efficiency ratio. Thus, higher revenue translates into a lower efficiency ratio. Wells Fargo will tell you that the 2 million or so fake accounts the bank's employees opened didn't actually generate that much revenue. The figure they've provided is $2.6 million, which was how much it refunded to customers "for any fees associated with products customers received that they may not have requested." That's not even a rounding error when you consider that Wells Fargo earns $5.5 billion or more a quarter. The last straw But the problem with this explanation is that it ignores the much larger amount of revenue that Wells Fargo has earned through the years from accounts that were lawfully opened but shouldn't have been. We now know that Wells Fargo's employees were pushed incredibly hard to cross-sell things such as credit cards and additional deposit accounts to customers who had no need for them. Take this exchange between Robert Smith, the co-host of NPR's Planet Money podcast, and a former Wells Fargo employee named Ashley: Smith: Ashley remembers one day when a man comes into the bank branch. Ashley: He was elderly. He had a cane. He was on his own. The teller had sent him over to me the first day I met him because he was overdraft. And he couldn't understand why he was negative. And he was saying, "All I want is to buy a newspaper. Why can't I buy my newspaper?" Smith: Ashley pulls up his account on her computer. And she notices something really strange. This man was living off Social Security. He got around $1,100 a month, and yet ... Ashley: Well, he had accrued, I think, over $200 in overdrafts. And when I looked at his accounts, he had six different accounts. He had no understanding of the accounts he had. He just said, "Oh, this nice lady explained to me that I needed this new account package," like it wasn't an option for him. I felt so terrible for this man. Ashley voided as many fees as she could, given the authorization she had, but then transferred money from her own account to cover the rest of them. And that isn't even the worst part. Ashley was later fired by Wells Fargo for failing to cross-sell enough financial products. And the bank took it one step further by making it impossible for her to ever get another job in the bank industry. Here's Planet Money's Smith and co-host Chris Arnold: Arnold: As far as Ashley, she started to refuse to meet her quota. She was just saying, "Look, I can't ethically do this." She was calling the Wells Fargo ethics line trying to explain this, but eventually Wells Fargo fired her. Smith: Ashley tried to get another job in banking, but she found that she never made it very far past the initial interviews. She suspected that Wells Fargo had put some sort of black mark on her record somewhere. And it turns out that is exactly the case. Wells Fargo wasn't joking around when they said they would make it hard for her to find work again. Arnold: No. Wells Fargo wrote her up on what's called a U5 document. It's like a report card for bankers, basically. We tracked it down, and we asked Ashley to read what it said. Ashley: "Failure to perform job duties." Smith: Any bank, any bank that Ashley applies to will see this line -- "failed to do job duties." Arnold: The form does not mention that those job duties were the sales goals that everyone we spoke to said were unrealistic and that are at the center of a series of ongoing investigations at the state and federal level. Smith: It just says "failed to do job duties." It was the first time Ashley had seen it in print. Ashley: It's like having a black cloud that's kind of looming behind you. And I'm always trying to get in front of the cloud, out of the cloud, into the sunshine, but it's always there. And, to be clear, this isn't an isolated incident. There are many reports from other employees saying essentially these very same things. One employee was even fired after sending an email to John Stumpf about the creation of fake accounts. Look, I'm very pro-bank. And I think most bankers are good, decent people. But this is unacceptable. It's time for Stumpf to go. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

Economic headwinds could batter big banks, and in case you didn't know, Bank of America stock is a bet on big banks By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 7, 2016, 10:06 am EST     Popular Posts: Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is a Post-Election Casualty Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Has a New Path to Bigger Profits Buffett Bails on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Stock. Should You? Recent Posts: Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Can Save Itself With This Move Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Looks Even Better With Urban Strategy Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Stock Light on Revenue, But Can Explain View All Posts Shares in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) have been on a tear lately. Since hitting their low for the year of $11.11 in February, Bank of America stock is up by one-third. Investors got another chance to buy it at $12.18 in June, but since then, BAC has been on a steady rise, and opened for trading on Oct. 7 at over $16. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr Our Serge Berger likes what he sees, and now has BAC stock on his buying radar. But buying right this second could be a trap. The price-to-earnings multiple on the stock is up to 14, higher than peers like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) or Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC). BofA reports earnings in 10 days, and analysts are hoping for 35 cents p[er share, on revenue of $20.76 billion. That sounds good, but would fall short of last quarter’s 37 cents per share, or the 36 cents per share achieved in the same quarter a year ago — when BAC shares were lower than they are now. Though Bank of America stock’s valuation looks a little better this morning — but only because of a disappointing jobs report that put a damper on interest-rate hike hopes. There also is a global economic storm coming, a financial hurricane that will batter global business, and hurt the bank’s results. Who says so? Bank of America says so. Merrill Lynch’s Warning We are reaching “peak everything.” Those were the words of Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America has owned now for nearly a decade. Bullish trends that have boosted globalization and liquidity look set to reverse, Hartnett’s team wrote yesterday. Politicians are increasingly anti-immigrant and anti-trade. There is a backlash against inequality. The global investment map is being withdrawn. Bonds are out, commodities and equities are back in. That means the value of assets banks like Bank of America hold on their books is due to fall. It means things like oil and gold are going to look like better investments. Market sectors that have underperformed in the past year are due to outperform. Does any of that sound good for Bank of America stock holders? A Political Call It should be emphasized, in a political year, that this is something of a political call, and one that is backward-looking. The Brexit vote, and that government’s decision to pursue an exit from the European Union regardless of the economic consequences, has unnerved markets. The rise of ultra-nationalists across Europe, Asia and the U.S. has bankers battening down the hatches like Floridians before Hurricane Matthew. Political trends can reverse, in response to economic action, but for now other analysts are heeding Bank of America’s warning and downgrading its stock. Vetr has downgraded BAC stock, and Zacks just says “sell.” I am personally more sanguine about the economic outlook than most, because I’m more hopeful about the political outlook. Trends may already be reversing, at least if 538.com is to be believed. That doesn’t mean I’m going to jump on BAC shares this morning. When investors or analysts panic, I like to wait it out before going for bargains. But the price-to-book of Bank of America stock remains 0.7 — dirt-cheap by historical standards, and rising interest rates (eventually) do mean money will get a price. In a few months, BofA might look very interesting. Dana Blankenhorn is a financial journalist who dabbles in fiction, his latest being The Reluctant Detective Travels in Time.

DB’s woes, along with the scandal at America’s largest bank by market capitalization, Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC), has renewed public interest in breaking up the biggest bank stocks. Source: Metropolico.org via Flickr The market seems to perceive a government-driven big bank breakup as bad news for bank stocks, but breakups might actually go a long way in unlocking shareholder value. Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) and WFC stock holders stand to gain the most. Turning Up the Heat on Bank Stocks A number of Wall Street analysts have suggested that big bank stocks should consider splitting up on their own as a strategy to combat lagging share prices. It’s been eight years since the financial crisis, yet BAC and Citigroup still trade below tangible book value. 5 Top Stocks to Buy for October Back in January 2015, Goldman Sachs suggested that JPM stock could see 25% upside if the company split into up to four different public companies. In March, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl projected that a Citigroup breakup could produce nearly 60% upside for Citigroup stock. Analysts at JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and CLSA have all been making the value argument for years. This year, there has been a surge in activist investor interest in breaking up financial stocks as well. Carl Icahn has publicly called for American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) to break its business into three companies. Activist investor Bartlett Naylor has been calling on the board members of BAC, JPM and Citigroup to form committees to study the potential impact of breakups. The Benefits of Breaking up Bank Stocks Bank breakups make a lot of sense. Politicians like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have made big banks their primary campaign targets. Not only would breakups be good PR for Washington, it would likely reduce the amount of bank-bashing on the campaign trail and in the media. By shrinking down, bank stocks can also avoid some of the suffocating regulations that have weighed on margins. Earlier this year, Metlife Inc (NYSE:MET) announced a spinoff of its retail business. The spinoff allowed the parent company to avoid Systemically Important Financial Institution status. SIFI designation comes with a huge amount of regulatory headaches. Other big banks and financial institutions may soon follow Metlife’s lead. Finally, the WFC fraud debacle highlights yet another advantage of breakups. Smaller, simpler banks with more specialized balance sheets paint a much clearer picture of investment risks. One of the major reasons that big bank stocks are so cheap is because the big banks lack transparency. Massive, convoluted balance sheets leave investors uncertain about what is actually going on inside such large, complicated companies. Don’t Fear the Breakup Big bank investors shouldn’t worry about potential breakups. First of all, it’s unlikely that the government will step in and force the issue. If you’re worried about Hillary Clinton or congress breaking up banks, ask yourself one question. How often do politicians actually do what they say they’re going to do? Breaking up the banks would be a legal and regulatory nightmare for Washington. I seriously doubt any politician actually wants that mess on his or her hands. Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Surges Back to Life Second, if the banks decide to break up on their own, it will likely be very good news for shareholders. The banks wouldn’t pursue a radical move like a breakup unless they were confident that it would unlock value. In fact, in the current low interest rate environment, any news about breakups could be the best reason to buy bank stocks these days. As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But Craig Erlam, sr. market analyst at Oanda, based in London thinks investors are anxious for an earnings rebound. "I think people want to start seeing earnings growth again. Video provided by TheStreet Newslook Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 7, 2016 in New York City. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) U.S. stocks kicked off the new week with sharp gains as oil prices rallied and Wall Street readies for the start of the third--quarter earnings season and awaits more news from the Federal Reserve and watches politics in the homestretch to the presidential election. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 88.55 points, or 0.5%, to 18,329.04. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index was up 9.92, or 0.5%, to 2163.66 and the Nasdaq composite rose 36.27, or  0.7%, to 5328.67 and briefly traded above its record closing high. A rally in the oil patch powered stocks, with U.S.-produced crude jumping 3% to $51.34 a barrel. Oil stocks rose with the Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE) up 1.7%. All eyes on Wall Street are on corporate earnings this week, as the reporting season kicks off unofficially Tuesday with results from aluminum maker Alcoa and gains more import on Friday with reports from three major banks (Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase). The outlook for overall profits for the S&P 500 is not bright, as analysts are expecting earnings to contract 0.7% in the third quarter, which if it occurs would mark the fifth straight quarter of negative growth, according to earnings tracker Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. USA TODAY 10 smart money moves to make that take 10 minutes The Federal Reserve and interest rates will also be a topic of discussion, following a solid but slight miss Friday on the September jobs report. The 156,000 new jobs created last month were below the 170,000 jobs analysts' had expected, but job creation was still strong enough to keep the nation's central bank on track for its first interest rate hike of the year later this year, with Wall Street placing odds of roughly 60% of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting. Wall Street will get more insight into the Fed's thinking this week on Wednesday from the release of the Fed's minutes of its September meeting, as well as a full slate of speeches on tap this week from Fed members, including a speech Friday from Fed chair Janet Yellen in Boston. The U.S. bond market is closed for the Columbus Day holiday. (The 10-year Treasury closed at 1.722% Friday.) Stock markets in Japan, Hong Kong and Canada were also closed. The threat of rising interest rates has hurt so-called stocks that pay out sizable dividends, or so-called bond proxies, in recent weeks. The utilities sector in the S&P 500, for example, has fallen sharply the past few weeks, and telecom stocks and real estate shares have also suffered. "We are now heading into earnings season and of course, this nightmarish election; pay attention," says Gary Kaltbaum, president of money-management firm Kaltbaum Capital Management. Indeed, politics is also in focus, following the second presidential debate Sunday night between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Markets will continue to monitor presidential polls to try to gauge which candidate has a better chance of capturing the White House. "Traders are digesting last night's U.S. presidential debate, which many believe kept the odds in favor of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton," Josh Selway of Schaeffer's Investment Research, said via e-mail. In individual stock news, shares of Twitter (TWTR) fell 11% amid news reports that bidders might not materialize to purchase the troubled social media company. Shares of Mylan (MYL) rose more than 8% after the company settled ($465 million) with the U.S. government for overcharging for its EpiPen treatments. USA TODAY Twitter tumbles as buzz on sale disappears Investors continue to eye the British pound, which has been under pressure in the past week since Britain prime minister Theresa May said the UK would trigger talks to split from the European Union in the first quarter of 2017 and also stressed that immigration issues were more important than access to the EU's single market system. On Friday, the pound suffered a so-called "flash crash," tumbling more than 6% vs. the dollar in a matter of minutes, before rebounding and cutting its losses to roughly 2%. In early trading Monday, the pound was down another 0.4% vs. the dollar and at a 31-year low vs. the greenback. Stocks were higher in the UK and Europe. London's FTSE 100 index, an index full of companies that support a lot of goods and therefore benefit from a weaker pound, rose 0.8%. Shares were 1.3% higher in Germany, up 1.1% in Paris and the broad Stoxx Europe 600 index was 0.7% higher.

But Craig Erlam, sr. market analyst at Oanda, based in London thinks investors are anxious for an earnings rebound. "I think people want to start seeing earnings growth again. Video provided by TheStreet Newslook Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 7, 2016 in New York City. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) U.S. stocks kicked off the new week with sharp gains as oil prices rallied and Wall Street readies for the start of the third--quarter earnings season and awaits more news from the Federal Reserve and watches politics in the homestretch to the presidential election. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 88.55 points, or 0.5%, to 18,329.04. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index was up 9.92, or 0.5%, to 2163.66 and the Nasdaq composite rose 36.27, or  0.7%, to 5328.67 and briefly traded above its record closing high. A rally in the oil patch powered stocks, with U.S.-produced crude jumping 3% to $51.34 a barrel. Oil stocks rose with the Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE) up 1.7%. All eyes on Wall Street are on corporate earnings this week, as the reporting season kicks off unofficially Tuesday with results from aluminum maker Alcoa and gains more import on Friday with reports from three major banks (Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase). The outlook for overall profits for the S&P 500 is not bright, as analysts are expecting earnings to contract 0.7% in the third quarter, which if it occurs would mark the fifth straight quarter of negative growth, according to earnings tracker Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. USA TODAY 10 smart money moves to make that take 10 minutes The Federal Reserve and interest rates will also be a topic of discussion, following a solid but slight miss Friday on the September jobs report. The 156,000 new jobs created last month were below the 170,000 jobs analysts' had expected, but job creation was still strong enough to keep the nation's central bank on track for its first interest rate hike of the year later this year, with Wall Street placing odds of roughly 60% of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting. Wall Street will get more insight into the Fed's thinking this week on Wednesday from the release of the Fed's minutes of its September meeting, as well as a full slate of speeches on tap this week from Fed members, including a speech Friday from Fed chair Janet Yellen in Boston. The U.S. bond market is closed for the Columbus Day holiday. (The 10-year Treasury closed at 1.722% Friday.) Stock markets in Japan, Hong Kong and Canada were also closed. The threat of rising interest rates has hurt so-called stocks that pay out sizable dividends, or so-called bond proxies, in recent weeks. The utilities sector in the S&P 500, for example, has fallen sharply the past few weeks, and telecom stocks and real estate shares have also suffered. "We are now heading into earnings season and of course, this nightmarish election; pay attention," says Gary Kaltbaum, president of money-management firm Kaltbaum Capital Management. Indeed, politics is also in focus, following the second presidential debate Sunday night between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Markets will continue to monitor presidential polls to try to gauge which candidate has a better chance of capturing the White House. "Traders are digesting last night's U.S. presidential debate, which many believe kept the odds in favor of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton," Josh Selway of Schaeffer's Investment Research, said via e-mail. In individual stock news, shares of Twitter (TWTR) fell 11% amid news reports that bidders might not materialize to purchase the troubled social media company. Shares of Mylan (MYL) rose more than 8% after the company settled ($465 million) with the U.S. government for overcharging for its EpiPen treatments. USA TODAY Twitter tumbles as buzz on sale disappears Investors continue to eye the British pound, which has been under pressure in the past week since Britain prime minister Theresa May said the UK would trigger talks to split from the European Union in the first quarter of 2017 and also stressed that immigration issues were more important than access to the EU's single market system. On Friday, the pound suffered a so-called "flash crash," tumbling more than 6% vs. the dollar in a matter of minutes, before rebounding and cutting its losses to roughly 2%. In early trading Monday, the pound was down another 0.4% vs. the dollar and at a 31-year low vs. the greenback. Stocks were higher in the UK and Europe. London's FTSE 100 index, an index full of companies that support a lot of goods and therefore benefit from a weaker pound, rose 0.8%. Shares were 1.3% higher in Germany, up 1.1% in Paris and the broad Stoxx Europe 600 index was 0.7% higher.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 10, 2016 9:35am   Comments Share: Related Benzinga's Top Initiations Benzinga's Top Initiations Noble Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: NBLX) has solid Permian potential and enjoys significant leverage to the development plans of its parent, Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NBL), JPMorgan’s Jeremy Tonet said in a report. He initiated coverage of Noble Midstream with an Overweight rating and a price target of $34. Solid Growth Potential The company focuses on the Denver-Julesburg region, with 300,000 acres and more than 6,000 drilling locations. This represents “significant organic expansion opportunities,” analyst Tonet noted. He added that there was significant visibility into volume growth, especially given Noble Energy’s [Rated: Overweight] focus on developing its core acreage. Rapid volume growth is expected to drive multiple years of ~20 percent distribution growth. Strong, Strategic Sponsor Noble Energy, which has “an impressive record of stability and strength,” is likely to have formed Noble Midstream to have a “low cost of capital vehicle to fund infrastructure growth,” Tonet commented. Noble Energy has a ~55 percent LP interest, the GP and the IDRs in Noble Midstream. “These interests strongly incentivize NBL to drive rapid growth at NBLX through supporting organic growth and providing attractive dropdowns. Moreover, NBL remains committed to a robust DJ development plan that depends upon rapid midstream build-out by NBLX,” the analyst wrote. Tonet added that Noble Midstream has financial flexibility and cash flow stability, which support its attractive profile.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 10, 2016 7:04am   Comments Share: Related XLF Kevin Kelly's JPMorgan Options Trade Trump May Not Be All Gravy For Bank ETFs Can Sector ETFs Be Your Best Choice? (Seeking Alpha) On CNBC's Options Action, Dan Nathan spoke about the financial stocks and he recommended a hedging strategy to lower the risk ahead of earnings reports for major banks. Nathan said that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE: PNC) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC) are going to report earnings on Friday. These banks are almost 30 percent of Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLF). Related Link: Big Banks To Kick Off New Earnings Season With Mixed Results? The banking sector showed some relative strength this week, because 10-year bond yield increased. He added that the expectations about interest rate in December are still projected at 65 percent probability, but he doesn't find the banking sector very interesting for a trade. Nathan thinks that it would be a good idea to hedge against a possible decline in the space by purchasing the October weekly 19.50 put in Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund for $0.12. The premium is less than 1 percent of the underlying stock price and the hedge offers protection below $19.38.

In the World Finance Corporate Finance Deals of the Year, we pay tribute to those who have managed to navigate these waters successfully   2016 | Corporate Finance deal of the year | World Finance Awards October 10, 2016 The instability that has so characterised the global economy in recent times has made the conditions for both businesses and investors hard to predict. Risk-taking is less common and financial gambles are few and far between, out of fear of a volatile operating environment that has already taken so many prisoners. As much as caution remains the defining sentiment of the corporate world, the promise of an economic recovery has done a great deal to give buyers the confidence to seek out acquisitions. The promise of an economic recovery has done a great deal to give buyers the confidence to seek out acquisition Accumulated cash reserves have played their part in the last couple of years, and the healthcare, media and technology, and telecoms sectors in particular have sparked something of a deal spree of late. Global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) reached record levels in 2015, with the volume of deals hitting $5trn, according to JPMorgan Chase. This was thanks in large part to growing activity in Asia and the overall globalisation of the market. While activity has slowed down slightly this year, with global M&A volume until April 2016 sitting at $986bn – compared with $1.24trn the previous year – it remains relatively buoyant. With the majority of corporations having gone through a period of relative inactivity, a string of recent deals has underlined the merits of corporate financing, particularly in commodities, where consolidation has proved effective in combatting overcapacity. That’s especially true of the oil and gas industry, where the number of deals has surged over recent times on the back of sliding oil prices. Consolidation has been the response to high debt levels in the sector – almost 10 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, according to a recent report by McKinsey – enabling production firms to remain competitive at a challenging time. “Healthy companies may have been slow to start deals, but they’ll clearly want to be on the lookout to strengthen their competitive positions as new opportunities emerge”, the report noted. Despite signs of buoyancy, however, the current market isn’t without its complications. According to a report by Deloitte: “These improvements notwithstanding, headwinds remain. The market may be challenged by an unexpected extension of the prolonged low interest rate environment, heightened regulatory scrutiny of potential transactions, and cautious acquirers and sellers – with valuations varying widely based on fundamental differences pertaining to each target.” Such heightened regulation around mergers has become especially evident in the US, with regulators tightening their policies and cracking down on deals in order to combat anti-competitive activity and protect national security. According to Steven Epstein, Partner and Co-Head of the Mergers and Acquisitions Practice at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP: “Antitrust regulators have more frequently been applying increased scrutiny to transactions, requiring more broad-based remedies as a condition of granting approvals, and more often commencing litigation to block transactions.” The report added that merger reviews by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US around security concerns have also increased, even among corporations not directly linked to known security risks. Indeed, a quick glance at some of the collapsed deals over the past year shows evidence of the current framework. Geopolitical effects Elsewhere, geopolitical risks have had their part to play in the current shape of the market. Last year’s Paris terrorist attacks and tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran earlier on in 2016, combined with various other political battles, have contributed to an environment of uncertainty. M&A activity in the Middle East slowed at the start of 2016, with outbound transactions dropping 85 percent year-on-year to Q1 2016, marking the lowest level for that period in six years. Over in the UK, M&A activity slumped in anticipation of the Brexit vote, and even now the market continues to struggle from lower levels of investor confidence, with activity in the country this year reaching its lowest point since 2011, according to Dealogic. How the legal framework for deals might change once the UK’s negotiations with the EU have been made remains to be seen; regulatory changes for international mergers will likely depend on whether the UK remains a member of the European Economic Area, but until the negotiations are concluded, it’s likely the UK and its potential investors will continue to experience challenges. Optimists predict overseas players may well be able to pluck opportunity from the weak currency, however, by snapping up bargain deals and helping to prevent an all-out slowdown in the short term. A large pool of cheap financing has propped up the UK market so far, and Asian investors in particular have been eyeing up UK assets. The Asia-Pacific region has continued to power through with its successful spate of M&As, with volume from the region hitting $1.5trn in 2015 – almost twice the amount seen in 2013. China has dominated the scene, despite concerns from some that slumped growth there could cause a slowdown. In the first four months of 2016, Chinese investors announced 70 percent of the biggest cross-border buyouts from Asia, according to JPMorgan Chase. The volume of Chinese M&A transactions reached $735bn last year – almost triple the sum seen in 2013 – thanks to a rising middle-class, a favourable regulatory and funding framework, and vast experience in completing cross-border deals. That is a powerful combination when combined with China’s overall shift towards technology-driven investments – a factor that means North America and Europe are its prime targets. New technologies It’s not just in the M&A market that change is causing ripples: across the broader sphere of corporate finance, digitalisation is bringing its own implications to bear, and with new technologies, financial structures are changing. For example, recent research by Accenture found 80 percent of traditional finance services will be carried out by cross-functional integrated teams by 2020. Such technologies are of course bringing ample opportunity alongside the challenges. The increasing use of big data in financial departments means it is becoming easier than ever to predict performance, seek out potential new markets, and assess (and track) financial risks. Companies are already seeing the benefits as well as the drawbacks. It is by making the most of those benefits and adapting to these changes that corporations will succeed in today’s climate, and it is herein that the World Finance Corporate Finance Deals of the Year recipients have thrived, weathering the storm that was the financial crisis and retaining their competitiveness during times of volatility. By overcoming geopolitical challenges and making the most of the opportunities that the current M&A market presents, our award winners offer an insight into what it takes to succeed in today’s market and the ways in which the industry is likely to change in the coming years. They provide an example to which the wider industry should pay heed, thriving in the face of uncertainty and plucking opportunity from instability.
