Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the Federal Reserve should increase interest rates—and sooner rather than later. “Let’s just raise rates,” Dimon said Monday during a wide-ranging discussion at the Economic Club of Washington. “The Fed has to maintain credibility. I think it’s time to raise rates. Normality is a good thing; not a bad thing.

By Suzanne McGee Biography September 28, 2009 BETWEEN THE ROCKY MARKETS, THE SHAKY BANKS and Bernie Madoff, the relationship between wealth managers and their clients didn't stand a chance. Rightly or not, investors first grew suspicious of their advisors and bankers, then contemptuous. Says one ultra-high-net-worth investor, who oversees billions of dollars in family investments: "I'm better off assuming that all these people are only out for themselves." MORE PENTA ARTICLES That kind of deep distrust is starting to dramatically reshape the world of wealth management, where banks, brokerage houses and other investment outfits compete to serve millionaires and billionaires. More than one out of four high net-worth investors yanked money from their wealth mangers in 2008, according to a survey by consulting firm Capgemini and Merrill Lynch. And some bankers believe that as many as four out of five are now thinking about firing their managers and picking new ones. "The amount of money in motion is probably several orders of magnitude higher than this industry has ever seen before," says Bruce Holley, a senior partner who heads the Boston Consulting Group's U.S. wealth-management practice. "Clients are aware that it's more critical for them to get good advice in such turbulent times, but at the same time, they are more nervous and wary than ever before." For bankers and advisors, he adds, "there's tremendous potential to either win or lose relationships." That's evident in Barron's annual ranking of America's top wealth-management outfits. None of the top five players, and only one of the top 10, holds the same position as last year, the result of both money on the move and crisis-driven mergers. Another factor: We've tightened our definition of wealth management. We think the term now denotes services for accounts of $5 million and up, verus $1 million-plus in the past, as firms increasingly cater to the very richest.

But the reshuffling extends deep into the ranks. Some of the biggest winners were smaller old-line private banking outfits, which benefited as last fall's financial crisis rocked some of the giants to their core. Bessemer Trust, formed more than 100 years ago to manage the money of the Phipps family, partners of Andrew Carnegie, shot up to No. 13 in the ranking from No. 20 last year. Northern Trust ntrs 0.22085889570552147% Northern Trust Corp.

Fiduciary Trust, started during the Great Depression to serve the anxious rich, leaped to No. 30 from 37. "We have just had the two best years in the 16 years I've been working here" in terms of attracting new assets under management, says Henry Johnson, president and co-CEO of Fiduciary Trust. Johnson attributes some of the growth in clients to the firm's conservative investment approach, which produced returns that looked relatively appealing, compared with the losses on major market indexes. "But," he says, "there's also a big element of a flight to quality happening out there, as clients seek out someone that they feel can help them rebuild their trust in the system." Even Fiduciary's name can be a plus, since a growing number of potential clients understand the meaning of the word "fiduciary" -- an investment professional with a legal obligation to put the client's interest ahead of his own. THE SURGE OF MISTRUST DIRECTED at private bankers and other advisors is logical, argues Maurice Schweitzer, an associate professor at the Wharton School. "Suddenly, clients recognize new ways that things could go wrong that had never occurred to them before, and if there isn't an extraordinary degree of transparency and communication, it's inevitable that the level of trust in their advisor will decline," says Schweitzer, who has studied issues of trust in a variety of industries. "They're going to be asking for extra reassurance in many areas, and that is going to be expensive for private banks to deliver, but it's completely reasonable. The Madoff debacle showed people that they might not be able to trust the printed statements they got from their advisor." Tony Guernsey, the New York-based head of National Wealth Management at Wilmington Trust, No. 21, has been on the receiving end of just that kind of client anxiety in recent months: "I've had clients walk in and say, look, I got a statement from Bernie Madoff that said I owned such and such, but it turns out that I didn't own anything -- so prove to me you're not Madoff." Suddenly, Guernsey says, investors are hungering for information about the arcane workings of third-party firms used for clearing transactions and holding securities in custody. Customers of Madoff certainly would have been a lot better off if he hadn't been handling such back-office tasks through a unit of his own firm, which helped mask his Ponzi scheme. Each time Guernsey is asked, he walks the client through their Wilmington statement in chronological order, spelling out the complete process of where each asset came from and where it now resides. "I reassure them, 'See, you can tell that none of this is in our name, it's all held in your name at an independent custodian.'" Of course, suspicions and blame can go too far. It's unrealistic to expect your manager to have posted gains last year when the huge majority of pros were down. But if the manager greatly trailed the market, that's another story. If a wealth manager has been hard to reach on the phone during stressful times, that's a clear red flag -- and most firms now realize that more than ever. "If the client has to call you, then you don't get points for that," says Dean Junkans, the chief investment officer of Wells Fargo Private Bank. For more tips on how to decide whether to dump or keep your wealth manager, see the box on this page. In many cases, distrust is sparked by a simple misunderstanding or miscommunication. "People have different, unstated, beliefs about what represents a betrayal of trust, and what are referred to as 'psychological contracts,'" says Schweitzer. "In that case, it's the perception of the client that matters -- that is the reality." For instance, a banker might reassure clients that their portfolios are protected from sudden shocks. In the banker's eyes, relative outperformance would meet that criterion, but the clients might interpret the reassurance as a promise they wouldn't lose money. Earlier this month, Peter Skoglund, co-head of Credit Suisse Private Banking USA, No. 11 in the rankings, met with a client who had experienced just this kind of miscommunication with his previous private bankers. "The advisor had invested his assets in some private-equity and hedge funds and now he's 'gated' and he can't withdraw his funds," Skoglund says, referring to lockup arrangements under which it can take up to 18 months for an investor to retrieve assets after requesting their return from a fund manager. The fault could lie with the client for not asking the right questions, but in Skoglund's eyes, at least, it's always up to the banker to be sure that any potential questions are addressed. "The winners are going to be those who can be most transparent with their clients, and who solve the issue of communication," he says. NOT SURPRISINGLY, MANY BANKERS and advisors are ramping up the nature and frequency of communication with the wealthy families whose assets they manage. "When the markets are strong and going up all the time, that communication is less valued by the client," says Peter Charrington, CEO of Citi Private Bank in North America, No. 23. But now, with transparency the buzzword, "people want to be more actively aware of how we are generating returns for them," Charrington says. Communication of course isn't just about returns. Says John Taft, head of RBC Wealth Management for the U.S.: "Our industry, for a long time, focused on a whole bunch of fancy complicated products that weren't properly tested, instead of emphasizing our role as responsible stewards of our clients' wealth," he says. Now, he argues, the trend is in the other direction. "Private banking has to move back to the basic, fundamental issues, communication with our clients chief among them." Barron's magazine introduces its Penta supplement which targets people with $5 million in assets. Some topics covered are: wealthy investors are questioning their advisors and you are the top private bankers. To that end, Fiduciary Trust's Johnson insists that his private bankers travel -- despite a firm-wide cost-cutting blitz -- to meet with their clients face to face on a regular basis. He also urges them not to try to cram too many meetings into one day in the name of efficiency. "We would rather do two or three good meetings a day, than five meetings a day," he says. "The process of rebuilding or reinforcing trust takes time." Clients are now asking some questions that private bankers have never dealt with before. "They are being frank and freely asking what would happen if the bank collapses -- how does the FDIC insurance guarantee work, for instance," says Robert Reilly, the Philadelphia-based head of the wealth-management division at PNC Bank, No. 22. Answering such questions has been winning business from people who use PNC for other services, such as corporate banking, as well as from customers of National City Bank, a Cleveland institution that PNC acquired after it was hobbled by mortgage losses. Customers "want to know what it means that we are regulated by the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency," Reilly says. The goal, he adds, is to "proactively address any concerns before mistrust becomes a fixed part of our clients' attitude to the financial system." It's all highlighting the changing requirements for success. "A good wealth manager is a quasi-psychologist, able to understand a client's hopes and fears," says Boston Consultant Group's Holley. "A lot of wealth managers organize their meetings with clients around process and returns, but if you don't increase the emotional component, you're just checking a box by having that meeting." And here's the biggest change: "There is going to be more healthy skepticism on the client's part about the kind of promises a bank makes," says Johnson of Fiduciary Trust. "The industry will have to adjust to that." When promises are both believed and kept, life will start looking up for clients and bankers alike.

"Let's just raise rates," Dimon said before an audience at the Economic Club of Washington, DC, adding that another rate increase of 25 basis points would be "a drop in the bucket." The U.S. central bank has held rates steady after raising them for the first time in a decade from near zero last December. Its next policy meeting is Sept 20-21. It has repeatedly held off in part due to fears on the U.S. and global economic growth outlook and tepid inflation. "The rate itself gets much more pyshological attention than the actual economic effect of raising rates," Dimon said, when asked if he thought the U.S. central bank should raise rates next week or wait until December. "I'd go sooner rather than later." (Reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama) Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Jon Marino | @JonMarino Monday, 12 Sep 2016 | 12:51 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters <p>JPM&#039;S Dimon: Let&#039;s just raise rates</p> <p>JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon shares his take on interest rates at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. CNBC&#039;s Wilfred Frost reports the details. </p> JPM'S Dimon: Let's just raise rates    Monday, 12 Sep 2016 | 12:43 PM ET | 00:50 Get on with it! That's how JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon feels when it comes to the much-anticipated interest rate hike the market has been worrying about from the Federal Reserve. Tim Boyle | Bloomberg | Getty Images Jamie Dimon "Let's just raise rates," Dimon said, speaking in an interview with Carlyle Group CEO David Rubenstein on Monday at the Economic Club of Washington. "Twenty-five basis points is a drop in the bucket." He went on to say he would rather see the Fed raise sooner rather than later, and said that at a positive point in the U.S. economy, "you don't want to be behind the 8-ball" when it comes to a rate hike. The Federal Reserve, after one interest rate hike in late 2015, has been weighing whether to raise rates again in 2016, although global economic factors have complicated the decision-making process. Because an interest rate hike translates into banks being able to charge a higher percentage to borrowers, a move by the Federal Open Market Committee to increase rates would be a boost for Wall Street banks' stocks. Dimon also cautioned that the Brexit vote could cause the Eurozone to "unravel," which he said could bring catastrophic consequences along with it. The two Wall Street titans also talked about the job market — that is to say, their own. Rubenstein admitted on stage, while interviewing Dimon that he tried to hire the JPMorgan Chase CEO "unsuccessfully, every time." Rubenstein wasn't the only one who sought Dimon's services. After his firing from Citigroup in 1999, Dimon weighed work with Home Depot, among other companies. Without being too specific, Dimon said that after his career at JPMorgan Chase ends, he would "maybe do something to help the government out, somewhere," but made it clear that this decision is years away. But when Rubenstein pressed Dimon for how he would respond if the next president of the United States offered him the role of leading the Treasury Department, the bank CEO turned the tables. "I'd say, ask David Rubenstein," Dimon said, drawing a laugh from the audience.

One of the concerns on Wall Street has been how companies will maintain their dividends at these lower levels, and while some already trimmed their payouts to shareholders, others have stood firm with no changes. A new JPMorgan research report raises price targets on three top integrated companies the firm has rated Overweight, while remaining cautious as a whole on the sector. JPMorgan also acknowledges the importance for the top companies to maintain dividend coverage and balance sheet strength, even if it comes at the expense of production growth. Here are the three integrated oil companies rated Overweight at JPMorgan Chevron This stock is very solid story for investors looking to stay long the energy sector, and it is a preferred U.S. company to own now. Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) is an integrated oil and gas company with worldwide operations in exploration and production, refining and marketing, transportation and petrochemicals. It sports a sizable dividend and has a solid place in the sector when it comes to natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Some on Wall Street estimate the company will have a compound annual growth rate of over 5% for the next five years. The company’s Permian Basin assets are a goldmine, and that the Australian LNG business will transition from a yearly $8 billion capital consumption drag to a $2 billion to $3 billion contributor. Combined with the much lower overall capital spending for the 2016 to 2018 period, the company is poised to not only hang around, but end the sector slump in a much better position. The analysts note the Permian acreage is profitable at $40 a barrel. The JPMorgan team notes that the company is the best in class when it comes to dividend yield, but they feel the need to see free-cash-flow infection reasonably soon is important. They also feel that the dividend being among the highest in the sector gives investors a degree of downside protection. Chevron investors are paid an outstanding 4.23% dividend. The JPMorgan price target was lifted to $117 from $113. The Wall Street consensus target is posted at $110.75. The shares closed Friday at $101.27 apiece. ConocoPhillips This company may offer investors solid upside potential, with little threat of an additional dividend cut after the one earlier this year. ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids (NGLs) worldwide. Conoco’s portfolio includes resource-rich North American tight oil and oil sands assets; lower-risk legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; various international developments; and an inventory of conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. Many Wall Street analysts feel the company can accelerate growth from a reloaded portfolio depth in the Bakken and Eagle Ford, and with visibility on future growth from a sizable position in the Permian. The company remains the one of the best values as short sellers circled after the dividend cut and many growth and income managers sold shares. JPMorgan notes that the company has underperformed this year versus its peer group and is offering investors solid value at current trading levels. Conoco investors are paid a 2.37 % dividend. The JPMorgan price target on the company was raised to $51 from $44, while the consensus price target is $52. Conoco closed Friday at $42.25. Canadian Natural Resources This top Canadian play is JPMorgan’s top pick, based on a free-cash-flow yield basis. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (NYSE: CNQ) acquires, explores for, develops, produces, markets and sells crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. The company offers light and medium crude oil, primary heavy crude oil, Pelican Lake heavy crude oil, bitumen and synthetic crude oil (SCO). Its midstream assets include three crude oil pipeline systems and a 50% working interest in an 84-megawatt cogeneration plant at Primrose. As of December 31, 2015, the company’s gross proved crude oil, bitumen, SCO and NGLs reserves totaled 4,695 million barrels; gross proved plus probable crude oil, bitumen, SCO and NGLs reserves totaled 7,623 million barrels; proved natural gas reserves totaled 6,106 billion cubic feet; and gross proved plus probable natural gas reserves totaled 8,508 billion cubic feet. It operates primarily in Western Canada; the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea; and Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon and South Africa in Offshore Africa. JPMorgan feels that the company’s metrics remain among the best in its research universe, and it notes that the improving balance sheet and a big stock buyback program are factors that can drive share prices higher. Investors are paid a 2.3% dividend. JPMorgan raised its price target to $51 from $47, and the consensus target is much lower at $35.81. The stock closed Friday at $30.63.

Any major dip in these three top stocks should be viewed as a golden opportunity for investors with a longer term view to buy shares.

Tracy Alloway tracyalloway September 12, 2016 — 3:32 AM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Monetary Policy Feeding the U.S. Corporate Bond Rush Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp When Japanese, European, and U.K. government bonds sneeze, U.S. Treasuries catch a cold? Investors have been eschewing some longer-dated government debt as they fret over the willingness — and ability — of central banks to continue to fan economic growth through unconventional monetary policy such as bond purchase programs. The skepticism helped send yields on Japanese government bonds and German bunds spiking last week, and on Friday the sell-off reached the U.S. Treasury market, where the benchmark 10-year note posted its worst two-day performance since July as yields jumped 14 basis points. The rout has sparked a flurry of analyst commentary as the higher U.S. yields haven't been accompanied by changing expectations of Federal Reserve policy. Instead, analysts at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. suggest the sell-off in U.S. government debt is taking place as higher yields in Japan and Europe make Treasury bonds less attractive by comparison. "From a medium-term perspective, we are beginning to think the risks around rate levels have begun to shift, for a number of reasons," JPMorgan analysts led by Jay Barry wrote in a note published late on Friday. "First, developed market central banks have disappointed again, highlighted by [last] week's lack of action from the European Central Bank. Second, as a corollary, Treasuries no longer appear as attractive to foreign investors compared to home currency bonds as they did earlier this year." The so-called yield pickup that foreign investors can expect to earn by selling government bonds in their local currencies to buy 10-year U.S. Treasuries has fallen dramatically thanks to the recent increase in yields and stubbornly negative cross-currency basis swaps that help traders hedge such deals. For instance, writes JPMorgan, Japanese and European investors could as recently as March have expected to pick-up 80 bps and 50 bps, respectively, by selling their home bonds to buy U.S. Treasuries with a short-term currency hedge. Source: JPMorgan "But this yield pickup has largely disappeared, as JGB and bund yields have risen, while cross-currency bases have remained quite negative," the analysts note. "This yield pickup was one large support for the Treasury rally in the first half of 2016, as the Bank of Japan and ECB eased aggressively, while the Fed remained on hold. Going forward, this should be less supportive of foreign demand than it was in [the first half], and recent data already suggest Japanese investment in foreign bonds had started to slow in August." Combined with some crowded positioning — JPMorgan's client survey shows 16 percent net longs, the highest level since June 27, or immediately after the Brexit vote — and a deluge of new supply expected this week when the U.S. Treasury is due to auction $44 billion worth of three- and 10-year notes in an unprecedented Monday sale.  All in all, suggests JPMorgan, the tailwinds for U.S. Treasuries appear to be turning more feeble — if not downright sickly.

An incredibly lucrative sign-up bonus has made the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card a cult hit among credit card aficionados. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Sep 11, 2016 at 9:29AM Want the new Chase Sapphire Reserve Card? You'll have to wait in line. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. The new travel rewards credit card offered by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) -- the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card -- is so popular that demand for the cards far outstripped the bank's supply of them shortly after the bank started issuing them. "I have never seen such interest in a credit card, and I've been doing this for 15 years," travel blogger Gary Leff told the Associated Press. Chase Sapphire Reserve Card: a metallic card for the masses The Chase Sapphire Reserve isn't your typical travel rewards card, and the difference is apparent as soon as you hold one. As opposed to the usual credit card, which is made of plastic, Chase's new card is handcrafted out of a metallic alloy that "gives it a satisfying heft and an impressive thunk when you toss it onto the table to pick up the check," says the Associated Press. This is why JPMorgan Chase ran out of the card almost immediately after it was launched. Unlike plastic, which is available in limitless quantities, the metallic alloy used in the Chase Sapphire Reserve card was in much shorter supply. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. For the record, the card's popularity has nothing to do with aggressive marketing. Just the opposite is true, in fact, as Chase hasn't spent a dime publicizing it. It's instead a cult hit, which spread by word of mouth. The prestige that comes with a metallic card is one of the card's main appeals. That puts it in league with the likes of American Express' Black Card. The difference between the Chase Sapphire Reserve card and American Express' Black Card is that you don't have to be a millionaire or a celebrity to qualify for one. This has made it especially popular among millennials, a generation that's otherwise shunned the credit card industry. A hefty annual fee But the card doesn't come cheap. It has an annual fee of $450. That's eight times more than the $55 annual fee that I pay for my Costco Anywhere Visa, which offers a slate of generous rewards and doubles as my yearly fee to access the membership warehouse. Another reason JPMorgan Chase's latest credit card offering is so popular is because it comes with what must be the single most lucrative sign-up bonus of any card on the market now. So long as you spend $4,000 on your card in the first three months after opening the account, you get 100,000 points that can be redeemed for travel. That equates to approximately $1,500 worth of travel rewards. Beyond the sign-up bonus, moreover, the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card provides a major recurring benefit. It comes with a $300 annual credit that can be used toward travel. Assuming you redeem the credit, then, this effectively drops your annual fee to $150. The sign-up bonus alone has people clamoring to get a card. It's become such a hit among those who regularly apply for rewards cards in order to accrue bonus points, that Chase is purportedly disqualifying applicants who have opened five or more bank cards in the past 24 months. The net result is that, while the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card may be less selective than the American Express Black Card, it's not like just anyone can get one. But for those who do, and who travel a lot as well, it's easy to see why JPMorgan's Chase's latest credit card offering has been such a hit. John Maxfield has no position in any stocks mentioned.

"Let's just raise rates," Dimon said Monday during a wide-ranging discussion at the Economic Club of Washington. "The Fed has to maintain credibility. I think it's time to raise rates. Normality is a good thing, not a bad thing. The return to normal is a good thing." Fed policymakers will gather in Washington Sept. 20-21, and recent comments from voting members have sent mixed signals about whether they'll lift rates or wait at least until the December meeting. Speaking Monday in Chicago, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said "the case to tighten policy pre-emptively is less compelling" in an environment where declining unemployment has been slow to spur faster inflation. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, a voting member this year on the Federal Open Market Committee, argued Friday there was a reasonable case for gradual tightening. Dimon, CEO and chairman of the biggest U.S. bank, isn't a disinterested party. Banks typically make more money when interest rates rise as the gap widens between how much they charge borrowers and pay depositors. The shares of banks have climbed this year on days when speculation rises that the Fed is closer to increasing rates. "I'd go sooner rather than later, but I'll leave the exact timing up to them," Dimon said. In a conversation that touched on topics from regulation to U.S. immigration policy to the highlights of his more than three decades in finance, Dimon lambasted the lack of educational opportunities for inner-city residents as a "disgrace." When asked if he would ever enter politics, Dimon, 60, said he would "love to be president" but the path is too difficult. It's likely some of the regulations enacted under the Dodd-Frank Act will be improved in coming years, Dimon said, adding that he isn't in favor of throwing it out entirely. When asked about cyber-security pressures, the CEO said JPMorgan was a like a "mini-police state" in tracking employee behavior, and that he fires staffers every week for violating policies. JPMorgan spends $600 million annually on cyber security, a figure that could rise to $1 billion in a few years, he said. Dimon, who was treated for throat cancer in 2014, said he's in good health and will probably be CEO for another five years.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows NHL: Coyotes F Brad Richardson carted off ice on stretcher Utah lawmakers: Time to take 'training wheels' off booming solar industry, retire tax credit BYU football: UMass' struggles as independent, FBS newcomer, paint a cautionary tale Bagley Cartoon: Choosing Winners and Losers ELEVATE Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   From Wall St to Hawaii to Utah Valley: UVU Professor Cary Wasden Mentors MBA Finance Students   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

(Photo: Getty Images for Fortune) Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, told a gathering of financiers in Washington, D.C. Monday that timing is right for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as the U.S. economy is humming along and called for more infrastructure investment to stir growth. “Twenty-five basis points is a drop in the bucket,” Dimon said in an on-stage interview at a luncheon hosted by the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. “Let’s just raise rates. You don’t want to be behind the eight-ball. I’d go sooner rather than later.” Investors are generally more bullish on banks when interest rates are higher as their earnings benefit from interest income derived from customers paying more for loans. Fed policymakers will meet on Sept. 20-21 to decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time this year amid a tepidly growing economy. In its "beige book" released last week, the Federal Reserve said the U.S. economy expanded modestly in July and August due to heightened manufacturing activity and strong job growth. But it also said the economy has expanded at a sluggish pace for three straight quarters. Dimon, whose company is the nation’s largest bank by assets, expressed optimism when asked by the interviewer, David Rubenstein, co-founder and co-CEO of private equity firm The Carlyle Group, about the state of the U.S. economy. "There's no immediate potholes,” Dimon said, pointing to rising employment, higher wages and a robust housing market. USA TODAY The last word on a Federal Reserve rate hike may mean standing pat But the executive also expressed concern about the quality of inner-city schools, the rising student loan debt and wage inequality. "We need more infrastructure investment," he said, arguing that spending to improve schools, bridges and roads shouldn't be a partisan issue. "Growth will fix wage inequality." When asked if he ever wanted to run for president, Dimon, 60, didn't hesitate. "I'd love to be president of the United States," he replied. "But it's just too hard and too late." Dimon, who in the past has described himself as a Democrat, said he is asked often about the impact of regulations but dismissed the argument that they impede corporate growth. "It's my job to deal with regulations," he said. "The interest of your country should come before the interest of your company or industry." USA TODAY AOL's Armstrong plans to take Internet He also largely defended the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, crediting it for restoring banks' capital holdings and consumer confidence following the financial crisis of 2008. The banking system "is in unbelievable shape, he said. "The system is recovered. And Dodd-Frank is partially responsible." Signed into law by President Obama in 2010, Dodd-Frank created federal agencies to monitor system risk, heightened reporting requirements and requires banks to hold a minimum amount of capital and undergo stress tests for liquidity. "I'm not in favor of throwing (Dodd-Frank) out and starting from the ground up," he said, countering critics who have called for its repeal. 51 CONNECTTWEET 34 LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2cjrdZz

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jonathan Stempel September 12 A federal appeals court on Monday revived a former JPMorgan Chase private banker’s whistleblower lawsuit accusing the bank of firing her in retaliation for warning that an Israeli client might be committing fraud. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York found enough evidence to suggest that former JPMorgan employee Jennifer Sharkey had a “reasonable belief” that the client was engaged in fraud and money laundering involving Colombia. Sharkey said she was fired as a vice president and wealth manager in August 2009, a week after formally urging the bank to heed “red flags” and sever its ties with the client, who generated about $600,000 in annual billings. The client was not identified in court papers. Sharkey was fired eight months after the multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme of longtime JPMorgan client Bernard Madoff was exposed. U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan dismissed Sharkey’s lawsuit last October. Sweet said JPMorgan could have fired Sharkey based on her performance, or for having purportedly lied about communications involving another client. Sharkey disputed having lied. But the appeals court said the “close temporal proximity” between Sharkey’s warning and her firing justified letting the case continue. It also said her qualifications as a whistleblower was an issue of fact to be resolved at trial. JPMorgan agreed in January 2014 to pay $2.6 billion to settle litigation over Madoff, and in a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. government acknowledged responsibility for failing to stop him. — Reuters business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay are being used for less than 1 percent of payments at retailers, Gordon Smith said, citing industry data at an investor conference. Ultimately, the convenience of paying with phones will bring a surge of use from consumers, but it is impossible to know when that inflexion point will be reached, said Smith. Chase last year announced its own application called Chase Pay to hold account credentials for use at checkout counters.

Not so fast, says one board member. (Bloomberg) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the Federal Reserve should increase interest rates—sooner, rather than later. “Let's just raise rates,” Dimon said Monday during a wide-ranging discussion at the Economic Club of Washington. “The Fed has to maintain credibility. I think it's time to raise rates. Normality is a good thing, not a bad thing. The return to normal is a good thing.” On the same day, the Associated Press reported, Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard indicated Monday that she's in no hurry to raise interest rates again. The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 200 points after her speech, ending the day with a 240-point gain. Other markets followed suit. Photo by Reuters Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard in 2015. In a speech in Chicago, Brainard said that the risk that higher rates will damage a fragile economy exceeds the risk that higher rates will ignite inflation. Economic weakness "counsels prudence," she said. Fed policy makers will gather in Washington Sept. 20-21, and recent comments from the committee's voters have sent mixed signals about whether they'll lift rates or stay on hold until at least the December meeting. Brainard said Monday that “the case to tighten policy preemptively is less compelling” in an environment where declining unemployment has been slow to spur faster inflation. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, a voting member this year on the Federal Open Market Committee, argued Friday there was a reasonable case for gradual tightening. “I'd go sooner rather than later, but I'll leave the exact timing up to them,” Dimon said.

 JAMIE DIMON: 'I would love to be president of the United States' Bob Bryan Sep. 12, 2016, 1:18 PM 24,842 facebook linkedin twitter email print Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon wants to live in the White House, but he doesn't think it will happen. In a Monday conversation at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., Dimon was asked by David Rubenstein, the head of the Economic Club, whether he would run for political office. "I would love to be president of the United States, but it's too hard and too late," Dimon replied. Dimon said that while the campaign of the real-estate mogul turned Republican nominee Donald Trump appeared to make it possible for a "businessman who had never held office before" to be successful in a run for the presidency, the expectation of voters for a presidential candidate to have served in office before taking over the White House would prevent him from winning. Dimon said "you have to join a party" and "be a senator and governor" first to qualify in voters' minds, which he does not plan to do. He also cited Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, as an example of a businessman who opted not to run for president. Dimon nevertheless seemed exasperated with the state of economic policymaking in Washington, saying the US didn't need more "Democratic and Republican bulls---." At the same time, Dimon reiterated his view that the US remained the world's strongest economy. "America has the best hand ever dealt of any country on this planet today ever," Dimon said. He said that the US had geographical, economic, and military advantages over every other country and that Americans "don't fully appreciate" that fact. Dimon also expressed his opinion on the state of economic policy. On the monetary side, he said he thought the Federal Reserve should raise interest rates. On the fiscal side, he believes there should be government stimulus, a decrease in the corporate tax rates, and easing of regulations. Dimon has frequently commented on macroeconomic events and policy, and the JPMorgan CEO's name has long been floated as a possible candidate for Treasury secretary.

"Let's just raise rates," Dimon said before an audience at the Economic Club of Washington, DC, adding that another rate increase of 25 basis points would be "a drop in the bucket." The U.S. central bank has held rates steady after raising them for the first time in a decade from near zero last December. Its next policy meeting is Sept 20-21. It has repeatedly held off in part due to fears on the U.S. and global economic growth outlook and tepid inflation. "The rate itself gets much more psychological attention than the actual economic effect of raising rates," Dimon said, when asked if he thought the U.S. central bank should raise rates next week or wait until December. "I'd go sooner rather than later."

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 12, 2016 12:44pm   Comments Share: Related What To Expect Now That Tesla Shareholders Have Approved A SolarCity Merger The Market In 5 Minutes: Salesforce Has Strong Quarter, Tesla-SolarCity Deal Approved By Shareholders Elon Musk: Our Solar Roof Could Cost Less Than A Normal Roof (Seeking Alpha) Paul Coster, an alternative energy analyst with JPMorgan, still expects the SolarCity Corp (NASDAQ: SCTY) merger with Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) to proceed as planned but if the deal falls through, SolarCity will face higher discount rates for future capital raises and a "compromising" growth prospect. In a report published Monday, Coster felt it prudent to revise his 2017 estimates for SolarCity. Specifically, the analyst is assuming SolarCity's discount rate increases by 100 basis points without an acquisition; this would weigh on its NPV/w and growth. Related Link: Gordon Johnson Warns Of 'Burgeoning Risk' To SolarCity/Tesla Deal Closure Coster lowered his fiscal 2017 MW additions to 996, which is up 6 percent year-over-year but doesn't compare favorably to his prior estimate of 1,152. The analyst's year-end 2017 pretax unlevered NPV remaining for the PowreCo was also reduced to $6.2 billion from $6.8 billion. Coster cautioned that it's "reasonable to assume" MW installations could slow even further as the company's discount rate increases, which would drag down SolarCity's stock price even further as a standalone entity. Coster also lowered his price target on SolarCity's stock (Neutral rated) as a standalone company to $21 from a previous $25, although a fundamental analysis yields an even lower valuation of $19 per share. Bottom line, Coster suggested investors remain on the sidelines in the event that the SolarCity-Tesla deal falls through and the discount rate for SolarCity's new MW rises above expectations.

The New York court on Monday reversed a judge’s decision to throw out the lawsuit and ordered him to consider the case. Jennifer Sharkey sued in 2010 claiming she was fired as a vice president in J.P. Morgan’s Private Wealth Management Group for investigating allegations that a long-term client might be involved in fraud or money-laundering. According to Sharkey, she was fired one week after making a formal recommendation that the bank end its relationship with the Israeli client after spending months warning about possible illegal activity. The person wasn’t named in the lawsuit and is referred to in court papers as "Client A." Client A was a 20-year customer of JPMorgan Chase, with income from the gem and diamond business, real estate, telecommunications, medical technology and pre-paid calling cards, according to court papers. Sharkey told superiors the client’s businesses, multiple bank accounts and failure to provide information necessary to satisfy the bank’s "Know Your Customer" requirements raised questions that should result in terminating his relationship with the bank. Sharkey sued the bank and three supervisors in 2010, claiming they violated whistle-blower protections in the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Monday’s ruling is the second time the New York appeals court has overturned rulings by U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet throwing out the case. "We are very pleased with the Second Circuit’s decision and we look forward to a trial before the district court," said Lawrence Pearson, Sharkey’s lawyer. The bank claims Sharkey was fired for lying to a superior about communicating with a different client and for poor performance, which Sharkey disputes. "We continue to believe this case is without merit and look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the court," JPMorgan Chase spokesman Darin Oduyoye said. JPMorgan Chase has previously agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties and settlements to resolve claims it failed to adequately oversee accounts that Bernard Madoff used in his Ponzi scheme. The case is Sharkey v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 15-3400, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Photo: Reuters Mumbai: Hindustan Powerprojects Pvt. Ltd has initiated discussions with investors to sell around 300 megawatts (MW) of solar assets, three people aware of the development said. The money could be used for expansion and also to provide a partial exit to its private equity investor, Blackstone. The sale could fetch the Blackstone-backed power asset developer almost $300 million (around Rs.2,000 crore), said one of the three, requesting anonymity as the talks are private. The company is “talking to various financial and strategic investors. The portfolio of assets it is looking to sell has an enterprise value of almost $300 million, of which almost $100 million is equity and the rest, debt”, this person added. Hindustan Powerprojects has been exploring options to raise funds to create more power assets and also to provide an exit to Blackstone, said the second person on condition of anonymity. “While the company has been talking about an IPO (initial public offering), that is still some time away. At the same time, Blackstone, which invested about $300 million in Hindustan Powerprojects in August 2010 and holds more than 30% (in the company), has been contemplating an exit. So, it has been looking at these asset sales to raise funds,” he said, adding that the company has hired investment bank JPMorgan India Pvt. Ltd to advise on the asset sale. Spokespersons of Hindustan Powerprojects, Blackstone and JPMorgan declined comment. Also Read: Govt plans $400 million fund for renewable energy firms The company, formerly known as Moser Baer Projects Pvt. Ltd, has 600MW of solar capacity. In April, it commissioned a 1,200MW thermal power plant at Anuppur in Madhya Pradesh. It plans to reach 2 gigawatts (GW) in total solar capacity by 2017 and has a target of reaching 7GW of total capacity by 2020 from coal, solar and hydroelectric power sources. According to its website, it is in advanced stages of commissioning more than 5GW by 2017 of combined power assets at an estimated investment of $5.15 billion. Besides India, the company has power generation assets in Germany, Italy, the US, the UK and Japan. In April, the company’s chairman, Ratul Puri, said that depending on the incremental capital requirement, Hindustan Powerprojects could look at an IPO some time in 2017. This year has seen significant merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in the Indian renewable energy space. In June, Tata Power Co. Ltd acquired a large chunk of renewable assets from Welspun Enterprise Ltd at an enterprise value of $1.4 billion. According to a report in The Economic Times, Greenko Energy Holdings is set to buy SunEdison’s Indian assets, and will pay a small premium of less than $100 million in an all-cash deal. “As compared to about a year ago, the market today is witnessing a lot of churn of assets. There is M&A activity on both the wind and solar power side,” said Sanjay Sethi, managing director and chief executive at infrastructure advisory firm Nestor Consulting India. India has set itself the ambitious target of increasing its clean energy capacity more than fivefold to 175GW by 2022. Of this, around 100GW is to come from solar power. In the climate change talks held in Paris last December, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that by 2030, 40% of the country’s installed power capacity would be based on non-fossil fuel. India needs $200 billion in investments to reach its goal of 100GW solar energy and 60GW wind energy by 2022. Overseas investors and global renewable energy firms are making a beeline for the country and several Indian conglomerates are looking at the sector more seriously.

 Private banks are turning away millionaires if they’re not rich enough Suzanne McGee, The Guardian Sep. 12, 2016, 7:44 PM 6,022 facebook linkedin twitter email print Neil Hall/Reuters So you’ve just sold those Facebook shares that your high school buddy, Mark Zuckerberg, let you buy years before it went public, and you’ve made an after-tax profit of $4m. You’re feeling very, very rich. Until, that is, you talk to a private bank that specializes in managing money for rich people. That’s when you realize that you’re nothing more than a “single-digit millionaire”. You’re just not that special. In fact, the rate at which the ranks of millionaires is expanding is so great, you’re actually pretty boring. Last year alone, the US welcomed 300,000 new millionaires: that translates into a growth rate of 3%, outpacing the growth in the US gross domestic product. In fact, there are now so many millionaires out there that the private banking system simply can’t cope. JP Morgan Chase’s private bank has been raising the minimum amount of assets you need to become of its clients slowly and steadily for many years. Early this year, it announced that the minimum asset level to remain a private banking customer would double from $5m to $10m. When that takes effect early next year, about 10% of the bank’s customers could be shuffled off to a less deluxe service, Private Client Direct. While a private banker might work with only 20 or so people, those working with “single digit millionaires” might have 100 clients – meaning that every one of them gets much less of their adviser’s time and attention. JP Morgan’s move was partly aimed at convincing clients to shift any assets they might be stubbornly holding at other banks, bringing them up above the $10m threshold. But it’s also a recognition that with the proliferation of millionaires, the private banks that you’ve heard about – the ones that will walk your dog, deliver gold bars with your monogram stamped into them and provide “wealth therapy” so your children don’t grow up entitled brats – can pick and choose the clients that they deal with. Traders work in the JP Morgan company stall on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York July 15, 2010. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson A sign of just how ruthless they have become is that JP Morgan’s new rule even applies to the corporate lawyers with whom its investment bankers work closely on big deals. Until now, access to private banking programs have been among the perks offered to lawyers at firms like Skadden Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; now, the word is that they too will be shut out from this special treatment (and the access to hedge fund investments and other products and events that only the super-elite can tap into). Imagine how the poor lawyer who does a deal for a Silicon Valley billionaire must feel: he’s negotiating with the very bankers who have thrown him out of their private club, on behalf of a client who is welcome to join it. If you don’t feel much empathy for that hypothetical lawyer, worth millions, just because he can’t qualify for super-special treatment from banks, I don’t blame you. The fact is that as banks scramble to emphasize with wealthier clients, it comes at the expense of serving the rest of their clientele. JP Morgan’s private clients might feel offended at being demoted. On the other hand, those of us who merely toil for our money and whose net worth hasn’t reached seven digits yet might be flattered to be invited to join Private Client Direct, a program serving the “mass affluent” that offers after-hours access, a phone number to reach a banker any time and a few special perks. (Yes, even if that also involves some heavy pressure to buy the bank’s proprietary investment products.) But even then, we’ll need $500,000 in investments or $250,000 in deposits to qualify, and minimums for other such programs at other banks aren’t very different. All of which brings me to an important point. Sam Valadi/Flickr Big banks are struggling to make money. That’s why Wells Fargo’s 5,300 rank-and-file employees were “encouraged”, or at least not discouraged, to set up phony accounts in the names of existing clients, earning the bank more in fees (phew) and helping those employees hit sales targets. The bank opened 1.5m of these ghost accounts – and has paid out $185m in penalties to various regulators, including a record $100m to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It’s also why the banks want to focus on their richest clients. Investing time and money in working with those of us who may only have a few thousand dollars to put to work is a waste of their resources – in their eyes. The problem is that as they keep conducting triage, and denying access to investment guidance to one group after another, more and more of us will end up without the ability to turn to the banks to help us manage our investments. Let’s face it, JP Morgan and other private banks can boost their investment minimums dramatically, but the incomes of most Americans are barely budging. We’re less and less likely to have the minimum level of assets that most investment counselors want to see before accepting us as a client. Robo-advisers – the new breed of automated investment platforms that usealgorithms to invest your money, taking into account factors such as age, income and risk tolerance – offer sensible alternatives. But they work best for those people who are familiar with how financial markets work. Someone who isn’t comfortable with markets, doesn’t understand the concept of an index fund, isn’t completely sure about how an asset allocation will help them, or isn’t certain about the relationship between stocks and bonds may not want to simply hand over their money to a robo-adviser and then step away. Lower Manhattan including the financial district is pictured from the Manhattan borough of New York Thomson Reuters So, big banks are in love with the billionaires who generate the bulk of their profits. Even the single-digit millionaires these days are starting to realize that they just don’t count as much as they used to. But at least if those folks make an error or two along the way, they have financial padding to cushion their fall. The rest of us? Like everyone else, we’re increasingly underserved by the banks and the rest of the financial services industry, and our needs are growing. A third of all Americans lack any retirement savings in a 401(k) plan or other tax-deferred account. That isn’t the fault of the banks, but it’s something that the banks could help to fix by offering even basic financial education and counselling to those who don’t have balances with many, many digits. Then we’d at least feel we were getting value for the account fees we’re already paying. As it is, if I were a single-digit millionaire tossed out of the “paradise” of private banking, I’d walk away from that bank altogether. They don’t want me? Heck, I don’t want them either. There are plenty of independent financial advisers out there who – unlike the banks – aren’t intent on making more money flogging their own proprietary investment products. Instead, they vow to put their clients’ financial interests before their own, come what may. Try one of those instead. For the rest of us? Well, we can keep demanding better financial education, however and whenever possible. And that the banks at least try to employ a better-functioning moral barometer.

After a market nosedive on Friday, investors bought safe investments like household goods makers and phone companies. Technology companies also jumped. Stocks started the day lower following Friday’s drop, but they soon rallied. Investors were pleased when Lael Brainard, a member of the Federal Reserve board, said the Fed shouldn’t raise interest rates quickly because that could hurt the economy. The biggest gains went to safe investments that pay big dividends, as they are more enticing to investors when interest rates and bond yields are low. Stocks had plunged Friday following remarks from another Fed official that suggested interest rates could go up next week. David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds, said he thinks Federal Reserve policymakers seem “noncommittal” and aren’t sure if they should raise interest rates now or not. In his opinion, the Fed’s cautious attitude toward raising interest rates even a little is causing strong market reactions. “The more cautious they are, the more sensitive the market becomes,” he said. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 239.62 points, or 1.3 percent, to 18,325.07. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 31.23 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,159.04. The Nasdaq composite surged 85.98 points, or 1.7 percent, to 5,211.89. The gains in the main three U.S. indexes made up for more than half of Friday’s losses. As investors sought safe-play picks, retail giant Wal-Mart rose $1.64, or 2.3 percent, to $71.94 and Procter & Gamble gained $2.01, or 2.3 percent, to $88.25. Phone companies also rose and AT&T gained $1, or 2.5 percent, to $40.71. Those stocks took some of the biggest losses Friday. HP agreed to buy Samsung’s printer business for $1.05 billion, and HP stock rose 54 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $14.49. That helped take technology stocks higher. Elsewhere, Apple rose $2.31, or 2.2 percent, to $105.44 and communications chip maker Broadcom picked up $3.70, or 2.3 percent, to $164.48. Canadian companies Agrium and Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan agreed to combine into the world’s largest crop nutrient company. The companies value their combined business at $36 billion, and Potash shareholders will own a majority of stock in the new company. Potash stock lost 21 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $16.76 and Agrium dipped $2.57, or 2.7 percent, to $92.64. Markets overseas took sharp losses following the rout in the U.S. Friday. Germany’s DAX fell 1.3 percent while the CAC-40 in France also lost 1.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares gave up 1.1 percent. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 1.7 percent and South Korea’s Kospi slid 2.3 percent. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng shed 3.4 percent. U.S. stocks had plunged late last week after Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said there’s a case to be made the U.S. central bank should raise rates sooner rather than later. Investors are not sure if the central bank will raise interest rates, and they’re not sure the economy is healthy enough to handle that. Higher rates threaten stocks by making interest-paying savings accounts and bonds more attractive to investors. They could also ding corporate earnings by raising companies’ borrowing costs.

Higher rates threaten stocks by making interest-paying savings accounts and bonds more attractive to investors. They could also ding corporate earnings by raising companies' borrowing costs. Irish drugmaker Perrigo added 6.52 dollars, or 7.3%, to 95.23 dollars after activist investment firm Starboard Value bought a 4.6% stake in the company. Starboard Value said Perrigo needs to boost profit margins for some of divisions, and notes that the company's stock has not done well since Perrigo rejected an offer from competitor Mylan NV. Perrigo said it will review Starboard's comments. US crude rose 41 cents to 46.29 dollars a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil trading, climbed 31 cents to 48.32 dollars a barrel in London. Energy Transfer Pipeline fell 1.19 dollars, or 3%, to 37.95 dollars. On Friday a federal judge ruled that the company can build a 3.8 billion dollar pipeline intended to carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois. That sent the company's stock higher. But the federal government stepped in to temporarily stop part of the project, and several agencies said they will reconsider their decisions supporting it. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe wants to stop construction of part of the pipeline because it crosses sacred sites and approaches a lake that provides drinking water for a reservation in southern North Dakota. In other energy trading, wholesale petrol gained three cents to 1.39 dollars a gallon. Heating oil added one cent to 1.44 dollars a gallon. Natural gas jumped 12 cents, or 4.2%, to 2.92 dollars per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell 8.90 dollars to 1,325.60 dollars an ounce. Silver lost 37 cents, or 1.9%, to 19 dollars an ounce. Copper gained one cent to 2.10 dollars a pound. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.67% from 1.68%. The dollar fell to 101.84 yen from 102.69 yen late Friday.

Despite major tech companies working aggressively on making digital wallet solutions available everywhere, these digital payment apps in our smartphones are yet to gain traction, according to Chief Executive of Consumer Banking JP Morgan Chase & Co. From a Reuters report: Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay are being used for less than 1 percent of payments at retailers, Gordon Smith said, citing industry data at an investor conference. Ultimately, the convenience of paying with phones will bring a surge of use from consumers, but it is impossible to know when that inflexion point will be reached, said Smith. money applepay culture ← You may like to read: → Unredacted User Manuals Of Stingray Device Show How Accessible Surveillance Is Donald Trump Wins US Presidency VC, Entrepreneur Says Basic Income Would Work Even If 90% People 'Smoked Pot' and Didn't Work Yelp Employee Posts Open Letter About Cost Of Living And Low Wages, Gets Fired Universal Basic Income Programs Arrive Russia Unveils 'Satan 2' Missile Powerful Enough To 'Wipe Out UK, France Or Texas' Verizon Is Moving From Telephone Poles To Light Poles for Smart Devices This discussion has been archived.

About a week later I got new cards in the mail along with an affidavit to sign which I gladly did. I was surprised to see that in the end when they reversed the $25,000 in charges they didn't bother to reverse the 2% cash back I earned on those purchases. I called three times asking them to adjust that as well. Finally after letting the credits sit on my account for six months with no reversal I said fuck it and spent the $500. I'm still a customer and never heard another word. I don't care if my phone would be more secure because at the micro level it doesn't affect me one bit. One might say that we all pay higher costs because of fraud and while that's true if all fraud went away tomorrow the consumers would never see a dime. When the big bad banks had their debit card interchange fees significantly curtailed we were all told how great it was for the consumer. I didn't see a single price drop anywhere. I did, however, see CEOs of big retailers celebrating their increased profitability to shareholders specifically citing reduced expenses in the transaction processing category.

Some advantages it has: 1) A proxy number can be used for each transaction. Your real number need never be used at any time, as a proxy can be created for each transaction. The bank lets the phone know what proxies to use, and the phone lets the bank know when they are used. so even if the merchant gets completely owned, the information gleaned on you is useless as it was valid for that transaction only. 2) You have a device that can notify the bank of the validity of the transaction. Not only will the payment terminal contact the bank for payment, but your phone can let the bank know as well. Now there has to be some slack built in the system to make sure that it can work even if you don't have signal, but basically when your phone gets back on the network if the transactions don't agree, a flag can be raised. 3) You have some defense against a compromised terminal that overcharges (basically a merchant that has messed with their terminals to charge a different amount than displayed. Your phone knows how much the charge was, and shows it to you. If that is different from the amount on the screen, you can contact your bank there and then and stop the transaction. 4) The two-factor auth is taken off the device, on to your device. You have to unlock your phone to use the payment, so you have a 2-factor setup (your phone + either code or biometrics). However with chip+pin, the pin is entered on the terminal so if it is compromised, it can get your pin. The terminal can't get anything when a phone is used as the auth is on the phone, not the terminal. It isn't flawless, but it is a decent step up from the security of just using a card.

In his opinion, the Fed's cautious attitude toward raising interest rates even a little is causing strong market reactions. "The more cautious they are, the more sensitive the market becomes," he said. "What's one quarter of 1%? It's nothing." The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 239.62 points, or 1.3%, to 18,325.07. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 31.23 points, or 1.5%, to 2,159.04. The Nasdaq composite surged 85.98 points, or 1.7%, to 5,211.89. The gains in the main three U.S. indexes made up for more than half of Friday's losses. As investors sought safe-play picks, retail giant Wal-Mart rose 1.64 dollars, or 2.3%, to 71.94 dollars and Procter & Gamble gained 2.01 dollars, or 2.3%, to 88.25 dollars. Phone companies also rose and AT&T gained one dollar, or 2.5%, to 40.71 dollars. Those stocks took some of the biggest losses on Friday. HP agreed to buy Samsung's printer business for 1.05 billion dollars, and HP stock rose 54 cents, or 3.9%, to 14.49 dollars. That helped take technology stocks higher. Elsewhere, Apple rose 2.31 dollars, or 2.2%, to 105.44 dollars and communications chip maker Broadcom picked up 3.70 dollars, or 2.3%, to 164.48 dollars. Canadian companies Agrium and Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan agreed to combine into the world's largest crop nutrient company. The companies value their combined business at 36 billion dollars, and Potash shareholders will own a majority of stock in the new company. Potash stock lost 21 cents, or 1.2%, to 16.76 dollars and Agrium dipped 2.57 dollars, or 2.7%, to 92.64 dollars. Markets overseas took sharp losses following the rout in the U.S. Friday. Germany's Dax fell 1.3% while the CAC-40 in France also lost 1.2%. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares gave up 1.1%. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 1.7% and South Korea's Kospi slid 2.3%. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng shed 3.4%. US stocks had plunged late last week after Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said there was a case to be made the US central bank should raise rates sooner rather than later. Mr Rosengren and Mr Brainard have both been reluctant to raise rates too quickly. Investors are not sure if the central bank will raise interest rates, and they're not sure the economy is healthy enough to handle that. Higher rates threaten stocks by making interest-paying savings accounts and bonds more attractive to investors. They could also ding corporate earnings by raising companies' borrowing costs. Irish drugmaker Perrigo added 6.52 dollars, or 7.3%, to 95.23 dollars after activist investment firm Starboard Value bought a 4.6% stake in the company. Starboard Value said Perrigo needs to boost profit margins for some of divisions, and notes that the company's stock has not done well since Perrigo rejected an offer from competitor Mylan NV. Perrigo said it will review Starboard's comments. US crude rose 41 cents to 46.29 dollars a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil trading, climbed 31 cents to 48.32 dollars a barrel in London. Energy Transfer Pipeline fell 1.19 dollars, or 3%, to 37.95 dollars. On Friday a federal judge ruled that the company can build a 3.8 billion dollar pipeline intended to carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois. That sent the company's stock higher. But the federal government stepped in to temporarily stop part of the project, and several agencies said they will reconsider their decisions supporting it. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe wants to stop construction of part of the pipeline because it crosses sacred sites and approaches a lake that provides drinking water for a reservation in southern North Dakota. In other energy trading, wholesale petrol gained three cents to 1.39 dollars a gallon. Heating oil added one cent to 1.44 dollars a gallon. Natural gas jumped 12 cents, or 4.2%, to 2.92 dollars per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell 8.90 dollars to 1,325.60 dollars an ounce. Silver lost 37 cents, or 1.9%, to 19 dollars an ounce. Copper gained one cent to 2.10 dollars a pound. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.67% from 1.68%. The dollar fell to 101.84 yen from 102.69 yen late Friday. The euro rose to 1.1241 from 1.1228 dollars.

Its 15- and 30-second video ads will begin appearing nationally Monday evening on cable networks including MTV and Comedy Central, and on internet-based services Hulu and YouTube. (https://youtu.be/t2o9p5F4oY4) The campaign also includes ads on posters, billboards, drink coasters and pizza boxes. The move is a milestone for Venmo, which has largely acquired new users by word-of-mouth since its 2009 launch. It comes weeks after a consortium of banks decided on a name for a competing payments app, to be called Zelle. Venmo's ads, viewed by Reuters, feature young people toasting beers or eating pizza while riding small horses, with the tagline: "Pony up with Venmo." Its customers, primarily in the millennial generation, mostly use the app to split tabs among friends or share roommate expenses like rent and utility bills. If Venmo's campaign works as intended, customers will learn to start typing the words "pony up" to create an emoji symbol of a pony and upward arrow, Kasia Leyden, Venmo's director of marketing, said in an interview. Big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp have been haggling over the roll-out of their Zelle app, expected to launch in the first half of 2017. Banks hold the vast majority of deposits, so they have a built-in advantage over apps like Venmo, which is owned by PayPal Holdings Inc. But banks are playing catch-up when it comes to digital offerings that appeal to young customers. Meanwhile, Venmo has become a serious and savvy competitor. PayPal has said the app handled $3.9 billion of payments in the second quarter, 1.4 times what it processed a year earlier. JPMorgan said at an investor conference on Monday that in the first six months of this year the bank had handled $13.4 billion of digital payments between individuals, a 37 percent increase from a year earlier. Most Venmo customers are in the coveted 18-to-35 age group, an important segment for banks because they represent the future of saving, borrowing and investing. WORD-OF-MOUTH Leyden declined to say how much Venmo will spend on the new campaign, which will run for two months. Previously, Venmo's only real advertising was a short run of posters in the New York City subway system in 2014. Venmo has been developing the campaign throughout this year, Leyden said, calling it a "fortunate coincidence" that it is beginning before the banks launch theirs. Existing users told Venmo during interviews that the campaign is necessary, Leyden said. "The feedback we get is, 'Can you guys start spreading the message yourselves and make sure I am not the only one doing the cheerleading?'" she said. In addition to the TV ads, posters and billboards, Venmo has ordered pizza boxes with a "Peace of Pizza Agreement" printed on top that obligates those who eat from it to pony up with Venmo, or pay with "inconvenient, antiquated means," such as cash and checks. Venmo is also distributing drink coasters at bars, and putting the marketing on pony-themed pedicabs in four cities where the app is catching on most quickly: Chicago, Austin, Texas, Portland, Oregon and Nashville, Tennessee. Some posters are customized for local specialties, such as paying bills for spicy chicken in Nashville and deep-dish pizza in Chicago. To add a surprising incentive, Leyden said the company will occasionally pony up for someone with a pending request and pay, for example, their $50 share of a grocery receipt. Overall, Venmo's goal is to lighten up the awkward moment of prodding friends for money, said Leyden. "It is a pretty short campaign cycle, but it is meaningful to us," she said.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Eds: Rewrites after the close of trading. With AP Photos. NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks surged Monday after a Federal Reserve official said the central bank shouldn't raise interest rates too soon, which came as a big relief to investors. After a market nosedive on Friday, investors bought safe investments like household goods makers and phone companies. Technology companies also jumped. Stocks started the day lower following Friday's drop, but they soon rallied. Investors were pleased when Lael Brainard, a member of the Federal Reserve board, said the Fed shouldn't raise interest rates quickly because that could hurt the economy. The biggest gains went to safe investments that pay big dividends, as they are more enticing to investors when interest rates and bond yields are low. Stocks had plunged Friday following remarks from another Fed official that suggested interest rates could go up next week. David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds, said he thinks Federal Reserve policymakers seem "noncommittal" and aren't sure if they should raise interest rates now or not. In his opinion, the Fed's cautious attitude toward raising interest rates even a little is causing strong market reactions. "The more cautious they are, the more sensitive the market becomes," he said. "What's one quarter of one percent? It's nothing." The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 239.62 points, or 1.3 percent, to 18,325.07. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 31.23 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,159.04. The Nasdaq composite surged 85.98 points, or 1.7 percent, to 5,211.89. The gains in the main three U.S. indexes made up for more than half of Friday's losses. As investors sought safe-play picks, retail giant Wal-Mart rose $1.64, or 2.3 percent, to $71.94 and Procter & Gamble gained $2.01, or 2.3 percent, to $88.25. Phone companies also rose and AT&T gained $1, or 2.5 percent, to $40.71. Those stocks took some of the biggest losses Friday. HP agreed to buy Samsung's printer business for $1.05 billion, and HP stock rose 54 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $14.49. That helped take technology stocks higher. Elsewhere, Apple rose $2.31, or 2.2 percent, to $105.44 and communications chip maker Broadcom picked up $3.70, or 2.3 percent, to $164.48. Canadian companies Agrium and Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan agreed to combine into the world's largest crop nutrient company. The companies value their combined business at $36 billion, and Potash shareholders will own a majority of stock in the new company. Potash stock lost 21 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $16.76 and Agrium dipped $2.57, or 2.7 percent, to $92.64. Markets overseas took sharp losses following the rout in the U.S. Friday. Germany's DAX fell 1.3 percent while the CAC-40 in France also lost 1.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares gave up 1.1 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 1.7 percent and South Korea's Kospi slid 2.3 percent. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng shed 3.4 percent. U.S. stocks had plunged late last week after Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said there's a case to be made the U.S. central bank should raise rates sooner rather than later. Rosengren and Brainard have both been reluctant to raise rates too quickly. Investors are not sure if the central bank will raise interest rates, and they're not sure the economy is healthy enough to handle that. Higher rates threaten stocks by making interest-paying savings accounts and bonds more attractive to investors. They could also ding corporate earnings by raising companies' borrowing costs. Irish drugmaker Perrigo added $6.52, or 7.3 percent, to $95.23 after activist investment firm Starboard Value bought a 4.6 percent stake in the company. Starboard Value said Perrigo needs to boost profit margins for some of divisions, and notes that the company's stock hasn't done well since Perrigo rejected an offer from competitor Mylan NV. Perrigo said it will review Starboard's comments. U.S. crude rose 41 cents to $46.29 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil trading, climbed 31 cents to $48.32 a barrel in London. Energy Transfer Pipeline fell $1.19, or 3 percent, to $37.95. On Friday a federal judge ruled that the company can build a $3.8 billion pipeline intended to carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois. That sent the company's stock higher. But the federal government stepped in to temporarily stop part of the project, and several agencies said they will reconsider their decisions supporting it. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe wants to stop construction of part of the pipeline because it crosses sacred sites and approaches a lake that provides drinking water for a reservation in southern North Dakota. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Heating oil added 1 cent to $1.44 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 12 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $2.92 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $8.90 to $1,325.60 an ounce. Silver lost 37 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $19 an ounce. Copper gained 1 cent to $2.10 a pound. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.67 percent from 1.68 percent. The dollar fell to 101.84 yen from 102.69 yen late Friday. The euro rose to $1.1241 from $1.1228. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay We have recently upgraded our commenting system.

The consent solicitation with respect to each series of Notes is conditioned upon the completion of each of the other consent solicitations. The consent solicitations are being made in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions stated in a Consent Solicitation Statement, dated September 12, 2016, and in a related Consent Form to holders of record as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 9, 2016.

The consummation of each consent solicitation is subject to a number of conditions that are set forth in the Consent Solicitation Statement, including, without limitation, (1) the receipt of the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of each series prior to the Expiration Date and (2) the execution and effectiveness of the supplemental indenture effecting the proposed amendments to the Indenture with respect to the applicable series of Notes.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements: This press release contains forward-looking statements, which are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as expectations related to completion of the consent solicitations to amend the indenture governing the 2019 Notes, the 2020 Notes, the 2021 Notes, the 2022 Notes, and the 2023 Notes. The words “anticipates,” “may,” “can,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “targets,” “intends,” “likely,” “will,” “should,” “to be,” ”potential" and any similar expressions are intended to identify those assertions as forward-looking statements. FCX cautions readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that can cause FCX’s actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include the delivery of the requisite consents from the holders of each series of Notes to effect the Proposed Amendments to the Indenture and other factors described in more detail under the heading “Risk Factors” in FCX's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as updated by FCX’s subsequent filings with the SEC. Investors are cautioned that many of the assumptions upon which FCX's forward-looking statements are based are likely to change after the forward-looking statements are made, including for example commodity prices, which FCX cannot control, and production volumes and costs, some aspects of which FCX may not be able to control. Further, FCX may make changes to its business plans that could affect its results. FCX cautions investors that it does not intend to update forward-looking statements more frequently than quarterly notwithstanding any changes in its assumptions, changes in business plans, actual experience or other changes, and FCX undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements.

"The U.S. economy is perfectly reasonably OK at its 2 percent growth. It could perfectly reasonably take a move from a quarter percent to a half a percent. It's not that big a move," he said in an interview on CNBC's "Power Lunch" from the firm's annual charity day. "The U.S. economy is ready for it and would accept it positively." Lutnick's comments come on the heels of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon calling for rate hikes. "Twenty-five basis points is a drop in the bucket," Dimon said in an interview with Carlyle Group co-CEO David Rubenstein on Monday at The Economic Club of Washington. A slew of Fed officials have also been weighing in ahead of next week's policy meeting. On Monday, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said the central bank should continue to keep policy loose, urging "prudence" in the decision on rates. Other officials have been more hawkish, including Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren. On Friday, Rosengren said that low interest rates are increasing the chance of overheating the U.S. economy. Gradually tightening monetary policy is appropriate to maintaining full employment, he added. Lutnick thinks the central bank wants to get to a 0.5 percent rate, but will probably get there in December. — CNBC's Jon Marino and Fred Imbert contributed to this report.

(NYSE: FCX) announced today that it and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC (FM O&G) and FCX Oil & Gas Inc. (FCX O&G), have commenced the solicitation of consents to amend the indenture governing the following notes of FM O&G and FCX O&G, totaling $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount as of September 9, 2016:         Senior Notes Aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding 6.125% due 2019 $236.9 million 6.50% due 2020 $617.0 million 6.625% due 2021 $261.5 million 6.75% due 2022 $448.5 million 6.875% due 2023 $778.5 million   The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by FCX. The purpose of the consent solicitations is to obtain from holders approval of the proposed amendments to align certain covenants in the indenture with those governing the existing notes issued by FCX. The consent solicitations are being made in connection with FCX’s recently announced sale of its Deepwater Gulf of Mexico oil and gas properties. The consent solicitation with respect to each series of Notes is conditioned upon the completion of each of the other consent solicitations. The consent solicitations are being made in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions stated in a Consent Solicitation Statement, dated September 12, 2016, and in a related Consent Form to holders of record as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 9, 2016. Each consent solicitation is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 23, 2016, unless extended or earlier terminated (the Expiration Date). Holders of Notes who validly deliver consents to the proposed amendments in the manner described in the Consent Solicitation Statement will be eligible to receive consent consideration equal to $2.50 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for which consents have been validly delivered prior to the Expiration Date (and not validly revoked). Holders providing consents after the Expiration Date will not receive consent consideration. Consent consideration will be paid to consenting holders as promptly as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the consent solicitations, as further described in the Consent Solicitation Statement. The consummation of each consent solicitation is subject to a number of conditions that are set forth in the Consent Solicitation Statement, including, without limitation, (1) the receipt of the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of each series prior to the Expiration Date and (2) the execution and effectiveness of the supplemental indenture effecting the proposed amendments to the Indenture with respect to the applicable series of Notes. Consents may be revoked prior to the date the supplemental indenture giving effect to the proposed amendments is executed and becomes effective (which is expected to be promptly after receipt of the requisite consents for each series of Notes, which may occur prior to the Expiration Date). If the requisite consents for such amendments are received, then upon execution of the supplemental indenture and payment of the consent consideration, the amendments will be operative and be binding upon all holders of Notes, whether or not such holders have delivered consents. A more comprehensive description of the consent solicitations can be found in the Consent Solicitation Statement and related Consent Form. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated are the Solicitation Agents in connection with the consent solicitations. Persons with questions regarding the consent solicitations should contact J.P. Morgan Securities LLC at (212) 270-7765 (collect) or (866) 834-4666 (toll-free) (Attention: Liability Management Group).

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoMore NEW YORK (Reuters) - Digital payment apps in smartphones, so-called digital wallets, have yet to catch on with customers, the chief executive of consumer banking for JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Monday. Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay are being used for less than 1 percent of payments at retailers, Gordon Smith said, citing industry data at an investor conference. Ultimately, the convenience of paying with phones will bring a surge of use from consumers, but it is impossible to know when that inflexion point will be reached, said Smith. Chase last year announced its own application called Chase Pay to hold account credentials for use at checkout counters.
