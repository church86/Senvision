Follow @nirkaissar Facebook Twitter Email Print Share April 7, 2017 7:30 AM EDT JPMORGAN CHASE & CO -0.30 At Closing, April 7th 86.18 USD Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co., thinks the U.S. has some problems. And not just a few problems: slow economic growth, declining real wages, low labor force participation, a shrinking middle class, high student loan burdens, high rates of felony convictions, reduced mortgage availability, poor educational system, crumbling infrastructure, a brain drain and excessive regulation. (Although Dimon says JPMorgan is doing great, thanks for asking.) I suspect that most Americans would agree with the sentiment, if not the particulars. According to Gallup, just 29 percent of Americans are satisfied “with the way things are going in the U.S.” That’s up from a low of 7 percent during the 2008 financial crisis but well below satisfaction rates that topped 70 percent in the 1990s. No Satisfaction A majority of Americans are unsatisfied with the way things are going in the U.S. Source: Gallup You wouldn’t guess anything is wrong by looking at the U.S. stock market. Stocks are famously volatile, but in recent years U.S. stocks have been eerily calm. Standard deviation is a common measure of volatility -- or the degree of the market’s ups and downs. A lower standard deviation indicates less volatility, and vice versa. The standard deviation of the S&P 500 has been 18.8 percent since 1926 -- the longest period for which numbers are available. To put that in some perspective, the standard deviation of long-term government bonds has been 8.4 percent over the same time. Over the last three years, however, the standard deviation of the S&P 500 has been just 10.4 percent through March -- nearly half its long-term volatility and modestly more than that of bonds. Still Waters There's nothing unusual about the market's current calm Source: S&P Which raises the question: Why is the market so calm while Dimon and many Americans are so anxious? I looked at the S&P 500’s rolling three-year standard deviations since 1929 for clues. The first thing I noticed is that there’s nothing unusual about the market’s current calm. Stocks have behaved more like bonds many times, most recently in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.    The second thing I noticed is that volatility tends to spike only during periods of economic stress. That was true during the Great Depression and during the brief recession that followed in 1938. It happened during the early 1970s when inflation unexpectedly rose from 3 percent in 1972 to 11 percent in 1974. And it happened during the recessions that followed the dot-com and housing bubbles. The two exceptions occurred within a decade of each other. Volatility was surprisingly muted during the stagflation era of the late 1970s and early 1980s. And volatility was high during the 1987 market crash, despite few signs of economic distress.   Nothing else seems to bother the market. Volatility was low during World War II. The market was untroubled during the 1960s, through the Cuban missile crisis,  the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, civil rights protests and the Vietnam War -- to name just a few episodes from that tense era. Volatility was low in the late 1990s when President Bill Clinton was impeached. And the market was quiet during the mid-2000s, when the U.S. fought two wars. The relevance to the current environment is obvious. While the U.S. faces numerous challenges and one of the most politically charged environments in memory, the U.S. economy appears to be humming along -- at least by traditional measures. Growth has been uninterrupted for eight years. Unemployment is at a historic low.  And profit margins for S&P 500 companies have averaged 8.5 percent since 2009 -- well above the margins achieved during the dot-com and housing booms. Fat Years U.S. companies have been highly profitable since the 2008 financial crisis Source: Bloomberg Ben Graham, the father of value investing, called the stock market a weighing machine -- and what the market weighs is companies’ earnings. Those earnings rely on a stable and growing economy, which the U.S. has enjoyed for many years. Even if Dimon is right about the U.S.'s problems, the market isn't likely to care until they start weighing on the economy and companies' bottom lines.

By Noah Smith The U.S. is in a period of institutional sclerosis, and more people are noticing it. Even JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is sounding the alarm. But it's reasonable to ask whether, despite all its difficulties, the U.S. is still the proverbial best house in a bad neighborhood. Many other rich, industrialized nations are facing their own long-term dysfunction. Europe is politically paralyzed, and much of that region still suffers from high unemployment. If no one else has figured out how to beat sclerosis, maybe it's inevitable? Maybe not. There is one large, developed country that has managed to mostly pull itself out of a long period of paralysis. That country is Japan. Much ink has been spilled about Japan's seemingly endless dysfunction following the bursting of its real estate and stock-market bubbles in about 1990. Books such as "The Sun Also Sets" and "Dogs and Demons," and economics papers like Takeo Hoshi and Anil Kashyap's "Why Did Japan Stop Growing?" recount the story of how the dynamo of the 1980s turned into the sick man of Asia during the 1990s. But although many outside the country seem to think that it's mired in an eternal "lost decade," this perception is now out of date. Yes, Japan's economy has a number of long-term structural problems, most significantly its aging, shrinking population. But in most areas, Japan has overcome its bout of sclerosis, and in many ways is looking healthier than any other major economy. In terms of gross domestic product, Japan is doing fine. Many people focus on the total GDP figure, or fail to account for inflation, both of which understate Japan's performance. But the country's real output per working-age population has outpaced the U.S.'s since 2000, despite the fact that Japan's working-age population has aged much more. But in Japan, practically everyone who wants a job has a job. And that understates the difference: A lot more of Japan's population is in the labor force in the first place. Surprisingly, this is true for women as well as for men. Though women in Japan still haven't won economic equality in the workplace, they now have jobs at higher rates than their American counterparts. One might think that Japanese companies are simply employing too many people, reducing profitability in the name of maintaining employment levels. There's always a bit of this happening, but even so, Japanese companies have managed to improve profitability a lot. Despite a strong currency that tends to hurt export earnings, Japan's corporations are seeing their earnings grow. Margins are higher than they've been since the Great Recession. These are the economic stats, but Japan has improved on many social indicators as well. Fertility, once among the lowest in developed countries, and though still well below the replacement rate of 2.1, has begun to inch up. Japan's violent crime rate is still legendarily low. And while the country is famed for having a high suicide rate, that has also come down substantially, falling by almost a third during the past decade. So Japan looks like a society that is healthy not just economically, but culturally and socially as well. How did it accomplish this feat, when it was mired in stagnation for so long? And why has it done better than most of the other rich countries? One factor is good leadership. After years of trying to deny problems like unproductive workplaces and pervasive sexism, Japan elected leaders who were willing to confront these issues head-on. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, though a conservative, has pushed to support working women, with both rhetoric and real policy. He has also opened up the country a bit to immigration, especially of the high-skilled variety. Meanwhile, the bureaucracy has started pushing Japanese companies to be more profitable and improve their corporate governance. But companies themselves have also made these efforts with little prompting. Waves of consolidation have helped raise profitability in industries from autos to banking to electronics. Accounting scandals may be making the front pages, but these are probably a sign that greater transparency is coming to Japan Inc. In the end, Japan is shaking off its sclerosis simply because the country's leaders recognized the need to do so. Instead of wasting energy on partisan political battles over health care or culture wars, as Americans have done, Japanese people targeted the real problems that were plaguing the economy and society. It took more than a decade for Japan to collectively realize that the old growth and social models weren't working, but once the country's businesses, politicians and households accepted that they were in a hole, they could start to dig themselves out. Just as Japan's stagnation offered a warning decades ago, the Japanese revival now offers the hope that the U.S. can do the same in the years to come.

 10 things you need to know in markets today Will Martin Apr. 5, 2017, 1:58 AM 550 facebook linkedin twitter email print Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond speaks during a joint news conference with India's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in New Delhi, India April 4, 2017. Reuters/Altaf Hussain Good morning! Here's what you need to know in markets on Wednesday. BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, slashed the amount it paid out in commissions to Wall Street firms for research by more than half for its largest mutual fund over the last two years, according to filings. The cuts show the immense power large asset managers have to curb fees they pay banks and the diminishing role of sell-side research at a time when Wall Street firms are facing a slump in stock trading commissions. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon released his annual letter to shareholders. Dimon said he was worried that "something was wrong" in the US and there are six issues holding back economic growth. Dimon also expressed concerns over the low labor force participation rate in the US. In the same letter Dimon also brought up his concerns with Brexit and the European Union. The JPMorgan CEO said that he hoped Brexit would bring the EU closer together but admitted that it could " result in political unrest that would force the EU to split apart ." Credit Suisse Securities USA, a unit of Credit Suisse, and a former investment adviser named Sanford Katz have agreed to pay about $8 million in fines to settle charges relating to improper investments, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said. According to the SEC's orders issued on Tuesday, Credit Suisse collected about $3.2 million in avoidable fees from clients during 2009-2014, and about $2.5 million of that amount was generated from Sanford Katz's advisory clients. JAB Holdings, the Luxembourgish company that owns chains such as Krispy Kreme, Caribou Coffee, and Peet's Coffee and Tea might soon add American sandwich shop Panera Bread to the mix. On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that JAB Holding was in advanced talks to buy Panera, after breaking the news that Panera was for sale a day earlier.   Morgan Stanley made an error analysing Snapchat. On March 27, Morgan Stanley published an equity research note on Snap, the social media company it helped take public, putting a $28 price target on the stock. Almost a day later, the bank issued a correction, changing a range of important metrics in its financial model but not the $28 price target. Prime Minister Theresa May has hinted that Britain could allow EU free movement to continue in some form after Brexit. "Once we've got the deal, once we've agreed what the new relationship will be for the future it will be necessary for there to be a period of time when businesses and governments are adjusting systems and so forth, depending on the nature of the deal - but a period of time when that deal will be implemented," May told reporters on a trip to the Middle East. Asian stocks traded cautiously on Wednesday, as investors move to the sidelines before a potentially tense meeting between Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week. As of 6.50 a.m. BST (1.50 a.m. ET) Japan's Nikkei index has gained around 0.25%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng has fallen by the same margin. The world's largest banks, insurers, asset managers, and professional services firms have made some headway in getting more women into finance but are still failing to promote women, according to exclusive data from The Financial Times. One key statistic demonstrated how the playing field for women is still unequal: "Women made up 25.5 per cent of senior roles in 2016, compared with 23.7 per cent in 2014." Obamacare's popularity has gone through the roof after Trump’s election. According to a new Gallup poll, 55% of American surveyed approve of the Affordable Care Act, the law known as Obamacare. This is the first time in Gallup's polling of the ACA that the law has cracked 50% approval since the firm began asking about the law in November 2012.

Photos: iStock, Reuters BusinessInvestment The week ahead: five big investment themes Five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders this week By Reuters April 9, 2017 12:36 AM (UTC+8) Share Tweet Linkedin Print Email Share 0 Comment 0 1. Taken by surprise Investors piled into safe-haven assets after US cruise missiles rained down on a Syrian airbase, following a policy shift by US President Donald Trump. Analysts were quick to interpret the strike, in response to a chemical weapons attack blamed on Syria, as a signal to Russia and to other countries such as China, North Korea and Iran. Markets largely reversed course after US officials said the airstrike was a “one-off”. Friday’s events have put investors on notice that geopolitics is likely to remain a major theme for markets this year. But they will also remain wary of assuming they know what Trump is thinking.

Bitter division Turkey holds a referendum on April 17 on replacing the country’s parliamentary system with an executive US-style presidency for Tayyip Erdogan. The result still looks like a coin toss but is guaranteed to trigger major moves in the lira and Turkey’s stock and bond markets whichever way it goes. The referendum has bitterly divided the country. Opponents fear increasing authoritarianism from Erdogan, a leader they see as bent on eroding modern Turkey’s democracy and secular foundations, while his campaign, in which he and government ministers have dominated the airwaves with multiple speeches daily, has strongly played the nationalist card to woo voters at home and abroad. The lira has lost almost a quarter of its value over the last year and analysts are predicting another dive if Erdogan wins and a jump if he doesn’t.

JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo will on Thursday kick-start a busy few weeks of corporate results and optimism is high. A synchronized uptick in profit forecasts as well as in GDP across every major market in the world is under way for the first time since 2010. Stock market valuations, running above historical averages, are already reflecting some of the upbeat sentiment so the bar for disappointments, particularly in the United States, is low. In Europe, the mood is even perkier thanks to relatively cheaper valuations, a definitive improvement in the macroeconomic backdrop and a still-accommodative central bank.

Hot cross Bunds What better place to keep money safe from potential geopolitical shocks than German debt? Germany sells its benchmark 10-year bonds, one of the world’s most liquid financial instruments, in the coming week. But, after failed auctions of both two- and five-year debt in recent weeks, the auspices are not the best. Germany’s 10-year borrowing costs have halved since mid-March as yields dropped from a 0.509% peak to 0.22%. While this would suggest buying interest, this is actually much more an adjustment in monetary policy expectations. Last month, all the talk was about how the European Central Bank was planning to “normalise” its monetary policy stance, aided and abetted by some fighting talk from Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann. But those expectations have cooled after recent signals from European policymakers and doubts over the “Trumpflation” trade. If the auction attracts fewer bids than the 3 billion euros on offer (and the small amount would tend to make this less likely) it would be the first failed auction of German 10-year bonds since September.

China rising Whatever presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping had to say about trade at their first summit, growth in Chinese imports is expected to have remained strong in March. Trade and inflation data are due in the coming week as part of a suite of indicators expected to show solid growth in the world’s second largest economy. Inflation is expected to remain mild, with consumer prices up 1.0% year-on-year after slowing to 0.8% in the previous month.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, Apr 09, 2017 - Page 16　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Norway wealth fund calls for cap on executives’ pay FAT CATS:A large part of their remuneration should be in shares that are locked in for at least five years, regardless of resignation or retirement, the fund said AFP, OSLO Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, on Friday called for a cap on executive pay and fiscal transparency at the companies in which it invests, further buffing its reputation as an ethical investor. In every company, “the board should ... disclose a ceiling for total remuneration for the coming year” for the chief executive, Norway’s central bank, which manages the fund built on the country’s oil revenues, said in a new policy document. In an era of fat-cat salaries that have drawn widespread criticism, the stance is all the more significant given that the fund holds stakes in about 9,000 companies worldwide, representing 1.3 percent of the global market capitalization. With its weight and its often-praised management requirements on ethics and transparency, the Scandinavian fund often sets the bar for investment funds worldwide. For many years, the Norwegian wealth fund had little to say about executive pay, but recently it has begun to play a more active role. Last year, it voted against the executive pay policies at companies including Alphabet Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Sanofi SA, according to the Financial Times. “We are not in a position any longer as investors to say that this is an issue we are not going to have a view on,” the fund’s director, Yngve Slyngstad, told the newspaper, noting that the principle of “say on pay” was now spreading in a number of countries. The fund’s policy document said that in order to align a CEO’s interests with those of shareholders, “a substantial proportion of total annual remuneration should be provided as shares that are locked in for at least five and preferably 10 years, regardless of resignation or retirement,” and without any conditions based on a company’s performance. In another document published on Friday, Norway’s central bank also called on companies to implement fiscal transparency. “Taxes should be paid where economic value is generated,” it said, expressing clear opposition to so-called fiscal optimization, where companies declare their profits in countries with lower taxes. The Norwegian fund, worth about 7.87 trillion kroner (US$908.8 billion) at the end of last month, grew by 298 billion kroner in the first quarter, its third-best quarterly performance in its 20 year history. Ethical rules already prohibit the fund from investing in companies accused of serious violations of human rights, the use of child labor or serious environmental damage, as well as in tobacco companies and manufacturers of “particularly inhumane” weapons. In line with a 2015 vote in Norway’s parliament, the fund cannot invest in mining or energy companies where coal represents more than 30 percent of their business — a somewhat paradoxical stance for a fund bankrolled by Norway’s oil revenues.

The reserves increased by $3.96 billion during March to reach $3.009 trillion, according to data of the People's Bank of China, the central bank on Saturday. It marked the first time that the reserves had increased for two consecutive months since April 2016. In January, the reserves fell below the $3 trillion mark, triggering concerns that they may continue to drop. But, in February, the reserves rose above that level. Capital outflows are an important factor influencing China's scale of foreign exchange reserves, said Zhang Yansheng, chief economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. "The US' economic prospects remain blurred and the Chinese economy has been widely seen as having largely stabilized, contributing to easing capital outflows," Zhang said. Zhu Haibin, chief China economist with JPMorgan Chase & Co, also said capital outflows are expected to slow this year. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange said that the country's foreign exchange reserves "may become more stable" given the resilient economic fundamentals. "China's economy has sound fundamentals, great potential and a high level of resilience, and will continue to grow at a stable and relatively fast pace," it said. Cross-border capital flows will also become more balanced and the reform to marketize the exchange rate formation of the renminbi has progressed steadily, contributing to the easing capital outflow pressure it faces, the statement said. China's economic growth remained stable in the first two months, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics. Analysts said the trend is expected to continue in March and April. "The trend of stable and improving growth will continue in April," said Hu Yuexiao, chief analyst of Shanghai Securities Co. Investment growth has picked up and corporate profits are also improving, he said. In the first quarter of this year, foreign exchange reserves fell by $1.4 billion and the fall was significantly smaller than in the previous two quarters, the administration said. China's gold reserves' value fell to $73.74 billion at the end of March from $74.376 billion at the end of February, the central bank said.

Sure, they support much of today’s media and technology business. They give us social networks and search engines and — oh, for the love of Pete, can you just let me watch my video already? Why are you making me sit through 30 seconds of some guy trying to sell me boat insurance? What I’m saying is, people tend to fly off the handle when they contemplate the modern advertising industry. This irrationality makes it difficult to talk soberly about what’s really going on when the business of ads makes the news. It’s especially difficult to take the nuanced position when you’re talking about “programmatic ads” — ads that are purchased and placed according to algorithms that determine their relevance to you and that sometimes appear to follow you across your digital meanderings. These ads have lately come under fire. The Wall Street Journal found that YouTube’s advertising engine was placing ads from large brands on racist videos. In response, several large advertisers pulled their ads. Meanwhile, an experiment by JPMorgan Chase called into question the effectiveness of programmatic ads. The company significantly reduced the number of ads it shows, but didn’t see a decline in response from users. But let’s take a deep breath before condemning programmatic ads. On the one hand, there are some clear problems with how programmatic ads are placed. The industry is rife with complexity. This type of advertising is also quite new, so a lot of the machinery that runs the ad market is still in the works. But these problems are also fixable and should not obscure a larger truth: Even though they are far from perfect, in many ways programmatic ads are creating a more efficient advertising market. And given that advertising pays for nearly the entirety of what we see and do online, the upside of all the hand-wringing is that we are now examining how all of that money gets spent — a process that should lead to better ads, and better media, too. To understand what’s at stake in the ad industry’s shift toward programmatic ads, we need to first traipse through a brief history of media and advertising. Once upon a time the ad business was dominated by size. Big companies with lots of money needed a way to convince people to buy their stuff. Luckily the people were easy to find: They were all watching or reading one of a handful of media offerings — three TV networks, some big glossy magazines and one or two newspapers in every town. So it was all pretty simple. The companies paid men in Manhattan to come up with catchy songs to get people to buy soda and soap and razor blades. The men got to drink martinis at work, so few had any reason to complain. But glamorous as it was, the ad business wasn’t the best deal for the companies that were paying for the ads. The central problem was the conflation of audience and media outlet: When it ran an ad for razors, Gillette would have preferred to show the spot just to men who shaved regularly. But you couldn’t target men who shaved regularly. “It wasn’t possible for us to be certain that we were reaching that audience, so we used the content of certain programming to define that audience,” said Brian Lesser, the chief executive of GroupM, a division of the advertising giant WPP. In other words, instead of targeting men, they’d run ads on shows they thought men liked to watch — a good enough solution, except for all the women and non-shavers who were also watching. Digital advertising fundamentally altered this model. Through profiling, now ad companies know — or, at least, aim to know — exactly who is reading a certain site or watching a certain video. So instead of buying ads tied to a certain piece of content, companies can buy ads targeted exactly to an audience. “Now we can get down to the level of an individual user and we can be certain that we’re targeting an ad to the same user across multiple devices,” Mr. Lesser said. But it’s deeper than that. Ad companies don’t just know the user, but they also know the user’s context — for instance, whether you’re at work or at home, or whether you’re in the mood for shopping or not. All of this comes together in a real-time calculation as you wander around the digital world, from app to website to social feed. The computers are watching what you do and deciding which ads to serve you when. Often the ads are sold dynamically in an auction — different companies offer to pay different amounts to get your attention at different times. There are some obvious downsides to this model. It also raises an issue for brands. One consequence of this model is that it pays for a lot of content that wouldn’t have been funded under the old model — now a teenager can attract a few million followers on YouTube, sign up for the company’s revenue-sharing program and make money from all of the programmatic sponsors. That’s a mixed blessing. It turns out there’s a lot of crazy stuff on the internet. Some of it is popular, even if it’s racist or otherwise objectionable. So suddenly a whole bunch of brands may be funding content that, in the old days of human-powered ad buying, they’d never in a million years have ventured anywhere near. The best way to think of this is as a supply-chain problem. Big, complicated industries that sell commodity goods often get tripped up on sourcing: you don’t know who made your clothes, whether your diamonds are funding war or whether your shrimp may be complicit in slavery. The way to solve these externalities is through investigation and better documentation — to follow the money deep in the supply chain, to figure out who’s ultimately getting it. Something like that is now happening in the programmatic ad industry. It’s rare to talk to someone in advertising who will tell you that things are working perfectly. They admit that there are holes in the system: Computers aren’t yet great at figuring out what’s racist and what’s not, or what’s fake news and what isn’t. But they’re getting better, and the more activists push platforms like YouTube on this issue, the more incentive the platforms have to keep improving things. “The nature of the internet is that it is fragmented,” said Ari Paparo, the chief executive of Beeswax, an advertising technology company. “You can’t buy over martinis everywhere you want to reach those customers. It just doesn’t work that way. There’s no amount of wishing that’s going to make the old days come back.” The New York Times Farhad Manjoo More Posts Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Related Adad industrybrandsmediaprogrammatic ads Previous ArticleLa Liga’s Foreign Players are Easy Targets until They Master the Spanish LanguageNext ArticleTraining Your Brain so that You Don’t Need Reading Glasses What’s Trending Amaq – 24/7 News Agency Run by ISIS 38526 Saudi Sources: the Ultimate Solution in Yemen will Put an End to the Militias 28444 Crown Prince Patronizes Deluge 6 Exercise 24614 Air Strikes Target al Qaeda in Yemen, Troops Capture Aden District 23095 10,000 More Syrian Refugees to Be Taken in by Canada 22574 Join our social media 264kFans 126kFollowers 237Followers Subscribe to News Asharq Al-awsat Newsletter Email address PRINT SUBSCRIPTIONS DISTRIBUTION ADVERTISING TERMS & CONDITIONS PRIVACY STATEMENT ABOUT US SUBMISSIONS © Copyright 2016 Asharq Al Awsat - Sub Division of SRPC - Site Last updated April 9, 2017 7:48 am Middle East Opinion Saudi Arabia Features World Lifestyle This website uses cookies to improve your experience.

Embedded in the surface of an EMV card is a microprocessor for storing data and instructions required for any purchase. Photo - Shutterstock Daw Than Than Swe, the director general of the Central Bank, told the Myanmar Times that all the payment cards issued by local banks will have to be upgraded to EMV standard, as a measure to strengthen security. Currently, Myanmar banks are issuing debit and credit cards which are classified as non-EMV chip cards. Therefore, these cards will be switched to the EMV standard which offers more protection, and all local banks will finish phasing out the old cards by 2020, she explained. According to information from JPMorgan Chase, EMV chip technology is becoming the global standard for credit card and debit card payments. Named after its original developers (Europay, MasterCard and Visa), this technology features payment instruments such as smart cards and mobile phones with embedded microprocessor chips which store and protect cardholder data. This standard, also commonly known as “chip and PIN” or “chip and signature”, have more sophisticated encryption and is primarily designed to prevent fraudulent transactions. EMV cards are also harder to clone. In order to implement this nationwide upgrade, Myanmar Payment Union (MPU), which was established together by 23 local private banks, signed a deal on February 7 with Unionpay International (UPI). “These chip cards which are currently issued by local banks are highly secure as well. But the EMV-standard cards are internationally recognised as the safest. Hence, we would need to change our cards so as to follow the international standard,” the director general said. “We need to make sure our cardholders are protected with better security measures and to get ready to be part of ASEAN,” she said, adding that 2020 is the deadline for the transition to be completed.   In the ASEAN region, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam have implemented the EMV payment system, and are also using the Asian Payment Network (APN) system. The APN is set to become a common standard for ASEAN members, said Mr Yan Wen Hui, general manager of UPI Southeast Asia. Banknotes from ASEAN countries. A more integrated payment system for the ASEAN is deemed beneficial for the economy. Photo - Shutterstock Among all the 10 ASEAN member states, UnionPay cards have also been widely accepted. The people in Myanmar, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand use UnionPay cards frequently in domestic consumption as well as when travelling overseas. “Myanmar will also be joining the ASEAN’s own network, the Asian Payment Network, in the future,” said Daw Than Than Swe. The APN was an initiative launched in 2006 by ASEAN member countries, namely Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, in coordination with their respective central banks. The initiative was organised as a private sector response-and-dialogue partner to the then-ASEAN Pay Steering Committee, a body comprised of representatives from central banks in ASEAN. The APN and the committee were tasked to establish common standards and formulate a framework for efficient and reliable cross-border payment services across the region. The APN brings together payment operators from the four ASEAN members, with the Philippines and Vietnam subsequently joining. Some other non-ASEAN Asian electronic payment operators have also taken part. The initiative has established standards for cross-border automated teller machine (ATM) cash withdrawals, balance inquiry and funds transfers. A working paper published by the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) in 2013 argues in favour of a more regionalised payment system for the ASEAN, which was expected to benefit from the significant growth in the Asia-Pacific payments market. Growth in economic activity in individual countries would increase the overall size, scale, and scope of payment transactions. Enabling the scale and scope of payments to fulfil its potential would require national payment and transaction systems to be regionally integrated. Standardising and improving the card payment systems is one of the steps paving way for Myanmar to join the game. An official from a local private bank, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Myanmar Times that, among all the cards issued by the banking sector, only the cards which are MPU-issued are non-EMV cards, and have to be replaced. That view is shared by the Central Bank. “Those cards which are not issued by the MPU already have the EMV system. What the Central Banking is essentially saying is that the MPU-issued cards should be changed,” said U Zay Yar Aung, an official from the CB Bank department of cards and machine maintenance. Another official from Kanbawza Bank (KBZ) also said, “Most cards issued by the banks these days include the EMV technology system. That is why I don’t think a lot of cards have to be replaced.” Apart from MPU-issued cards, Master cards and Visa cards issued by Myanmar banks, there are also jointly-issued cards such as MPU-Master, MPU-Visa, MPU-UPI, and MPU-JCB cards. The UPI has agreed to provide technical assistance and technology service to MPU for the EMV upgrade. MPU started issuing cards in 2012 and, at present, there are a total of 2.8 million MPU cards issued by the 23 local private banks. Adopting EMV cards is another sign that Myanmar is keen to connect with the global financial system. Last March, the AYA Bank became the first lender to offer bank cards with a stamp from global payment network provider JCB. The bank started issuing debit and credit cards with a joint stamp from Japan’s JCB and MPU, meaning it can be used in Myanmar and across a JCB network spanning some 31 million merchants in 190 countries and territories. Why did the Central Bank set a deadline for the technology transition? This is probably a measure to avoid following in the footsteps of America’s slow embrace of the smart cards. A few years back, American card companies and banks were very reluctant to do what had been done elsewhere — start issuing the upgraded payment cards. But without the government’s command, the card industry has been locked in a dilemma labelled by The Economist as a “chicken-and-egg situation”: stores had no reason to install EMV-card readers while financial institutions had been reluctant to issue those cards; and banks had refused to embrace them while they were not accepted in stores. With the instruction from the Central Bank, the payments industry in Myanmar is set to embrace the technology very soon. – Translation by Kyaw Soe Htet Most Read - Business Statoil to sign contract Yangon govt promises YBS improvements Sweet plans for future of Shan honey US chain Krispy Kreme aims to fill the local doughnut hole Trade volume set to beat FY 2009-10 total Dealers put the brakes on car imports Car sales rained out Tackling the infant industry debate Car prices continue downward slide Hundreds of companies caught in UWSA tin mine supply chain Most Read - Property News Real estate law headed to Nay Pyi Taw Fashion entrepreneur spots the trend Land near Thilawa sees steep increase Speculators return to Dala as bridge plans firm up More effort needed to tackle idle industrial land Dagon City 1 developer discusses temporary pause on construction Junction City becomes Yangon’s latest addition Sales rise in Yangon property market Metal scaffolding taking hold Mingalar market design competition opens Most Read - Technology Myanmar ICT Exhibition finishes Fibre cuts slow internet speeds Mytel to target rural areas and compete on price Laws remain vague as ministry swears off internet shutdown E-commerce slowly escalates The future is still far off Telenor Myanmar starts SIM swap Latest CDMA sales strong: MPT MPT rolls out 450MHz phone network MCC to open master and doctoral courses Copyright © 2017 The Myanmar Times.

By SueChang Markets reporter After being stuck in a state of suspended animation for the past few weeks, the stock market will finally have its moment of truth as corporate earnings begin rolling out over the next few days. There will be a lot riding on this earnings cycle. It will be the first quarter since President Donald Trump took office, providing a look at whether the euphoria that propelled major stock indexes to historic levels was justified. It could also be the spark that rejuvenates the market as investors have become increasingly cautious amid signs that many of the pro-growth policies promised by the new president may be delayed. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03%  fell 6.85 points to end at 20,656.10, closing flat for the week. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.08%  shed 1.95 points to finish at 2,355.54, falling 0.3% for the week and the Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 1.14 points to 5,877.81, logging a weekly decline of 0.6%. Here's what Trump could mean for the nonprofit sector(2:07) Feeding America CEO Diana Aviv explains how President Trump's proposed budget and fiscal policies could affect the nonprofit sector. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.35% Citigroup Inc. C, -0.77% and Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, -0.96% will be among the first to report quarterly results. The financial sector has been in the spotlight since the Federal Reserve’s shift to a tighter monetary policy regime, and first-quarter results will be a critical test for whether bank shares have more upside potential. Across the board, earnings are expected to rise as much as 12%, which will mark the highest growth in profitability since third quarter 2011, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet. However, there is always a chance that earnings may fall short. “What I do see as a possibility is early first-quarter earnings perhaps not living up to the expectations and that increases the selling pressure and the market uses that as a reason to sell off but I’m thinking if this does occur then we only see the selling mounting to down 5%-7%,” said Bob Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. There is also the risk that if earnings fail to revive the market’s momentum, investors may be forced to play an extended waiting game for the next catalyst. See also: Predictions for stocks, bonds, gold and oil after U.S. strike on Syria As Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James, noted, the S&P 500 has been corralled between 2,335 to 2,400 for the past couple of months, which he blames on the market being “confused” with no clear indication whether it is headed up or down. “The best strategy has been to basically do nothing,” said Saut. Jason Goepfert, president of Sundial Capital Research, pointed out that there is “a large conflict between bullish and bearish inputs.” Perhaps the confusion shouldn’t come as a surprise, given that for each incentive to buy stocks, there are just many reasons to sell. It may also be symptomatic of the uncertain times as President Trump’s policies get bogged down by politics. “If you are still of the belief we can get tax reform done in a meaningful bi-partisan way, then there is room to go on the upside because I think the market is pricing in only a 65/35 chance it does at this point. By meaningful I mean less than 25% corporate tax rate with a one time repatriation holiday at 10% and a cut in individual taxes ideally without a border-adjusted tax,” said Ian Winer, head of equities at Wedbush Securities. On the other hand, there is a strong case to sell stocks since tax reforms could fail given the difficulties over repealing and replacing Obamacare and tax cuts are not possible without a BAT, he said. Similar arguments apply to the economy. See also: Trump economy starting to look like the same-old, same-old “You buy if you think we can get to 3% to 3.5% GDP exiting 2018. You sell if you think the economy is not going to improve,” he said. “If we can’t grow above 2% to 2.5% then our upside is limited from here.” To make matters more murky for investors, even the charts are sending garbled messages. According to Goepfert, the NYSE Advance/Decline Line is climbing even while the S&P 500 is moving lower. The rise in the Advance/Decline Line, which tracks the number of advancing stocks minus the declining shares each day and adds that to the figure from the previous session, indicates a positive trend. Sundial Capital Research “The only times the S&P showed a loss over the prior month while the A/D Line rose at least 1% and hit a multiyear high during the month were in April 2014 and April 2016. Both led to nice rallies over the next few months,” he said in a report. However, Chris Kimble, founder and chief executive of Kimble Charting Solutions, had a different take on the market. Kimble believes the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, -0.32% a bellwether for the U.S. economy, may be forming a bearish pattern similar to the ones observed in 1998-99 and 2007-08. “The bulls will need the transports to blow through the red resistance line to breathe a sigh of relief. If not, it could spell trouble for the transports,” he wrote in a blog post. Kimble Charting Solutions In his chart, he pinpointed 9,109 as a key support level. “A break below this line would be the first warning to investors,” he said. The index closed at 9,104.81 on Friday.

And no Wall Street CEO is catching more of it than Jamie Dimon. Bloomberg News reports that the century-old connection between General Electric Co. and what is now JPMorgan Chase & Co., which dates back to the days of Thomas Edison, has become one of the most lucrative relationships in corporate America. Over the past five years, Immelt’s GE has paid Dimon’s JPMorgan $167 million in merger and acquisition fees, as GE jettisoned lending units to revive the parent company following the financial crisis. The question now is whether the good times are ending as GE’s restructuring is nearly complete and its pool of capital available for deals is shrinking. “The major pieces have been taken care of at this point,” said Jeff Windau, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. “That was kind of an extraordinary period of time for them.” Hit the link below to access the complete Bloomberg News article: JPMorgan's 125-Year Courtship of GE Is Paying Off Handsomely The $90 Billion Investor Who’s Out to Fire Wall Street And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is...

And JPMorgan Jamie Dimon wrote in his annual investor letter “it is clear that something is wrong” with the nation. Fink and Dimon belong to a coterie of business leaders advising President Trump. Appearing on CNBC, Fink suggested consumers and businesses are waiting on tax reform and deregulation after the healthcare-reform debacle. “There’s a greater worry that these proposed changes are going to be harder and harder to execute,” Fink said. He added that the country may trail the other G-7 nations in first-quarter growth. Tax reform and deregulation are needed to protect the markets, he said. Dimon, meanwhile, pointed in his letter to how the U.S. “has dumped trillions of dollars into wars, piled huge debt onto students and forced legions of foreigners to leave after getting advanced degrees,” according to Bloomberg. The CEO argued for more infrastructure spending and for corporate tax cuts as ways to spur the economy.

Marquez sued a father and son from Hacienda Heights in March 2017, claiming they stole $2.3 million in tax refunds from him. (Photo by Gene Blevins/LA DailyNews) By Stephanie K. Baer, The Whittier Daily News Posted: 04/06/17, 5:00 PM PDT | Updated: 10 hrs ago # Comments Professional Mexican boxer Juan Manuel Marquez has sued a major U.S. bank and a father and son duo convicted of tax fraud, alleging they stole $2.3 million in tax refunds through fake bank accounts opened at one of the bank’s branches in Whittier, according to court documents. In the civil complaint filed March 24 in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Marquez alleges agents at the Chase Bank, 13103 E. Philadelphia St., conspired with his former tax preparers to open fraudulent bank accounts they used to launder tax returns withheld from Marquez’s winnings from fights in the U.S. The complaint claims Adel Cotton and his son Heber Cotton, both of Hacienda Heights, forged a power of attorney from Marquez to open the accounts in which they deposited Marquez’s tax refund checks totaling $2,308,439. The Cottons filed returns for Marquez in 2013, claiming refunds of $898,057 for 2008 and $1,410,382 for 2012, according to the complaint. JP Morgan Chase & Co., Adel and Heber Cotton, and licensed notary Brian Lallement are listed as defendants in the case. “You can’t open an account in the United States unless you have positive proof of identity of a person,” said Alan J. Romero, Marquez’s attorney. “That didn’t happen here.” The complaint alleges the bank failed to comply with “mandatory statutory minimum requirements set forth by applicable California and federal law and/or regulations to prevent the use of (its) banking operations for the laundering of stolen tax refund monies.” The complaint also states that Marquez believes one or more Chase employees may have accepted bribes and violated other federal laws. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan declined to comment Friday. Marquez is a four-weight world champion boxer who has held seven world titles over the past 20 years. He is considered to be one of the greatest Mexican boxers of all time. According to the complaint, Marquez found out about the scheme in 2015 when his new accountant obtained his tax return records from the Internal Revenue Service. “We received a letter from the IRS indicating that they had paid the checks out,” said Noriel Zuazo, an accountant hired by Marquez in 2015. “(The checks) were deposited into an account that Mr. Marquez never authorized to open.” Both Cottons are currently serving sentences in federal prison for obtaining fraudulent tax refunds in a separate scheme that netted more than $2.6 million in bogus tax returns using stolen identities. They pleaded guilty in 2015 to one count each of conspiracy to defraud the federal government by filing at least 275 fraudulent income tax returns. Advertisement As in that case, the Cottons directed the IRS to mail Marquez’s refunds to addresses they controlled, according to the complaint. “Why the feds have not done anything, that’s certainly the $64,000 question,” Romero said. “It was really blatant.” A U.S. Department of Justice spokesman declined to comment on the case. Marquez is seeking millions in damages on 17 causes of action, including misrepresentation, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and civil remedy for stolen property.

');//--> } Home Wealth Management Speaking Book Contact New Glass Steagall: Repeal & Replace for Dodd-Frank ? April 7, 2017 12:30pm by Barry Ritholtz One of the great misunderstandings about the financial crisis is the role that repealing the Glass-Steagall Act played. This is newly relevant, as there has been interest from White House economic adviser Gary Cohn in restoring the Depression-era legislation. President Donald Trump is said to want to keep his campaign promise to restore Glass-Steagall as well. As someone who (literally) wrote a book on the subject, it’s a good time to revisit the actual impact of the repeal, and what its resurrection might mean to banks, investors, Wall Street and taxpayers. We begin by recounting why we had Glass-Steagall in the first place: the 1933 legislation divided banking into Main Street and Wall Street. Perhaps the best illustration of this is J.P. Morgan & Co. When the house of Morgan was split in two, one part became JP Morgan, a commercial bank (today it’s known as JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Morgan Stanley, a brokerage firm. The Main Street half of banking handled lower-risk activity, accepting deposits held in savings and checking accounts, while making personal and commercial loans and mortgages. The deposits in these institutions are backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which ultimately is guaranteed by taxpayers. This backstop effectively ended the tendency of banks to collapse amid panicked deposit runs spurred by bad news, either real of fake. Wall Street is the more speculative side of banking — it uses capital for trading, underwriting, mergers and acquisitions, investing, syndication, asset management and initial public offerings. These pools of capital (aka other people’s money) take on more risk, and in exchange potentially earn higher returns. As we saw in 1929 and again in 2008-09, there is the possibility of catastrophic loss, wiping out entire companies. Hence, Glass-Steagall was designed to act as a firebreak between Wall Street and its appetite for risk and Main Street and its demand for safety. The 1987 stock-market crash, before Glass-Steagall was gutted, is a perfect example of how a crisis on Wall Street was isolated from Main Street.

Alts Equities Smart-Beta New ETFs ETF Ecosystem Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Smart Beta Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2017 → April → What to Expect From Bank ETFs in Earnings Season What to Expect From Bank ETFs in Earnings Season April 6, 2017 at 10:46 am by Tom Lydon The Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLF) and other financial services exchange traded funds are among the more disappointing sector-level plays this year, particularly after the Federal Reserve boosted borrowing costs last month. A subsequent dovish tone from the Fed weighed on financial services, the S&P 500’s second-largest sector weight. As a result, XLF is up just 2% this year. With first-quarter earnings season right around the corner, some market observers believe investors should be careful in betting that earnings will meaningfully impact financial services ETFs. “As we head into quarterly results, our expectations have been lowered, but we remain optimistic near-term that bank fundamentals will continue improving–led mostly by higher rates,” according to part of a KBW note posted by Crystal Kim of Barron’s. KBW has mixed views on first-quarter results for some of XLF’s biggest holdings. The research firm is “raising first-quarter earnings estimates for Bank of New York Mellon (BK), State Street (STT), and Wells Fargo (WFC). He is lowering estimates for Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS),” according to Barron’s. The Trump administration’s expansionary policies would be especially beneficial for banks since the segment is sensitive to the overall economy. Moreover, the expansionary policies have fueled bets of increased Federal Reserve interest rate hikes to rein in a potentially overheating economy and rising inflation, which further supports lending revenue and their bottom line among bankers and insurers. The financial sector is getting hit by a double whammy as more are growing concerned over Trump’s ability to deliver on promises and yields on Treasury bonds pulled back. Financial sector valuations still look relatively cheap, compared to the broader market. The sector’s valuations are still about 25% below the average since the early 1990s. XLF is coming off one of its best annual performances since the global financial crisis. While the financial services sector, the second-largest sector allocation in the S&P 500, has some doubters after last year’s impressive rally, some market observers believe the sector can keep tracking higher this year. Some strategists also argue that the financial sector may be a good area to look at this time around, given the potential for growth in a rising rate environment, along with potential tax and regulatory changes under the Donald Trump administration.

The fiduciary rule was set to take effect on Monday, but the Labor Department has officially delayed it for 60 days starting April 7. In that time, the department can revise it, rescind it or request another delay. The rule would have required brokers who oversee $3 trillion in tax-advantaged retirement savings to act in their clients’ best interest. That is a stricter standard than many brokerages were using. After the rule was unveiled in April 2016, some brokerages moved clients from commission-based accounts that could run afoul of the rule to fee-only accounts. Among firms that disclosed their plans after the fiduciary rule was announced, Merrill Lynch— Bank of America Corp.’s BAC, -0.43%  wealth-management unit—and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.35%  say they are still moving most clients to fee-based accounts. A J.P. Morgan spokesman said the bank would push back its deadline to track the Labor Department’s actions. Other brokerages including Morgan Stanley and Edward Jones have said they would keep some previously announced changes, such as lower commission charges and some sales restrictions.

The fiduciary rule was set to take effect on Monday, but the Labor Department has officially delayed it for 60 days starting April 7. In that time, the department can revise it, rescind it or request another delay. The rule would have required brokers who oversee $3 trillion in tax-advantaged retirement savings to act in their clients’ best interest. That is a stricter standard than many brokerages were using. After the rule was unveiled in April 2016, some brokerages moved clients from commission-based accounts that could run afoul of the rule to fee-only accounts. Among firms that disclosed their plans after the fiduciary rule was announced, Merrill Lynch— Bank of America Corp.’s BAC, -0.43%  wealth-management unit—and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.35%  say they are still moving most clients to fee-based accounts. A J.P. Morgan spokesman said the bank would push back its deadline to track the Labor Department’s actions. Other brokerages including Morgan Stanley and Edward Jones have said they would keep some previously announced changes, such as lower commission charges and some sales restrictions.

With both bad loans and interest rates on the rise, financial institutions are becoming more selective in doling out credit for new-car purchases, adding to the pressure for automakers already up against the wall with sliding sales, swelling inventories and a used-car glut. “We’ve been having a party for a few years and it was fun,” said Maryann Keller, an industry consultant in Stamford, Connecticut. “Now lenders are getting back to basics.” Many figure they have to. For one thing, subprime borrowers have been falling behind on their car-loan payments at a rate not seen since just after the 2008 financial crisis. Delinquencies for auto debt of all stripes have been climbing, with the value of those behind for at least 30 days swelling to $23.3 billion in December, a 14 percent jump from a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve. This helps explain why 10 percent of senior bank-loan officers said they expect to pull back on extending credit to car buyers this year, according to a Fed survey. Expectations are that terms will toughen for loans the vast majority of Americans need to buy new vehicles as the Fed boosts benchmark rates.© Gabrielle Coppola, Matt Scully and David Welch    ‘Have to Reset’ “There are only so many people wanting a new car and only so much capital available,” said Daniel Parry, chief executive officer of Praxis Finance and co-founder of Exeter Finance, a Blackstone Group-backed subprime lender. “Manufacturers and lenders will have to reset to reduced volume levels.” The reset has already started, with auto sales dipping in each of the first three months of the year. In March, the annualized pace, adjusted for seasonal trends, slowed to 16.6 million from 16.7 million a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp. Analysts had projected it would accelerate to about 17.2 million. Now Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists figure there’s only demand for about 15 million per year, they said in an April 4 report. The industry set a record by selling 17.6 million cars and trucks in 2016 and has been on a seven-year growth streak. But General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and others had to pile on discounts and incentives to keep the expansion going, with both their finance arms and third-party lenders giving them a boost with easy credit. “This has come full circle,” Keller, the consultant, said. “We’ve created an auto market of 17.5 million vehicles based on accommodating credit. There will be consequences.” GM Residuals GM expects used-car prices will fall 7 percent this year, followed by “more normalized” deflation of 2 to 3 percent per year, Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens told analysts during a conference call Thursday. GM will still see lending profits grow this year, he said. Declining resale values are an issue of particular importance for leasing, which has been relied on to help consumers afford monthly payments on increasingly expensive new vehicles. When lenders lease vehicles to consumers, they make an assumption about what the car will be worth when it’s returned. If vehicles are depreciating more than expected, losses can pile up. Read More: Why auto-debt boom fuels bubble talk -- a QuickTake Q&A Carmakers and lenders may have to begin offering less-attractive terms on new leases. Loan officers are starting to demand bigger down payments or are raising the bar for income or credit scores they’re willing to accept. JPMorgan Chase & Co. will “pull back” on auto loans longer than seven years, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said in October. That may help address borrowers owing more on their vehicle than what its worth. Referred to as being “underwater,” those borrowers are rolling over their outstanding balance into an even bigger loans, a problem credit-rating companies have highlighted as a growing risk.© Gabrielle Coppola, Matt Scully and David Welch    ‘More Cautious’ Chris Halmy, CEO of Ally Financial Inc., recently told investors it would be “a bit more cautious on the credit side” in 2017 after warning that sinking used-vehicle prices and losses on consumer loans would weigh on profits. Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc., a major subprime auto lender, started pulling back after being stung by losses on auto loans made in 2015, executives said in a February investor presentation. Rising delinquencies have surpassed some credit graders’ initial forecasts, prompting their analysts to revise expectations for bonds backed by the debt. Lenders are in turn asking borrowers to put more money down, or are tightening criteria to approve new loans or leases, analysts have said. The restraint could cost the industry as many as 175,000 in new-car deliveries this year, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association, or about 1 percent of last year’s total. That may not sound like much, but auto companies are fighting for every sale as it is. They can sacrifice profits by subsidizing leases and offering below-market interest rates through their in-house financing arms, or they can accept lower volumes, said Steven Szakaly, chief economist for the dealer trade group NADA. Pricey Cars For consumers, the question is how many can continue to afford buying new cars. Wages in the U.S. haven’t kept pace with inflation, and the average new-vehicle price, at more than $35,000, is the highest ever. Car shoppers may downgrade their ambitions and pick cheaper models or defer to the used-car market instead. While that’s a negative for new-vehicle sales, it could help address a supply gut that’s worsening as a record number of leases expire and load up lots with three- or four-year-old cars and trucks. Lenders will stay busy, said Brian Landau, head of the auto business at credit-scoring company TransUnion. “Now a lot of financing companies are focusing on used-vehicle loans.” --With assistance from Jamie Butters  To contact the reporters on this story: Gabrielle Coppola in New York at gcoppola@bloomberg.net, Matt Scully in New York at mscully17@bloomberg.net, David Welch in Southfield at dwelch12@bloomberg.net.  To contact the editors responsible for this story: Craig Trudell at ctrudell1@bloomberg.net, David Papadopoulos at papadopoulos@bloomberg.net, Anne Reifenberg ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

For instance, the S&P 500 has outperformed its average stock this year since mid-February, after performing mostly in line at the beginning of the year. [www.bit.ly/2oQPVXF]"The fact that we're seeing stabilization in the global community will bode well for multinational companies and help earnings for the first quarter," said Terry Sandven, senior equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis."You've also seen the dollar not appreciate as much as many had forecast a quarter ago, so multinational companies may get some relief on the (foreign exchange) line," he said.A weaker dollar boosts offshore revenues when they are translated into the U.S. currency. The U.S. dollar index was down 1.8 percent in the first quarter, but it was still cheaper during last year's first quarter. STRONGER DATA AS EARNINGS LOOM A survey this week showed euro zone business activity at a six-year high. Forecasts from the International Monetary Fund show a pickup in the global economy in 2017 and 2018, especially in developing economies.However, some investors worry multinationals may have already priced in big gains in earnings."As long as nothing changes, these firms are going to be fine," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago, speaking of the strength of the largest American companies. He warned, however, that stock prices may have taken in any good news. "The market has certainly fully discounted all that."The U.S. earnings season gets under way next week, with results from banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup among others.The financial sector is projected to post a 15.4 percent profit gain, second only to energy among S&P sectors.Energy companies, which carried most of the losses that extended an S&P 500 earnings recession until the second quarter of last year, are expected to do most of the heavy lifting this earnings season with a whopping 600 percent increase. For the entire S&P 500, analysts are projecting earnings up 10.1 percent compared with a year ago, which would be the first double-digit increase since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data.Excluding the energy sector, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.1 percent.Revenue is expected to have jumped 7 percent, the most since 2011, which should help compensate for higher wage and other costs facing companies, strategists said."We're seeing revenues contribute materially more to that bottom-line growth," said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets in New York.Big profit gains are expected in technology and materials as well, the data showed."It comes down to a synchronized global economic acceleration ...; a rebound and stabilization in commodity prices and a higher interest rate environment," Palfrey said.

That's been a common refrain for months, including this week as he met for the first time with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. A "global recession" will occur if Trump follows through on his threatened 45 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, rival candidate Jeb Bush warned during the presidential campaign last year. No one wins in a trade war, said President Xi himself in a speech two months ago. The grain of truth here is that, yes, an all-out trade clash between the two largest economies would have immediate and negative consequences for workers and consumers around the world. But all of this may, at the same time, miss a key point: The global trade system has deep flaws that are related to China, not Trump. For years, China has been welcomed by the world into trade linkages, on the expectation that over time it will play the game of commerce the way others generally do. Trade experts say that hasn't happened. Even many of the same CEOs and economists who warn against a trade war say China has been violating both the letter and spirit of global trade rules. Trump's election-win stemmed partly from the resonance of his critique of trade policies as harming US workers. While outside experts may not paint the issue with the president's broad brush, some say a tougher stance toward China is needed, that a damaging trade war isn't the most likely outcome, and that the "just be patient" strategy carries its own deep risks. "His diagnosis is correct. It's very frustrating, I find, listening to the Washington trade establishment" view about not risking a trade war with China, says Robert Atkinson, an economist who studies the ties between global trade and national economic performance. "The war has been going on for 15 years, and in earnest for the last eight. The notion that if you respond you're a protectionist, or you're starting a trade war, ... that's incorrect." Atkinson, who heads the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank in Washington, doesn't endorse all of Trump's espoused trade views. But he argues China is a unique challenge because of its sheer size, coupled with its determination to parlay that market power into acquiring a leadership role in advanced industries from aerospace to computing. That means that when Beijing doesn't play by accepted rules, the damage to other nations including the US is considerable. Under President Barack Obama, the office of the US Trade Representative ramped up its engagement on alleged violations by China. The USTR's annual report covering 2016, for example, lists an array of settlements reached with China last year - over subsidies, taxes, or other policies in industries including aircraft, autos, financial information, wind power, and green technologies. That's a sign that progress can come when pressure is applied. The problem, say critics of China's trade policies, is that much more needs to change. Among the biggest sore spots is the way foreign companies doing business in China are pressured to transfer knowledge to Chinese partner firms in industries such as aerospace. WTO prohibits countries from making such demands, yet the Chinese arrangements are, in practice, hard to prosecute. "It's not just a manufacturing [jobs] issue," says Edward Alden, a trade expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. "There are very legitimate questions about what can be done to make China a fairer partner not just for the US but for the world." Jamie Dimon, CEO of the banking firm JPMorgan Chase, included some policy commentary in his annual letter to shareholders, and singled out China for "serious trade issues ... which have grown over the years - from cybersecurity and the protection of intellectual property to tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers and non-fulfillment of WTO obligations." As Trump and Xi met at the Trump-branded Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, there were few early signs of either progress or breakdown. Before a side-by-side dinner on Thursday, Trump offered that "we've had a long discussion already, and so far I have gotten nothing, absolutely nothing. But we have developed a friendship - I can see that - and I think long term we are going to have a very, very great relationship and I look very much forward to it." Is the friendly comment a sign that Trump will go just as soft on China as critics say some of his predecessors have been? That's actually just one of many unanswered questions about Trump and trade policy. For all the concern in some quarters that he'll go too far, resulting in tit-for-tat sanctions that cause a recession, leading Democrats in Congress are urging him to get tough. Alden says it's still too early to gauge the tenor of Trump's policies. His trade team is far from complete and some of his appointees differ in tone. One crucial decision will be how much to seek a broader international coalition to press China. Trump has voiced a penchant for bilateral dealing and deal making. But Alden echoes many experts when he says "you're always better off working with allies than working alone." Atkinson says the goal isn't to block China's development but to insist on a rule-of-law system under which all parties can benefit. Coupled with innovation policies to maintain America's dynamism at home, such a strategy could avert the potential loss of key industries, he says. "When we have pushed the Chinese in the past, in a respectful but firm way with our allies, we have prevailed," Atkinson says. - The Christian Science Monitor Share More > Vote MORE FROM Opinion and Editorial Opinion and Editorial Europe needs to secure its borders and people There are more refugees per capita than any other country in Europe READ MORE Opinion and Editorial Why the Indian rupee is rising against the dollar How soon will the rupee start depreciating against the dollar?

A strong earnings season would help justify pricey stock valuations, with the S&P 500 rallying this month to its most expensive since 2004 on a forward price-to-earnings basis. While the U.S. economy has gotten a lot of attention since the Nov. 8 election and President Donald Trump's vows to boost the domestic economy, data during the quarter has suggested the global economy is strengthening. That is welcome news for S&P components, since nearly half of their sales come from overseas. Shares of the biggest U.S. companies, which tend to have the most overseas exposure, have been among the strongest performers over the past several weeks. For instance, the S&P 500 has outperformed its average stock this year since mid-February, after performing mostly in line at the beginning of the year. [http://www.bit.ly/2oQPVXF] "The fact that we're seeing stabilization in the global community will bode well for multinational companies and help earnings for the first quarter," said Terry Sandven, senior equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. "You've also seen the dollar not appreciate as much as many had forecast a quarter ago, so multinational companies may get some relief on the (foreign exchange) line," he said. A weaker dollar boosts offshore revenues when they are translated into the U.S. currency. The U.S. dollar index was down 1.8 percent in the first quarter, but it was still cheaper during last year's first quarter. STRONGER DATA AS EARNINGS LOOM A survey this week showed euro zone business activity at a six-year high. Forecasts from the International Monetary Fund show a pickup in the global economy in 2017 and 2018, especially in developing economies. However, some investors worry multinationals may have already priced in big gains in earnings. "As long as nothing changes, these firms are going to be fine," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago, speaking of the strength of the largest American companies. He warned, however, that stock prices may have taken in any good news. "The market has certainly fully discounted all that." The U.S. earnings season gets under way next week, with results from banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup among others. The financial sector is projected to post a 15.4 percent profit gain, second only to energy among S&P sectors. Energy companies, which carried most of the losses that extended an S&P 500 earnings recession until the second quarter of last year, are expected to do most of the heavy lifting this earnings season with a whopping 600 percent increase. For the entire S&P 500, analysts are projecting earnings up 10.1 percent compared with a year ago, which would be the first double-digit increase since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Excluding the energy sector, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.1 percent. Revenue is expected to have jumped 7 percent, the most since 2011, which should help compensate for higher wage and other costs facing companies, strategists said. "We're seeing revenues contribute materially more to that bottom-line growth," said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. Big profit gains are expected in technology and materials as well, the data showed. "It comes down to a synchronized global economic acceleration ...; a rebound and stabilization in commodity prices and a higher interest rate environment," Palfrey said.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 98,000 jobs last month, the fewest since last May, the Labor Department said on Friday. Job gains, which had exceeded 200,000 in January and February, were also held back by a slowdown in hiring at construction sites, factories and leisure and hospitality businesses, which had been boosted by unseasonably warm temperatures earlier in the year. In March, temperatures dropped and a storm lashed the Northeast and Midwest. Economists said bad weather accounted for the stepdown in hiring. The two-tenths of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate from 4.7 percent in February took it to its lowest level since May 2007. “The disappointing gain in nonfarm payrolls in March is a bit of a head fake that doesn’t reflect the underlying strength and momentum in the labor market,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. While the bigger establishment survey showed fewer jobs created last month, the smaller and more volatile survey of households showed employment increased 472,000. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population and some Federal Reserve officials view the labor market as being at full employment. Economists had forecast payrolls increasing 180,000 last month and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.7 percent. The dollar rose a three-week high against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street rose. Job growth averaged 178,000 per month in the first quarter, underscoring the labor market’s strength, despite last month’s stumble. The solid employment gains suggest that an apparent slowdown in gross domestic product growth to around a 1.0 percent annualized pace in the first quarter is probably temporary. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Average hourly earnings increased 5 cents or 0.2 percent in March after rising 0.3 percent in February. That lowered the year-on-year gain in wages to 2.7 percent. But with inflation rising and the unemployment rate below the most recent Fed median forecast for full employment, economists expect another interest rate increase in June. The U.S. central bank lifted its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more increases this year. Minutes from the Fed’s mid-March meeting showed most policymakers expected to start reducing the Fed’s $4.5 trillion bond portfolio later this year. New York Fed President William Dudley said on Friday that would prompt only a “little pause” in the central bank’s rate hike plans. “If today’s decline in the unemployment rate doesn’t reverse itself they may be compelled not only to hike but also to signal a faster pace of future tightening,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Other measures also showed labor market slack shrinking. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, held at an 11-month high of 63 percent in March. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 8.9 percent, the lowest level since December 2007. The employment-to-population ratio increased one-tenth of a percentage point to a fresh eight-year high of 60.1 percent. Last month, construction jobs rose 6,000, the weakest gain since August, after robust increases in January and February. Manufacturing employment advanced by 11,000 jobs, slowing from the 26,000 positions created in February. Retail payrolls fell 29,700, declining for a second straight month. Employment at clothing retailers decreased by 5,800 jobs last month and general merchandise stores shed 34,700 positions. Retailers including J.C. Penney Co Inc and Macy’s Inc have announced thousands of layoffs as they shift toward online sales and scale back on brick-and-mortar operations. Leisure and hospitality payrolls increased 9,000, a third of February’s job gains, as employment at amusement parks fell 6,900. Government payrolls increased 9,000 as state and local government hiring offset a 1,000 drop in federal jobs.   SEE COMMENTS → News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Father charged with son’s 1979 murder in Maine cold case squad’s first arrest Collaboration between Amish builders, solar company results in ‘solar shed’ We asked how to attract younger people to Maine.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid By Caroline Valetkevitch | NEW YORK NEW YORK America First may be a main policy of the White House and fuel to the stock market rally but U.S. investors are looking overseas for stronger earnings as S&P 500 companies are set to report their first quarter of double-digit profit gains since 2014. A strong earnings season would help justify pricey stock valuations, with the S&P 500 rallying this month to its most expensive since 2004 on a forward price-to-earnings basis. While the U.S. economy has gotten a lot of attention since the Nov. 8 election and President Donald Trump's vows to boost the domestic economy, data during the quarter has suggested the global economy is strengthening. That is welcome news for S&P components, since nearly half of their sales come from overseas. Shares of the biggest U.S. companies, which tend to have the most overseas exposure, have been among the strongest performers over the past several weeks. For instance, the S&P 500 has outperformed its average stock this year since mid-February, after performing mostly in line at the beginning of the year. [www.bit.ly/2oQPVXF] "The fact that we're seeing stabilization in the global community will bode well for multinational companies and help earnings for the first quarter," said Terry Sandven, senior equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. "You've also seen the dollar not appreciate as much as many had forecast a quarter ago, so multinational companies may get some relief on the (foreign exchange) line," he said. A weaker dollar boosts offshore revenues when they are translated into the U.S. currency. The U.S. dollar index was down 1.8 percent in the first quarter, but it was still cheaper during last year's first quarter. STRONGER DATA AS EARNINGS LOOM A survey this week showed euro zone business activity at a six-year high. Forecasts from the International Monetary Fund show a pickup in the global economy in 2017 and 2018, especially in developing economies. However, some investors worry multinationals may have already priced in big gains in earnings. "As long as nothing changes, these firms are going to be fine," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago, speaking of the strength of the largest American companies. He warned, however, that stock prices may have taken in any good news. "The market has certainly fully discounted all that." The U.S. earnings season gets under way next week, with results from banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup among others. The financial sector is projected to post a 15.4 percent profit gain, second only to energy among S&P sectors. Energy companies, which carried most of the losses that extended an S&P 500 earnings recession until the second quarter of last year, are expected to do most of the heavy lifting this earnings season with a whopping 600 percent increase. For the entire S&P 500, analysts are projecting earnings up 10.1 percent compared with a year ago, which would be the first double-digit increase since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Excluding the energy sector, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.1 percent. Revenue is expected to have jumped 7 percent, the most since 2011, which should help compensate for higher wage and other costs facing companies, strategists said. "We're seeing revenues contribute materially more to that bottom-line growth," said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. Big profit gains are expected in technology and materials as well, the data showed. "It comes down to a synchronized global economic acceleration ...; a rebound and stabilization in commodity prices and a higher interest rate environment," Palfrey said.

MENG ZHONGDE/FOR CHINA DAILY For the second month in running, China's foreign exchange reserves rose slightly in March to steady above trillion. Analysts said the stockpile will remain stable at least in the short term as the economy stabilizes. The reserves increased by .96 billion during March to reach .009 trillion, according to data of the People's Bank of China, the central bank. It marked the first time that the reserves had increased for two consecutive months since April 2016. In January, the reserves fell below the trillion mark, triggering concerns that they may continue to drop. But, in February, the reserves rose above that level. Capital outflows are an important factor influencing China's scale of foreign exchange reserves, said Zhang Yansheng, chief economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. “The US' economic prospects remain blurred and the Chinese economy has been widely seen as having largely stabilized, contributing to easing capital outflows,” Zhang said. But if the US continued to raise interest rates as frequently as expected and launched a trade war with China, the situation would change for the worse and China may face heavier capital outflow pressure, he said. Zhu Haibin, chief China economist with JPMorgan Chase & Co, also said capital outflows are expected to slow this year. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange said that the country's foreign exchange reserves “may become more stable” given the resilient economic fundamentals. “China's economy has sound fundamentals, great potential and a high level of resilience, and will continue to grow at a stable and relatively fast pace,” it said. Cross-border capital flows will also become more balanced and the reform to marketize the exchange rate formation of the renminbi has progressed steadily, contributing to the easing capital outflow pressure it faces, the statement said. China's economic growth remained stable in the first two months, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics. Analysts said the trend is expected to continue in March and April. “The trend of stable and improving growth will continue in April,” said Hu Yuexiao, chief analyst of Shanghai Securities Co. Investment growth has picked up and corporate profits are also improving, he said. In the first quarter of this year, foreign exchange reserves fell by .4 billion and the fall was significantly smaller than in the previous two quarters, the administration said. China's gold reserves' value fell to .74 billion at the end of March from .376 billion at the end of February, the central bank said.

The ECB proposal to European Union states, seen by Reuters, says that a draft piece of legislation on foreign bank regulation already under discussion among the 28 EU members should be toughened further. The draft rules, proposed by the EU executive commission in November, require foreign lenders with a major presence in the EU to combine their businesses in the region into a separately capitalised holding company. The proposal is aimed at ensuring that foreign banks classed as globally systemic lenders or those with at least 30 billion euros of assets in the EU are able to sustain significant losses without support from their headquarters. It has already been met with strong opposition from non-EU banks who say it would significantly raise the cost and bureaucracy of operating in the EU. But now the ECB is proposing the law goes further and requires branches of foreign banks to be included in the EU holding company, a move that would likely raise foreign lenders’ capital requirements. The draft law had exempted branches. The ECB said it was making the proposal more comprehensive as it was concerned that the draft law could lead to “regulatory arbitrage” where banks booked important transactions in branches in order to reduce the level of assets that would be subject to the holding company’s capital requirements. The changes it proposes would also bring the draft EU law in line with similar rules faced by large foreign banks in the US, it said. Currently, big lenders such as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America or the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, carry out significant operations through branches in the EU rather than subsidiaries, the paper said, meaning the capital reserves they keep inside the bloc are lower, posing a higher risk to financial stability. The ECB is also proposing that the holding companies be regulated by whoever supervises the largest individual entity within the group, which in practice would most often be the ECB. This would mark a broadening of the central bank’s supervisory reach, partly at the expense of national securities watchdogs inside the EU. The proposal, that was drafted together with the EU’s banking liquidation body, the Single Resolution Board, is also aimed at facilitating the SRB task of preparing resolution plans for banks operating in the EU, so that in case they fail, their creditors’ funds can be used to prop them up, instead of taxpayers’ money. EU envoys last week had a first exchange of views on the paper, dated March 28. The issue may be discussed at a regular meeting of the bloc’s finance ministers in Malta on Friday and Saturday although it is not formally on the agenda. The ECB move was welcomed by France, whose large banks have been lately hit by US competitors, and also pleased smaller EU countries where branches of foreign banks operate, because it would reduce lenders’ risks by stepping up controls and the transparency of their operations, officials briefed on the envoys’ meeting said. But the legislative change would hit EU’s larger financial centres making them likely less attractive to foreign banks as headquarters for their continent-wide operations. Britain “strongly disagreed” with the ECB proposal, the source said. Britain and Luxembourg, which host Europe’s biggest financial hubs, have already protested against the original proposals made by the European Commission.

First, the "Mad Money" host noted that the market prefers decisiveness to uncertainty, hence the positive response to Trump denouncing the use of chemical weapons and taking action. Cramer attributed the soft response to the Labor Department's employment report to bad weather marring construction hiring and a newfound understanding that lost retail jobs are not because of slowing consumer spending, but Amazon's growing influence. Finally, oil prices spiked on inflamed tensions in the Middle East. "I know it's counter intuitive to like higher rates and higher oil prices but these are signs, at least to some market participants, that the economy is still strong even as last month's hiring seems disappointing," Cramer said. With the market's resilience in mind, here are the stocks and events on Cramer's radar next week: Monday: Oil, rates, takeovers The bulls are itching to see oil break out of its $47 to $52 range into the $53 to $54 area, and would also do well to see the 10-year Treasury's rates rise from 2.3 percent up to 2.4 or 2.5 percent. Cramer also expects some takeover action in the biotechnology, consumer packaged goods, and oils sectors. "I believe there are several European drug companies desperate to expand their pipelines and I expect them to start making deals in the near future. We know Kraft-Heinz is ready to pull the trigger on a deal, [but] we don't know who it's going to be," he said. "And the amount of call option buying in the major independent oils with Permian exposure this week, it was extraordinary." Tuesday: PMIs Purchasing Managers' indices from China and the United Kingdom concern Cramer, because if China's is weak, leaders there could insist on stimulus via U.S. business involvement. "That would be a sign that the Trump meetings with the Chinese president this week went very well," he said. But post-Brexit inflation in the United Kingdom could push the country's central bank to raise rates, an effect that could spark worries going forward. Wednesday: Mortgage applications, Delta, Mosaic Mortgage applications: "We need to see some proof that April's started off better than March finished," Cramer said, and the first good indicator will come from mortgage application data. "Have these new lows that we've seen in rates ... spurred any buying? Is the spring selling season, so important for housing, starting strongly? I think this number, actually, strangely, is going to be the most important number about what's going on right now in the economy," the "Mad Money" host said. Delta: The airliner reports earnings ahead of market open, and Cramer is worried about the effects of a slowdown in travel, though he does not expect any major bombshells. "Either way, I want you to keep in mind that Warren Buffett owns 8% of this airline's stock, and I generally like buying a Buffett stock if I can get it on weakness," Cramer said. Mosaic: An analyst meeting at the fertilizer company, and Cramer expects a strong story and says some upgrades for the lagging agriculture play are possible. "I would actually like to own the stock ahead of that meeting," Cramer said. Thursday: Big banks, small banks, Taiwan Semiconductor JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo will report earnings in the morning, and Cramer is paying attention to net interest margins, or the "free money" banks make from deposits, loan growth, which he hopes has not slowed from the first quarter, and expenses in the midst of regulatory rollbacks. In the case of Wells Fargo, Cramer hopes to gauge whether the bank has evaded the cross-selling scandal for good. Cramer is also watching smaller banks PNC and First Horizon, as the companies' earnings could reveal whether commercial construction has slowed due to recent impasses in Washington. Taiwan Semiconductor: If the chipmaker's earnings report shows that $171 billion company is spending, Cramer says investors should pick up shares of Lam Research or Applied Materials, as they will be the direct beneficiaries of Taiwan Semiconductor's capital outflows. Markets are closed on Good Friday, so Cramer suggests taking a breath before earnings season really kicks into gear the following week. "[The] bottom line is that the average just keep staying resilient, and if you stick around, I'll explain the itchy fingers that may very well be behind this market's seeming inability to crater even when you expect it to just plain get obliterated," Cramer said.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website 5  ×  4  =  Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Saudi Aramco is reportedly worth over $2 trillion, twice the market cap of Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL). Aramco controls 20% of the world's proven oil reserves, or 267 billion barrels of oil, and that has investors eager to buy Saudi Aramco stock. They'll get their chance soon. The world's biggest oil company is planning an initial public offering soon, and it's going to break records. But investors need to approach the Aramco IPO with caution. The big numbers gloss over some serious issues with the company… The Saudi Aramco IPO is projected to be the largest IPO of all time. The company is expected to offer 5% of the company for public sale, and with a total valuation of $2 trillion, the IPO will be worth a record-smashing $100 billion. That's four times bigger than the current record holder, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA), which debuted at a whopping $25 billion. In fact, Saudi Aramco's market cap is very likely to be larger than Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM), Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (NYSE ADR: RDS.A), BP Plc. (NYSE:BP), and Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX), combined. Trending: The Best Stocks to Buy (and When to Sell) for Mega-Profits in 2017 But, at one point, a Saudi Aramco stock offering was supposed to happen already. The Saudi Arabian IPO date has been pushed back by more than a year since it was first announced in January 2016. That's because the Aramco IPO is much more complicated than a typical IPO, and it means potential investors need to pay careful attention to what's going on… When Can I Buy Saudi Aramco Stock? The Saudi Aramco IPO is expected to be the biggest of all time, but its massive size is also making the IPO process difficult. It also means there's no concrete date for the IPO. The company has had to hire firms to manage the IPO, from advisors to underwriters. This is a standard part of a company going public, but the size of Aramco has made the competition fierce. The Aramco IPO could produce over $1 billion in fees for participating banks. Plus, winning a spot in the IPO process could mean future business with the oil giant. "Every bank in the world is going to want to have a role in this," reported the Financial Times in January. That's why it was a shock when Aramco chose a small boutique investment bank to advise on the IPO. Moelis & Co. (NYSE: MC) beat out investment banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) to sign the coveted agreement. But Aramco went with a more expected approach when it chose its underwriters. Saudi Aramco chose JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and HSBC to underwrite its IPO. That means these Wall Street titans will be promoting the stock and committing to buy shares of it if the public doesn't. But the next step in the process for Aramco will be deciding which stock exchange to list the company on, and that's a much bigger hurdle to leap. Must Read: Five Double-Digit Dividend Plays to Secure Your "Second Salary" Aramco will list some shares on the Saudi Arabian stock exchange, but it's also looking to list shares on a major stock exchange with global reach. The company has short-listed exchanges in New York, London, or Hong Kong. But major exchanges like these have public reporting requirements that could open the company up to the public in a way it has never done. If the Saudi Aramco IPO occurred on a stock exchange in the United States, the firm would need to follow U.S. fiduciary laws regarding transparency and public auditing. It would also have to form a board of directors that could take some power away from the Saudi royal family. Money Morning Global Energy Strategist Dr. Kent Moors notes that Saudi Arabia was never keen to sell Saudi Aramco because it could mean having to reveal information about the oil fields it would rather keep to itself. It also means the company will have to disentangle itself from the government. Just last week the Saudi government took a step toward that by announcing it was slashing the tax rate on Aramco from 85% to 50%. That makes Aramco stock more attractive to investors, but shows how deeply reliant the government was on the oil company. The government is expected to make up the difference through dividend payments once the company goes public. But the biggest hurdle to the IPO might be convincing investors it's a good stock to own in the first place… Saudi Aramco Stock Might Be Riskier Than You Think Join the conversation.

A strong earnings season would help justify pricey stock valuations, with the S&P 500 rallying this month to its most expensive since 2004 on a forward price-to-earnings basis. While the U.S. economy has gotten a lot of attention since the Nov. 8 election and President Donald Trump’s vows to boost the domestic economy, data during the quarter has suggested the global economy is strengthening. That is welcome news for S&P components, since nearly half of their sales come from overseas. Strongest performers Shares of the biggest U.S. companies, which tend to have the most overseas exposure, have been among the strongest performers over the past several weeks. For instance, the S&P 500 has outperformed its average stock this year since mid-February, after performing mostly in line at the beginning of the year. “The fact that we’re seeing stabilisation in the global community will bode well for multinational companies and help earnings for the first quarter,” said Terry Sandven, senior equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. “You’ve also seen the dollar not appreciate as much as many had forecast a quarter ago, so multinational companies may get some relief,” he said. A weaker dollar boosts offshore revenues when they are translated into the U.S. currency. The U.S. dollar index was down 1.8% in the first quarter, but it was still cheaper during last year’s first quarter. A recent survey showed euro zone business activity at a six-year high. Forecasts from the IMF show a pickup in the global economy in 2017 and 2018, especially in developing economies. However, some investors worry multinationals may have already priced in big gains in earnings. “As long as nothing changes, these firms are going to be fine,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago, speaking of the strength of the largest American companies. He warned, however, that stock prices may have taken in any good news. “The market has certainly fully discounted all that.” The U.S. earnings season gets under way next week, with results from banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup among others. The financial sector is projected to post a 15.4% profit gain, second only to energy among S&P sectors. Big profit gains are expected in technology and materials as well, the data showed. “It comes down to a synchronized global economic acceleration...; a rebound and stabilization in commodity prices and a higher interest rate environment,” said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets.

That’s been a common refrain for months, including this week as he met for the first time with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. A “global recession” will occur if Mr. Trump follows through on his threatened 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods, rival candidate Jeb Bush warned during the presidential campaign last year. Recommended: Trump's biggest executive actions, explained No one wins in a trade war, said President Xi himself in a speech two months ago. The grain of truth here is that, yes, an all-out trade clash between the two largest economies would have immediate and negative consequences for workers and consumers around the world. But all of this may, at the same time, miss a key point: The global trade system has deep flaws that are related to China, not Trump. For years, China has been welcomed by the world into trade linkages, on the expectation that over time it will play the game of commerce the way others generally do. Trade experts say that hasn’t happened. Even many of the same CEOs and economists who warn against a trade war say China has been violating both the letter and spirit of global trade rules. Trump’s election win stemmed partly from the resonance of his critique of trade policies as harming US workers. While outside experts may not paint the issue with the president’s broad brush, some say a tougher stance toward China is needed, that a damaging trade war isn’t the most likely outcome, and that the “just be patient” strategy carries its own deep risks. “His diagnosis is correct. It's very frustrating, I find, listening to the Washington trade establishment” view about not risking a trade war with China, says Robert Atkinson, an economist who studies the ties between global trade and national economic performance. “The war has been going on for 15 years, and in earnest for the last eight. The notion that if you respond you're a protectionist, or you're starting a trade war, ... that's incorrect.” DAMAGE TO NATIONS  Mr. Atkinson, who heads the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank in Washington, doesn’t endorse all of Trump’s espoused trade views. But he argues China is a unique challenge because of its sheer size, coupled with its determination to parlay that market power into acquiring a leadership role in advanced industries from aerospace to computing. That means that when Beijing doesn’t play by accepted rules, the damage to other nations including the US is considerable. Under President Barack Obama, the office of the US Trade Representative ramped up its engagement on alleged violations by China. The USTR’s annual report covering 2016, for example, lists an array of settlements reached with China last year – over subsidies, taxes, or other policies in industries including aircraft, autos, financial information, wind power, and green technologies. That’s a sign that progress can come when pressure is applied. The problem, say critics of China’s trade policies, is that much more needs to change. Among the biggest sore spots is the way foreign companies doing business in China are pressured to transfer knowledge to Chinese partner firms in industries such as aerospace. The World Trade Organization prohibits countries from making such demands, yet the Chinese arrangements are, in practice, hard to prosecute. “It’s not just a manufacturing [jobs] issue,” says Edward Alden, a trade expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. “There are very legitimate questions about what can be done to make China a fairer partner not just for the United States but for the world.” Jamie Dimon, CEO of the banking firm JPMorgan Chase, included some policy commentary in his annual letter to shareholders, and singled out China for “serious trade issues ... which have grown over the years – from cybersecurity and the protection of intellectual property to tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers and non-fulfillment of World Trade Organization obligations.” FEW SIGNALS FROM SUMMIT As Trump and Xi met at the Trump-branded Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, there were few early signs of either progress or breakdown. Before a side-by-side dinner Thursday, Trump offered that “we’ve had a long discussion already, and so far I have gotten nothing, absolutely nothing. But we have developed a friendship – I can see that – and I think long term we are going to have a very, very great relationship and I look very much forward to it.” Is the friendly comment a sign that Trump will go just as soft on China as critics say some of his predecessors have been? That’s actually just one of many unanswered questions about Trump and trade policy. For all the concern in some quarters that he’ll go too far, resulting in tit-for-tat sanctions that cause a recession, leading Democrats in Congress are urging him to get tough. Mr. Alden says it’s still too early to gauge the tenor of Trump’s policies. His trade team is far from complete and some of his appointees differ in tone. One crucial decision will be how much to seek a broader international coalition to press China. Trump has voiced a penchant for bilateral dealing and dealmaking. But Alden echoes many experts when he says “you're always better off working with allies than working alone.” Atkinson says the goal isn’t to block China’s development but to insist on a rule-of-law system under which all parties can benefit. Coupled with innovation policies to maintain America’s dynamism at home, such a strategy could avert the potential loss of key industries, he says. “When we have pushed the Chinese in the past, in a respectful but firm way with our allies, we have prevailed,” Atkinson says.

Unemployment in March had already declined to the level they’d expected it to hit by the end of 2017. That combined with what some economists viewed as another head-scratcher. Even as unemployment fell to 4.5 percent, its lowest level in almost 10 years, wages remained on just a gentle upward path. Average hourly earnings rose 2.7 percent year-on-year, essentially the same as the average over the previous 12 months. How policy makers react depends on how they unravel that riddle. If they conclude that it’s only a matter of time before falling joblessness triggers a stronger response in wages and prices, the Fed may be inclined pick up the pace of rate increases. Their current set of projections points them toward three total hikes this year, including a March move already in the books. But there’s another option. They could decide to lower their estimate for the level at which unemployment becomes inflationary -- the so-called non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or Nairu. That would justify sticking to their current outlook for rates. “There’s a good chance we’ll see them revising the Nairu downward” when Fed officials submit new projections in June, said Thomas Costerg, senior U.S. economist at Standard Chartered Bank. “The Fed is flying a bit in the dark on Nairu. The canary in the coal mine is wage growth, and the fact is wage growth remains tepid.” It wouldn’t be the first time central bankers shifted that estimate. Nairu is the term now in fashion for what Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman first described in 1968 as the “natural rate of unemployment.” First thought of as a fixed level, Nairu is what economists now see as a trigger point that can move substantially over time. As recently as 2013, Fed officials estimated Nairu in the U.S. around 5.6 percent. After unemployment hit its Great Recession peak of 10 percent in 2009 and kept on falling without triggering much movement in inflation, they revised their estimates downward. Expressed in Fed projections as the “longer-run” estimate for unemployment, the median level of their estimates now sits at 4.7 percent. “They’ve already overshot on their measure,” said Allen Sinai, president and co-founder of Decision Economics in New York who also thinks Fed officials will ratchet down their estimates in June. Other economists, however, disagreed. “Inflation doesn’t jump back to normal as soon as you hit Nairu,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. “The current period looks very similar to what happened in the late 2000s and the late 1990s. In each case, unemployment went below Nairu and you got a very gentle acceleration in inflation.” Neither Harris nor Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, thought the Fed would respond to the new data by lowering their estimate for Nairu. “Wage growth isn’t strong, but I think it’s very hard to look at the chart of average hourly earnings and not see an acceleration from the 2.0 percent rate that prevailed from 2010 to 2015,” he said.

The board said in a proxy it was against the measure. Morgan Stanley and the board defeated the proposal at the annual meeting last year. It received 16 percent of votes cast. Morgan Stanley, like many other Wall Street firms, allows employees to receive stock that otherwise would have been locked up for years if they depart the bank for Washington.
