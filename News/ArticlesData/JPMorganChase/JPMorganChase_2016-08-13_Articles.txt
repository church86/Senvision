If the Fed agrees, the extension would give banks more time to exit fund investments that are difficult to sell, but no longer allowed by the law. The added grace period, which follows three one-year extensions, would start next year and run through 2022. The law on Volcker rule implementation says banks can ask for an extra five-year extension for "illiquid" funds, where banks had contractual commitments to invest. In deciding whether to grant Wall Street more leeway, the Fed has asked banks to provide details on their specific investments to prove that they fall under the statutory definition of "illiquid," said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss non-public regulatory discussions. Those seeking the extension include Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co and some other banks, the sources said. They are making their push in part through Wall Street lobbying group the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA). "SIFMA is working with our members to ensure that regulators have the data they need to adequately appraise the situation," the association said in a statement to Reuters. Congress intended to provide "an appropriate transition period" so that banks could exit illiquid funds without disrupting markets, SIFMA added. The banks and the Federal Reserve declined to comment. The Volcker rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, is part of the sweeping 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. It aims to reduce risk-taking by preventing banks from using their own capital to make speculative bets. Critics say its many loopholes – with exemptions for activities like merchant banking and foreign exchange trading – have made it less effective than it was intended to be. "It's laughable that the biggest, most sophisticated financial firms in the world claim they can't sell the stakes year after year," said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of non-profit Better Markets. "Everyone else in America has to comply with the law and Wall Street should also."   TOUGH CALL The Fed has already granted three one-year extensions for compliance with a broader provision of the Volcker rule regarding stakes in hedge funds and private equity funds – the maximum number of extensions it could provide in that context. The new requests, which were widely expected, concern only "illiquid" fund investments. The Fed risks criticism for giving Wall Street more wiggle room, but also risks blame for fire-sale losses or for banks and their investor clients getting tied up in court if they are forced to exit certain contractual agreements quickly. Before the crisis, big banks had proprietary trading desks that made bets on market direction, as well as in-house hedge funds, investments in external hedge funds and co-investments alongside clients in internal private-equity funds. Underlying assets could range from investments in private companies to real estate and long-dated derivatives. While the regulated banks have spun off much of that activity, bankers say there are still some investments that do not contractually expire for years or lack a liquid market for an immediate sale. But disclosures are few and far between, making it difficult to independently discern how truly illiquid the investments are. Banks are now asking the Fed for more time to exit stakes in funds they deem to be illiquid, sources said. In response, the Fed is demanding more details about why the funds, or their underlying assets, are considered illiquid, how much time it would take to exit the investments and what efforts have been made to exit investments sooner, sources said. In granting banks its final one-year extension last month, the Fed said it would soon provide details on how it will address illiquid funds. Banks have been selling down non-compliant investments over the last several years, with Goldman having reduced its exposure by more than half since mid-2013. Yet in regulatory filings, banks have said they may face difficulty in getting rid of those investments by upcoming deadlines. As of June 30, Goldman Sachs held $7 billion worth of private equity investments, real estate holdings and hedge funds affected by the Volcker rule. In March, Goldman said it expected to sell the majority of those stakes before the July 2017 deadline, but it removed that language in its most recent quarterly filing. Morgan Stanley, which has about $3.2 billion in real estate and private equity funds, recently said it expected to be able to divest much of those investments. But the bank said in a second-quarter filing that it expected to ask for further extensions "for certain illiquid funds." JPMorgan has around $1 billion in hedge funds, private equity and real estate investments.

The emergency deal to save the 544-year-old bank, orchestrated by Mediobanca and JPMorgan, will incur about BP250m ("212m) in underwriting fees for a proposed BP5bn capital hike, according to three sources involved in the deal. The fees come on top of nearly "400m that the bank has paid out in the past two years for other capital hikes. There is no certainty that the proposed rescue plan will proceed, but if it is carried out successfully, investment banks working with Monte dei Paschi will ave generated a payday of close to "1bn over the past three years, even though the bank"s market value now stands at "747m. "The scale of fees that potentially are there in the Italian banking market " from restructurings and consolidation " are substantial," said Peter Hahn, professor of banking at the London Institute of Banking & Finance. The bank paid "130m to a pool of banks for a "3bn cash call last year. In 2014 it spent more than any other company in Europe on investment banking fees, paying advisers nearly "274m for its "5bn capital hike, according to Thomson Reuters data. By contrast Deutsche Bank paid "119m in 2014 to underwriters for its "8bn capital hike, according to its rights issue.     MENA News Headlines  Nov 23 2016 -  UAE national graduate on Etihad Airways’ runway to success, MENAFN Press (MENAFN Press) Etihad Airways, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, has celebrated the graduation of 310 future leaders from the company’s Future Leaders Programmes.

Millennials' distrust of banks is spawning a new breed of startups Tech Insider 8/14/2016 Avery Hartmans © Provided by Business Insider Inc miley cyrus cash dollars bills wild free For anyone who came of age during the 2008 financial crisis, it's hard to forget the names of the banks who needed bailouts or the tents of Occupy Wall Street.  Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 111.18 -0.62 -0.55% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▲ 78.87 +0.34 +0.43% Older millennials likely graduated college into an environment where jobs were scarce, and younger millennials are currently saddled with hefty student debt, so it's no wonder young people are feeling distrustful of existing financial institutions.  That's according to Rick Yang, a partner at New Enterprise Associates, one of the world's oldest venture capital firms. Yang is focused on consumer and fintech companies, and he's noticed some big changes over the past few years: mainly, that more and more consumer finance startups are springing up with millennials in mind.  "There’s a massive shift in consumer behavior and consumer trust," Yang told Business Insider. " I think coming out of [the financial crisis], millennials have a massive distrust of existing financial services. They tend to trust technology more than the recognized stalwart brands, like a J.P. Morgan Chase or a Wells Fargo." While Yang said he hasn't seen any startup "crack" what it means to be a consumer bank quite yet, plenty of companies are already giving it a shot. Startups like and Chime are encouraging millennials to spend and save through a mobile app rather than keep their money in a more traditional bank. And Venmo, which allows users to more easily transfer money, just added an option to  using Venmo, much like Apple Pay.  But services like Chime and Simple are "layered" on top of FDIC-insured, existing banks, which means there needs to be collaboration between big banks and the startups that want to disrupt them. "I think it’s really hard to offer a full suite of banking and I think companies and startups, as well as the existing financial institutions, don’t really understand what the right amount of collaboration is yet," Yang said. "It’s one of those things where at the end of the day, both sides are going to realize that they need each other but both sides are a little wary of each other." And much like the transportation industry, Yang said, more established companies are going to be slow to adopt to the latest trend. While smaller banks and financial institutions are going to be motivated to make changes to attract young, lower-earning customers, it's going to take longer for the giants to come around — and by then, it may be too late.  Go to MSN Home More in Money 7 successful icons who had a brush with bankruptcy InvestorPlace 20 best money tips of all time from Tony Robbins GOBankingRates 7 CEOs heading to the chopping block InvestorPlace The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money Up Next What the richest 1 percent earns in every state Money Talks News AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from Tech Insider Pound's long-term future looks grim Tech Insider American kids are clamoring for this fascinating hatching toy that is sold out everywhere — and prices are skyrocketing Tech Insider 50 movies that critics really hate but normal people love Tech Insider Trump takes credit for a Ford factory staying in the US — but it was never leaving Tech Insider Tech Insider View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

This trend is bound to have big ramifications for the wider markets moving forward. From the Wall Street Journal: Emboldened by central-bank stimulus and a hefty price tag on equities, investor demand for bond funds relative to stocks is the highest on record, according to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.’s analysis of global exchange-traded-fund and U.S. domiciled mutual-fund flows going back to 2007. Investors have poured $202 billion into global bond funds and withdrawn $47 billion from global equity funds this year, putting stocks on track for their first yearly outflow since 2008, according to the bank. The shift shows many investors believe global growth and inflation will remain tepid and central banks will keep monetary policy loose—enough to spur greater gains in bonds, but not quite sufficient to push the stock market past the current highs amid lackluster profits and a range of political risks. Never before in market history have so many investors been so bearish on stocks sitting at all-time highs. In past eras, the desire for bonds would have collapsed, pushing yields higher. Nowadays, with so much central bank intervention, equities, bonds, and precious metals are all rallying in unison, despite big outflows from equity funds. High valuations aren’t helping attract investment. U.S. stocks are soaring even though companies listed on the S&P 500 are on track to post their fifth consecutive quarter of declines. The trailing price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 climbed to 19.5 this week, the highest since 2010. That compares with a 10-year average of about 15.9. “The U.S. equity market is confounding everyone’s expectations by reaching new highs, but it has become quite expensive,” said Christopher Mahon, director of asset allocation research at Baring Asset Management. Bonds are more expensive than ever too, but investors just keep plowing money into them. The iShares Barclays 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) closed at $140.08 per share on Friday, up $1.17 (+0.84%). The TLT has gained 16% year-to-date, more than doubling the performance of the S&P 500 in the same period.

Fitch expects Bahrain’s general government debt to rise to almost 80 percent of gross domestic product this year from 62 percent in 2015 and the budget deficit widening to 15.4 percent of economic output from 14.8 percent last year. The growing deficit pushed the government to tap both the domestic and international markets to fund spending.

Founded largely by veterans fleeing bureaucracy and shrinking paycheques at the large banks, these low-profile small firms are proving popular among companies who value their niche expertise and independent advice as opposed to mega-banks who tend to cross-sell other services like financing. Advisory boutiques have captured 44 per cent or US$1.7 billion (RM6.9 billion) of total completed M&A deals fees in Europe, Thomson Reuters data collected up to August 10 shows. Boutiques based in Europe captured 24.9 per cent, or US$964 million, and other boutiques took the other 19 per cent, or US$728 million. That compares with 42.8 per cent for the whole of 2015, 30.5 per cent at the height of the last M&A boom in 2007 and 20.1 per cent in 2000, when Thomson Reuters began recording the data. The data excludes some of the massive deals of 2015 that have not yet been completed, including Anheuser-Busch InBev’s US$100 billion-plus merger with SABMiller. “We are not trying to sell multiple products. Our sole focus is on high-value-add advisorybusiness, and as such we have no conflicts,” Pieter-Jan Bouten, managing director at Greenhill, one of the early US-based boutiques to set up in Europe, told Reuters. Boutiques are defined as firms earning greater than 85 per cent of their fees from M&A and equity capital markets activity (ECM), with M&A accounting for at least 70 per cent of that wallet. “With the number of boutique firms occupying M&A league tables at its highest since the 1980s, we can expect the attractiveness of independent advisories (for job seekers) only to increase,” said Alex Howard-Keyes, Head of Wholesale Financial Services at Alderbrooke, the executive search firm. Crossing the Atlantic Boutiques have made more progress in stealing business from investment banks in Europe than in the United States, where they accounted for 27.5 per cent or US$2 billion of total completed M&A deals fees so far this year. As a result, more American bankers are crossing the Atlantic to set up shops in Europe and poaching top dealmakers. In July, US boutique bank LionTree, founded by former UBS bankers Aryeh Bourkoff and Ehren Stenzler in 2012, hired Jake Donavan from JPMorgan in London to be president of LionTree Europe to grow its business in the region. In 2015, PJT Partners, an independent financial advisory firm led by Paul J. Taubman, the former senior Morgan Stanley dealmaker in New York, hired a raft of bankers to build out his European arm. Last year former senior Goldman Sachs investment banker Gordon Dyal launched his own boutique Dyal Co, which then emerged as the lead advisor to Switzerland’s Syngenta on its sale to ChemChina. “Looking ahead, Donavan’s move could be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to sell-side switches if we see a further proliferation of M&A boutiques,” Howard-Keyes said. Boutiques range from established firms like Lazard and Rothschild to “micro” outfits such as Zaoui & Co, an advisory firm set up by brothers Michael and Yoel, and Robey Warshaw, set up by Simon Robey and Simon Warshaw, former Morgan Stanley and UBS bankers, both based in London. Bankers who leave for these boutiques stand to earn potentially more money if they make a success of it, free from a cap imposed by the European Union after the financial crisis that stipulates that bank bonuses can no longer exceed 100 per cent of fixed salaries, or twice that with shareholder approval. Robey Warshaw, which worked on the BG Group and Shell merger, has earned US$42 million in fees on completed deals in the year to date, ranking it 15th in the league tables in Europe, above HSBC, Societe Generale and Mediobanca. The figures do not include fees it expects to reap for its work advising SABMiller and most recently having advised Japan’s SoftBank on its acquisition of ARM. “Boutique expansion is a direct consequence of bulge brackets paying less, adding layers of bureaucracy and admin work for senior people,” said one New York-based boutique banker, using a colloquial expression for the top banks. “In a nutshell working for a bulge bracket is no longer fun.” Finance muscle Large banks tout their financing muscle as well as their prowess in areas ranging from currency hedging to treasury management to win big M&A assignments.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 14 August 2016 | MYT 4:13 PM Europe's boutique firms stealing M&A market share, dealmakers Photo illustration of beer flowing from a bottle of Stella Artois into a glass, part of the Anheuser-Busch InBev group, seen against a SABMiller logo, November 5, 2015. REUTERS LONDON: Boutique advisory firms now receive nearly half of all mergers and acquisition fees in Europe, stealing market share and top dealmakers from global investment banks hamstrung by a renewed focus on cost-cutting and regulations on how much they can pay. Founded largely by veterans fleeing bureaucracy and shrinking paychecks at the large banks, these low-profile small firms are proving popular among companies who value their niche expertise and independent advice as opposed to mega-banks who tend to cross-sell other services like financing. Advisory boutiques have captured 44 percent or $1.7 billion of total completed M&A deals fees in Europe, Thomson Reuters data collected up to August 10 shows. Boutiques based in Europe captured 24.9 percent, or $964 million, and other boutiques took the other 19 percent, or $728 million. That compares with 42.8 percent for the whole of 2015, 30.5 percent at the height of the last M&A boom in 2007 and 20.1 percent in 2000, when Thomson Reuters began recording the data. The data excludes some of the massive deals of 2015 that have not yet been completed, including Anheuser-Busch InBev's $100 billion-plus merger with SABMiller. "We are not trying to sell multiple products. Our sole focus is on high-value-add advisory business, and as such we have no conflicts," Pieter-Jan Bouten, managing director at Greenhill, one of the early U.S.-based boutiques to set up in Europe, told Reuters. Boutiques are defined as firms earning greater than 85 percent of their fees from M&A and equity capital markets activity (ECM), with M&A accounting for at least 70 percent of that wallet. "With the number of boutique firms occupying M&A league tables at its highest since the 1980s, we can expect the attractiveness of independent advisories (for job seekers) only to increase," said Alex Howard-Keyes, Head of Wholesale Financial Services at Alderbrooke, the executive search firm. CROSSING THE ATLANTIC Boutiques have made more progress in stealing business from investment banks in Europe than in the United States, where they accounted for 27.5 percent or $2 billion of total completed M&A deals fees so far this year. As a result, more American bankers are crossing the Atlantic to set up shops in Europe and poaching top dealmakers. In July, U.S. boutique bank LionTree, founded by former UBS bankers Aryeh Bourkoff and Ehren Stenzler in 2012, hired Jake Donavan from JPMorgan in London to be president of LionTree Europe to grow its business in the region. In 2015, PJT Partners, an independent financial advisory firm led by Paul J. Taubman, the former senior Morgan Stanley dealmaker in New York, hired a raft of bankers to build out his European arm. Last year former senior Goldman Sachs investment banker Gordon Dyal launched his own boutique Dyal Co, which then emerged as the lead advisor to Switzerland's Syngenta on its sale to ChemChina. "Looking ahead, Donavan's move could be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to sell-side switches if we see a further proliferation of M&A boutiques," Howard-Keyes said. Boutiques range from established firms like Lazard and Rothschild to "micro" outfits such as Zaoui & Co, an advisory firm set up by brothers Michael and Yoel, and Robey Warshaw, set up by Simon Robey and Simon Warshaw, former Morgan Stanley and UBS bankers, both based in London. Bankers who leave for these boutiques stand to earn potentially more money if they make a success of it, free from a cap imposed by the European Union after the financial crisis that stipulates that bank bonuses can no longer exceed 100 percent of fixed salaries, or twice that with shareholder approval. Robey Warshaw, which worked on the BG Group and Shell merger, has earned $42 million in fees on completed deals in the year to date, ranking it fifteenth in the league tables in Europe, above HSBC, Societe Generale and Mediobanca. The figures do not include fees it expects to reap for its work advising SABMiller and most recently having advised Japan's SoftBank on its acquisition of ARM. "Boutique expansion is a direct consequence of bulge brackets paying less, adding layers of bureaucracy and admin work for senior people," said one New York-based boutique banker, using a colloquial expression for the top banks. "In a nutshell working for a bulge bracket is no longer fun." FINANCE MUSCLE Large banks tout their financing muscle as well as their prowess in areas ranging from currency hedging to treasury management to win big M&A assignments. But for many M&A bankers this just means having to fend off other departments and deal with more bureaucracy. "A coverage banker at a bulge-bracket is essentially a glorified salesman," said a second boutique banker. To be sure, some of Wall Street's biggest M&A banks still maintain a dominant share of fees in Europe, with Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley in the top five in terms of fees earned so far this year.

Photographer: Carlos Becerra/Bloomberg Venezuela’s distressed bond lure investors in zero-rate world Yet risks, highlighted by canceled Barclays trip, are high Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Barclays Plc has decided that Venezuela is too dangerous for its bond-investor clients. No, not as in default kind of dangerous. Sure that’s possible but Barclays is more worried right now about things like kidnapping and murder. Last month, the bank canceled a trip to take a group of money managers to Caracas after its security team deemed the trip “unwise” without “significantly enhanced” safety measures, according to an e-mail sent to investors that was obtained by Bloomberg News. The decision highlights an unusual point of tension in this nook of the bond world. At a time when interest rates are near zero or even negative in many countries across the globe, the 23 percent yield offered by Venezuela’s benchmark dollar bonds stands out as a rare opportunity for the bravest of investors to make a big score. Before taking that plunge and buying the debt of a nation mired in crisis, though, investors will typically want to see the place first-hand, talk to government officials and business executives and assess the mood on the ground. In Venezuela, that means walking into a country convulsed by an economic collapse, spontaneous street protests and soaring crime. QuickTake Venezuela on the Brink While JPMorgan Chase & Co. went through with a client trip several weeks ago and Bank of America Corp. plans on going ahead with one scheduled for next month, Barclays told clients including Pharo Management and Blackstone NWI Asset Management that the risk was too great. Scheduled for the week of July 11, the trip was to give them face-time with a top economic aide to President Nicolas Maduro, leaders of the opposition and experts on the country’s oil industry, according to a copy of the itinerary. “The situation in Venezuela is more concerning than was previously considered,” Ellis Thomas, the bank’s head of emerging-market credit sales, and Alejandro Arreaza, the economist for Venezuela, said in the e-mail informing clients that the trip was canceled. Barclays analyzes travel requests on a case-by-case basis and doesn’t rule out green-lighting trips to Caracas again in the future, according to a person familiar with the firm’s policies. Spokesman Marc Hazelton declined to comment. U.S. Warning Home to the world’s third-highest homicide rate, Venezuela has long been one of the globe’s most dangerous places. As the collapse in oil prices deepened the economic crisis and exacerbated food shortages, crime has become widespread. That has in turn fueled vigilante justice: a rash of mob lynchings, predominantly in poorer neighborhoods, has swept across the country this year. While bank-organized treks to Caracas, like the Barclays outing, tend to largely keep travelers in the wealthier, and safer, eastern part of the city, risks still abound. In March, an Egyptian tourist was murdered in an attempted robbery just feet outside the international airport’s doors, the local press reported. And one day before Barclays canceled its trip, the U.S. State Department renewed its travel warning for the South American country, saying crime is even common in “areas generally presumed safe and frequented by tourists.” An added concern is that people perceived to be carrying dollars attract attention in a country where inflation is spiraling out of control, according to Raul Gallegos, a senior analyst at political and security risk consulting firm Control Risks. It labels Caracas a “very high risk” area, just one notch below the rating it gives to places in civil war. “I’ll go to Nigeria, I was in Turkey right before the coup, but Venezuela’s just a little too tense,” said Ray Zucaro, the chief investment officer of emerging-markets hedge fund RVX Asset Management in Miami and the husband of a Venezuelan native. “It’s just a bad spot.” The country’s bonds, though, are so tempting. In recent days alone, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and BlueBay Asset Management both said the debt looks attractive. The benchmark notes due 2027 yield some 18 percentage points more than the emerging-market average, according to JPMorgan indexes. While concern has been building for the past two years that a default was imminent, the government has managed to scrounge together the funds to remain current on its foreign debt and insists it will continue to do so.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Aug 13, 2016 at 10:49AM I've always known that Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) was a heavily traded stock, but it wasn't until today that I compared its trading volume to other big banks. Here's what I found: Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. This confirms what I thought. Yet I was surprised by how much higher Bank of America's trading volume is than the other banks. Its shares change hands at four times the velocity of runner-up Citigroup's (NYSE:C) on a typical day. The comparison to Citigroup is apt because the banks are in similar positions. Both it and Bank of America lost so much money in the crisis eight years ago that they've had to focus on recovering ever since. This decimated shareholder value, and contributes to the fact that their stocks still trade for 40% discounts to book value. The banks are similarly structured, too, offering both commercial and investment-banking products. And they're of approximately the same size: Bank of America has $2.1 trillion in assets on its balance sheet compared to Citigroup's $1.8 trillion. This begs the question: If these two banks are so alike, what explains the fact that Bank of America's trading volume is four times that of Citigroup's? Or for that matter, of Wells Fargo's and JPMorgan Chase's? The answer is much-less exciting than one might imagine. Namely, the reason Bank of America's shares trade at such a high velocity relative to these other banks is because its share price is lower. This makes it affordable for hedge funds and high-frequency traders to buy and sell a large number of Bank of America's shares. Bank Share Price* JPMorgan Chase $65.32 Wells Fargo $47.90 Citigroup $45.58 Bank of America $14.85 *As of Aug. 8, 2016. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. The numbers aren't exact, but the size of the difference between these banks' share prices corresponds roughly over to volume. For instance, Bank of America's shares trade at four times the rate of Citigroup's because the latter's shares are three times the price of the former's. It's worth noting, as well, that Bank of America's shares don't trade at a high volume only in the context of bank stocks; its volume is also high when you look at the broader market. Shares of the North Carolina-based bank trade at a higher average daily volume than any other company on the S&P 500. The runner-up is Chesapeake Energy, shares of which trade hands at half the pace of Bank of America's volume. The point here is that Bank of America is a volatile stock. It offers a lot of potential, but it's not for the faint of heart. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Despite Massive Downgrades, Some Analysts Still See SunPower Shining Bright By Jon C. Ogg August 13, 2016 9:20 am EST Print Email Tweet SunPower Corp. (NASDAQ: SPWR) managed to obliterate its shareholders in the past week. It was supposed to have decent earnings, but the guidance and the commentary about new competition hurting its orders created a drag-down effect for the entire solar industry during the week. When growth investors think of alternative and renewable energy’s growth prospects in the years ahead, they might begin to scratch their heads when they hear that a company has to have layoffs. SunPower shares had fallen 3.4% to $14.78 the day ahead of earnings, but the guidance was so dismal (ditto for layoffs) that the shares were indicated down 30% at $10.30 to a new 52-week low even before the dust settled for the week. The stock hit a new low of $10.05 this week, but SunPower shares ended the week at $10.85. The prior 52-week low before the big drop was $13.29, and its 52-week high is $31.10. 24/7 Wall St. not only wanted to list the numerous downgrades, but also to see which firms were still telling their clients to be buyers on weakness. It turns out that two firms think that this latest drop is a gift. Just make sure to keep in mind that when stocks drop 30% or more in a day that they almost never bounce back handily on their own internal efforts. Some analysts did not release their downgrades immediately after the drop. Morgan Stanley downgraded SunPower to Equal Weight from Overweight on Friday, slashing its price target to $12 from $27. Barclays downgraded SunPower’s rating to Equal Weight from Overweight on Thursday, with its price target slashed to $12 from $23. Other analyst downgrades of SunPower were seen as follows: JPMorgan downgraded it to Neutral from Overweight and cut the target to $17 from $28. Janney downgraded it to Neutral from Buy and the fair value estimate was slashed to $13. Oppenheimer downgraded it to Perform from Outperform, but no price target is offered now. Credit Suisse downgraded it to Neutral and slashed the price target to $12 from $32. Deutsche Bank cut its rating to Hold from Buy and lowered the price target to $11 from $37. Not everyone is advising clients to bail out here. We have two ratings that were seen in basic calls and two which were expanded upon. Robert W. Baird’s team maintained its Outperform rating, but they did get more realistic on their price target, cutting that to $21 from $37. Standard & Poor’s kept its Buy rating, but it is much more conservative now with a 12-month target price to $13 (down from $22). Then there was Raymond James, which also maintained its Outperform rating. That firm’s analyst came on CNBC and said that investors should be more interested in a great company after its shares were battered. Pavel Molchanov, the solar analyst at Raymond James, believes that the market and the host of analyst downgrades are simply wrong to keep battering SunPower’s stock lower. Still, he lowered his target for clients to $20 from $30. Molchanov told CNBC that the United States has a lot of room to grow its solar energy efforts. His appearance said: We don’t have to wait 35 years. Look at Europe—Germany and Italy. Last year [solar] was almost 10 percent of total power generation. In the United States, we are not even at 1 percent… There’s enormous scope for solar growth in the U.S., and enormous technology improvements to be implemented. Europe has driven costs down by investing heavily in solar and the U.S. stands to benefit a great deal. Merrill Lynch’s Krish Sankar also kept a Buy rating, but the firm’s price objective was lowered to $25 from $31 in that call. This is still more than 100% implied upside if correct, and the report said that SunPower is a top pick among solar stocks. That report said: We see SunPower’s continued market share gains in the residential sector as a positive. However, the challenge facing this segment is that more home owners prefer cash sales/loans rather than a 20-year lease from the solar installer, thereby impacting EBITDA and the long-term cash flow stream. Other positives include management’s view of possible margin expansion in the commercial business and reduced operating expenses (~1,200 employee reduction). The company offers the industry’s highest efficiency panel, has exposure to key growth markets globally, and is backed by global energy giant Total. In addition to utility-scale project opportunities, the company’s US-based rooftop leasing business holds long-term value. We see substantial opportunity for the company to leverage high efficiency technology and low-cost Total-backed financing to expand contracted project opportunities around the world. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Again, it would be silly to believe that SunPower is going to snap back immediately on its own. An outside force, or a merger would be able to change that view, but companies that get hit this hard just do not usually get immediately up off the floor. SunPower’s new consensus analyst price target from Thomson Reuters was at $18.67 on Friday. It was more than $31 in July and above $32 in May. By Jon C.
