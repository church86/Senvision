 Machine learning is now used in Wall Street dealmaking, and bankers should probably be worried Matt Turner Apr. 4, 2017, 7:12 PM 5,222 facebook linkedin twitter email print 20th Century Fox/IMDB It has been said that Wall Street dealmaking is more art than science. That could be changing.  JPMorgan, which is spending big on technology as it looks to cut costs and increase efficiency, last year launched a predictive recommendation engine to identify those clients which should issue or sell equity. And now, given the initial success of the engine, it's being rolled out to other areas. Matt Zames, chief operating officer at JPMorgan, ran through the bank's tech strategy in a letter titled "Redefining the Financial Services Industry" in JPMorgan's 328-page letter to shareholders.  Included in the letter alongside talk of robotics, new design standards and a private cloud platform was reference to the Emerging Opportunities Engine. The letter said:  "We also use machine learning to drive predictive recommendations for Investment Banking. Last year, we introduced the Emerging Opportunities Engine, which helps identify clients best positioned for follow-on equity offerings through automated analysis of current financial positions, market conditions and historical data. Given the initial success of the Emerging Opportunities Engine in Equity Capital Markets, we are expanding it to other areas, like Debt Capital Markets, similarly basing predictions on client financial data, issuance history and market activity." JPMorgan isn't the only Wall Street bank applying technology to dealmaking. At an event in January, Goldman Sachs' deputy chief financial officer Marty Chavez said the bank was focused on automating investment banking tasks. He said that the bank has mapped out 146 distinct steps in the initial public offering process, and that many of these are "begging to be automated," according to MIT Technology Review. That represents a change. While trading has already seen heavy automation and the job cuts associated with it, Wall Street dealmaking had traditionally been seen as impervious to such a process. Not any more.  NOW WATCH: Take a look inside the Laguna Beach vacation home Warren Buffett listed for $11 million Loading video...

PHOTO: AFP [NEW YORK] The odds of a breakup of the European Union have increased after Brexit, an outcome that could have "devastating" economic and political effects, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive said on Tuesday. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon, in an annual letter to shareholders, said he had hoped Britain's decision last year to exit the EU would have led the bloc to focus on "fixing its issues," such as immigration and rigid labor rules. "Our fear, however, is that it could instead result in political unrest that would force the EU to split apart," Mr Dimon said. "The unraveling of the EU and the monetary union could have devastating economic and political effects. While we are not predicting this will happen, the probabilities have certainly gone up - and we will keep a close eye on the situation in Europe over the next several years." sentifi.com Market voices on: Regarding Brexit itself, Mr Dimon expressed confidence the bank would be able to meet all its European' clients needs once Britain exits the EU following negotiations expected to take two years. SEE ALSO: A 3M outcome - May, Merkel, Macron - may boost Europe stability The bank doesn't foresee shifting much staff from Britain over the next two years, but "we do suspect that following Brexit, there will be constant pressure by the EU not to 'outsource' services to the United Kingdom but to continue to move people and capabilities into EU subsidiaries," Mr Dimon said. Mr Dimon, who is chair of the Washington lobby group the Business Roundtable and sits on a CEO advisory board to President Donald Trump, also expressed support for international trade in the wake of criticism by Mr Trump and others of major trade agreements. Mr Dimon called Mexico, a leading Trump target, a "long-standing peaceful neighbour" whose interests are intertwined with those of the United States. "Our trade agreement with Mexico helps ensure that the young democracy in Mexico is not hijacked by populist and anti-American leaders (like Chavez in Venezuela)," Mr Dimon said. " "While there are some clear identifiable problems with Nafta, I believe they will be worked out in a way that is fair and beneficial to both sides." Mr Dimon described the challenges with China as "more complex" and include cybersecurity and the protection intellectual property. "However, there is no inevitable or compelling reason that China and America have to clash," Dimon said. Mr Dimon also reiterated stances on a number of other issues, voicing support for less onerous financial regulation and endorsing tax reform to eliminate the incentive for multinationals to move overseas.

In a letter by Matt Zames, the bank’s chief operating officer, JPMorgan Chase detailed some of its strategy in this area. Zames said the bank made automating development life cycles a priority in 2016. For instance, by using automated code scanning, the bank saved nearly 120,000 developer hours during the year. He added that the bank expects to be able to deliver more than 90% of its software through end-to-end automation over the next five years. In other words, much of the software code testing done by humans can be replicated by technology, making the process much quicker. Matt Zames, chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase. Bloomberg News Zames, along with business leaders of JPMorgan’s various business lines, published their individual letters to shareholders on Tuesday afternoon, shortly after CEO Jamie Dimon issued his annual letter. Like others, the firm is also looking to robotics and machine learning to automate basic tasks. The bank is looking to robotic process automation to handle 1.7 million administrative requests in 2017, Zames said. “Machine learning offers another exciting opportunity to drive new capabilities for the firm and our customers and clients,” Zames wrote. “As an example, we recently introduced COiN, a contract intelligence platform that uses unsupervised machine learning to analyze legal documents and to extract important data points and clauses.” In an initial implementation, the company extracted 150 relevant attributes from 12,000 annual commercial credit agreements in seconds. Zames said it would have taken as many as 360,000 hours a year to perform such a task manually. “This capability has far-reaching implications considering that approximately 80% of loan servicing errors today are due to contract interpretation errors,” Zames wrote. In general, cost savings were a common theme of several of the letters from the various leaders of JPM’s business lines. Zames noted that the bank has introduced “innovative [data] storage offerings, decreasing the price of our lowest tier storage by 75%. We are driving additional efficiency by reducing waste and becoming smarter around technology consumption.” Gordon Smith, the CEO of consumer and community banking, said JPMorgan Chase remains “fiercely devoted to expense discipline.” He noted the firm has overseen $2.4 billion in structural expense reductions since 2014 and improved overhead ratio from 58% in 2014 to 55% in 2016. “Importantly, during that same time period, we continued to prudently invest in our core businesses to deliver value for the long term,” Smith added.” In particular, we’ve invested heavily in technology and marketing associated with new product launches, digital and payments innovation, and cybersecurity. Our investments have also improved our control environment, leading to more automated processes, better customer and employee experiences.” Article Your Top CECL Questions Answered How should banks approach CECL implementation and can existing processes be used as a starting point?

 Someone made a $100 million trade with JPMorgan on their cell phone Portia Crowe Apr. 4, 2017, 2:45 PM 17,026 facebook linkedin twitter email print Flickr / Michele Ursino JPMorgan is investing in technology in a big way — and it's paying off. The CEO of the firm's corporate investment bank, Daniel Pinto, stressed the importance of technology in an annual letter to shareholders Tuesday. Specifically, he noted, one client leveraged the firm's technological capabilities to make a $100 million trade — from a mobile phone. "Our profitable Markets business, which generated an overall ROE of 17% last year, enables us to invest in innovation and the client experience," Pinto wrote. "Eighty three percent of notional FX trading is now done electronically. We have seen a $100 million trade done on a mobile phone, and on peak days in 2016, $200 billion in FX was traded through our electronic channels, including our own J.P. Morgan Markets platform, which provides a range of services from research to pre- and post-trade reporting." The firm spends more than $9.5 billion on technology with an increasing percentage of that budget going towards new investments and innovation, according to a letter from COO Matt Zames Tuesday. Pinto said the firm fundamentally believes clients should be able to choose how to trade with JPMorgan. He emphasized that it's the firm's strong technical capabilities that allow clients trade through turbulent times like Brexit and the US presidential election last year. "The electronic evolution is advancing, and the investments we've made, and will continue to make, already are proving their merit to our clients," Pinto wrote.

 JPMorgan is targeting Silicon Valley Frank Chaparro Apr. 4, 2017, 2:19 PM 2,552 facebook linkedin twitter email print Zames is COO of JPMorgan. Syr.edu JPMorgan chief operating officer Matt Zames is setting his sights on Silicon Valley. In a letter titled "Redefining the Financial Services Industry" in JPMorgan's 328-page letter to shareholders, Zames ran through the bank's tech strategy. Zames said attracting tech talent from Silicon Valley and technology firms is an integral component to that strategy. The letter said: "Attracting, retaining and developing top technology talent is paramount, and we cast a net far and wide to find the best and the brightest. In 2016, 32% of our senior hires in technology came from non-financial services firms. We had a 10:1 applicant-to position ratio for our Technology Analyst Program, which targets graduates of global universities that have strong technology programs." The bank spends more than $9.5 billion on technology, according to the letter, with an increasing percentage of that budget going on new investments and innovation.  "Our strategy is a combination of build, buy and partner in order to continue delivering the best digital products and services at scale," Zames said. "Our relationships with the external technology ecosystem helped drive value across our technology focus areas, including next-generation data and analytics platforms, such as Hadoop and Spark." Zames highlighted a number of fields such as machine learning and robotics in which the bank made huge inroads with new initiatives. Here are some of the highlights from the letter (emphasis added): New design standards "We are also defining design standards to provide a common technical framework for development of applications of a particular type, for example, big data analytics. This will significantly reduce rework and duplication in the software development life cycle where, previously, application developers have had to create their own one-off frameworks." A new private cloud "In 2016, we launched a new private cloud platform called Gaia, designed to provide developers with rapid agility – so that they spend more time developing and less time provisioning infrastructure and application services. Over 5,000 developers already have begun to use Gaia. By the end of 2017, we expect to more than double the number of applications hosted on the platform." New global data center strategy "In 2016, we invested in a new global data center strategy to consolidate our existing facilities into fewer, larger, more modular sites. In early 2017, we opened our first new state-of-the-art data center, which is the strategic model for all future builds globally." New Market Risk platform "Last year, we re-engineered our Market Risk platform, one of the largest in-memory risk analytics platforms in the world. The platform now manages over 1 billion risk sensitivities and provides visibility 17 times faster than the prior system while delivering a more granular and holistic view of the firm’s risk exposure." Robotics "We established an internal center of excellence to drive best practices around a growing pipeline of robotic process automation, including systems access administration, for which we expect to automate 1.7 million requests in 2017. We have line of sight into more than $30 million run rate saves from robotic process automation in 2017, a savings that, coupled with other optimization efforts, will continue to increase substantially in the years to come." Machine learning "We are initiating pilots for a broad range of machine learning use cases – from detecting anomalies for fraud and cybersecurity, to generating targeted trading strategies to share with clients, to optimizing our client servicing channels. We are only at the very beginning of tapping the potential capabilities of machine learning and its benefits to our business."

Financial News Investment Banking Jamie Dimon’s shareholder letter: The key takeaways After the year that gave the world Brexit and Trump, JP Morgan's CEO was never going to be short of things to write about Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase Getty Images By Fareed Sahloul, Samuel Agini and Mark Cobley April 4, 2017 Updated: April 5, 2017 7:56 a.m. GMT After the year that gave the world Brexit and Trump, Jamie Dimon was never going to be short of material for his 2017 letter to shareholders. JP Morgan's chairman and chief executive published his annual missive today, addressing the issues, of which there were plenty, that have affected his bank and the wider financial sector and global economy during the past 12 months. Here are some of the key takeaways: On the business... Dimon was chipper about JP Morgan’s prospects, as well be might be, reporting record profits for the year of almost $25 billion on revenues of $99.1 billion. He promised a bank that’s on the front foot, in a world where it feels like big banks have only just stopped retreating. Dimon talked of “selectively adding investment bankers and private bankers around the world”. He promised to open more branches in the US and expand wholesale businesses abroad. His bank will “carefully” expand into new countries, too. On 'too big to fail'... Essentially, Dimon said, the problem of 'too big to fail' in banking had been solved. He wrote that investors - both in equity and debt - are on the hook rather than taxpayers in the event of a major bank collapse. If the capital provided by the bank's investors does not suffice, Dimon said the industry itself was legally liable for "excess losses". Dimon wrote that a repeat of the Lehman Brothers collapse would be "highly unlikely" because post-crisis rules would have forced the bank to maintain higher levels of equity capital. The JP Morgan boss added that regulators now have the ability to put failed banks into receivership, something that could not be done in 2007-08. On US politics... In a striking move for a bank CEO, in section three on "public policy", Dimon set out something approaching a political manifesto. Portraying the US as a "truly exceptional" country with "the widest, deepest, most transparent financial markets in the world", he then set the problems that are "holding us back". These include slower economic growth in the 21st century than the 20th; a shrinking middle class, and falls in real incomes and productivity, especially for lower earners. Dimon went on to decry "trillions of dollars" of spending on foreign wars by the US government instead of "investing that money productively". He critiqued the US government's 2010 takeover of student lending, which had "dramatically increased student defaults and a population that is rightfully angry about how much money they owe, particularly since it reduces their ability to get other credit". Dimon did not mention Trump by name in the report but as the president and his administration dust off the disappointment of the failed healthcare reforms and prepare to tackle tax, the JP Morgan chief had a warning: America's "corporate tax system is driving capital and brains overseas". He also backed the idea of increased infrastructure spending. He concluded: "Our problems are significant, and they are not the singular purview of either political party. We need coherent, consistent, comprehensive and coordinated policies that help fix these problems." On Brexit... Dimon also addressed the biggest geopolitical risks to the banking industry, which included a warning on the potential fallout from the UK's vote to leave the European Union. The bad news: he seems to have become gloomier on the issue. He wrote: "We hope that the advent of Brexit would lead the EU to focus on fixing its issues – immigration, bureaucracy, the ongoing loss of sovereign rights and labor inflexibility – and thereby pulling the EU and the monetary union closer together. Our fear, however, is that it could instead result in political unrest that would force the EU to split apart." In a January interview with FN, Dimon said he wished his bank could keep all of its European operations in London. But The Wall Street Journal reported last week that JP Morgan was scouring Europe for potential post-Brexit bases. On technology spending... JP Morgan's technology bill was almost $10 billion last year. Dimon said the bank spent a punchy $9.5 billion on tech in 2016, almost a third of which went on new initiatives. "One of the reasons we’re performing well as a company is we never stopped investing in technology – this should never change," he wrote. JP Morgan is developing products across mobile banking, digital investment advice and electronic trading, on top of its work collaborating with fintech firms in areas such as small business lending and mortgages, according to Dimon's letter. On financial regulation... Dimon said it would be an "understatement" to say that improvements could be made to regulation, though he backed away from throwing out the entirety of the Dodd-Frank Act. "It is, however, appropriate to open up the rulebook in the light of day and rework the rules and regulations that don’t work well or are unnecessary," he wrote.

Here are some key passages from his 45-page letter, which value investor Warren Buffett has said is among his favorites for gleaning business wisdom. Brexit Dimon said he’s concerned the U.K.’s departure from the European Union might trigger political unrest throughout the region that could split the currency union, resulting in “devastating economic and political effects.” The potential for a U.K. “hard exit” wouldn’t require moving many people in the next two years, although some staff and technology transfers will be needed and JPMorgan will have to secure various regulatory approvals to shift operations, Dimon said. Before last year’s Brexit referendum, Dimon told U.K. staff that as many as 4,000 people could be relocated if the measure passed. After the British exit, the EU probably will pressure banks not to outsource services to the U.K., Dimon wrote. JPMorgan is in talks to buy a Dublin office building as it considers an expansion into the Irish capital, people with knowledge of the matter said last week. The building in development would have space for more than 1,000 workers. Regulations On banking regulation, to which Dimon devoted more than a third of his letter, he pushed back on a key argument underpinning the deregulation hopes of Republican lawmakers and Gary Cohn -- the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. president who now heads President Donald Trump’s National Economic Council. In opposition to Cohn and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, Dimon asserted that the Dodd-Frank Act effectively ended the possibility of government bailouts for "too big to fail" banks. Even as he endorsed a number of regulations put in place after the crisis, Dimon was especially critical of capital demands on banks, saying the rules have thwarted lending. He said if the government eased several capital and liquidity requirements to instead match lesser international standards, it could permit an additional $190 billion of loans. Dimon also called for modifying the Financial Stability Oversight Council -- the panel of regulators created by the Dodd-Frank Act that has authority to impose oversight on non-bank financial companies. Overhauling FSOC has become a common talking point among Republicans and is something the Treasury Department is looking at as part of a broader review of rules. Technology JPMorgan is among U.S. banks touting billions of dollars in investments in technology upgrades as they seek to improve profitability and stay ahead of startups. Dimon said JPMorgan spent more than $9.5 billion on technology in 2016, including $3 billion on new initiatives. About $600 million of the bank’s technology spending was for what Dimon called emerging "fintech" solutions, which include digital and mobile services and partnering with other companies. Taxes Most other developed nations have cut their corporate tax rates in the past decade, leaving the U.S. with the highest levels and causing “considerable damage,” Dimon said. “Our corporate tax system is driving capital and brains overseas,” he wrote, adding that American corporations are now better off investing capital outside the U.S., where they can earn higher returns. Lowering taxes would improve wages, he argued, citing a 2007 Treasury Department review. U.S. Economy “It is clear that something is wrong — and it’s holding us back,” Dimon said. He cited the labor-force participation rate, education and infrastructure spending, though he said he “strongly disagrees” with the idea that slower growth and lower productivity are a permanent fixture. Dimon said he has confidence underlying growth in the U.S. economy will propel JPMorgan’s consumer businesses. Dimon said in February that the U.S. would have a bright economic future if the president carries out plans to overhaul taxes, rein in regulation and boost infrastructure investment. In an interview last month, he credited Trump with boosting consumer and business confidence in growth, and reawakening “animal spirits.” Diversity Women account for half of JPMorgan’s global workforce of more than 243,000, as well as 30 percent of Dimon’s direct reports and the company’s senior leadership worldwide, according to the CEO. “In addition to gender diversity, 48 percent of our firm’s population is ethnically diverse in the United States, and we are in more than 60 countries around the world,” Dimon wrote. “Diversity means running a company where people are respected, trusted and given equal opportunity to contribute and raise their ideas and voices.” JPMorgan, however, hasn’t met self-prescribed standards when it comes to increasing the ranks of African-Americans and introduced an initiative “dedicated to helping us better attract and recruit external black talent while retaining and developing the talent within the company,” he wrote. Mortgages Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up Various proposals for reforming the mortgage market could add more than $300 billion a year in new purchased loans, Dimon wrote. Costs to consumers could be 20 basis points lower and mortgage underwriters would be willing to take more risks on first-time, young and lower-income buyers. Had problems in the mortgage market been addressed five years ago, more than $1 trillion in additional mortgage loans could have been made, according to a JPMorgan analysis. Among Dimon’s suggestions are new standards to reduce complexity and aid securitization. Private capital is needed to make the market less reliant on taxpayers, he said. “Seven major federal regulators and a long list of state and local regulators have overlapping jurisdiction on mortgage laws and wrote a plethora of new rules and regulations appropriately focused on educating and protecting customers,” Dimon said. Annual Report Separately, JPMorgan said Tuesday in its annual report that it expects $49 billion of net interest income this year, up from about $46 billion in 2016, assuming additional loan growth and no changes in interest rates. Average core loan growth will be about 10 percent, and loan write-offs will remain close to historically low levels, according to the forecast. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

 DIMON: 'We are creating generations of citizens who will never have a chance' Matt Turner Apr. 4, 2017, 12:52 PM 12,074 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty/Win McNamee JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is worried about labor-force participation. Dimon just published his annual shareholder letter, setting out his thoughts on JPMorgan's strategy as well as on broader issues of regulation and public policy. Included in the 46-page report was a section on labor-force participation and education. Dimon said he was concerned about the labor-force participation rate, particularly for men in their prime working years, ages 25 to 54. He highlighted the role of education in this problem, saying "many high schools and vocational schools do not provide the education our students need." His comments can be summarized as follows: The labor participation rate for men ages 25 to 54 has gone from 96% in 1968 to a little over 88% today. "This is way below labor force participation in almost every other developed nation," Dimon said. "If the work participation rate for this group went back to just 93% — the current average for the other developed nations — approximately 10 million more people would be working in the United States." "Fifty-seven percent of these non-working males are on disability, and fully 71% of today's youth (ages 17–24) are ineligible for the military due to a lack of proper education (basic reading or writing skills) or health issues (often obesity or diabetes)." "We should be ringing the national alarm bell that inner city schools are failing our children — often minorities and children from lower income households. In many inner city schools, fewer than 60% of students graduate, and many of those who do graduate are not prepared for employment." Here are the full extracts on labor force participation and education: "Labor force participation in the United States has gone from 66% to 63% between 2008 and today. Some of the reasons for this decline are understandable and aren't too worrisome — for example, an aging population. But if you examine the data more closely and focus just on labor force participation for one key segment; i.e., men ages 25-54, you'll see that we have a serious problem. The chart below shows that in America, the participation rate for that cohort has gone from 96% in 1968 to a little over 88% today. This is way below labor force participation in almost every other developed nation. "If the work participation rate for this group went back to just 93% — the current average for the other developed nations — approximately 10 million more people would be working in the United States. Some other highly disturbing facts include: Fifty-seven percent of these non-working males are on disability, and fully 71% of today's youth (ages 17–24) are ineligible for the military due to a lack of proper education (basic reading or writing skills) or health issues (often obesity or diabetes)." And: "Many high schools and vocational schools do not provide the education our students need — the goal should be to graduate and get a decent job. We should be ringing the national alarm bell that inner city schools are failing our children — often minorities and children from lower income households. In many inner city schools, fewer than 60% of students graduate, and many of those who do graduate are not prepared for employment. We are creating generations of citizens who will never have a chance in this land of dreams and opportunity. Unfortunately, it's self-perpetuating, and we all pay the price. The subpar academic outcomes of America's minority and low-income children resulted in yearly GDP losses of trillions of dollars, according to McKinsey & Company."

 DIMON: 'The United States of America is truly an exceptional country,' but 'something is wrong' Matt Turner Apr. 4, 2017, 12:37 PM 21,175 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty/Win McNamee JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is out with his annual letter to shareholders. The 46-page letter sets out Dimon's thoughts on a wide range of issues, including JPMorgan's performance and the prospect of changes to regulation. In a section on public policy, Dimon said that the US was "probably stronger than ever before" but that it was "clear that something is wrong." "Many economists believe we are now permanently relegated to slower growth and lower productivity (they say that secular stagnation is the new normal), but I strongly disagree," Dimon said. Dimon then detailed six problems he believes are holding America back but often don't show up in economic models. "Making this list was an upsetting exercise, especially since many of our problems have been self-inflicted," he said. "That said, it was also a good reminder of how much of this is in our control and how critical it is that we focus on all the levers that could be pulled to help the U.S. economy." Here's the six problem areas he identified (emphasis added): "Over the last 16 years, we have spent trillions of dollars on wars when we could have been investing that money productively. (I'm not saying that money didn't need to be spent; but every dollar spent on battle is a dollar that can't be put to use elsewhere.) "Since 2010, when the government took over student lending, direct government lending to students has gone from approximately $200 billion to more than $900 billion — creating dramatically increased student defaults and a population that is rightfully angry about how much money they owe, particularly since it reduces their ability to get other credit. "Our nation's healthcare costs are essentially twice as much per person vs. most other developed nations. "It is alarming that approximately 40% (this is an astounding 300,000 students each year) of those who receive advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering and math at American universities are foreign nationals with no legal way of staying here even when many would choose to do so. We are forcing great talent overseas by not allowing these young people to build their dreams here. "Felony convictions for even minor offenses have led, in part, to 20 million American citizens having a criminal record — and this means they often have a hard time getting a job. (There are six times more felons in the United States than in Canada.) "The inability to reform mortgage markets has dramatically reduced mortgage availability. We estimate that mortgages alone would have been more than $1 trillion higher had we had healthier mortgage markets. Greater mortgage access would have led to more homebuilding and additional jobs and investments, which also would have driven additional growth."

 DIMON: You can thank Trump for our stock price performance Bob Bryan Apr. 4, 2017, 12:21 PM 1,495 facebook linkedin twitter email print US President Donald Trump shakes hands with JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie DimonKevin Lamarque/Reuters JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon released his annual letter to shareholders on Tuesday, and seemed to give some of the credit for his bank's soaring stock price to the possibility of regulatory and policy shifts under President Donald Trump. Dimon said that recent changes in attitudes from government towards business and regulation have helped boost JPMorgan's stock. Trump has repeatedly said that he wants to roll back regulations. Recently, he signed an executive order asking the Treasury department to take a look at the Dodd-Frank banking regulations that were passed following the financial crisis. Additionally, a number of surveys from consumers to CEOs to investors have indicated that expectations for a more "business friendly environment" under the new administration have soared. From Dimon's letter (emphasis added): "Whether looking back over five years, 10 years or since the Bank One/JPMorgan Chase merger (approximately 12 years ago), our stock has significantly outperformed the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 and the S&P Financials Index. And this is during a time of unprecedented challenges for banks — both the Great Recession and the extraordinarily difficult legal, regulatory and political environments that followed. We have long contended that these factors explained why bank stock price/earnings ratios were appropriately depressed. And we believe the anticipated reversal of many negatives and the expectation of a more business-friendly environment, coupled with our sustained, strong business results, are among the reasons our stock price has done so well this past year." Trump told a town hall meeting with various CEOs on Tuesday that he wants to give a "major haircut to Dodd-Frank." Since the election, JPMorgan has seen its stock price jump 25%, and the financial sector has been one of the best performing industries following Trump's win.

With inflation a real concern going forward, and the market expecting at least two more interest rate hikes, it makes sense to own stocks that should do well under those conditions. One sector that should perform well is the broader communications arena, that includes the tower companies, cable, satellite and the telecoms. The analysts at J.P. Morgan ranked their coverage universe for April, and we focused on the five of the top ranked stocks, some of which pay solid dividends. All are rated Overweight. SBA Communications This is the top play for this month at JPMorgan. SBA Communications (NASDAQ: SBAC) is the third largest U.S. wireless tower company, with approximately 25,000 towers spread across the United States, Canada and Latin America. The core business for SBA is leasing antenna space on its towers to various wireless service providers on a long-term basis. The company also manages rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements, and it has a large site development and construction division. JPMorgan sees the stock as cheap relative to its peers, and it doesn’t feel that increased AT&T spending for 2018 is factored in to current estimates. The JPMorgan price target for the stock is $130, and the Wall Street consensus target is $130.47. The stock closed Monday at $119.55 a share. CenturyLink This is the largest of the rural local exchange carriers and is expected to continue get a large dose of government money to provide continuing internet service in rural areas. CenturyLink Inc. (NYSE: CTL) is a global communications, hosting, cloud and IT services company enabling millions of customers to transform their businesses through innovative technology solutions. CenturyLink offers network and data systems management, Big Data analytics and IT consulting, and it operates more than 55 data centers in North America, Europe and Asia. The company provides broadband, voice, video, data and managed services over a robust 250,000-route-mile U.S. fiber network and a 300,000-route-mile international transport network. The company announced last year plans to sell its data centers and colocation business to a consortium led by BC Partners for $2.3 billion, which it will use in part to fund its planned tie-up with Level 3 Communications. JPMorgan feels the dividend is safe, and the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. CenturyLink investors receive a gigantic 9.15 % dividend. JPMorgan has a $38 price target, while the consensus price objective is at $27.15. The shares closed trading on Monday at $23.60.

Successful commercialization will significantly boost Clovis’ top line, going forward. Rubraca is also under review in the EU for a comparable ovarian cancer indication. Several studies on Rubraca, targeting different types of ovarian cancer patients, are currently underway. Meanwhile, Clovis is looking to expand Rubraca’s label into additional indication like prostrate, breast and pancreatic cancers, among others. Also, shares of Clovis outperformed the industry in the past one year. Estimates have been stable ahead of Q4 results. However, Clovis’ dependence on Rubraca alone for growth is a cause for concern.” 2/7/2017 – Clovis Oncology was upgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “buy” rating.

Economy 13:30, 04 April 2017 telegraf.com.ua Ukrainian GDP warrants – securities used by the former Soviet republic to clinch a sovereign debt restructuring in 2015 – surged by the most since they were issued last week after JPMorgan published a note arguing that they trade at a third of their true value. The 25-page report concluded that payouts on the securities, while difficult to determine, are likely to far exceed current pricing, Bloomberg reported. The debt had slipped off investors' radars because the warrants aren't included in major emerging-market bond benchmarks and don't offer any payout until at least 2021, and then only if Ukraine's gross-domestic product climbs by about 35 percent to $125.4 billion. The JPMorgan note put the spotlight back on the securities at a time when traders are hungry for high-yielding debt amid record-low interest rates in most of the developed world. "The warrants were grinding lower and then suddenly this note came out and people rediscovered them," said Viktor Szabo, a bond-fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, who holds the warrants along with an overweight position in Ukraine's sovereign dollar bonds. "Our valuation wouldn't go so far as JPMorgan's, but even if you halve it, it still offers value compared to the current level." Read alsoUkraine to continue defending its case in "Yanukovych debt" litigation with Russia – Finance MinistryThe notes were included in Ukraine's $15 billion debt agreement as an incentive to persuade creditors, including Franklin Templeton, to take a 20 percent principal write-down and accept a delay in repayment. Investors who hold the notes can receive a payout twice a year until 2040, with the amount determined by the pace of gross domestic product growth in the country. The International Monetary Fund estimates the nation's GDP will rise enough to breach the pay-out level in 2021. The JPMorgan analysts, who estimated the fair value for the securities at 79.5 cents on the dollar, admitted that the armed conflict with pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine's east poses a major risk if fighting escalates and the country loses territory and production facilities. The central bank cut its 2017 economic growth forecast last month to 1.9 percent from 2.8 percent after the country imposed a trade blockade on its eastern separatist regions. The blockade delayed a $1 billion loan from the IMF, which was approved on Monday. The warrants surged 5.71 cents to 36.76 cents on the dollar last week after the note was published on March 24. They were little changed on Tuesday at 36.74 cents, near the highest since February 2016. "We think the current discount in the price versus our estimates of fair value is sufficient to compensate for these risks and will start correcting over time as market participants look more at the payment triggers," JPMorgan analysts including Nicolaie Alexandru Chidesciuc wrote. "Prices will eventually correct higher."

Laura J. Keller JPMorgan Chase chief executive officer Jamie Dimon. Photo: Bloomberg New York: JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief executive officer Jamie Dimon has two big pronouncements as the Trump administration starts reshaping the government: “The United States of America is truly an exceptional country,” and “it is clear that something is wrong.” Dimon, leader of world’s most valuable bank and a counsellor to the new president, used his 45-page annual letter to shareholders on Tuesday to list ways America is stronger than ever—before jumping into a much longer list of self-inflicted problems that he said was “upsetting” to write. Here’s the start: Since the turn of the century, the US has dumped trillions of dollars into wars, piled huge debt onto students, forced legions of foreigners to leave after getting advanced degrees, driven millions of Americans out of the workplace with felonies for sometimes minor offences and hobbled the housing market with hastily crafted layers of rules. Dimon, who sits on Donald Trump’s business forum aimed at boosting job growth, is renowned for his optimism and has been voicing support this year for parts of the president’s business agenda. In February, Dimon predicted the US would have a bright economic future if the new administration carries out plans to overhaul taxes, rein in rules and boost infrastructure investment. In an interview last month, he credited Trump with boosting consumer and business confidence in growth, and reawakening “animal spirits.” Understands anger But on Tuesday, reasons for concern kept coming. Labour market participation is low, Dimon wrote. Inner-city schools are failing poor kids. High schools and vocational schools aren’t providing skills to get decent jobs. Infrastructure planning and spending is so anaemic that the US hasn’t built a major airport in more than 20 years. Corporate taxes are so onerous it’s driving capital and brains overseas. Regulation is excessive. “It is understandable why so many are angry at the leaders of America’s institutions, including businesses, schools and governments,” Dimon, 61, summarized. “This can understandably lead to disenchantment with trade, globalization and even our free enterprise system, which for so many people seems not to have worked.” Dimon’s name repeatedly came up last year as a potential Treasury Secretary after Trump rode a wave of populism to win the November election. The job ultimately went to Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner who had served as the campaign’s national finance chairman. While Dimon’s letter marked a shift in his typical tone, he said he remains optimistic about JPMorgan’s ability to expand and profit. And the bank’s leaders have confidence in the underlying growth of the US and global economies, he said. ‘Secret sauce’ Still, the US is paying the price for bad decisions, and “something has gone awry in the public’s understanding of business and free enterprise,” he said. “We need trust and confidence in our institutions,” he concluded. “Confidence is the ‘secret sauce’ that, without spending any money, helps the economy grow.” Bloomberg Laura J.

In his annual letter to shareholders — one that was more focused on public policy than his bank — Dimon seemed to reach all the way to Washington in an attempt to effect change in a very pro-business administration. Dimon, 61, said easing off on some regulation would spur lending. Over 45 pages, Dimon said the banking sector could survive more sensible regulation because it is “safer and stronger today” — because of many of the provisions in the Dodd-Frank financial laws, including higher capital requirements. “We are not looking to throw out the entirety of Dodd-Frank or other rules,” he wrote, adding that he wants to “open up the rulebook in the light of day” to scrap some rules. Dimon said that while US was still the greatest country in the world, there is “something wrong” within its borders. “Our problems are significant, and they are not the singular purview of either political party,” the executive wrote. “We need coherent, consistent, comprehensive and coordinated policies that help fix these problems.” The solutions, he said, are not about Democrats or Republicans, but about facts, analysis, ideas and best practices.

(Reuters/Larry Downing) Share Written by Jason Karaian April 04, 2017 JPMorgan is an exceptional bank. Extraordinary, even. That’s according to chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, who published his annual letter to shareholders (pdf) today. As the boss of the largest bank in the US by assets, Dimon’s words are closely followed, not least in this letter, which he uses every year to muse on banking, business, and public policy. (This year’s letter runs to 45 pages.) Per usual, Dimon thinks regulations are too strict. That said, “a more business-friendly environment” is on the way soon (cough, Trump, cough), which is partly why the bank’s share price has soared over the past year, he writes. Another major theme of the letter, it may surprise you, is how great JPMorgan is. “Ours is an exceptional company with an extraordinary heritage and a promising future,” the CEO writes at the outset. “Exceptional” and “extraordinary” are two superlatives that Dimon has been using more lately, about a wide range of things. For market watchers looking for an edge, a meta-analysis of the effusiveness of Dimon’s praise may serve as a useful indicator.

Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Apr 4, 2017 at 6:55PM Credit card companies give away billions of dollars in cash back and travel rewards to new customers every year. Many banks are even willing to lose money on new sign-ups for the first year of their relationship with customers in order to establish a good long-term credit card holder. Smart consumers can take advantage by signing up for new credit cards with lucrative bonuses, then ensuring they never pay unnecessary fees like late fees or interest. With that in mind, here are a few of what we think are the best sign-up bonuses for April. Image source: Getty Images. Barclaycard Arrival Plus World Elite MasterCard The Barclaycard Arrival Plus is currently offering 50,000 bonus miles to new customers that spend $3,000 within the first 90 days following approval. That's an increase from the standard offer of 40,000 miles. The annual fee of $89 is waived the first year as well. Each mile can be redeemed for $0.01 in travel, making the bonus worth $500. (Cardholders can also opt to receive cash back, but at only half the rate of travel redemptions.) The card also offers 2 miles per dollar spent on regular purchases, so cardholders get 2% back in travel spending. Additionally, customers receive 5% back on each miles redemption, so when they redeem those 50,000 bonus miles, they get 2,500 miles (worth $25) back for a future purchase. New cardholders also have the option of transferring balances on other credit cards to the Barclaycard Arrival Plus and paying 0% interest for the first 12 months. The standard balance transfer fee of $5 or 3% (whichever is greater) applies. Note, balance transfers do not count toward the $3,000 spending requirement. If you love to travel, the 50,000 mile sign-up bonus on the Barclaycard Arrival Plus may be for you. (Read our full review to learn more.) Chase Sapphire Preferred If you can spend $1,000 more in three months, you might be interested in the Chase Sapphire Preferred. Chase currently offers new applicants 50,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 in the first three months following approval. The annual fee of $95 is waived the first year. Cardholders will also receive an additional 5,000 bonus points after adding an authorized user in the first three months for a total of 55,000 points. Cardholders also earn 2 points per dollar spent on restaurants and travel, which is effectively 2.5% back for travel. All other purchases earn 1 point per dollar. Points can be redeemed for $0.0125 through Chase's travel portal, making the bonuses worth a combined $687.50 in travel spend. Points can also be redeemed as a statement credit for $0.01 per point. Another lucrative way to use points is to transfer points to Chase's various travel partners like Southwest Airlines or Hyatt Hotels, some of which can offer much higher redemption values than $0.0125 per point. If you spend a little bit more (or have a big expense coming up) and love to travel, the Chase Sapphire Preferred may be for you. (Read our full review to learn more.) Chase Freedom Unlimited If you're not interested in paying another annual fee, the Chase Freedom Unlimited offers a compelling sign-up bonus. New cardholders will receive a bonus of $150 after spending just $500 in the first three months following approval. Actually, it's 15,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points, which can be redeemed for a $150 statement credit. The Chase Freedom Unlimited also earns 1.5 points per dollar on everyday spending. What makes the Chase Freedom Unlimited even better is that cardholders can combine the points they earn from the card with points earned on other Chase Ultimate Rewards cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve. The latter offers $0.015 per point for travel redemptions, which means Chase Freedom Unlimited Cardholders could earn as much as 2.25% back in travel spend for everyday purchases by combining two Chase credit cards. That's better than any other credit card we've reviewed. New cardholders also benefit from a 15-month 0% APR introductory interest rate for new purchases and balance transfers. The standard balance transfer fee of $5 or 3% (whichever is greater) applies. Note, balance transfers do not count toward the $500 spending requirement. If you already have one of the high-end Chase Ultimate Rewards credit cards, or you're looking for a big cash sign-up bonus, the Chase Freedom Unlimited may be for you. (Read our full review to learn more.) BankAmericard Cash Rewards If you're strictly interested in a cash-back card, the BankAmericard Cash Rewards offers new cardholders $100 after spending $500 in the first 90 days. Additionally, there's no annual fee. The real value of the BankAmericard Cash Rewards credit card is its bonus spending categories. Cardholders earn 3% cash back at gas stations and 2% back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs (up to $2,500 bonus spending per quarter). All other purchase earn 1% back. But Bank of America banking customers could earn up to a 75% bonus on cash-back rewards through its Preferred Rewards program. That means cardholders can effectively earn 5.25% back on gas purchases, higher than any other card we've reviewed. It also boosts the cash back on regular spending to 1.75%, making it a very good card for people interested in holding just one credit card. The BankAmericard Cash Rewards also offers 0% interest on balance transfers for 12 months if cardholders make the transfer within 60 days of approval. The standard balance transfer fee of $5 or 3% (whichever is greater) applies. Note, balance transfers do not count toward the $500 spending requirement. If you qualify for the upper tiers of Bank of America's Preferred Rewards program and you're interested in getting more cash back on your everyday purchases, the BankAmericard Cash Rewards may be good for you.

The 10-year yield rose about four basis points to 2.36 percent at 4:10 p.m. in New York, after touching 2.31 percent, Bloomberg Bond Trader data show. The yield spread between five- and 30-year Treasuries widened to about 111 basis points. Research from primary dealers shows views are split about the future shape of the yield curve given the prospect of further rate hikes -- a phenomenon that usually leads to flattening -- while the Trump administration pledges fiscal stimulus that could prompt steepening. The number of short positions increased among clients surveyed by JPMorgan Chase & Co.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon testifies at a Senate Banking Committee about losses on Wednesday, June 13, 2012. While Dimon wouldn't defend the trades, he repeatedly called the $2 billion loss "purely management's mistakes," refusing to yield any... By Matt Egan NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Jamie Dimon admitted he received "a lot of complaints" after agreeing to join President Trump's CEO advisory council. But the JPMorgan CEO made it sound like a no-brainer, explaining he just wants America to do well. "When you get on the airplane, you better be rooting for the success of the pilot," Dimon told Yahoo Finance during a town hall event on Tuesday. "I am a patriot. I will do what I can to help the United States of America; that includes helping whoever is president," he said. Dimon, a former backer of President Obama and other Democrats, emphasized that his decision to join Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum shouldn't be confused as a wholesale endorsement of Trump. Asked if he agrees with everything Trump proposes, Dimon said "absolutely not." "Mr. Trump doesn't even agree with everything he said himself," Dimon joked. And Dimon himself doesn't seem to agree with Trump's harsh rhetoric on Dodd-Frank, the 2010 Wall Street reform law. Trump on Tuesday promised to "do a very major haircut on Dodd-Frank" and referred to it as an example of "horrendous" regulation that his administration is "absolutely destroying." But Dimon's closely-watched annual shareholder letter took a more moderate tone. Yes, Dimon said that "poorly conceived and uncoordinated regulations" have hurt the U.S. economy. But the JPMorgan chief said "we're not looking to throw out the entirety of Dodd-Frank or other rules." In the letter released Tuesday, Dimon even argued that thanks to regulation, the odds of another cataclysmic bank collapse like Lehman Brothers have been drastically reduced. "There's so much more capital in the system that the chance of failure is really small," Dimon said, adding that "we should congratulate the regulators" for stabilizing the system after 2008. By contrast, Trump seemed to blame the regulators. He said the regulators, not the CEOs, are the ones "running the banks" these days. Bank CEOs are "petrified of the regulators. They're petrified," Trump said. Dimon is just the latest big CEO to defend his ties to Trump. Elon Musk took to Twitter in February to explain why he agreed to stay on Trump's advisory panel despite the uproar in Silicon Valley over his immigration policies. "I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council & keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong," Musk tweeted. On the other hand, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick stepped down from the advisory council, saying he didn't want his position to be "misinterpreted" as an endorsement of Trump's agenda. Dimon is using his influential role to call out specific problems that Washington needs to fix, including corporate taxes, immigration and education. The JPMorgan CEO seemed particularly exasperated about crumbling roads, bridges and other forms of infrastructure Trump has pledged to rebuild. "People may die. It's amazing to me we haven't fixed this problem," Dimon said. Dimon said he believes Trump is "on the right track" and said he's "very comforted" by the president's team of capable advisers like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis. "I'm optimistic because America has this amazingly resilient political system," Dimon said. "It's been through far worse than today." TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

REUTERS/Larry Downing/File Photo    JP Morgan Client Makes $100 Million Trade On Cell Phone Robert Donachie Finance and Health Care Reporter 5:03 PM 04/04/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5573360 JP Morgan is investing billions into its technology, and it appears to be paying off. JP Morgan’s corporate investment banking division CEO Daniel Pinto announced Tuesday that one of the bank’s clients used their cell phone to make a $100 million trade. The bank spends over $9.5 billion on technology alone and is always looking to allocate more funds towards new investment opportunities and innovative ideas. Pinto’s announcement Tuesday may be proof the investments were worth the risk. “We have seen a $100 million trade done on a mobile phone, and on peak days in 2016, $200 billion in FX was traded through our electronic channels, including our own J.P. Morgan Markets platform, which provides a range of services from research to pre- and post-trade reporting,” Pinto wrote Tuesday in an annual letter to shareholders. “The electronic evolution is advancing, and the investments we’ve made, and will continue to make, already are proving their merit to our clients.” JP Morgan’s chief operating officer Matt Zames said the bank is looking to further its goal by attracting talent from Silicon Valley. “Attracting, retaining and developing top technology talent is paramount,” Zames wrote. “Our relationships with the external technology ecosystem helped drive value across our technology focus areas, including next-generation data and analytics platforms.” The bank is performing well even without all the new technology. JP Morgan retained its title as the leading investment bank in the world in 2016. The bank’s revenues from trading, investment banking-related activity and mergers and acquisitions was $25.2 billion in 2016, up 11 percent from the previous year.

But the JPMorgan CEO made it sound like a no-brainer, explaining he just wants America to do well. “When you get on the airplane, you better be rooting for the success of the pilot,” Dimon told Yahoo Finance during a town hall event on Tuesday. “I am a patriot. I will do what I can to help the United States of America; that includes helping whoever is president,” he said. Dimon, a former backer of President Obama and other Democrats, emphasized that his decision to join Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum shouldn’t be confused as a wholesale endorsement of Trump. Asked if he agrees with everything Trump proposes, Dimon said “absolutely not.” “Mr. Trump doesn’t even agree with everything he said himself,” Dimon joked. And Dimon himself doesn’t seem to agree with Trump’s harsh rhetoric on Dodd-Frank, the 2010 Wall Street reform law. Trump on Tuesday promised to “do a very major haircut on Dodd-Frank” and referred to it as an example of “horrendous” regulation that his administration is “absolutely destroying.” But Dimon’s closely-watched annual shareholder letter took a more moderate tone. Yes, Dimon said that “poorly conceived and uncoordinated regulations” have hurt the U.S. economy. But the JPMorgan chief said “we’re not looking to throw out the entirety of Dodd-Frank or other rules.” In the letter released Tuesday, Dimon even argued that thanks to regulation, the odds of another cataclysmic bank collapse like Lehman Brothers have been drastically reduced. “There’s so much more capital in the system that the chance of failure is really small,” Dimon said, adding that “we should congratulate the regulators” for stabilizing the system after 2008. By contrast, Trump seemed to blame the regulators. He said the regulators, not the CEOs, are the ones “running the banks” these days. Bank CEOs are “petrified of the regulators. They’re petrified,” Trump said. Dimon is just the latest big CEO to defend his ties to Trump. Elon Musk took to Twitter in February to explain why he agreed to stay on Trump’s advisory panel despite the uproar in Silicon Valley over his immigration policies. “I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council & keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong,” Musk tweeted. On the other hand, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick stepped down from the advisory council, saying he didn’t want his position to be “misinterpreted” as an endorsement of Trump’s agenda. Dimon is using his influential role to call out specific problems that Washington needs to fix, including corporate taxes, immigration and education. The JPMorgan CEO seemed particularly exasperated about crumbling roads, bridges and other forms of infrastructure Trump has pledged to rebuild. “People may die. It’s amazing to me we haven’t fixed this problem,” Dimon said. Dimon said he believes Trump is “on the right track” and said he’s “very comforted” by the president’s team of capable advisers like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis. “I’m optimistic because America has this amazingly resilient political system,” Dimon said. “It’s been through far worse than today.” 12 companies pull ads from 'The O'Reilly Factor' in growing movement Payless ShoeSource is filing for bankruptcy Related Posts Boeing working to drum up business in Iran Bryan Adams refuses to play in Mississippi over anti-LGBT law Verizon: We’re ‘still evaluating’ Yahoo deal This Chinese stock just mysteriously plunged 90% Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

The cuts show the immense power large asset managers have to curb fees they pay banks and the diminishing role of sell-side research at a time when Wall Street firms are facing a slump in stock trading commissions. BlackRock's $40 billion Global Allocation Fund paid out $13.4 million in commissions in the 2016 fiscal year for trades tied to research, compared with $28.8 million two years earlier. The commissions fell even though the BlackRock fund routed roughly the same level of transactions to brokerages in exchange for access to their research notes and other related services. The same pattern is true for other big BlackRock funds, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings from three of BlackRock's five largest funds. Some of those funds paid out more in total commissions, but trading activity in those funds increased to a greater degree, meaning that the actual commission rate fell. A BlackRock spokeswoman declined to comment. In announcing an overhaul of its actively managed equities business last week, BlackRock said it was "harnessing the power of 'human and machine,'" relying more on computers and data-mining to pick stocks. Equities revenue, which includes executing stock trades and buying and selling derivatives related to stocks, is slumping across Wall Street. In 2016, equities revenue across the world's biggest banks declined 13 percent, to the lowest level since 2012, according to research provider Coalition. The outlook is not expected to improve. For the first quarter of 2017, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co predicts equities revenue across the industry fell 3 percent year-over-year, compared with gains of over 20 percent in both investment banking and bond trading. REVENUES NOT SEEN COMING BACK Structural changes to the equities business over the last several years, such as the rise of electronic trading, have knocked off around $15 billion from the equities fee pool, according to a report from Morgan Stanley and management consulting firm Oliver Wyman. Electronic trading has dramatically increased trading volumes, while making the cost of trading much cheaper. Oliver Wyman partner Christian Edelmann, who co-authored the report, does not see those revenues coming back. "Once the equities model has become technology driven, that's not going to change," he said. Other factors are expected to strain the equities business further. Asset managers including BlackRock, which last week also said it would cut jobs and fees in its active equities business, are under enormous pressure due to weak returns and competition from low-cost options like index funds. The fee squeeze is making firms more selective about how they spend research dollars. At the same time, the long-running practice of paying for research through trading commissions is being upended by new regulations in Europe, known as the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Part of the overhaul will force investors in the European Union to pay for research directly, meaning banks will be required to put price tags on their proprietary analysis. Global asset managers are expected to "unbundle" payments in other regions as well. Asset managers and hedge funds typically determine their research budgets through a process called broker votes in which portfolio managers rate the value of equity research analysts. The broker vote helps firms decide which research providers to keep and how to allocate their research dollars. Asset managers have gained leverage because they have an increasing variety of choices of trading venues and research providers, including independent firms unaffiliated with the big banks. And a push for high-value ideas has caused some to build up more research capabilities in-house. Banks are doing what they can to keep their research products relevant, such as employing more data scientists to support research from traditional stock analysts. Banks have already been trimming their research budgets. Spending on research at the top investment banks fell by just over half to $4 billion in 2016 from $8.2 billion in 2008, according to Frost Consulting. BlackRock has managed to keep its funds' spending on commissions for research under control. Spending on commissions by its $21 billion Equity Dividend Fund increased by 39 percent from the 2014 to 2016 fiscal years, but the fund's transaction activity more than doubled, meaning that its commission rate overall decreased considerably. The commission rate paid for research by BlackRock's nearly $15 billion Multi-Asset Income Fund also fell over the 2014 to 2016 fiscal years, plunging by nearly 41 percent. One of BlackRock's five largest funds has not yet disclosed 2016 data, while another does not direct trades to brokerages in exchange for research. The funds use the brokerage services of major banks such as Bank of America Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan. The filings does not identify which of the banks provide research to BlackRock.

Since 2010, when the government took over student lending, direct government lending to students has gone from approximately $200 billion to more than $900 billion – creating dramatically increased student defaults and a population that is rightfully angry about how much money they owe, particularly since it reduces their ability to get other credit. Student loan experts disagree with Dimon's analysis. The bank-based Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program was phased out and replaced with the current Direct Loan program as part of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 signed into law by former President Barack Obama. "It is inaccurate to suggest that the federal government has managed the Direct Loan program any better or any worse than the FFEL lenders did," said Mark Kantrowitz, vice president of strategy for college and scholarship search site Cappex.com. "The percentage of Direct Loan dollars in default is similar to what it was under the FFEL program prior to 2010." Christophe Morin | Bloomberg | Getty Images Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co. For the 2016 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, there were $68 billion in Direct Loans for 4 million borrowers and $97 billion in FFEL loans to 6.9 million borrowers in default, according to the Department of Education. That means 7.2 percent of the outstanding Direct Loan portfolio and 29 percent of the outstanding FFEL portfolio were in default. A comparison between Direct Loan and FFEL portfolios is not appropriate, Kantrowitz said, since most defaults occur within the first five years of a loan entering repayment. That means the FFEL portfolio is almost entirely in repayment, while the Direct Loan portfolio continues to have loans added as new students go to college. And more of those loans could default. "We do not currently have a student debt problem so much as a college completion problem." -Mark Kantrowitz, Cappex.com "Growth in loan volume is largely due to growth in college costs and anemic increases in the federal Pell grants," Kantrowitz said. "Although milestones like a trillion dollars in student loan debt are impressive, what matters more is the impact on individual borrowers." Students who drop out of college are four times more likely to default than students who graduate, and college dropouts represent nearly two-thirds of the defaults. "We do not currently have a student debt problem so much as a college completion problem," Kantrowitz said. However, student loan experts do agree with Dimon's larger point that the debt is a drag on the American economy. "The banking industry is right to be worried about heavy debt burdens of young consumers," said Rohit Chopra , a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America and a former student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The high debt loads mean that young workers will delay buying a home, saving for retirement or starting a business, Chopra said. "But the answer is not hand the keys back to Wall Street," Chopra said. "We tried that before and it failed miserably." Tom AndersonPersonal Finance Writer

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told investors the U.S. is hurting the economy and growth by forcing hundreds of thousands of foreign students to leave every year after earning advanced degrees at American universities. Jamie Dimon Photographer: Christophe Morin/Bloomberg “It is alarming that approximately 40 percent (this is an astounding 300,000 students each year) of those who receive advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering and math” have no legal way of staying in the U.S., Dimon told shareholders in his annual letter Tuesday. “We are forcing great talent overseas by not allowing these young people to build their dreams here.” He made the comment in a list of government moves that already have eroded economic growth in recent years -- also including wars that have cost trillions of dollars, a surge in student debt and policies that seek felony convictions for minor crimes, keeping people out of the workforce. Yet, the remarks come just as President Donald Trump seeks to make good on a campaign promise to crack down on work visas that let companies in Silicon Valley and beyond enlist skilled foreign workers -- hiring that Trump says comes at the expense of American workers. On Friday, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency made it harder for companies to use so-called H-1B work visas. Dimon, who sits on Trump’s business forum aimed at boosting job growth, has been voicing support this year for other parts of the president’s business agenda. Dimon has said the U.S. would have a bright economic future if the new administration carries out plans to overhaul taxes, rein in regulation and boost infrastructure investment.

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has two big pronouncements as the Trump administration starts reshaping the government: “The United States of America is truly an exceptional country,” and “it is clear that something is wrong.” Dimon, leader of world’s most valuable bank and a counselor to the new president, used his 45-page annual letter to shareholders on Tuesday to list ways America is stronger than ever -- before jumping into a much longer list of self-inflicted problems that he said was “upsetting” to write. Here’s the start: Since the turn of the century, the U.S. has dumped trillions of dollars into wars, piled huge debt onto students, forced legions of foreigners to leave after getting advanced degrees, driven millions of Americans out of the workplace with felonies for sometimes minor offenses and hobbled the housing market with hastily crafted layers of rules. Read more on visas: Dimon alarmed that foreigners can’t stay Dimon, who sits on Donald Trump’s business forum aimed at boosting job growth, is renowned for his optimism and has been voicing support this year for parts of the president’s business agenda. In February, Dimon predicted the U.S. would have a bright economic future if the new administration carries out plans to overhaul taxes, rein in rules and boost infrastructure investment. In an interview last month, he credited Trump with boosting consumer and business confidence in growth, and reawakening “animal spirits.” Understands Anger Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up But on Tuesday, reasons for concern kept coming. Labor market participation is low, Dimon wrote. Inner-city schools are failing poor kids. High schools and vocational schools aren’t providing skills to get decent jobs. Infrastructure planning and spending is so anemic that the U.S. hasn’t built a major airport in more than 20 years. Corporate taxes are so onerous it’s driving capital and brains overseas. Regulation is excessive. “It is understandable why so many are angry at the leaders of America’s institutions, including businesses, schools and governments,” Dimon, 61, summarized. “This can understandably lead to disenchantment with trade, globalization and even our free enterprise system, which for so many people seems not to have worked.” Dimon’s name repeatedly came up last year as a potential Treasury secretary after Trump rode a wave of populism to win the November election. The job ultimately went to Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner who had served as the campaign’s national finance chairman. While Dimon’s letter marked a shift in his typical tone, he said he remains optimistic about JPMorgan’s ability to expand and profit. And the bank’s leaders have confidence in the underlying growth of the U.S. and global economies, he said. See also: Key takeaways from Dimon’s annual letter to shareholders Still, the U.S. is paying the price for bad decisions, and “something has gone awry in the public’s understanding of business and free enterprise,” he said. “We need trust and confidence in our institutions,” he concluded. “Confidence is the ‘secret sauce’ that, without spending any money, helps the economy grow.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

In the latest example, Wells Fargo and the data aggregator Finicity are announcing Tuesday afternoon a deal through which Wells Fargo will give Finicity access to its customers’ account data through an open application programming interface. This will allow Finicity’s clients, which include four of the top seven providers of personal financial management and many online lenders, to populate their apps with Wells Fargo customer data and use that data to assess potential borrowers’ creditworthiness — without customers having to give the third parties their login and password. It’s part of an overall thaw in the relationships between banks and fintechs. At the Retail Banking 2017 conference in March, more bankers expressed interest in working with tech companies than we’ve seen in past years; they were seeking help with virtual assistants, authentication, customer analytics and more. And fintechs lately have softened their sometimes-adversarial views toward banks, recognizing they need their scale, money and regulatory compliance prowess. “When people talk about there being this tension, we're not experiencing that with the financial institutions we're working with,” CeCe Morken, executive vice president of Intuit, maker of Mint, QuickBooks and TurboTax, said in an interview last week. “They have been awesome. And everyone is just interested in how do we get the best possible customer experience, leveraging the assets we both have and we both need each other.” Intuit, which has recently signed agreements with JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo and works with many banks and core processors directly and resorts to screen scraping, the method of logging in as the customer and looking up account data, where necessary. Morken said Intuit and the banks it works with seek common data-sharing standards. “We don't want anything custom," Morken said. "We just want standard connectivity, and that enables the smaller players to have easy access to data and do their innovations.” Deal of the week For Wells Fargo, the Finicity deal is the latest, but is likely not the last. “We’ve been talking with a number of potential partners about this sort of arrangement,” said Brett Pitts, head of digital for Wells Fargo Virtual Channels. Finicity, too, has been signing deals with other banks that have not been announced. “We’re not interested in limiting access to the data,” says Brett Pitts, head of digital for Wells Fargo Virtual Channels. The technology approach Wells Fargo is taking with Finicity, offering access through an application programming interface, is the same as it’s taken with Xero and Intuit. What’s different is this deal is the bank’s first with a provider to third-party applications. In other words, the Xero and Intuit deals were specific to Intuit and Xero products, this deal connects Wells Fargo to a universe of fintech firms. “The enablement of third parties and the broader ecosystem Finicity supports is something we’re excited about,” Pitts said. Debate lingers Critics of such deals, like Bill Harris at Personal Capital, have charged recently that banks are too controlling of their data and seek to block data aggregators and PFM companies from accessing certain types of information such as pricing that they could use to lure customers away. Pitts says this is not so. “We’re not interested in limiting access to the data,” he said. “I think a lot of those statements are based on the premise or assumption that we’re somehow fearful of these arrangements. We’re not concerned about being disintermediated from relationships with our customers, we’re not concerned about customers’ sharing information they want to share. The control point that’s important to us is that all of this remains under customer control.” Wells Fargo has no intention of restricting the customer data that it shares in any way, he said. (Asked if the bank plans to share pricing data, Pitts said he couldn’t comment due to the confidentiality of the agreements.) Steven Smith, CEO of Finicity, also defends banks on this front. “The banks ultimately want to be good actors in this space by providing access to data,” he said. “Generally, the banks we work with agree that it’s the consumer’s data. They believe they are a custodian, which means they have an obligation for security for their customers, and as a result, they have to form a portion of the overall ecosystem for ensuring we can get to a place where consumers can have ready access to the data they want in a secure fashion. You can’t eliminate banks from that ecosystem.” The New York Times reported recently that Wells Fargo has asked to be paid by technology companies that want better access to its data, to cover the additional infrastructure costs involved in providing real-time access to data. Pitts and Smith both said they could not confirm or deny this. The connections between Wells Fargo and Finicity will be built over the course of this year. Drive toward a single standard For their part, banks have been vocal about their dislike for screen scraping. This approach is insecure, brittle, easily broken and puts too much load on their servers at peak times, banks say. Smith also sees the shortcomings of this approach. “We ought to be looking for the most secure, consistent, reliable access to clean data possible,” he said. “Screen scraping is not that. With respect to the bank’s position, you are coming in the front door and exercising their servers at times that may be inconvenient for them, and there are better methods with respect to security.” Smith also said that Finicity holds itself to the same information security standards as banks. Where it can, the company uses industry-standard APIs, but it resorts to screen scraping when such is not available. Banks, fintech companies, and the Center for Financial Services Innovation have all called for the industry to adopt a common data sharing standard. Wells Fargo uses the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center’s Durable Data API standard for sharing data and the OAuth standard for tokenized authentication and authorization. The Durable Data standard is based on Open Financial Exchange 2.2, the data-sharing standard used by JPMorgan and many others. JPM also uses OAuth for authentication. The Durable Data API “is generally the standard people seem to be gravitating toward and understand,” Pitts said. “To the degree that we can all coalesce around a more open and standard way of doing things, it’s going to accelerate the adoption of this model.” Pitts said if a different standard becomes more popular, Wells Fargo might adopt it. “If something else starts to emerge, we’ll all have to stay open-minded and flexible in the interest of doing things in a way that’s broadest and most easily adopted,” he said. Smith says it’s important for the industry to choose between OFX and DDA, in order for open data access to build momentum. “We need to get to a standard that contemplates full access and uses of data that are helpful to facilitate all kinds of fintech solutions,” he said.

 Jamie Dimon just doubled down in supporting a little-known tax that pays poor people Chris Weller Apr. 4, 2017, 1:57 PM 2,087 facebook linkedin twitter email print m01229/Flickr In his latest annual letter to shareholders, JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon says the US should "dramatically expand" its current earned-income tax credit, a form of negative income tax that pays low-earners instead of asking them to pay income tax. The idea of negative income tax is novel: In effect, it's a kind of income tax that works in reverse. For those who earn below a certain amount — like the poverty line — the government pays them. The US already has a program like this that benefits millions of people's health and wallets, and President Donald Trump has proposed expanding it. Here's what it's all about. How it's applied today The largest example of NIT is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which serves 27 million working families in the US. It was started in 1975, under President Gerald Ford, expanded once by President Reagan, and expanded further by President Clinton. The EITC functions like a big tax refund. If a family makes below a certain amount each year, the government will refund the tax that was withheld plus an additional amount. President Trump wants to increase the EITC for couples making under $64,400 a year (or individuals earning below $31,200) to help low-income parents spend on childcare, up to a certain point. Families will also be able to deposit some of that money into a special account, which the government will match up to $1,000 annually. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters But it's still important for government "to have eggs in other baskets" when solving poverty, rather than relying exclusively on the EITC, says Russ Whitehurst, senior fellow of economics studies at the Brookings Institution. "Education programs that increase skill levels among the working-age population have, to date in human history, paid a consistent dividend in the form of higher overall economic activity," Whitehurst tells Business Insider. A hypothetical NIT, courtesy of the 1960s Milton Friedman, the influential University of Chicago economist, started talking about NIT in 1968. He saw it as a way to help people economically without reducing their incentive to work. He proposed a hypothetical. Let's say the lowest income someone could pay tax on was $3,000. For everyone who makes below that, Friedman said the government should give them 50% of the amount between the actual income and the cutoff. So if you earned $2,000, you'd get half of the $1,000 difference, or $500. If you earned nothing that year, you'd get $1,500. In other words, a family could never earn less than half the threshold, but it also couldn't earn the threshold itself or higher. Friedman said this was essential, because if people could earn the baseline or higher, they'd have little incentive to work at all. Planning for a future of automated work The idea resurfaced most recently in Dimon's letter to shareholders. "It is important to note that large companies generally pay well above the minimum wage and provide health insurance and retirement benefits to all their employees," Dimon wrote. "While this would help small businesses far more than big businesses, large companies should support the expansion of this program because it would foster growth and be great for lower paid American workers." Dimon's letter echoed his comments at this year's World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland, where leaders took to the idea because robotic automation now looms over a growing number of jobs. Governments may need to find ways to supplement people's wages when employers no longer require the employee's specific type of work. "I think negative income tax is a big solution for the low-skilled, to give people a living wage and the dignity of a job," Dimon said at a private lunch during the event. Dimon's vision of the near future is different from how most of us think about earning an income. JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Getty/Win McNamee In the current system, people earn an income based largely on what skills they can sell in the labor market. Doctors make more than baristas because medicine requires a greater set of skills and draws from a smaller pool of candidates relative to making coffee. As more jobs become automated, that dynamic could change. More people might work part-time and rely on supplemental income to reach a living wage. "Maybe one day we'll all be working four days a week and not five or six days a week," Dimon said. "In fact, I think in Europe they're already down to four days a week." However, the more jobs are automated, the less something like NIT would necessarily help people, says Jesse Rothstein, an economist at UC Berkeley. "Even the existing EITC doesn't get people to a livable wage," he tells Business Insider. "So you'd need something much more generous to make up for the fact you're only asking people to work two days a week, and to make that a livable amount of money." An alternative idea is universal basic income — a regular, livable wage paid to every citizen, working or not. Basic income is more extreme than NIT; advocates often take issue with the initial work requirement Friedman took for granted. Sam Altman, president of Silicon Valley's biggest startup accelerator, Y Combinator, has said it asks too much of people to keep working full-time (or at all) if machines already produce enough wealth to get divvied up. "There's this very deep-seated American ideal that work is valuable for its own sake, and there is some truth to that," Altman says. "But I don't think work is the only way to get a sense of being needed and community and fulfillment."

(Photo by Diane Bondareff/Invision for JPMorgan Chase/AP Images) JPMorgan CEO Dimon wants feds to 'open the rulebook' on post-crisis bank rules By Joseph Lawler (@josephlawler) • 4/4/17 12:52 PM Joseph Lawler Economics Writer The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/HeadshotLawler_Joseph.jpg Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called Tuesday for the government to revisit post-crisis rules on banks, saying that the system is now safer and crediting a "more business-friendly" environment for boosting the bank's performance. "We are not looking to throw out the entirety of Dodd-Frank or other rules..." Dimon wrote in a letter to shareholders. "It is, however, appropriate to open up the rulebook in the light of day and rework the rules and regulations that don't work well or are unnecessary." Dimon said the problem of "too big to fail" banks has been solved and that taxpayers would not be asked to bail out a big bank if one were to fail, thanks to much higher capital levels required at banks, new regulations and a new government process for putting banks through bankruptcy. Accordingly, he said, the government should revisit those rules to simplify capital requirements for banks and adjust some of the rules they face and the relationships they have with regulators. The banking industry, with congressional Republicans, is expected to mount various challenges to post-crisis rules implemented by former President Barack Obama. Although Dimon's letter did not mention President Trump by name, it did note that "the anticipated reversal of many negatives and the expectation of a more business-friendly environment" have improved the bank's results. Trump has pledged to undo many Dodd-Frank rules blamed for banks' problems. Earlier Tuesday, Trump told a group of CEOs at the White House that he planned to do "a major haircut" on Dodd-Frank. Among the biggest geopolitical risks facing JPMorgan, Dimon also wrote, is rising anti-globalization sentiment, including anti-immigrant politics. "We do not believe globalization will reverse course — we believe trade has been absolutely critical for growth around the world and has benefited billions of people," Dimon wrote.

 DIMON: We fear the EU will split apart, and it could have 'devastating economic and political effects' Elena Holodny Apr. 4, 2017, 1:01 PM 1,573 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jamie Dimon. REUTERS/Dylan Martinez JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is out with his annual letter to shareholders, in which he discusses not only the bank's business outlook but also various current economic and political issues. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he addresses one of the big political shocks of 2016 — the UK voting to leave the European Union in the June Brexit vote — and what that could mean for the continent going forward. "We hope that the advent of Brexit would lead the EU to focus on fixing its issues — immigration, bureaucracy, the ongoing loss of sovereign rights and labor inflexibility — and thereby pulling the EU and the monetary union closer together. Our fear, however, is that it could instead result in political unrest that would force the EU to split apart," he wrote in the letter. "The unraveling of the EU and the monetary union could have devastating economic and political effects," he continued, with his own added emphasis. "While we are not predicting this will happen, the probabilities have certainly gone up — and we will keep a close eye on the situation in Europe over the next several years." Data from the fall 2015 Eurobarometer report. Andy Kiersz/Business Insider As his emphasis on the world "could" suggests, Dimon is not forecasting the imminent collapse of the EU. Rather, he is addressing a potential political risk. And he's not alone in this thinking. Since the Brexit vote, markets across the board have focused on elections across Europe, looking for clues about other potential populist shifts. Perhaps the most well known example is the looming French election. One of the candidates, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right nationalist Front National, had previously outlined a plan to overhaul France. Should she win, she intends to hold a referendum on membership in the European Union if the EU does not agree to redesign the union as a loose coalition of nations without a common currency or a border-free area. Additionally, she has stated her intention to exit the euro. Market participants have also monitored the recent Dutch elections in March, which saw Prime Minister Mark Rutte's ruling People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) win the most seats in parliament for the third time in a row, dealing a blow to far-right populist leader Geert Wilders, and will be watching the upcoming German elections in September. Dimon also touched on some of the nitty-gritty details regarding Brexit and JPMorgan's future in Europe. "We are confident we will be able to develop and expand the capabilities that our EU subsidiaries and branches will need to serve our clients properly in Europe under EU law. This will require acquiring regulatory approvals, transferring certain technologies and moving some people," he wrote. "We must be prepared to do this assuming a hard exit by the United Kingdom — it would be irresponsible to presume otherwise. While this does not entail moving many people in the next two years, we do suspect that following Brexit, there will be constant pressure by the EU not to 'outsource' services to the United Kingdom but to continue to move people and capabilities into EU subsidiaries," he added.

The updates were mentioned in CEO Jamie Dimon’s annual letter to shareholders, which was published Tuesday. The highly anticipated letter often serves as a bellwether for various topics, ranging from the threat of fintech in previous years to the need for regulatory reform, the dominating topic in this year’s missive. Although Dimon’s comments this year on tech were shorter than last year’s, he made a few noteworthy points. (The heads of JPMorgan’s business lines also wrote letters and were expected to include additional details about the company’s efforts with regard to technology. Expect to read more about those letters later.) JPMorgan spends heavily on tech "to benefit customers with better, faster and often cheaper products and services, to reduce errors and to make the firm more efficient,” CEO Dimon wrote. Bloomberg News For instance, $600 million of the company’s $9.5 billion tech budget was spent “on emerging fintech solutions.” In one sense, Dimon is using "fintech" as a synonym for digital banking. He mentioned that some of that money went toward building and improving online and mobile services. But he also used "fintech" to refer to partnerships with fintech firms. In the last couple of years, for example, JPMorgan has partnered with the online lender OnDeck for small-business loans, TrueCar for auto lending and Roostify for mortgages. "The reasons we invest so much in technology (whether it’s digital, big data or machine learning) are simple: to benefit customers with better, faster and often cheaper products and services, to reduce errors and to make the firm more efficient,” Dimon said in the 46-page letter. Dimon also highlighted a Developer Services API store — a place where developers can access the company’s application programming interfaces to build new products or services. Such connectivity would be “fully controlled, of course,” Dimon wrote. He also vaguely referred to “bill payment and business services” innovations. “While I can’t reveal much at the moment, suffice it to say there are some interesting developments coming as we integrate our capabilities with those of other companies,” Dimon wrote. In last year’s letter, Dimon spent a considerable amount of ink discussing screen-scraping and customer data. This year, the firm entered into a deal with Intuit to share data via API. Dimon mentioned the Intuit deal in the letter, but also referenced an on-off switch that allows customers to stop third-party access to their data. “In addition to protecting the bank, the customers and even the third party (in this case, Intuit), it allows customers to share data — how and when they want,” Dimon wrote. ”We are hoping this sets a new standard for data-sharing relationships,” he added. In the letter, Dimon also outlined the company’s efforts with the Center for Financial Services Innovation to help foster the growth of fintechs that address the needs of the underserved through the center's Financial Solutions Lab. To date the lab has supported more than 18 fintech companies. Dimon also name-checked the savings app Digit, which helps people build savings by moving small amounts of money into an account based on spending and income. Digit has helped Americans save more than $350 million. Article Your Top CECL Questions Answered How should banks approach CECL implementation and can existing processes be used as a starting point?

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told investors the U.S. is hurting the economy and growth by forcing hundreds of thousands of foreign students to leave every year after earning advanced degrees at American universities. “It is alarming that approximately 40 percent (this is an astounding 300,000 students each year) of those who receive advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering and math” have no legal way of staying in the U.S., Dimon told shareholders in his annual letter Tuesday. “We are forcing great talent overseas by not allowing these young people to build their dreams here.” (See also: What Dimon had to say about fintech in his annual letter.) Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, sits on Trump’s business forum aimed at boosting job growth Bloomberg News He made the comment in a list of government moves that already have eroded economic growth in recent years — also including wars that have cost trillions of dollars, a surge in student debt and policies that seek felony convictions for minor crimes, keeping people out of the workforce. Yet, the remarks come just as President Donald Trump seeks to make good on a campaign promise to crack down on work visas that let companies in Silicon Valley and beyond enlist skilled foreign workers — hiring that Trump says comes at the expense of American workers. On Friday, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency made it harder for companies to use so-called H-1B work visas. Dimon, who sits on Trump’s business forum aimed at boosting job growth, has been voicing support this year for other parts of the president’s business agenda. Dimon has said the U.S. would have a bright economic future if the new administration carries out plans to overhaul taxes, rein in regulation and boost infrastructure investment.

"Essentially, too big to fail has been solved — taxpayers will not pay if a bank fails," Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders released Tuesday. "The American public has the right to demand that if a major bank fails, they, as taxpayers, would not have to pay for it, and the failure wouldn't unduly harm the U.S. economy," he added. "In my view, these demands have now both been met." "Market panic will never disappear entirely, and regulations must be flexible enough to allow banks to act as a bulwark against it rather than forcing financial institutions into a defensive crouch that will only make things worse." -Jamie Dimon, CEO, JPMorgan Chase The expression is a relic from the 2008 financial crisis that refers to regulators' determination then that certain institutions could not be allowed to go bankrupt, because of the danger such an outcome would pose to the wider financial system. Multiple financial institutions received taxpayer aid in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers that year. Dimon cites multiple reasons why he believes the too-big-to-fail phenomenon no longer exists. Among them are higher capital and liquidity levels, more transparency and disclosure and a general regulatory environment that has made the system far more secure. In fact, he said some regulations go too far. "Market panic will never disappear entirely, and regulations must be flexible enough to allow banks to act as a bulwark against it rather than forcing financial institutions into a defensive crouch that will only make things worse," he said. Dimon cites the need for "consistent, transparent, simplified and more risk-based capital standards." However, he contends that under today's capital rules, Lehman probably wouldn't have even failed. The bank's capital would now be $45 billion as opposed to the $23 billion in 2007. If Lehman still failed, he said multiple safeguards put into place now wouldn't put the onus on taxpayers. Dimon added that due to the existence of "living wills" that show how a bank would be unwound in case of emergency, "Too Big to Fail was solved before any additional rules were put in place."

Grogan | CNBC Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co. at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank spent $9.5 billion on technology in 2016 and has plans this year to introduce products for digital banking, online investment advice and electronic trading. In his annual letter to shareholders on Tuesday, Dimon said the bank is also "collaborating with some excellent fintech companies to dramatically improve our digital and other customer offerings." Among the leading bank executives, Dimon has established himself as the biggest presence in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, making regular trips West to meet with tech executives and venture capitalists. He made headlines in his shareholder letter two years ago, warning investors that "Silicon Valley is coming." Rather than view potential banking disruption as a threat to JPMorgan, Dimon has embraced new technologies. About $3 billion, or almost one-third, of last year's investment went to "new initiatives," including $600 million on fintech solutions and projects. Dimon highlighted partnerships with emerging tech companies like Zelle for consumer payments, Roostify for online mortgages, TrueCar for auto finance and On Deck Capital, which provides loans to small businesses. The JPMorgan CEO also took a swipe at the U.S. immigration system and how it hurts this country's ability to compete globally. Dimon said that about 40 percent of people receiving advanced degrees in science, technology engineering and math at American universities are from other countries. Yet they have no legal way to stay when they're finished with school. "We are forcing great talent overseas by not allowing these young people to build their dreams here," Dimon wrote.

Santiago Suarez will join the San Francisco-based company as head of strategy and mergers and acquisitions, he said on Twitter. He was previously JPMorgan’s head of new product development and emerging technologies, a group he co-founded and which has helped the biggest U.S. bank experiment with the digital ledger known as blockchain as well as machine-learning techniques. Before that, he worked in JPMorgan’s corporate-strategy group — described by some bankers as a SWAT team deployed by Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon to take care of pressing issues in the business. IMAGE: Bloomberg News The high-profile hire is the latest by Lending Club, whose stock has tumbled by almost two-thirds from its listing price of $15 a share after the company found abuses tied to the sale of some of its loans, which led to the departure of its founder and former CEO Renaud Laplanche. It also comes as peer-to-peer lending grows more enmeshed with the Wall Street institutions its champions once eschewed, with the launch of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s own proprietary offering being but one example. Suarez declined to comment publicly when contacted by Bloomberg. He joins the company after taking a sabbatical from the bank. On LinkedIn, he said that currently he was “on leave traveling around the world on a bit of an adventure climbing mountains, rock faces, and the occasional ice sheet.” Lending Club didn’t immediately reply to a request for confirmation submitted after normal business hours. Lending Club, which uses an online platform to directly connect borrowers with lenders, has been seeking to restore its funding sources by selling bonds and re-establishing relationships with banks. Last month Scott Sanborn, the new CEO, said the company still intends to expand abroad and has “accomplished the foundational work required to prepare Lending Club for the growth to come.” Article Your Top CECL Questions Answered How should banks approach CECL implementation and can existing processes be used as a starting point?

Our findings may assist plan sponsors and advisors in guiding these investors to a financially secure retirement. Survey results indicate that members of this large and influential age group—which will be working its way toward retirement for the next 35 to 45 years—are not only supportive of a more “automatic” DC plan, but they also expect their employers to play a vital role in helping them save and invest for retirement. Here are three critical findings from our research on the attitudes toward saving and investing among the youngest members of the U.S. labor force. 1) A majority identify as “do it for me” investors. Our research shows that, despite their generally accepted reputation as self-assured and independent, those under 30 are more likely than those 30 and over to classify themselves as “do it for me” investors (69% vs. 56%). These youthful investors say they want help selecting their investments and prefer to leave most of the ongoing investment decisions to experienced investment professionals (vs. “do it yourself” investors, who prefer to take a more hands-on approach). They are also more likely than those over 30 to appreciate receiving notifications from their employer if they are not saving enough (62% of those under 30 vs. 34% of those 30 and over). 2) In general, they expect their employers to take responsibility for helping them save and invest for retirement. These young employees, less experienced in managing their own finances—and admittedly a long way from retirement—are more likely to assign at least some degree of responsibility to their employers for helping them save for retirement (82% vs. 73% for those 30 and over). What’s more, half of those under 30 think their employer has an obligation to help them choose the right investments, compared with only 22% of their older colleagues. 3) They are among the strongest proponents of the “automatic 401(k).” Our research and experience suggest that some plan sponsors may be reluctant to adopt the automatic 401(k)—a term we use here to refer to a plan that utilizes some combination of automatic plan features, qualified default investment alternatives (QDIAs) such as target date funds (TDFs), and re-enrollment¹—for fear of employee pushback. Yet our participant research indicates an encouraging level of support, particularly among participants under 30, for these plan features, as well as asset allocation strategies, that may help automate and simplify employee retirement-related decisions while leaving the ultimate choice in participants’ hands. A large majority are in favor of or at least neutral toward automatic enrollment (84%) and automatic contribution escalation (86%), and the group is close to unanimous in its support of target date funds and re-enrollment. Rather than seeing the implementation of the automatic 401(k) as an example of employers overstepping their roles, participants, especially those under 30, appear to appreciate and to some extent expect their employers to proactively help them get and stay on track for a secure retirement. “Under 30s” are the strongest proponents of the automatic 401(k) Implications for plan sponsors and advisors Getting these young employees on the right track now, early in their careers, can allow the benefits of consistent saving and age-appropriate asset allocation to compound over their working lives. The good news is, those under 30 recognize the challenge they face in saving and investing for retirement and appear very receptive to the knowledge, tools and guidance that employers and advisors can provide. These findings may help assure plan sponsors that their efforts to strengthen their plans and proactively place employees on a solid path to a secure retirement will likely be met with support among current and future generations of participants. Source: J.P. Morgan Plan Participant Research 2016. The online survey of 1,001 DC plan participants was conducted in January 2016. ¹A plan re-enrollment is a process by which participants are notified that their existing assets and future contributions will be invested in the plan’s qualified default investment alternative (QDIA), which may be a target date fund, based on their date of birth. All participants’ assets are automatically moved into the QDIA on a certain date unless the participant makes a new investment election during a specified time period. Before conducting a re-enrollment, plan sponsors must engage in a prudent process for determining whether a re-enrollment is appropriate for the plan and its participants.

JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon, in an annual letter to shareholders, said he had hoped Britain’s decision last year to exit the EU would have led the bloc to focus on “fixing its issues,” such as immigration and rigid labor rules. “Our fear, however, is that it could instead result in political unrest that would force the EU to split apart,” Dimon said. ADVERTISEMENT READ: ‘Disintegrating’ EU has nothing to celebrate — ex-Greek minister  | Duterte drops the ‘F bomb’ on EU anew “The unraveling of the EU and the monetary union could have devastating economic and political effects. While we are not predicting this will happen, the probabilities have certainly gone up — and we will keep a close eye on the situation in Europe over the next several years.” Regarding Brexit itself, Dimon expressed confidence the bank would be able to meet all its European’ clients needs once Britain exits the EU following negotiations expected to take two years. The bank doesn’t foresee shifting much staff from Britain over the next two years, but “we do suspect that following Brexit, there will be constant pressure by the EU not to ‘outsource’ services to the United Kingdom but to continue to move people and capabilities into EU subsidiaries,” Dimon said. Dimon, who is chair of the Washington lobby group the Business Roundtable and sits on a CEO advisory board to President Donald Trump, also expressed support for international trade in the wake of criticism by Trump and others of major trade agreements. Dimon called Mexico, a leading Trump target, a “long-standing peaceful neighbor” whose interests are intertwined with those of the United States. “Our trade agreement with Mexico helps ensure that the young democracy in Mexico is not hijacked by populist and anti-American leaders (like Chavez in Venezuela),” Dimon said. ” “While there are some clear identifiable problems with NAFTA, I believe they will be worked out in a way that is fair and beneficial to both sides.” ADVERTISEMENT Dimon described the challenges with China as “more complex” and include cybersecurity and the protection intellectual property. “However, there is no inevitable or compelling reason that China and America have to clash,” Dimon said. Dimon also reiterated stances on a number of other issues, voicing support for less onerous financial regulation and endorsing tax reform to eliminate the incentive for multinationals to move overseas.

They also outline their recommendations on IT as well as auto sector Titan Morgan Stanley is overweight on the stock with a target of Rs 530. It says that the post-quarter update points to a strong Q4 and expects consensus to revise earnings over the next few days. It also cited the management’s optimistic stance of high-teen revenue growth for FY18. Meanwhile, JPMorgan has maintained its neutral rating with an increased target price to Rs 455 from Rs 400. United Spirits Goldman Sachs has upgraded the stock to neutral from a sell call. The research firm believes the valuation post its recent underperformance reflects the risk of a margin miss. The target for the stock implies a 9 percent downside against 5 percent for the coverage group. Cyient Morgan Stanley has doubled its upgrade on the stock to overweight and there are rerating triggers in sight as well. It expects earnings growth of 20 percent in FY18 from 8 percent in FY17. The research firm also sees broad-based growth to narrow PE discount to larger peers. Kotak Mahindra Bank UBS has a buy rating on the stock with an increased target price of Rs 1,050 from Rs 900. It has raised the earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 10 percent in FY18 and 3 percent in FY19. The research firm has also factored in 3.4 percent equity dilution. It says banks offer one of the highest sustainable earnings growth over 5 years. It has raised FY18/19 estimates and expects a 29% EPS CAGR over FY17-20 BEL Credit Suisse has maintained an outperform rating on the stock with an unchanged target of Rs 180. Q4 execution and profits for nine months to FY17 suggest a significant upgrade to the consensus. The company may report EPS of about Rs 71-72 in FY17. Coal India Nomura has maintained a neutral call on the stock with an unchanged target of Rs 320. The FY17 output implies 2-3 percent rise in its normalized EPS. IT sector Nomura believes immigration tightening seen in the UK, US and Singapore as a negative for the Indian IT sector. It sees both margin and near-term growth being under pressure. It has cited 3 H1-B visa bills that are tabled in the House or the Senate since the Trump administration took over, but the actual passage will take 3-4 quarters. HCL Tech remains the only buyer in Tier-1 IT firms, while it remains neutral on Infosys, Tech Mahindra and TCS. It has maintained a reduce call on Wipro. AutosCLSA believes the impact of demonetisation seems to be behind passenger vehicles, but two-wheelers and commercial vehicles remain weak. However, it is also growing sequentially. Based on volumes of original equipment manufacturers, the research firm estimates PV industry to have grown over 10 percent, while M&HCVs were seen at 5-7 percent in March. It sees less pre-buying in M&HCVs due to BS-IV norms raise concerns for FY19 outlook. tags #BSE #Nifty #NSE #Sensex #Stocks Views #trading #United Spirits Related news Business Sensex back at 30K after 2 yrs: 600 stocks that more than doubled wealth in the same period BY kshitij Apr 05, 2017 11:54 AM Business Here are some stock ideas from market experts Apr 05, 2017 11:51 AM Business Buy Edelweiss Financial Services, Titan Company: Prakash Gaba Apr 05, 2017 11:48 AM Business Buy Petronet LNG 420 Call, Hindustan Unilever 920 Call: Amit Gupta Apr 05, 2017 11:41 AM Business Buy Allahabad Bank, PC Jeweller, Adani Power: Sandeep Wagle Apr 05, 2017 11:27 AM Business Here are fundamental trading ideas from SP Tulsian Apr 05, 2017 11:22 AM Business Buy Reliance Industrial Infrastructure, Aditya Birla Nuvo: Mitessh Thakkar Apr 05, 2017 11:20 AM Business Not very aggressive at current levels; like consumer discretionary, NBFCs & metals: Birla Sun Life MF Apr 05, 2017 10:22 AM Business 'Smart stock pickers can make 50-100% return in FY18': 5 stocks Porinju is positive on Apr 05, 2017 10:19 AM News Most Popular Top News Maybe it's time for hostile takeovers; govt must back honest risks: Uday Kotak D-Mart bumper listing: Should you buy, book profits or hold shares?

The Chancellor accused some Tory MPs of undermining the Prime Minister’s negotiations by secretly wanting talks to break up without agreement so the country has a clean break from the EU. In a dig at the Foreign Secretary and Brexit Secretary, who have claimed leaving without a deal would not be disastrous, Mr Hammond said it was not a sensible option. Philip Hammond (left) said the option of leaving the EU without a deal was ‘ridiculous’, contradicting Boris Johnson (right) and David Davis Last month, Mr Davis (pictured) said that leaving without a deal was ‘not as frightening as some people think but not as simple as some people think RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Our reliance on foreign nurses is the biggest threat to the... Don't expect EU free movement to end for at least five... Share this article Share On a trip to India, Mr Hammond told Bloomberg: ‘There are definitely some people on both sides who do not want a deal, they do not want to see Britain continuing to collaborate in what the Prime Minister described in a letter as a deep and special partnership with the European Union.’ REMOANER BANKER'S U-TURN  Brexit could be the EU’s last chance to solve its problems and avoid collapse, the boss of JPMorgan has said. In a major U-turn, arch-Remainer Jamie Dimon confessed his business would move just a few of its 16,000 UK staff abroad in the next two years. And the Europhile Wall Street boss said he feared that the EU could disintegrate in coming years, with ‘devastating economic and political effects’ unless the Brexit vote acts as a wake-up call. His bleak assessment of the bloc – and more compromising tone on the City of London – is a sharp contrast to the Project Fear campaign, when he threatened 4,000 British workers with the sack if the referendum did not go his way. While he last night talked of potentially ‘moving some people’, he explicitly stressed the figure would be low. His comments came in his bank’s annual report to US markets. He said: ‘We hope that the advent of Brexit would lead the EU to focus on fixing its issues – immigration, bureaucracy, the ongoing loss of sovereign rights and labour inflexibility – and thereby pulling the EU and the monetary union closer together. ‘Our fear, however, is that it could instead result in political unrest that would force the EU to split apart.’ He predicted with a ‘high degree of confidence’ there would be ‘tensions’ in the process, but added: ‘I’m clear the objective from the UK side is to reach a deal and what I’m hearing from my counterparts in Europe is that is their objective. ‘Those people who are hoping for no deal, I say we have to disprove their thinking by showing there is clear goodwill on the Europe side to reach a deal.’ Speaking in the Middle East, Theresa May insisted the Brexit deal could be completed within two years, but acknowledged that the full free trade deal, which would have to be signed off by every EU parliament, might take longer. Mr Johnson, who was meeting Germany’s foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel in London, said he was confident of reaching an agreement with the remaining 27 EU member states, but insisted if they failed the UK would continue to thrive. ‘It is possible to do a deal that is win-win. I don’t want to be unduly pessimistic.  'I think we can get a deal,’ he said. ‘But if you ask me ‘If we don’t get a deal would the UK survive?’ I think we would more than survive.’ Last month, Mr Davis said that leaving without a deal was ‘not as frightening as some people think but not as simple as some people think’. Mr Hammond yesterday said it would not be ‘realistic’ to expect 100 per cent support on both free movement and the economy at the end of the two-year negotiations. ‘The issue for most people in the UK is they want control of their borders and they want to be outside of the EU’s structures, but within those constraints they want to go on trading as openly and freely as possible,’ he said.

By Jon C. Ogg April 4, 2017 2:40 pm EDT Print Email Tweet When major bank analysts at one bank downgrade the stock (or stocks) of competitors, it has long been considered by some investors that perhaps that analyst is indirectly downgrading their own bank. So when Citigroup’s Keith Horowitz downgraded shares of rival Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC), does it mean that the analyst is indirectly downgrading Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) in the same call? Before thinking this is a serious stretch, let’s consider where the banking sector is and how it has been broken down. Both BofA and Citi were trading at the biggest discounts to book value of the major money center banks — while J.P. Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo were at big premiums. Both BofA and Citi used to be Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks, only to get booted out of the index. When Horowitz downgraded Bank of America, it was to Neutral from Buy and the price target is $25.00 for the stock. The call is also about two weeks ahead of the banking sector’s earnings report for the first quarter. Horowitz cited BofA’s valuation and rally after almost a 50% gain in six months and with BofA shares having outperformed other large money center banks. One key issue which was brought up is that the value gap between BofA and JPMorgan seems to have tightened enough and that much of the good news now looks priced in. In recent months, Bank of America has said that higher interest rates would help its main operations. The promise of lower regulation for banks under the Trump administration has also helped to contribute to the major gains seen in the banking sector. Even the expected economic improvement was said to be reflected in BofA shares at the current price. ALSO READ: Merrill Lynch Has Top 10 Stock Ideas for Q2 What also stood out is that Bank of America’s stock was last seen up 7% year to date. That is up from a 2% gain for JPMorgan and a gain of almost 1% for Citigroup. Now look at the 77% gain for BofA versus the performance from a year ago in rivals: Citi is up 43% and JPMorgan is up 51%. Book values are now becoming a tad outdated as the last book values were as of December 31, 2016. On a comparison to then, BofA’s price to book value ratio is now 1.00 after having been trading at a handy discount for years. JPMorgan is valued at 1.37 times its 2016 year-end book value, while Citi is still valued at a deeply discounted 0.82 times book value. ALSO READ: 25 Companies Raising Their Dividends for 25 Years or More Another key issue to consider is that Bank of America’s P/E ratio is 12.8 times this year’s expected earnings per share. The same P/E ratios are 13.3 for JPMorgan and Citi is valued at 11.5 times expected earnings per share. As far as how the bank stocks reacted all on their own, Bank of America’s stock was down just 0.5% at $23.47. JPMorgan shares were actually up 0.3% at $87.32. Citigroup’s stock price was down just 3-cents at $59.65 late on Tuesday. Perhaps Mr. Horowitz’s downgrade wasn’t pointing the finger at anything more than Bank of America.

("CEOC") and its Chapter 11 debtor subsidiaries (collectively, the "Debtors") today announced the pricing of $1.435 billion of senior secured credit facilities for CEOC, consisting of a $1.235 billion seven-year senior secured term loan facility (the "Term Facility") and a $200 million five-year senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility" and, together with the Term Facility, the "Senior Facilities"). The Term Facility was oversubscribed. The interest rate under the new Term Facility is equal to either, at CEOC's option, (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 250 basis points with no LIBOR floor or (b) the adjusted base rate plus 150 basis points, and the Term Facility will be issued at 99.5% of par.  "Pricing of the Senior Facilities is another important milestone in the process to complete CEOC's restructuring," said Mark Frissora, President and Chief Executive Officer of Caesars Entertainment.  The closing of the Senior Facilities is anticipated to occur in connection with CEOC's emergence from bankruptcy in the summer of 2017, subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation, receipt of all required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.  CEOC's emergence from bankruptcy is subject to the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, completion of the merger of Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition Company, certain other financing activities, continuing oversight by the United States Bankruptcy Court, and other customary closing conditions. The proceeds from the Term Facility will be used to finance transactions in connection with CEOC's emergence from bankruptcy in accordance with CEOC's plan of reorganization, including to repay existing indebtedness and to pay related fees and expenses.  Credit Suisse AG is serving as sole administrative agent for the Senior Facilities. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. served as joint lead arrangers for the Senior Facilities and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Morgan Stanley and UBS Securities LLC served as joint bookrunners for the Senior Facilities.

VEGAS, April 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Caesars Entertainment Corporation (NASDAQ: CZR) ("Caesars Entertainment") and Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc. ("CEOC") and its Chapter 11 debtor subsidiaries (collectively, the "Debtors") today announced the pricing of $1.435 billion of senior secured credit facilities for CEOC, consisting of a $1.235 billion seven-year senior secured term loan facility (the "Term Facility") and a $200 million five-year senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility" and, together with the Term Facility, the "Senior Facilities"). The Term Facility was oversubscribed. The interest rate under the new Term Facility is equal to either, at CEOC's option, (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 250 basis points with no LIBOR floor or (b) the adjusted base rate plus 150 basis points, and the Term Facility will be issued at 99.5% of par.  "Pricing of the Senior Facilities is another important milestone in the process to complete CEOC's restructuring," said Mark Frissora, President and Chief Executive Officer of Caesars Entertainment.  The closing of the Senior Facilities is anticipated to occur in connection with CEOC's emergence from bankruptcy in the summer of 2017, subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation, receipt of all required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.  CEOC's emergence from bankruptcy is subject to the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, completion of the merger of Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition Company, certain other financing activities, continuing oversight by the United States Bankruptcy Court, and other customary closing conditions. The proceeds from the Term Facility will be used to finance transactions in connection with CEOC's emergence from bankruptcy in accordance with CEOC's plan of reorganization, including to repay existing indebtedness and to pay related fees and expenses.  Credit Suisse AG is serving as sole administrative agent for the Senior Facilities. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. served as joint lead arrangers for the Senior Facilities and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Morgan Stanley and UBS Securities LLC served as joint bookrunners for the Senior Facilities.

You are cautioned to not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this document. CEC undertakes no obligation to publicly update or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this filing or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.

Like us on Facebook. Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now With a building boom underway, business has continued to gobble up new North Texas office space this year. Net office leasing in North Texas added up to about 1.5 million square feet of buildings in the first quarter. The highest demand areas for office space were in Las Colinas and in Dallas' northern suburbs, according to a new report by commercial real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. While the leasing total was down slightly from first quarter 2016, it was enough to keep overall office vacancy in the area at just over 16 percent at the end of March. "Numerous tenants are in the market exploring space options, but are likely taking less square footage due to more efficient space layouts based on new workplace design strategies," said Cushman & Wakefield's research director Curtis Hornaday. "New construction deliveries over the next several months will put an upward pressure on vacancy rates." Almost 5.9 million square feet of office space was under construction in North Texas in the first quarter. And much of that new building space will open its doors this year. Fortunately, most of the new office space is for major employers including Toyota, Liberty Mutual Insurance and JPMorgan Chase. But those companies will leave behind older, empty offices when they move into their new Plano campuses this year. Average office rents for first-class buildings now top $30 per square foot - the highest ever in Dallas-Fort Worth. First class office rents are even higher in Uptown - at more than $40 per square foot on average - and in Preston Center in North Dallas, $37.76 per square foot. The surge in net office leasing in the Las Colinas area came from two big companies moving into space there - CoreLogic and Caliber Home Loans, according to Cushman & Wakefield. With almost 100,000 square feet of net leasing in the first quarter, downtown Dallas had one of the best office market showings in more than a year. "We're seeing steady demand from tenants. Uptown and Legacy are still seeing solid activity, but downtown is new, and here's why," said Cushman & Wakefield's Randy Cooper. "You're starting to see a lot of excitement over the redevelopment of Fountain Place and the renovation of Trammell Crow Center. Momentum also is building in the West End." Nationwide net office leasing totaled about 6.8 million square feet in the first quarter, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Office demand in the first months of 2017 was down by about 40 percent from a year earlier and was the smallest net gain in almost five years. Across the country, just more than 13 percent of the office space was empty. There were more than 100 millions square feet of office space under construction nationwide at the end of March. "Developers are clearly cranking it up, but the space is mostly getting delivered in places that need it most," said Cushman & Wakefield chief economist Ken McCarthy. Among the major markets the real estate firm tracks each quarter, D-FW ranked behind Manhattan and Silicon Valley, Calif in total office construction.

JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon, in an annual letter to shareholders, said he had hoped Britain's decision last year to exit the EU would have led the bloc to focus on "fixing its issues," such as immigration and rigid labor rules. "Our fear, however, is that it could instead result in political unrest that would force the EU to split apart," Dimon said. "The unraveling of the EU and the monetary union could have devastating economic and political effects. While we are not predicting this will happen, the probabilities have certainly gone up -- and we will keep a close eye on the situation in Europe over the next several years." Regarding Brexit itself, Dimon expressed confidence the bank would be able to meet all its European' clients needs once Britain exits the EU following negotiations expected to take two years. The bank doesn't foresee shifting much staff from Britain over the next two years, but "we do suspect that following Brexit, there will be constant pressure by the EU not to 'outsource' services to the United Kingdom but to continue to move people and capabilities into EU subsidiaries," Dimon said. Dimon, who is chair of the Washington lobby group the Business Roundtable and sits on a CEO advisory board to President Donald Trump, also expressed support for international trade in the wake of criticism by Trump and others of major trade agreements. Dimon called Mexico, a leading Trump target, a "long-standing peaceful neighbor" whose interests are intertwined with those of the United States. "Our trade agreement with Mexico helps ensure that the young democracy in Mexico is not hijacked by populist and anti-American leaders (like Chavez in Venezuela)," Dimon said. "While there are some clear identifiable problems with NAFTA, I believe they will be worked out in a way that is fair and beneficial to both sides.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 April 2017 by Military News Caesars Announces Pricing of $1.435 Billion Senior Secured Credit Facilities LAS VEGAS, April 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Caesars Entertainment Corporation (NASDAQ: CZR) ("Caesars Entertainment") and Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc. ("CEOC") and its Chapter 11 debtor subsidiaries (collectively, the "Debtors") today announced the pricing of $1.435 billion of senior secured credit facilities for CEOC, consisting of a $1.235 billion seven-year senior secured term loan facility (the "Term Facility") and a $200 million five-year senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility" and, together with the Term Facility, the "Senior Facilities"). The Term Facility was oversubscribed. The interest rate under the new Term Facility is equal to either, at CEOC's option, (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 250 basis points with no LIBOR floor or (b) the adjusted base rate plus 150 basis points, and the Term Facility will be issued at 99.5% of par.  "Pricing of the Senior Facilities is another important milestone in the process to complete CEOC's restructuring," said Mark Frissora, President and Chief Executive Officer of Caesars Entertainment.  The closing of the Senior Facilities is anticipated to occur in connection with CEOC's emergence from bankruptcy in the summer of 2017, subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation, receipt of all required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.  CEOC's emergence from bankruptcy is subject to the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, completion of the merger of Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition Company, certain other financing activities, continuing oversight by the United States Bankruptcy Court, and other customary closing conditions. The proceeds from the Term Facility will be used to finance transactions in connection with CEOC's emergence from bankruptcy in accordance with CEOC's plan of reorganization, including to repay existing indebtedness and to pay related fees and expenses.  Credit Suisse AG is serving as sole administrative agent for the Senior Facilities. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. served as joint lead arrangers for the Senior Facilities and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Morgan Stanley and UBS Securities LLC served as joint bookrunners for the Senior Facilities.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:00 AM, April 5, 2017 NEW YORK - BlackRock Inc <BLK.N>, the world's biggest asset manager, slashed the amount it paid out in commissions to Wall Street firms for research by more than half for its largest mutual fund over the last two years, according to filings. The cuts show the immense power large asset managers have to curb fees they pay banks and the diminishing role of sell-side research at a time when Wall Street firms are facing a slump in stock trading commissions. BlackRock's $40 billion Global Allocation Fund <MALOX.O> paid out $13.4 million in commissions in the 2016 fiscal year for trades tied to research, compared with $28.8 million two years earlier. The commissions fell even though the BlackRock fund routed roughly the same level of transactions to brokerages in exchange for access to their research notes and other related services. The same pattern is true for other big BlackRock funds, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings from three of BlackRock's five largest funds. Some of those funds paid out more in total commissions, but trading activity in those funds increased to a greater degree, meaning that the actual commission rate fell. A BlackRock spokeswoman declined to comment. In announcing an overhaul of its actively managed equities business last week, BlackRock said it was "harnessing the power of 'human and machine,'" relying more on computers and data-mining to pick stocks. Equities revenue, which includes executing stock trades and buying and selling derivatives related to stocks, is slumping across Wall Street. In 2016, equities revenue across the world's biggest banks declined 13 percent, to the lowest level since 2012, according to research provider Coalition. The outlook is not expected to improve. For the first quarter of 2017, JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> predicts equities revenue across the industry fell 3 percent year-over-year, compared with gains of over 20 percent in both investment banking and bond trading. REVENUES NOT SEEN COMING BACK Structural changes to the equities business over the last several years, such as the rise of electronic trading, have knocked off around $15 billion from the equities fee pool, according to a report from Morgan Stanley and management consulting firm Oliver Wyman. Electronic trading has dramatically increased trading volumes, while making the cost of trading much cheaper. Oliver Wyman partner Christian Edelmann, who co-authored the report, does not see those revenues coming back. "Once the equities model has become technology driven, that's not going to change," he said. Other factors are expected to strain the equities business further. Asset managers including BlackRock, which last week also said it would cut jobs and fees in its active equities business, are under enormous pressure due to weak returns and competition from low-cost options like index funds. The fee squeeze is making firms more selective about how they spend research dollars. At the same time, the long-running practice of paying for research through trading commissions is being upended by new regulations in Europe, known as the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Part of the overhaul will force investors in the European Union to pay for research directly, meaning banks will be required to put price tags on their proprietary analysis. Global asset managers are expected to "unbundle" payments in other regions as well. Asset managers and hedge funds typically determine their research budgets through a process called broker votes in which portfolio managers rate the value of equity research analysts. The broker vote helps firms decide which research providers to keep and how to allocate their research dollars. Asset managers have gained leverage because they have an increasing variety of choices of trading venues and research providers, including independent firms unaffiliated with the big banks. And a push for high-value ideas has caused some to build up more research capabilities in-house. Banks are doing what they can to keep their research products relevant, such as employing more data scientists to support research from traditional stock analysts. Banks have already been trimming their research budgets. Spending on research at the top investment banks fell by just over half to $4 billion in 2016 from $8.2 billion in 2008, according to Frost Consulting. BlackRock has managed to keep its funds' spending on commissions for research under control. Spending on commissions by its $21 billion Equity Dividend Fund <MRDVX.O> increased by 39 percent from the 2014 to 2016 fiscal years, but the fund's transaction activity more than doubled, meaning that its commission rate overall decreased considerably. The commission rate paid for research by BlackRock's nearly $15 billion Multi-Asset Income Fund <BKMIX.O> also fell over the 2014 to 2016 fiscal years, plunging by nearly 41 percent. One of BlackRock's five largest funds has not yet disclosed 2016 data, while another does not direct trades to brokerages in exchange for research. The funds use the brokerage services of major banks such as Bank of America Corp <BAC.N>, Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N> and JPMorgan.

By Linda Burns Published in Commercial Real Estate April 4, 2017 3:44 pm In my corporate site location work, I continue to see evidence of labor shortages and strong competition for workers within several industries where Texas has historically excelled.  Specifically in healthcare, information technology, finance, aerospace manufacturing, electronics and components manufacturing. The gap for high demand middle-skill workers in these industries was substantiated in JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s 2015 skills gap report, New Skills at Work, on global workforce readiness of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro. According to an analysis by the Manufacturing Institute, a non-profit advocacy group affiliated with the National Association of Manufacturers and Deloitte, 2 million U.S. manufacturing jobs will remain unfilled over the next decade due to a shortage of trained workers. The millennial generation, born between the late 1970’s and early 1990’s, is now the largest generation in the workplace and will represent nearly 75 percent by 2030, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Yet even with this level of representation, the unemployment rate for those ages 18 to 29 was 12.8 percent per the U.S. Department of Labor’s 2016 September report. The BLS said two-thirds of the high school graduates who enrolled in higher education in 2015, opted for four-year degrees versus community college or vocational tech schools. Four-year university degrees are still seen as the more viable path to higher paying jobs. The 12.8 percent unemployment rate was adjusted for those young people who have given up looking for work and moved back home with their parents due to unemployment or under-employment. As mentioned in a Forbes article, older generations remaining in the workplace longer due to economic needs, has meant younger workers are less likely to be promoted into roles held by incumbent workers. Millennials do not see a viable path to employment with one company as earlier generations have experienced. Baby boomers had limited experience, too, due to the economic downturns.  Having raised two millennials, I agree that we are responsible for the attitudes and mindsets from this generation growing up in a more abundant lifestyle with all those trophies and iconic gummy bears candy received for their just showing up at sport or talent competitions. Per another Forbes write-up, “They don’t need trophies but they want reinforcement.” In “All about Bob(bie): Strategies for Winning With your Employees”, and a follow up article, I gained some more insight into this younger generation.  Employers need to set clear expectations of opportunities for millennials to move up and make more money.  They work well in teams, a trend used in their undergraduate education, want real time feedback on their performance, and prefer a “coach” to a “boss.”  Because they grew up playing video and computer games and that’s how they also learned in school, “gamification” is an effective approach when it comes to training millennials.  Gamification involves any tool or software platform used for applying game mechanics to non-game contexts in order to boost engagement, motivate employees, and facilitate learning/training for successful end-results. While working a multi-state search for an international high-tech manufacturer to locate a plant this past year, I had the opportunity to learn more about another iconic German tradition, their globally recognized apprenticeship system model—now also being used in the United States.  Apprenticeships are a form of paid worker training that can lead to a nationally recognized credential for employment. In Germany, about half of the high school graduates opt for apprenticeships rather than college degrees because of the potential of almost certain employment at the respective company when completed.  Siemens was one of the first companies to utilize an apprenticeship program in the U.S. in a Charlotte factory, modeled after the German system. The company partnered with a local community college to offer vocational courses in combination with on-the-job training.  As a response to Kansas City employers needing access to an adequately trained workforce, the Midwest Center for Robotics and Automation Apprenticeship Program was established.  This program is a hybrid of the original German system, offering both online and in-the-lab training. Apprentices can learn skills required in advanced manufacturing and graduate with an associate’s degree combining disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and math.  The U.S. Department of Labor estimated that 87 percent of apprentices in the U.S. are employed after completing their training programs, earning an average of $50,000 annually or higher.   In many apprenticeship programs, apprentices can earn college credit for their coursework and on-the-job training. This credit can lead to an associate’s degree and, depending on the industry, may also contribute to a bachelor’s or master’s degree Although most of the apprenticeships in the U.S. are in skilled trades, like the construction or automobile industries, the concept is applicable to other occupations.  Medical doctors essentially participate in an apprenticeship structure through their internships and residencies for on-the-job training, combined with classroom learning. Expanding apprenticeships to other industries and marketing these opportunities to both unemployed and under-employed millennials could make a real difference in reducing unemployment.  Recruitment should be more reflective of the practice in Germany where a student decides on an apprenticeship in high school.   More apprenticeship initiatives are needed in Texas—both at the community college level and among employers.  An apprenticeship provides a young worker with an immediate job during training and an opening to sustainable long-term employment. A four-year degree is not the answer for everyone, as evidenced by the high unemployment rate. The German apprenticeship concept fits with how Millennials learn in terms of preference for a coach or mentorship type relationship, real time feedback, hands-on learning, opportunity for challenging work, experience with the internet, and clearly stated goals and due dates for earning certifications and degrees.  Employers should also factor in their desire for work-life balance by basing their performance evaluation on output rather than amount of time spent on a project to improve employee retention.  The average millennial changes jobs about every two years. Now back to those iconic German gummy bears—the gelatin-based candy.  There seems to still be some comfort derived from their consumption by millennials as evidenced by the German manufacturer Haribo’s TV commercial, where millennial executives are enjoying the candy in a boardroom.  (You can catch it on YouTube, too.)  For a daily fix, vitamin companies like Nature Made have adult gummy vitamins now, too. So, in closing, could training programs like Germany’s apprenticeship model help to reduce millennial unemployment and fill the high-demand skills gap? Based on my experience, first as an educator and science museum director while in graduate school at SMU, later as an economic development marketer and recruiter, and now as a corporate site location consultant, I strongly believe they play a critical role in skills training.  And, since no “participation trophies” are needed, perhaps gummy bears in the vending machines for rewards should be considered.

By: AFP | New York | Published: April 5, 2017 2:23 AM The odds of a breakup of the European Union have increased after Brexit, an outcome that could have “devastating” economic and political effects, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive said today. (Reuters) The odds of a breakup of the European Union have increased after Brexit, an outcome that could have “devastating” economic and political effects, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive said today. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon, in an annual letter to shareholders, said he had hoped Britain’s decision last year to exit the EU would have led the bloc to focus on “fixing its issues,” such as immigration and rigid labor rules. “Our fear, however, is that it could instead result in political unrest that would force the EU to split apart,” Dimon said. “The unraveling of the EU and the monetary union could have devastating economic and political effects. While we are not predicting this will happen, the probabilities have certainly gone up — and we will keep a close eye on the situation in Europe over the next several years.” Regarding Brexit itself, Dimon expressed confidence the bank would be able to meet all its European’ clients needs once Britain exits the EU following negotiations expected to take two years. The bank doesn’t foresee shifting much staff from Britain over the next two years, but “we do suspect that following Brexit, there will be constant pressure by the EU not to ‘outsource’ services to the United Kingdom but to continue to move people and capabilities into EU subsidiaries,” Dimon said. Dimon, who is chair of the Washington lobby group the Business Roundtable and sits on a CEO advisory board to President Donald Trump, also expressed support for international trade in the wake of criticism by Trump and others of major trade agreements. Also Watch: Dimon called Mexico, a leading Trump target, a “long-standing peaceful neighbor” whose interests are intertwined with those of the United States. “Our trade agreement with Mexico helps ensure that the young democracy in Mexico is not hijacked by populist and anti-American leaders (like Chavez in Venezuela),” Dimon said. “While there are some clear identifiable problems with NAFTA, I believe they will be worked out in a way that is fair and beneficial to both sides.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

Lynch | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, the attorney at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission who oversees the unit that polices foreign bribery laws, plans to depart the SEC later this month, the regulator announced Tuesday. Brockmeyer, a 17-year veteran of the SEC, has led the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) unit since 2011. The unit was one of five specialty areas created in 2010 in an effort to bolster the SEC's enforcement program following revelations over the agency's repeated failures to detect Bernard Madoff's massive Ponzi scheme. Brockmeyer oversaw a wide array of FCPA cases, including charges against hedge fund Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC and its chief executive Daniel Och over bribery in Africa, charges against JPMorgan Chase & Co following the so-called "princeling" investigation into hiring practices in China in order to win business and charges against Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer SA over bribes paid in a variety of countries. The SEC said that after Brockmeyer departs, the unit's current deputy chief Charles Cain will serve as acting chief until a permanent replacement is named. The SEC's enforcement of the FCPA is an area that is being actively watched by the defense bar, after President Donald Trump previously made disparaging remarks about the law and called for it to be changed. Trump's pick to lead the SEC, Wall Street attorney Jay Clayton, also previously chaired a committee at the New York City Bar Association which drafted a paper that was somewhat critical of how the law was being enforced. Clayton, whose nomination was approved by the Senate Banking Committee earlier on Tuesday, is still awaiting confirmation by the full Senate. Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee have previously raised concerns about whether he will actively pursue FCPA cases. In written responses to questions from the panel's top Democrat Sherrod Brown following his confirmation hearing, Clayton said he believes the law can be a "powerful and effective means" to combating corruption. He added, however, that it is more effective when international authorities are also willing to coordinate and take enforcement actions against bribery, as opposed to having the United States go at it alone.

Posted 05 Apr 2017 03:50 A man walks next to a BlackRock sign pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York, October 11, 2015. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz - RTS415V Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: BlackRock Inc , the world's biggest asset manager, slashed the amount it paid out in commissions to Wall Street firms for research by more than half for its largest mutual fund over the last two years, according to filings. The cuts show the immense power large asset managers have to curb fees they pay banks and the diminishing role of sell-side research at a time when Wall Street firms are facing a slump in stock trading commissions. BlackRock's US$40 billion Global Allocation Fund paid out US$13.4 million in commissions in the 2016 fiscal year for trades tied to research, compared with US$28.8 million two years earlier. The commissions fell even though the BlackRock fund routed roughly the same level of transactions to brokerages in exchange for access to their research notes and other related services. The same pattern is true for other big BlackRock funds, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings from three of BlackRock's five largest funds. Some of those funds paid out more in total commissions, but trading activity in those funds increased to a greater degree, meaning that the actual commission rate fell. A BlackRock spokeswoman declined to comment. In announcing an overhaul of its actively managed equities business last week, BlackRock said it was "harnessing the power of 'human and machine,'" relying more on computers and data-mining to pick stocks. Equities revenue, which includes executing stock trades and buying and selling derivatives related to stocks, is slumping across Wall Street. In 2016, equities revenue across the world's biggest banks declined 13 percent, to the lowest level since 2012, according to research provider Coalition. The outlook is not expected to improve. For the first quarter of 2017, JPMorgan Chase & Co predicts equities revenue across the industry fell 3 percent year-over-year, compared with gains of over 20 percent in both investment banking and bond trading. REVENUES NOT SEEN COMING BACK Structural changes to the equities business over the last several years, such as the rise of electronic trading, have knocked off around US$15 billion from the equities fee pool, according to a report from Morgan Stanley and management consulting firm Oliver Wyman. Electronic trading has dramatically increased trading volumes, while making the cost of trading much cheaper. Oliver Wyman partner Christian Edelmann, who co-authored the report, does not see those revenues coming back. "Once the equities model has become technology driven, that's not going to change," he said. Other factors are expected to strain the equities business further. Asset managers including BlackRock, which last week also said it would cut jobs and fees in its active equities business, are under enormous pressure due to weak returns and competition from low-cost options like index funds. The fee squeeze is making firms more selective about how they spend research dollars. At the same time, the long-running practice of paying for research through trading commissions is being upended by new regulations in Europe, known as the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Part of the overhaul will force investors in the European Union to pay for research directly, meaning banks will be required to put price tags on their proprietary analysis. Global asset managers are expected to "unbundle" payments in other regions as well. Asset managers and hedge funds typically determine their research budgets through a process called broker votes in which portfolio managers rate the value of equity research analysts. The broker vote helps firms decide which research providers to keep and how to allocate their research dollars. Asset managers have gained leverage because they have an increasing variety of choices of trading venues and research providers, including independent firms unaffiliated with the big banks. And a push for high-value ideas has caused some to build up more research capabilities in-house. Banks are doing what they can to keep their research products relevant, such as employing more data scientists to support research from traditional stock analysts. Banks have already been trimming their research budgets. Spending on research at the top investment banks fell by just over half to US$4 billion in 2016 from US$8.2 billion in 2008, according to Frost Consulting. BlackRock has managed to keep its funds' spending on commissions for research under control. Spending on commissions by its US$21 billion Equity Dividend Fund increased by 39 percent from the 2014 to 2016 fiscal years, but the fund's transaction activity more than doubled, meaning that its commission rate overall decreased considerably. The commission rate paid for research by BlackRock's nearly US$15 billion Multi-Asset Income Fund also fell over the 2014 to 2016 fiscal years, plunging by nearly 41 percent. One of BlackRock's five largest funds has not yet disclosed 2016 data, while another does not direct trades to brokerages in exchange for research. The funds use the brokerage services of major banks such as Bank of America Corp , Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan. The filings does not identify which of the banks provide research to BlackRock.

"Our fear, however, is that it could instead result in political unrest that would force the EU to split apart," Dimon said. "The unraveling of the EU and the monetary union could have devastating economic and political effects. While we are not predicting this will happen, the probabilities have certainly gone up -- and we will keep a close eye on the situation in Europe over the next several years." Regarding Brexit itself, Dimon expressed confidence the bank would be able to meet all its European' clients needs once Britain exits the EU following negotiations expected to take two years. The bank doesn't foresee shifting much staff from Britain over the next two years, but "we do suspect that following Brexit, there will be constant pressure by the EU not to 'outsource' services to the United Kingdom but to continue to move people and capabilities into EU subsidiaries," Dimon said. Dimon, who is chair of the Washington lobby group the Business Roundtable and sits on a CEO advisory board to President Donald Trump, also expressed support for international trade in the wake of criticism by Trump and others of major trade agreements. Dimon called Mexico, a leading Trump target, a "long-standing peaceful neighbor" whose interests are intertwined with those of the United States. "Our trade agreement with Mexico helps ensure that the young democracy in Mexico is not hijacked by populist and anti-American leaders (like Chavez in Venezuela)," Dimon said. "While there are some clear identifiable problems with NAFTA, I believe they will be worked out in a way that is fair and beneficial to both sides."  O P E N Professional Courses Sponsored link Technology Courses Sponsored link Latest Suicide blast in Lahore kills six, including census workers Jishnu Prannoy's mother arrested in front of Kerala police headquarters Toll in suspected Syria chemical attack rises to 72 YouTube unveils India app for spotty mobile signals India, Pakistan exchange fire in Jammu SP leader Shivpal Yadav to meet CM Adityanath today British Chancellor on two-day visit to India starting today It is partial relief for farmers: Rahul on UP loan waiver Gallery Samatha Divas: Birth anniversary of Babu Jagjivan Ram Suspected chemical attack in Syria that killed over 58 arrow Videos North Korea launches missile ahead of US-China talks Syria 'gas attack' kills at least 58 in rebel-held town arrow FOLLOW US Copyrights New Indian Express.2017 Dinamani | Kannada Prabha | Samakalika Malayalam | Malayalam Vaarika | Indulgexpress | Edex Live Contact Us | About Us | Careers | Privacy Policy | Search | Terms of Use | Advertise With Us Home | Nation | World | Cities | Business | Columns | Entertainment | Sport | Magazine | The Sunday Standard

Some of those funds paid out more in total commissions, but trading activity in those funds increased to a greater degree, meaning that the actual commission rate fell. A BlackRock spokeswoman declined to comment. In announcing an overhaul of its actively managed equities business last week, BlackRock said it was "harnessing the power of 'human and machine,'" relying more on computers and data-mining to pick stocks. Equities revenue, which includes executing stock trades and buying and selling derivatives related to stocks, is slumping across Wall Street. In 2016, equities revenue across the world's biggest banks declined 13 percent, to the lowest level since 2012, according to research provider Coalition. The outlook is not expected to improve. For the first quarter of 2017, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) predicts equities revenue across the industry fell 3 percent year-over-year, compared with gains of over 20 percent in both investment banking and bond trading. REVENUES NOT SEEN COMING BACK Structural changes to the equities business over the last several years, such as the rise of electronic trading, have knocked off around $15 billion from the equities fee pool, according to a report from Morgan Stanley and management consulting firm Oliver Wyman. Electronic trading has dramatically increased trading volumes, while making the cost of trading much cheaper. Oliver Wyman partner Christian Edelmann, who co-authored the report, does not see those revenues coming back. "Once the equities model has become technology driven, that's not going to change," he said. Other factors are expected to strain the equities business further. Asset managers including BlackRock, which last week also said it would cut jobs and fees in its active equities business, are under enormous pressure due to weak returns and competition from low-cost options like index funds. The fee squeeze is making firms more selective about how they spend research dollars. At the same time, the long-running practice of paying for research through trading commissions is being upended by new regulations in Europe, known as the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Part of the overhaul will force investors in the European Union to pay for research directly, meaning banks will be required to put price tags on their proprietary analysis. Global asset managers are expected to "unbundle" payments in other regions as well. Asset managers and hedge funds typically determine their research budgets through a process called broker votes in which portfolio managers rate the value of equity research analysts. The broker vote helps firms decide which research providers to keep and how to allocate their research dollars. Asset managers have gained leverage because they have an increasing variety of choices of trading venues and research providers, including independent firms unaffiliated with the big banks. And a push for high-value ideas has caused some to build up more research capabilities in-house. Banks are doing what they can to keep their research products relevant, such as employing more data scientists to support research from traditional stock analysts. Banks have already been trimming their research budgets. Spending on research at the top investment banks fell by just over half to $4 billion in 2016 from $8.2 billion in 2008, according to Frost Consulting. BlackRock has managed to keep its funds' spending on commissions for research under control. Spending on commissions by its $21 billion Equity Dividend Fund (MRDVX.O) increased by 39 percent from the 2014 to 2016 fiscal years, but the fund's transaction activity more than doubled, meaning that its commission rate overall decreased considerably. The commission rate paid for research by BlackRock's nearly $15 billion Multi-Asset Income Fund (BKMIX.O) also fell over the 2014 to 2016 fiscal years, plunging by nearly 41 percent. One of BlackRock's five largest funds has not yet disclosed 2016 data, while another does not direct trades to brokerages in exchange for research. The funds use the brokerage services of major banks such as Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and JPMorgan. The filings does not identify which of the banks provide research to BlackRock.

The brokerage currently has a $5.25 target price on the stock. Zacks Investment Research’s price target indicates a potential upside of 10.53% from the stock’s previous close. According to Zacks, “Accuray reported wider loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily due to declining gross orders. Also over the past one year, Accuray underperformed the broader industry with respect to price performance. Of the recent developments, strong data showcasing the clinical efficacy of the CyberKnife System at the annual ASTRO Conference, several orders for the newly unveiled Radixact System and solid revenue performance in Japan are the key positives in our view. The company also witnessed strong demand for the TomoTherapy platform, which boosted the company’s growth trajectory. We believe a broad product portfolio, growing customer base, stringent cost control and international expansions will drive growth. However, a drag in the gross orders, unfavorable product mix, declining product revenues, sluggish macro economic conditions and pricing headwinds are major concerns.” Other analysts have also recently issued research reports about the stock. Aegis restated a “buy” rating on shares of Accuray in a research report on Tuesday, March 21st. BTIG Research restated a “hold” rating on shares of Accuray in a research report on Sunday, February 5th. Finally, JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut shares of Accuray from an “overweight” rating to a “neutral” rating and lowered their price objective for the company from $8.00 to $6.00 in a research report on Wednesday, December 14th.

According to Zacks, “ExxonMobil recently entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Eni to acquire 25% indirect interest in the natural gas-rich Area 4 block, off the coast of Mozambique. We believe that ExxonMobil’s strong financial strength along with industry-leading project execution skills will help it capitalize on the development’s strong prospects and likely create long-term economic value for shareholders. We also appreciate ExxonMobil’s ongoing investments in new refining and chemical manufacturing facilities along the U.S. Gulf Coast to enhance manufacturing and exporting capacity.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 12:40 AM, April 5, 2017 Updated: 2:20 AM, April 5, 2017 NEW YORK - JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> Chief Executive Jamie Dimon devoted one-third of his annual shareholder letter to arguments for changing regulations, particularly those on bank capital and liquidity, as well as home mortgage loan financing. Current regulations are inconsistent and have left banks with "too much capital," some of which could be used to "finance the economy without sacrificing safety," Dimon said in the 17,349-word letter released on Tuesday. He also warned that anti-trade policies could be disruptive and geopolitical risks are in a "heightened state." Dimon, 61, has entered his twelfth year as CEO. He considers the annual letter to be among his most important public statements about JPMorgan, as well as public policy. It is widely read because the bank is one of the most profitable and came out of the financial crisis stronger than competitors. This year, Dimon argued that the idea of banks being "too big to fail" and therefore requiring bailouts during times of stress, is a problem that "has been solved." He said "taxpayers will not pay if a bank fails" because of measures enacted since the crisis nearly a decade ago. Dimon's comments on bank regulation come at a time of possible flux in rules and laws under a new White House and Congress. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve governor who has been overseeing regulation, including bank capital stress tests, is leaving his post on Wednesday and a replacement has yet to be proposed by President Donald Trump. The way the Fed conducts stress tests should be clearer and more consistent, Dimon said. He also said home mortgage rules imposed since the crisis have raised costs for consumers and made it less likely that those with weak credit histories will get loans. "While some of the rules are beneficial, many were hastily developed," he wrote. Dimon said the geopolitical risk environment is in a "heightened state" with the United Kingdom's pending withdrawal from the European Union and a growing anti-globalization sentiment. He said he hopes Britain's exit will prompt the EU to fix issues it has with immigration, bureaucracy and restrictive labor laws. "Our fear, however, is that it could instead result in political unrest that would force the EU to split apart," which, he wrote, "could have devastating economic and political effects." Dimon also warned that "poorly conceived" trade policies could be very disruptive, especially with regard to two key trading partners, Mexico and China.

Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of the Wall Street giant, said that the bank will need to obtain licences and permissions to operate across the EU, but that it can still service European clients from the UK. “This does not entail moving many people in the next two years,” he said in a letter to the US investment bank’s shareholders. This contrasts starkly with his previous warning last June - given in a speech alongside George Osborne in JP Morgan's offices in Bournemouth just weeks before the referendum - that thousands of its 16,000 UK jobs could be moved. Rather than seeing Britain as a basket case for leaving the EU, Mr Dimon now fears that if the EU fails to address its own problems then the union could break up, with much more serious economic consequences. Last June, George Osborne and Jamie Dimon warned JP Morgan staff in Bournemouth that Brexit could force the bank to move thousands of staff abroad Credit: DYLAN MARTINEZ/Reuters “Regarding Brexit, a key concern is to make sure our company is prepared to support our clients on day one – the first day after the actual Brexit occurs, approximately two years from now,” Mr Dimon said. “We are confident we will be able to develop and expand the capabilities that our EU subsidiaries and branches will need to serve our clients properly in Europe under EU law. This will require acquiring regulatory approvals, transferring certain technologies and moving some people.” He said the bank is now preparing for “a hard exit by the United Kingdom – it would be irresponsible to presume otherwise.” “While this does not entail moving many people in the next two years, we do suspect that following Brexit, there will be constant pressure by the EU not to ‘outsource’ services to the United Kingdom but to continue to move people and capabilities into EU subsidiaries.” In another very small move insurance market Lloyd's of London last week said it would move "tens of jobs" to Brussels to set up a new EU hub Credit: BEN STANSALL/AFP It is not the first time Mr Dimon has cast doubt on the prospect of moving staff to other EU nations - in January he reportedly said France was an unappealing destination due to its tough employment rules. JP Morgan is a major employer in London, with offices in the City and Canary Wharf, as well as Bournemouth in Dorset, where it is the largest private sector employer. Brexit does not only affect the UK, but the wider EU as well and he hopes that Brussels will use this as a chance to reform itself - but fears it will fail to do so. “We hope that the advent of Brexit would lead the EU to focus on fixing its issues – immigration, bureaucracy, the ongoing loss of sovereign rights and labor inflexibility – and thereby pulling the EU and the monetary union closer together,” Mr Dimon said. “Our fear, however, is that it could instead result in political unrest that would force the EU to split apart. The unraveling of the EU and the monetary union could have devastating economic and political effects. "While we are not predicting this will happen, the probabilities have certainly gone up – and we will keep a close eye on the situation in Europe over the next several years.” Last week the iconic insurance market Lloyd's of London said it would move "tens of jobs" to Brussels to set up its new EU hub to provide access to those markets post-Brexit.

The company intends to price its 7.5 million shares in the range of $19 to $21 per share, with an overallotment option for an additional 1.125 million shares. At the maximum price, the entire offering is valued up to $181.125 million. The company has been authorized to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CADE. The underwriters for the offering are Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Sandler O’Neill, Keefe Bruyette & Woods, Baird, Raymond James, Stephens, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey and Tudor Pickering Holt. This is a bank holding company and a Delaware corporation headquartered in Houston, Texas, and is the parent company of Cadence Bank, N.A. Formed in 2009 by banking industry veterans, Cadence secured $1.0 billion of capital commitments in 2010 and built its franchise on the heels of three successful acquisitions: Cadence Bank, N.A., in March 2011; the franchise of Superior Bank in April 2011; and Encore Bank, N.A., in July 2012. Currently Cadence is a growth-oriented, middle-market focused commercial relationship bank providing a broad range of banking and wealth management services to businesses, high net worth individuals, business owners and retail customers through a network of 66 branches, as of December 31, 2016, with branches in Alabama (25), Florida (14), Texas (12), Mississippi (11) and Tennessee (four). At the end of 2016, the company had $9.5 billion of assets, $7.4 billion of gross loans, $8.0 billion in deposits and $1.1 billion in shareholder’s equity. It generated $65.8 million and $39.3 million of net income for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Cadence intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to support its organic growth and for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of debt, maintenance of required regulatory capital and potential future acquisition opportunities, although the firm made no specific indications.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio BLink Editorial Columns Letters Books Blogs SBI, a synonym for resurgent India S Adikesavan comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet That floating feeling: On a merger high - Photo: K K Mustafah Among the world’s top 50 banks post merger, it will continue to meet varied domestic needs, while being globally competitive Effective last weekend, State Bank of India, the country’s banking icon, has begun a new journey after merging five of its associate banks and the Bharatiya Mahila Bank with itself, reiterating its position in our banking landscape as numero uno with a solid 23 per cent market share, both in deposits and advances. While its entry into the world’s top 50 banks is already known, what is equally noteworthy is that now SBI becomes arguably the bank with the highest market share in any major economy. This makes SBI matchless within even this top-50 club.Matchless position Just a few comparisons should provide the base for this hypothesis. While the world’s topmost bank by assets, the Industrial Credit Banking Corporation of China (ICBC), has a market share of 17 per cent in China, JP Morgan Chase, another global leader, has only a 14 per cent share in the US. Neither BNP Paribas of France nor Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Japan, both figuring in the top 10 global banks, has a market share in their respective countries close to SBI’s, covering both deposits and loans. In a league of its own now, SBI becomes even more emblematic of the resilence and growing maturity of the Indian economy — in financial terms, it is a proxy for a sovereign. India also happens to be the fastest growing major economy in the world. Quite strikingly, in terms of client base, it can be said that if SBI’s customers were a country, they would be the third most populous nation at 50 crore, ahead of the US! What does the merger mean for the medium-term, and the long-term prospects of this institution which traces its origin to 1806 when the Bank of Calcutta was formed? With a multinational presence, it is now unique among Indian public sector entities for an uninterrupted track record of profitability coupled with a deep-rooted commitment to social uplift.Industry powerhouse Over the past several decades it has been able to attract the brightest and the best and has functioned as a powerhouse for the industry as a whole. In the first wave of new bank licensing which India witnessed in the nineties, the erstwhile UTI Bank (now Axis Bank), Indusind Bank and ICICI Bank were all headed by former SBI bankers such as Supriyo Gupta, Solomon Raj and N Vaghul, respectively. The talk then was that the competition was between people who are in SBI and those who were in SBI. The only exception was HDFC Bank. While earlier too, betting on SBI was analogous to betting on India, the odds would favour this bet even more now. If India is to grow, it will do so with SBI and if SBI is to flourish, it will do so with India. Never before has a nation and one of its financial market players become so inextricably intertwined that speaking of one’s prospects is tantamount to talking about the other. In that sense, there is a heavier responsibility on Team SBI. The bank has always offered services that cover a range of clients, spanning the smallest borrower to the biggest corporate. It has bridged and narrowed the gap between the last man out there in the hinterland of India, and the wealthiest of them, in the metros. The challenge now will be to scale up this role, be all things to all domestically, and yet retain a global competitive edge. This will truly yoke SBI’s future more firmly to our nation’s economic advancement. The merger can exploit the niche-market strengths of its five associates to propel further the pole-position of the mother brand, by enmeshing the micro-potency of the former with the macro-stature of the latter, topping up efficiencies. Nurturing role Among the merged banks is also State Bank of Mysore, the smallest public sector bank. I remember a conversation in 2012 with R Chellappan, now the CEO of Swelet Energy Systems (formerly Numeric Power Systems), who sold his 26-year-old company to French major Legrande for ₹829 crore then. Born into an ordinary Salem family, Chellappan recalled his ₹25,000 loan from SBM in 1986 when he made the first UPS all by himself. “SBM helped me reach up to the Legrand deal,” he had said. Chellappan is one among many nurtured by the associates to reach heights they had never dreamt of. Through this merger, customer connects for SBI will both deepen and widen. SBI was a resilient structure of nearly 17,000-odd branches which are tightly-controlled with strong systems and procedures. That network has now becomes close to 24,000. Perhaps there is no better integrator of people and cultures than SBI in India’s contemporary body-politic which has kept us ticking as a nation.Good leadership Well endowed in human resources, it has seen a string of outstanding leaders, not least among whom was the legendary Raj Kumar Talwar, who spoke truth to power in extraordinary circumstances during the Emergency in 1975. He paid the price for the sake of institutional and personal integrity at a rather tender age for a chairman. When he was forced out of office at 54 he had been at the helm for seven years. Latter-day SBI has also had an array of chairpersons with the trend-setting OP Bhatt, the meticulous Pratip Choudhary, and the first woman to head the bank, widely acknowledged as a clear thinker and lucid communicator, Arundhati Bhattacharya. It has a durable and diverse second line of leadership as well. The historic change comes at a time when a Prime Minister whose passion for “param vaibhavam” (greatest glory) for India has only been matched by his dedication to “antyodaya” (uplift of the last-mile man). A bigger bank with dispersion in vertical terms financially and horizontal terms geographically, should become the engine for our great nation’s march forward.

By: Bloomberg | Published: April 4, 2017 8:12 PM   S&P now rates South Africa’s foreign-currency debt BB+, one level below investment grade, with a negative outlook.(Reuters) South Africa’s investment-grade credit status hangs by a thread after S&P Global Ratings cut the country’s debt to junk and Moody’s Investors Service placed it on review for a downgrade. The state of play S&P now rates South Africa’s foreign-currency debt BB+, one level below investment grade, with a negative outlook. Fitch Ratings and Moody’s assess the nation’s creditworthiness at BBB- and Baa2, one and two levels above sub-investment, respectively. Both have a negative outlook, meaning they’re more likely to lower than raise the credit score. At the same time, S&P reduced its rating for the nation’s local debt one step to BBB-, the lowest investment grade. Moody’s rates the local-currency debt at Baa2, two levels above junk, while Fitch’s assessment is BBB-, one rung above junk. What happens next? A one-step downgrade of the foreign-currency debt by Moody’s wouldn’t change the picture substantially, as South Africa would still be left with two investment-level ratings. A two-notch downgrade by Moody’s or a cut by Fitch would spark forced selling of foreign-currency bonds by investors that track investment-grade debt indexes. On the local-currency front, it would require a one-step downgrade by Fitch and a two-notch cut by Moody’s, or another by S&P, to trigger forced selling from local-currency bond-index tracker funds. There is less danger of that happening immediately. Why does it matter? Bond indexes compiled by Bloomberg Barclays, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., which are tracked by more than $2 trillion of institutional funds, have rules relating to the credit quality of constituents. Broadly speaking, those rules require an investment-grade rating, either from S&P (in the case of Citigroup’s World Government Bond Index) or from two of the three companies (in the case of the Bloomberg Barclays and JPMorgan emerging-market indexes). Hard-currency indexes, such as the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index and JP Morgan’s EMBIG gauges, look at the long-term foreign-currency ratings, while local-currency indexes like the WGBI focus on the local-currency rating. Should South Africa lose its membership of these indexes, funds that track them would be forced to sell their holdings of South African bonds. In addition, funds that are mandated to hold investment-grade debt only would be forced to sell. What’s at stake? Foreign investors hold 36 percent of South Africa’s 1.74 trillion rand ($129 billion) of local-currency government bonds, according to the National Treasury’s February budget review. That means an amount of 623 billion rand is potentially at risk in a selloff, in addition to about $16 billion of debt denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign-currency bonds account for about 10 percent of South Africa’s total government debt of 2.2 trillion rand. In practice, the amounts will probably be less. UBS Ltd. estimates that WGBI-tracking funds account for about 22 percent of non-resident bond holdings, or about $10 billion of South African local-currency debt, roughly the same amount as the current-account deficit. A forced sell-off by funds tracking the gauge could double the shortfall in nominal terms. What are the precedents? Turkish and Brazilian bonds fell after they were first downgraded to junk, in September 2016 and September 2015, respectively. Turkish local government debt lost 5.1 percent in the month after the nation was cut to Ba1 by Moody’s, the worst performance among 31 emerging markets monitored by Bloomberg. Its Eurobonds lost 2.4 percent, more than three times the average for developing-nation dollar notes in that period. Brazilian real-denominated government bonds dropped 0.73 percent in the four weeks after S&P moved it to BB+, while emerging-market local government bonds gained 2.7 percent on average. By contrast, Russia’s assets outperformed after it was first cut to junk by S&P in January 2015. The country’s local debt and Eurobonds gained in the following month, while those of its emerging-market peers fell. Please Wait while comments are loading...

We are now a full 100 trading days since that night in November, pretty evenly split with 49 trading days through the inauguration and another 50 since then. When it comes to the major companies in the Dow 30, and the 11 broad-based sectors of the stock market, there's been little consistency in how they performed in the two time periods. As a whole, there's been less enthusiasm in the second portion of the "Trump bump" than before the president actually took office. Start with stocks in the Dow 30. Between election night and the inauguration, the three best-performing stocks were Goldman Sachs (up 28 percent), JPMorgan Chase (up 20 percent), and Disney (up 15 percent). Since Inauguration Day however, those same stocks have been outpaced in a big way. The top three stocks since Jan. 20 represent a very different theme: Apple (up 20 percent), Boeing and Cisco (both up nearly 12 percent). Apple's upward trajectory was boosted by better-than-expected earnings reported in January. Next consider the 11 sector-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs): There's been a complete reversal between leaders and laggards. Between election night and the inauguration, the financial sector led the way, up 16 percent in just a few weeks. Since the inauguration however, financials are only up 3 percent. In many cases, it appears to be just a perfect flip-flop. Notice in the chart above that the top five sectors before the inauguration (financials, industrials, materials, energy and telecommunications) all fell to nearly the bottom five after the inauguration. The performance data suggests a mismatch between election night expectations and political realities. The companies and sectors that saw initial boosts have not been able to replicate them for the most part.

Bloomberg News reports that U.S. federal prosecutors are discussing ways for three U.K.-based traders to avoid an extensive extradition process and come to the U.S. voluntarily for trial, according to people familiar with the talks. At least two are considering it, two people said. The people said the prosecutors have been talking with lawyers for former JPMorgan Chase trader Richard Usher, ex-Citigroup Inc. trader Rohan Ramchandani and Chris Ashton, formerly of Barclays, who were charged in January with conspiring to rig exchange markets through discussions in an electronic chat room known as The Cartel. They released statements at the time declaring their innocence. The alternative to facing the U.S. charges is spending months or years trapped in the U.K. fighting extradition. That can be a costly battle for defendants, who may need the money to mount a defense if they are ultimately handed over to the U.S., as has happened in similar cases.

By Ben White and Aubree Eliza Weaver 04/04/17 08:00 AM EDT GOING BIPARTISAN ON TAX REFORM? — One argument currently making the rounds in Washington and New York is that the Trump administration could avoid its health care nightmare by end-running the Freedom Caucus and putting together a corporate tax reform package that would appeal to a significant number of Democrats. This wouldn’t be easy. Democrats are not generally in the mood to do deals with President Trump. And many Republicans are also deeply skeptical of this approach and the results it could yield. But Trump desperately wants a big win and has given signals that he’s willing to deal with Democrats. Story Continued Below Obama White House CEA Chair Jason Furman laid out a roadmap to a bipartisan tax and infrastructure deal in this WSJ op-ed. The gist: Focus on corporate tax only; make it revenue neutral; adopt a minimum tax on overseas income; switch domestic taxes to cash flow from profits and drop the top rate; do public infrastructure. There would be big gaps to bridge on getting to revenue neutrality (or even caring about it) and how low the rate should be. But many Democrats want to get the U.S. rate more competitive and could be brought along with the infrastructure piece. MM spoke to Furman about his ideas: “This doesn’t have to be about ideology on the size of the government or the distribution of income but simply about devising a less stupid way to collect a given amount of taxes. There are many ways that are less stupid than what we do now … “Border adjustment is a clever idea and has lots of tax policy merit. But it has some problematic side effects that would be exacerbated by the way this administration would likely sell it as a protectionist measure. … “We are never going to compete on rates with Ireland or the Caymans but would could be on par with Japan, Germany the UK and other big countries and our business tax would have 100 percent expensing which is not something you get anywhere else in the world.” On appealing to Dems: “They have a high bar to overcome to create an atmosphere of trust where something can be done together. But if the White House can propose something that is within the zip code of sensible then I’d love to see Democrats go along and work on it. … “Certainly it can be a lot easier to add Democrats than to keep every single one of your Republican votes and it’s a way of legislating that’s more consistent with what he ran on.” DAILY UH OH — NBC's Lester Holt and Alexander Smith: "A senior North Korean defector has told NBC News that the country's desperate dictator is prepared to use nuclear weapons to strike the United States and its allies" More. TRUMP TWITTER FODDER — Via Bank of Tokyo’s Chris Rupkey: “The ISM manufacturing survey came off the boil in March with the index now 57.2 versus 57.7 in February, but who cares? Because a couple of the key sub-index components are heating up including inflation and jobs. “The employment index surged 4.7 points to 58.9 in March which bodes well for new manufacturing jobs in Friday's employment report … [M]anufacturing executives clearly like what they are hearing out of Washington and are putting more people to work … [M]aybe the President's jawboning means fewer factories are leaving because it looks like there is a renaissance for U.S. manufacturing” CRA PUSH BACK — Greg Baer, President of The Clearing House emails, “Claims included in Politico’s reporting yesterday that there is no precedent for the GAO to overturn regulatory guidance under the Congressional Review Act are incorrect. There is ample precedent for the GAO’s review and evaluation of guidance under the CRA. “For example, in September 2012, the GAO issued a letter in response to a request from Sen. Hatch and Rep. Camp finding that guidance issued by HHS was a rule for CRA purposes and not legally effective until properly submitted to Congress for review.” AMALGAMATED PUSH BACK — Per House Financial Services spokesman Jeff Emerson on the CEO of Amalgamated Bank praising Dodd-Frank: “Of course the CEO of an institution the New York Times called ‘the left’s private banker’ and said has a “political banking business” supports Dodd-Frank.” CORDRAY IS … STILL THERE — Compass Point’s Isaac Boltansky and Lukas Davaz: “With a decision in the PHH case review unlikely until next year, and the path for a legislative compromise on the Bureau’s governance structure becoming hazier by the day, all indications are that Director Cordray is likely to retain his seat at least through the year and possibly until it comes to term in July 2018. “President Trump could conceivably attempt to dismiss Director Cordray, but our sense is that the White House would prefer avoiding the associated political and procedural fallout” GOOD TUESDAY MORNING — One of the ugliest NCAA championship games MM can remember but congrats to the victorious North Carolina Tar Heels who won despite shooting just 36 percent from the field and 15 percent from three point land.

THIS MORNING ON POLITICO PRO FINANCIAL SERVICES — Patrick Temple-West on Jay Clayton’s meeting with Carl Icahn — and to get Morning Money every day before 6 a.m. — please contact Pro Services at (703) 341-4600 info@politicopro.com DRIVING THE DAY — President Trump this morning holds a CEO roundtable on “the American business climate” … Later in the morning, Trump will speak at the 2017 North America’s Building Trades Unions National Legislative Conference. Later in the day he meets with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin … House Financial Services has a hearing at 10:00 a.m. on the Fed … HFS subcommittee has a hearing at 2:00 p.m. on Iran sanctions … Senate Banking at 10:00 a.m. is expected to approve Jay Clayton’s nomination for SEC chair … Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan speaks at a Washington Post event at noon … JPMorganChase CEO speaks at a Yahoo Finance event at 2:00 p.m. … Outgoing Fed Governor Dan Tarullo gives a farewell address at 4:30 p.m. MORE ON CLAYTON’S MEETINGS — Via Bloomberg: “Jay Clayton … said he had ‘substantive’ communications with several wealthy backers of then-President-elect Donald Trump before he was offered the job in January. Clayton spoke with venture capital billionaire Peter Thiel and political adviser Rebekah Mercer … “Clayton also said he communicated with the campaign’s chief executive officer, Stephen Bannon, who is now Trump’s chief strategist” Read more. DEM PRESSURE — Via Revolving Door Project’s Jeff Hauser: “Whatever unity progressives have achieved in the Gorsuch fight might be proven temporary or meaningless if any Banking Committee Democrats vote for Clayton, who would bring more conflicts of interest to the SEC than Trump has to the White House. “A Clayton SEC would make Mary Jo White critics like myself look back with surprising wistfullness. Senate Democrats might think a vote for Clayton is a costless vote to hand the donor class, but over time a vote for Clayton will become a Scarlett Letter for any ambitious Democrat." Tweet du jour via @angieberkey: “Even #RogerStaubach admits @cajunbanker REALLY IS a Cowboys fan! #CBALIVE@ConsumerBankers” MM RESPONSE: #HTTR ** A message from Morgan Stanley: Morgan Stanley helped All Aboard Florida raise capital needed to develop Brightline, an express, intercity rail connecting Southern Florida. The project won’t just reduce travel time—it’s projected to add up to hundreds of millions in tax revenue over the next several years1. Learn more at morganstanley.com/brightline. Capital creates change. ** KUSHNER BUILDING IN TROUBLE — NYT’s Charles Bagli: “The Fifth Avenue skyscraper was supposed to be the Kushner Companies' flagship in the heart of Manhattan - a record-setting $1.8 billion souvenir proclaiming that the New Jersey developers Charles Kushner and his son Jared were playing in the big leagues. “And while it has been a visible symbol of their status, it has also been a financial headache almost from the start. On Wednesday, the Kushners announced that talks had broken off with a Chinese financial conglomerate for a deal worth billions to redevelop the 41-story tower, at 666 Fifth Avenue, into a flashy 74-story ultraluxury skyscraper” Read more. McHENRY HOPES FOR FIN REG BILL BY SUMMER — POLITICO’s Colin Wilhelm: “House Republican Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) says he hopes to see a financial regulatory reform package advance out of the House this summer but that any effort would take a backseat to health care and tax reform” MEMO TO BOND MARKETS: DON’T FIGHT THE FED — Mohamed A. El-Erian in the FT: “When it comes to investor positioning, an important takeaway from last month should have been that the Fed … now less worried about the economic outlook, is becoming more assertive in leading, rather than following markets … Yet investor attention has been distracted, making bonds less sensitive to an important Fed policy regime shift and a lot more reflective of political uncertainty in the US and Europe” Read more. WELLS FARGO WHISTLE-BLOWER COMES OUT ON TOP — NYT’s Stacy Cowley: “A federal regulator on Monday ordered Wells Fargo to pay $5.4 million to a former manager who said he was fired in 2010 after reporting to his supervisors and to a bank ethics hotline what he suspected was fraudulent behavior. The bank must also rehire him, the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration said. “The $5.4 million, intended to cover back pay, compensatory damages and legal fees, is the largest individual award ever ordered through OSHA’s whistle-blower protection program, according to Barbara Goto, the agency’s regional administrator in San Francisco.” Read more. BANK OF AMERICA TURNS TO FATF REPORTS — WSJ’s Samuel Rubenfeld: “Bank of America Corp. is using a recent assessment of the money laundering risk in the U.S. economy to help determine risk among its customers, according to a bank official. “William Fox, global head of financial crimes compliance at Bank of America, said during a panel discussion at an anti-money laundering conference that he had briefed senior management about the latest evaluation of the U.S. from the Financial Action Task Force, an international standards-setting body.” Read more. INVESTORS TROUBLED BY WEAK AUTO SALES — AP’s Marley Jay: “U.S. stocks started the second quarter with a thud Monday after car makers reported disappointing March sales, a possible warning about other types of spending. But a late recovery helped stocks avoid bigger losses. “Stocks tumbled in morning trading after automakers including Ford and General Motors said passenger car sales slumped last month. Auto parts and rental car companies also tumbled. Spending by shoppers is a critical part of economic growth and investors found themselves wondering if spending will keep growing as it has in recent years. Small companies slumped, as their performance is closely linked to U.S. economic growth.” Read more. COWEN GROUP ACQUIRES BROKERAGE FIRM — NYT’s Chad Bray: “The Cowen Group said on Monday that it had agreed to acquire the brokerage firm Convergex Group as it looks to bolster its sales and trading business. “The New York financial services company said that it would pay $116 million in cash and stock to acquire Convergex from the private equity firm GTCR, Bank of New York Mellon and other investors. The deal for Convergex came just days after Cowen announced it had agreed to sell a 19.9 percent stake in itself to CEFC China Energy, a Chinese conglomerate with big investments in oil in Central Africa.” Read more. CHINA’S ‘BAD BANKS’ FLOURISH — FT’s Don Weinland: “China’s so-called bad banks are thriving as alternative lenders, evolving from bad-debt managers into some of the country’s largest financial conglomerates just as margins at the big state-owned banks come under pressure. “China’s four centrally controlled asset management companies (AMCs) were set up in 1999 to swallow toxic assets from banks, and have had their assets grow expansively over the past five years. The four groups — Cinda, Huarong, Great Wall and Orient — have been the primary buyers of non-performing loans in China. But they have also profited from low interest rates in recent years” Read more. ECONOMY BIGGER THREAT THAN TRUMP? — Bloomberg’s Adam Haigh: “Veteran money manager Bob Doll is becoming increasingly worried that the American economy poses a greater threat to the U.S. stock rally than the political tensions traders are currently focused on from President Donald Trump and Congress. “Sentiment on the U.S. economy may be too high, leaving investors vulnerable to negative surprises on growth, according to Doll, the Chicago-based chief equity strategist and senior portfolio manager at Nuveen Asset Management LLC, which oversees about $230 billion. Equities and high-yield bonds may suffer in the short-term, with the chance of a deeper sell-off growing, he said. He remains bullish on equities longer-term.” Read more. MORGAN STANLEY TAPS MARTIN LEIBOWITZ TO LEAD NEW GROUP — Business Insider’s Frank Chaparro: “Morgan Stanley has handed a Wall Street legend a new role as the head of a newly created council focused on quantitative research. The US investment bank has named Martin L. Leibowitz, known as Marty, vice chairman of Morgan Stanley Research, and chair of a newly formed Research Quantitative Council. “The bank council will be made up of ‘nine quantitative specialists’ across different segments of the investment bank, according to an internal memo announcing the appointments.” Read more.

DEFENDING HEDGE FUNDS — Managed Funds Association’s Richard Baker in USA Today: “Even in times of pressure, research shows that investors — particularly institutional investors such as pensions, foundations and endowments — continue to use hedge funds as tools to help meet their unique financial and risk management needs.” Read more. CFTC NAMES HEAD OF MARKET INTELLIGENCE UNIT — POLITICO’s Patrick Temple-West: “A former currency trader and CNBC contributor has been named head of a new unit at the CFTC tasked with monitoring markets … Andrew Busch of Chicago has most recently been head of a boutique economic research firm he founded. Busch formerly worked at the Bank of Montreal in Chicago where he served as a currency strategist." ** A message from Morgan Stanley: When All Aboard Florida wanted to bring an innovative express, intercity railway to Florida, Morgan Stanley helped it raise capital to make the project happen. The new Brightline trains are expected to cut travel time across Southern Florida by about an hour, while potentially creating over 10,000 jobs on average per year during construction1.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 April 2017 by Military News CIT Completes Sale of Commercial Aircraft Leasing Business to Avolon Holdings for $10.4 Billion NEW YORK, April 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — CIT Group Inc. (NYSE: CIT) today announced that it completed the sale of its commercial aircraft leasing business to Avolon Holdings Limited (Avolon), the international aircraft leasing company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Bohai Capital Holding Co. Ltd., for a purchase price of $10.4 billion. CIT will use the cash proceeds from the transaction to fund approximately $3 billion in capital return to shareholders and redeem $5.8 billion in senior unsecured debt. The liability management and capital return actions are expected to be initiated as soon as practicable and before the end of April. Separately, the company continues to evaluate the issuance of approximately $325 million of Tier 1 qualifying preferred stock, which would allow for an incremental return of an equivalent amount of common equity. „This marks the completion of a landmark transaction that will further simplify our business model, enhance our core funding profile and enable us to return significant capital to our shareholders,” said Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer Ellen R. Alemany. „I want to thank the CIT team for successfully achieving this milestone in our strategic plan. As we look ahead, we will continue to strengthen our position as a leading national bank for lending and leasing to the middle market and small businesses, while driving long-term shareholder value.” With the completion of this transaction, as well as the recent sale of CIT’s stake in the TC-CIT aviation joint ventures, CIT has now exited the commercial aircraft leasing business. CIT’s Commercial Finance business will continue to work with aircraft owners, manufacturers, suppliers and service providers in the industry to offer loans for commercial aircraft, aircraft engines and aircraft parts as part of its Aerospace, Defense & Government Finance business.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 April 2017 by satprnews satprnews HNW Market Asset Allocation Trends & Strategies in 17 Key Markets HNW investment preferences are the result of an interplay between a multitude of factors, such as macroeconomic and political conditions, risk-preferences, demographic factors, and investor attitudes. Over the next 12 months we expect further portfolio reallocation to benefit risk assets, as HNW investors globally are looking for cheap buying opportunities amid turbulent market conditions. However, there continue to be significant regional differences. The typical HNW portfolio in Asia Pacific and the Middle East is significantly more conservative than elsewhere globally, with above-average allocations to property and cash and near-cash products. However, falling or stagnating property prices in some countries in these regions are set to cub investor demand over the next 12 months. In the West, investors are more willing to embrace risk and HNW clients favor equities, hoping that index movements will continue to provide opportunities. We also forecast increasing demand for alternatives, as HNW investors are looking for new means of diversification; however, a certain amount of hand holding will be required to capitalize on rising demand for the asset class. This report draws on our 2016 Global Wealth Managers Survey to analyze HNW asset allocation strategies in 17 key markets. In particular, it examines the drivers behind investment choices now and over the next 12 months. Specifically the report – – Analyzes HNW asset allocation strategies in 17 key HNW markets, including Australia, the UK, and the US. – Examines the drivers that determine HNW investment preferences. – Interprets macroeconomic, demographic, and attitudinal trends, such as risk preferences that are shaping HNW investment behavior. Key companie slisted in the report are ANZ, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, and UBS, Eiffel Management, Dubai Islamic Bank, Mashreq Bank, Scotiabank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The report is accompanied by an online interactive dashboard to enable users to select and view the data of their choosing. Scope – The most striking trend in 2016 was the surge of risk assets, as investors are more willing to take on risk in the current low-yield environment. – HNW equity holdings will experience the biggest increase in demand as HNW investors continue to look for capital appreciation opportunities, hoping to take advantage of cheap buying opportunities. – The typical HNW real estate portfolio is increasingly skewed towards non-direct property investments; offering real estate investment trusts (REITs) is a must in the HNW space. – We forecast increased demand for commodities, which are regarded as a wider markets hedge. This will drive demand for gold in particular. However, betting on a sustained commodity price rebound will lead to further diversification. – Alternatives are becoming an increasingly attractive diversifier, as investors are losing faith in bonds and are looking for returns elsewhere. Asset diversification is the single most important driver for alternatives. Reasons to buy – Understand how to best promote investment products by learning what is driving investment choices. – Understand investment trends, and adjust your service proposition based on a detailed understanding of HNW investors’ investment preferences. – Give your marketing strategies the edge required and capture new clients using insights from our data on HNW investment drivers. – Learn how and why investment preferences will change over the next 12 months.

HNW INVESTMENT DRIVERS 23 3.1. Equity holdings are driven by capital appreciation opportunities 23 3.1.1. Cheap buying opportunities are driving equity investments 23 3.1.2. Capital appreciation potential will continue to drive HNW demand, but not everywhere 24 3.2. Dividend income as a driver of equity investments is becoming increasingly important 26 3.2.1. Geographic diversification is driving equity investment in Russia 27 3.3. Bonds are traditionally important to risk-averse HNW individuals 28 3.3.1. Quantitative easing and political uncertainty will continue to have a negative effect on bond holdings in Europe 28 3.3.2. Risk aversion and asset diversification are the main drivers of bond investments 29 3.3.3. Current returns are important considerations in many emerging markets, and wealth managers will do well to educate clients about the risks involved 30 3.4. Cash and near-cash products are favored as a means of “parking” wealth and maintaining liquidity 31 3.4.1. HNW investors are forecast to increase their cash holdings, albeit only slightly 31 3.4.2. Being ready for future investment opportunities and a desire to maintain liquidity are the top drivers for cash investments 32 3.4.3. Rising consumer confidence will have an adverse effect on deposit holdings in Europe 34 3.4.4. The uptake of financial advice will lead to further portfolio diversification away from deposits – at least in some markets 35 3.5. Real estate investments are driven by price movements and a desire to be able to rely on rental income 36 3.5.1. Global HNW investments in real estate are forecast to rise 36 3.5.2. Property price movements and rental yields are the main drivers for HNW investments in real estate 37 3.5.3. Price appreciation is of particular importance in Asia 38 3.5.4. In Europe the perception of safety, diversification benefits, and rental income are more important than capital growth 39 3.6. Alternative investments are becoming increasingly important for their diversification benefits 40 3.6.1. HNW demand for alternatives is forecast to increase in all but one country 40 3.6.2. Asset diversification benefits have emerged as the top driver for HNW alternative investments 41 3.6.3. Future capital appreciation remains important, but less so than a year ago 41 3.6.4. Expansion of P2P lending and crowd-funding platforms is driving demand for alternatives in Hong Kong 42 3.6.5. Other HNW drivers for alternatives include dissatisfaction with traditional asset classes, the perception of exclusivity, and current returns 43 3.7. Commodities largely act as a diversifier, but capital appreciation opportunities seem appealing too 43 3.7.1. Demand for commodities is set to rise in the majority of countries surveyed 43 3.7.2. Their reputation as an important diversifier has seen commodities become an integral part of the typical HNW portfolio 44 3.7.3. HNW investors in Asia Pacific are betting on capital appreciation opportunities 45 3.7.4. The perception of safety is becoming an increasingly important driver in the commodity sphere 46 4.

Emerging market borrowers raised a record $181 billion in global bond markets during the first quarter of 2017, with both corporate and sovereign tallies surpassing previous highs, data from JPMorgan showed. The bank, which runs the most widely used emerging debt indexes, said in a note sent late on Monday that sovereign year-to-date issuance stood at $61.5 billion, over $16 billion more than at this time of the year in the past. Emerging market companies raised $119.1 billion, surpassing the previous high of $109.6 billion set in the first quarter of 2013, JPM said. The $51 billion sold in March was more than twice the $21.8 billion from a year back, and well above the average March supply of $28.4 billion. The numbers testify to the global fundraising rush before the U.S. Federal Reserve kicked off interest rate rises, precipitating a rise in U.S. Treasury yields. You may watch: In a report released on Monday, the Institute for International Finance found that outstanding emerging market debt had seen a “spectacular rise” to $55 trillion in 2016, equal to 215 percent of the GDP of developing nations, which was mostly by non-financial corporate debt. JPM said appetite for emerging new debt was being supported by abundant cash flows to bondholders in the form of coupon payments and maturities that it estimated at $26.5 billion so far this year for sovereigns and $72 billion for corporates. Emerging debt funds are also receiving inflows from investors, having just taken new money for nine weeks in a row. JPM forecasts sovereign bond issuance at $137 billion in 2017 and corporate sales at $315 billion but added that the current issuance rate would pose “upside risk” to the forecasts, at least on the corporate front.

Like us on Facebook. Like The Denton Record-Chronicle's Facebook Page To finance seven ongoing construction projects across the University of North Texas system, system officials had to sell bonds in January to pay for the work.  In addition to the regular finance team, James Verfurth, a senior finance major, accompanied the team for a two-day trip to New York to work with financial service companies JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays to sell $264.1 million worth of bonds. Over two days, Verfurth sat in meetings with UNT and bank officials, watched the bonds go to market and met with a variety of executives at both companies.  "It was an eye-opening experience," Verfurth said of the early January trip. "I genuinely enjoy finance and it was an opportunity I couldn't pass up — I observed something that directly impacts students." After, he presented about the experience and bond sales to the Board of Regents last week in Dallas. Over the course of eight minutes, Verfurth explained the sale of new bonds and refinancing of others, totaling $264.1 million. With refinancing, the system saves $7.1 million and reduces the average debt service the system has to pay.  "We definitely entered at a good time and it was a favorable entry point for us into the market," he told the board. "That gave us a phenomenal focus, and we were definitely center stage and center of attention, as far as what institutions and investors were looking at."  Board members whispered among themselves during his presentation. Neal Smatresk, UNT president, turned back from his seat to Luke Lybrand, the UNT System treasury manager who intoduced Verfurth, to tell him "good job."  At the end of his presentation, board President Brint Ryan asked if Verfurth was sure he wanted to move to Philadelphia for a job with Wells Fargo in June.  After the meeting, Ryan, who has been on the board since 2009, said he had never seen a student give this level of presentation to the board before.  "I was very impressed with James' presentation," he said in an email. "I've never seen a student present to the Board at this level and I would have hired him on the spot it — if he wasn't already headed to Wells Fargo."

The state of play S&P now rates SA’s foreign-currency debt BB+, one level below investment grade, with a negative outlook. Fitch Ratings and Moody’s assess the nation’s creditworthiness at BBB- and Baa2, one and two levels above sub-investment, respectively. Both have a negative outlook, meaning they’re more likely to lower than raise the credit score. At the same time, S&P reduced its rating for the nation’s local debt one step to BBB-, the lowest investment grade. Moody’s rates the local-currency debt at Baa2, two levels above junk, while Fitch’s assessment is BBB-, one rung above junk. What happens next? A one-step downgrade of the foreign-currency debt by Moody’s wouldn’t change the picture substantially, as SA would still be left with two investment-level ratings. A two-notch downgrade by Moody’s or a cut by Fitch would spark forced selling of foreign-currency bonds by investors that track investment-grade debt indexes. On the local-currency front, it would require a one-step downgrade by Fitch and a two-notch cut by Moody’s, or another by S&P, to trigger forced selling from local-currency bond-index tracker funds. There is less danger of that happening immediately. READ: Economist slams Treasury response to downgrade Why does it matter? Bond indices compiled by Bloomberg Barclays, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup, which are tracked by more than $2trn of institutional funds, have rules relating to the credit quality of constituents. Broadly speaking, those rules require an investment-grade rating, either from S&P - in the case of Citigroup’s World Government Bond Index (WGBI) - or from two of the three companies - in the case of the Bloomberg Barclays and JPMorgan emerging-market indicess. Hard-currency indices, such as the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index and JP Morgan’s EMBIG gauges, look at the long-term foreign-currency ratings, while local-currency indices like the WGBI focus on the local-currency rating. Should SA lose its membership of these indices, funds that track them would be forced to sell their holdings of SA bonds. In addition, funds that are mandated to hold investment-grade debt only would be forced to sell. What’s at stake? Foreign investors hold 36% of SA’s R1.74trn of local-currency government bonds, according to the National Treasury’s February Budget Review. That means an amount of R623bn is potentially at risk in a selloff, in addition to about $16bn of debt denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign-currency bonds account for about 10% of SA’s total government debt of R2.2trn. In practice, the amounts will probably be less. UBS estimates that WGBI-tracking funds account for about 22% of non-resident bond holdings, or about $10bn of SA local-currency debt, roughly the same amount as the current-account deficit. A forced sell-off by funds tracking the gauge could double the shortfall in nominal terms. READ: Downgrade: Our people will be worse off - CEOs What are the precedents? Turkish and Brazilian bonds fell after they were first downgraded to junk, in September 2016 and September 2015, respectively. Turkish local government debt lost 5.1% in the month after the nation was cut to Ba1 by Moody’s, the worst performance among 31 emerging markets monitored by Bloomberg. Its Eurobonds lost 2.4%, more than three times the average for developing-nation dollar notes in that period. Brazilian real-denominated government bonds dropped 0.73% in the four weeks after S&P moved it to BB+, while emerging-market local government bonds gained 2.7% on average. By contrast, Russia’s assets outperformed after it was first cut to junk by S&P in January 2015. The country’s local debt and Eurobonds gained in the following month, while those of its emerging-market peers fell.

YouTube is a favorite time suck for many of us, and for countless good reasons. Uploading videos is seamless and fast, and watching content — from cute kitties to math classes at Khan Academy — makes it an easy service to use. Whether you seek self-improvement or just want to waste time, YouTube has become the site and app of choice. Various statistics suggest that 300 to 400 hours of content are uploaded on YouTube every minute, and 5 billion videos are enjoyed daily. But all of that content has triggered headaches for many advertisers, and now YouTube and its parent, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), have taken a financial hit. The risk that a brand’s advertisements can run alongside a sexist outburst or an Islamic State rant on YouTube has caused many online marketers to yank their content from the popular video sharing site. JPMorgan Chase, for example, joined companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola and Walmart in halting their ad campaigns due to growing consumer backlash. Google said this problem only amounts to “very, very, very small numbers” of ads running on YouTube. But for a major global brand, the risk of consumer outrage if an ad is placed before or during a racist or hate-filled diatribe on YouTube is very, very, very big. To that end, Google said it will roll out a new system that permits third-party companies to evaluate quality standards on YouTube. But considering the vast amount of content that is added to the site, human eyeballs may not be enough. Bloomberg’s Mark Bergen is among many analysts who inferred that Google did not move quickly enough to quell what has now become a crisis. So, could artificial intelligence help repair and resuscitate YouTube’s reputation and revenues? Machine learning techniques could be the ticket to weeding out those dodgy videos. Google says it has already been researching and investing in the technology over the past five years. In layperson’s terms, this technology is going far beyond the zeroes and ones that have been the foundation of computer science for decades. As artificial intelligence pioneer Arthur Samuel described machine learning almost 60 years ago, this sub-field of computer technology “gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” As New York Times technology writer Daisuke Wakabayashi reported this week, Google has already applied this technology to monitoring some of YouTube’s content – mostly to root out easily identifiable copyrighted content or pornography. But the next frontier for machine learning is granting the systems an ability to understand context. After all, teenagers filming themselves acting out a parody of “The Bourne Identity” series, or septuagenarians pretending to be James Bond, are not quite the same as an online diary of some right-wing militia urging an uprising against anyone non-white. The same goes for a DIY video on how to cook meth compared to a media geek’s review of an episode of “Breaking Bad.” For now, the artificial intelligence used at Google cannot differentiate such nuances – but that could soon change. Google told the Times it is accelerating the application of machine-learning techniques to YouTube’s service, complemented by researchers who are developing an automated system that can determine a video’s appropriateness for public viewing. With 3 million advertising-supported channels on YouTube, it could take years for such a process to approach anything near perfection. But for Google and its deep-pocketed advertisers, there is really no other option if YouTube will remain both popular and profitable.

Posted on March 31, 2017 by Yves Smith By Don Quijones of Spain & Mexico, editor at Wolf Street. Originally published at Wolf Street For a country that is on the brink of a gargantuan public bailout of its toxic-loan riddled banking sector, or failing that, a full-blown financial crisis that could bring down the European financial system, things are eerily quiet in Italy these days. It’s almost as if the more serious the crisis gets, the less we hear about it — otherwise, investors and voters might get spooked. And elections are coming up. But an article published in the financial section of Italian daily Il Sole lays out just how serious the situation has become. According to new research by Italian investment bank Mediobanca, 114 of the close to 500 banks in Italy have “Texas Ratios” of over 100%. The Texas Ratio, or TR, is calculated by dividing the total value of a bank’s non-performing loans by its tangible book value plus reserves — or as American money manager Steve Eisman put it, “all the bad stuff divided by the money you have to pay for all the bad stuff.” If the TR is over 100%, the bank doesn’t have enough money “pay for all the bad stuff.” Hence, banks tend to fail when the ratio surpasses 100%. In Italy there are 114 of them. Of them, 24 have ratios of over 200%. Granted, many of the banks in question are small local or regional savings banks with tens or hundreds of millions of euros in assets. These are not systemically important institutions and can be resolved without causing disturbances to the broader system. But the list also includes many of Italy’s biggest banks which certainly are systemically important to Italy, some of which have Texas Ratios of over 200%. Top of the list, predictably, is Monte dei Paschi di Siena, with €169 billion in assets and a TR of 269%. Next up is Veneto Banca, with €33 billion in assets and a TR of 239%. This is the bank that, together with Banco Popolare di Vicenza (assets: €39 billion, TR: 210%), was supposed to have been saved last year by an intervention from government-sponsored, privately funded bank bailout fund Atlante, but which now urgently requires more public funds. Their combined assets place them seventh on the list of Italy’s largest banks. Some experts, including the U.S. bank hired last year to save MPS, JP Morgan Chase, have warned that Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca will not be eligible for a bailout since they are not regarded as systemically important enough. This prompted investors to remove funds from the banks, further exacerbating their financial woes. According to sources in Rome, the two banks’ failure would send shock waves through the wider Italian financial industry. There are other major Italian banks with Texas Ratios well in excess of 100%. They include: Banco Popolare (the offspring of a merger of Banco Popolare di Verona e Novara and Banca Popolare Italiana in 2017 and then a subsequent merger with Banca Popolare di Milano on 1 January 2017): €120 billion in assets; TR: 217%. UBI Banca: €117 billion in assets; TR: 117% Banca Nazionale del Lavoro: €77 billion in assets; TR: 113% Banco Popolare Dell’ Emilia Romagna: €61 billion in assets; TR: 140% Banca Carige: €30 billion in assets; TR: 165% Unipol Banca: €11 billion in assets; TR: 380% In sum, almost all of Italy’s largest banking groups, with the exception of Unicredit, Intesa Sao Paolo and Mediobanca itself, have Texas Ratios well in excess of 100%. But, as Eisman recently pointed out, the two largest banks, Unicredit and Intesa Sanpaolo, have TRs of over 90%. As long as the other banks continue to languish in their current zombified state, they will continue to drag down the two bigger banks. And if either Unicredit or Intesa begin to wobble, the bets are off. To stay on the right side of the solvency threshold, Unicredit has already had to raise €13 billion of new capital this year and last week it took advantage of the ECB’s latest splurge of charitable lending (formally known as TLTRO II) to borrow €24 billion of free money. But as long as the financial health of the banks all around it continues to deteriorate, staying upright is going to be a tough order. This is where things get complicated. In order to qualify for public assistance, banks must be solvent. Presumably, that would automatically disqualify any bank with a Texas Ratio of over 150%, which includes MPS, Banco Popolare, Popolare di Vicenza, Veneto Banca, Banca Carige and Unipol Banca. The bailout must also comply with current EU regulations including the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive of Jan 1, 2016, which specifically mandates that before public funds are injected into a bank, shareholders and creditors must be bailed in for a minimum amount of 8% of total liabilities, as famously happened in the rescue of Cyprus’ banking system in 2013. The Italian government knows that this approach could end up wiping out retail investors (otherwise known as voters) who were missold, in many cases fraudulently, subordinated bonds by cash-hungry banks in the wake of the last crisis, in turn wiping out the government’s votes. To avoid such an outcome, the government has proposed compensating those retail bondholders with public funds, just as the Spanish government did with the holders of preferente bonds. Which, of course, is in direct contravention of EU laws. So far, the European Commission has stayed silent on the issue, presumably in the hope that the resolution of Italy’s financial sector can be held off until at least after the French elections in late April, if not the German elections in September. Then, if those elections go Brussels’ way, a continent-wide taxpayer funded bailout of banks’ NPLs can be unleashed, as already requested by ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio and European Banking Authority President Andrea Enria. With no guarantee that Italy’s NPL-infested banks can hold out that long, it’s a dangerous waiting-and-hoping game.

Reply ↓ Dr Duh March 31, 2017 at 11:09 am Great article. A couple questions 1. What is the overall Texas Ratio for the Italian banking system? 2. What is the mechanism connecting a ‘bad’ Texas Ratio to failure in this case? Are they funding long term liabilities with short term borrowing like Lehman and hence are at risk of being locked out of the market? 3. How interconnected are the Italian banks? Is there potential for a domino effect? What would be the mechanism, loss of confidence or actual counterparty risk? Reply ↓ John Tipre April 2, 2017 at 8:30 pm All good questions. Come June, one may expect more EU austerity practices in the form of public bailout, Yes? The “public,” the disappeared element of modern western political cultures, is the “backstop,” the final insurer. Neoliberalism plays a strong role in the grossly unfair practice of public bailouts. Reply ↓ craazyman March 31, 2017 at 11:41 am What radar? Italy’s last radar stations shut down for lack of money in 2013 and all the operators who could leave the country left for science jobs in Uganda and Brazil. There is no radar in Italy. Germany has radar but it only picks up signals from NATO or Brussels. Italy’s scientific minds are busy with financial theory, in New Yawk. I’ve seen a few of them. Pretty smart dudes! And women! They like stochastic volatility and Wishart distributions but God Forbid you put them in front of a radar machine. They wouldn’t know a bird from the Luftwaffe (haha sorry that was a long time ago). What radar? Radar is so 20th century! Today we have Twitter and Facebook if you wanna stare at a glass screen and hear beeps. I think there’s a Wikipedia page for radar but it’s rusting. They use radar on boats and ships though. Maybe one of Italy’s banks will go floating by on the ocean of liquidity from the ECB. Then it might show up on a radar someplace out near the Azores. Too bad you’ll lose money no matter how you try to trade it. Or at least I would! That’s for sure. Reply ↓ Susan the other April 1, 2017 at 11:01 am a day late and a dollar short here, why do I have all my good ideas on April Fool’s day? – but anyway: Schaeuble’s “we are overbanked” is now Schaeuble’s Paradox because if they let the little ones go they will bring down the big ones because everybody and their dog has a stake in this – much like you explained about China’s bubble. So, yes Wolfgang, we are overbanked and no, Wolfgang, we are not overbanked… everything is in perfect balance. And all those euros and dollars racing around with nowhere to go? – here’s a suggestion: pour them as fast as you can back into the planet. Clean it up. Cool it down. Reply ↓ DJG March 31, 2017 at 11:57 am A couple of reasons come to mind, but I may be too anecdotal: When I was in Italy three weeks back, some friends of mine (and my friends are all pretty much red) mentioned that parties on the left had looted Monte dei Paschi di Siena. So the Partito Democratico, the successor party, is going to end up with a scandal (or with even more scandal). A second idea crossed my mind: For many years, the Italians were the champion savers of Europe. (They were nearly as good at savings as the Japanese.) So these banks are filled with Italians’ savings accounts and their retirement nest eggs. Weirdly, the Italian regulators may have some idea that the Italians and their savings habits can shift the balance. What’s more likely, though, and what’s worse is that once these banks start failing in series, you will see Italian families wiped out financially. The social devastation will bring down the government and may even bring down most of the political parties. The irony would be that the newer Movimento Cinque Stelle is less implicated (not that they have a plan either). Reply ↓ ChrisAtRU March 31, 2017 at 12:40 pm Thanks for this. I follow Bloomberg on Twitter and this came across the wire a day of so ago: Italy Finance Minister Says Banking Problems ‘Solved’ Needless to say, raised eyebrows by yours truly given previous material posted here. Just gave a first listen to it, and nothing he (Padoan) says suggests the dire straits outlined in the NC post. I’ll follow up later, but perhaps a shorter version of his answers to the interviewer here would have been “Shhhhhhhhh …” Reply ↓ JustAnObserver March 31, 2017 at 1:46 pm All we need now is for some Italian financial official to utter the Words Of Doom: “The Fundamentals of the Economy are Sound”.

Of course since it was undeclared money the Italian State got to keep 50%. Now, since the Italian finance minister thinks the banking problems are resolved I imagine there must be a whole bus of Japanese moneymen on their way to Chiasso… https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Italian_border_guards_seize_$134_billion_in_U.S._bonds_at_Swiss_border Reply ↓ ChrisAtRU March 31, 2017 at 7:33 pm Hahahah! That is too funny – regardless of whether the bonds were real or not. Maybe the Italians are following the Wu Tang Financial paradigm … ;-) Reply ↓ ChrisAtRU March 31, 2017 at 7:31 pm Ha! Yes, it was JKG. And for sure, the Words of Doom will be uttered just before … well, Doom. Reply ↓ John March 31, 2017 at 9:12 pm Well isn’t that what most Keynesians think? That the fundamentals are relatively sound, the only problem is a financial crisis caused by asset bubbles? And that if we just increase the deficit (update the nation’s infrastructure), things will be fine? The reality is that it wasn’t just a financial crisis that caused the post 2008 recession. The real economy is not in good shape, nor has been since the 1970’s. The industrialization of Europe and Japan, followed by China and India, has caused a crisis of overproduction/under-utilization of capacity that has eaten away profit rates in manufacturing firms around the globe (even with the abundant supply of labor available from the ease of outsourcing). The only growth we’ve had since then has been from asset bubbles (Japanese real estate in the 80’s, the US stock market in the 90’s, US real estate in the 00’s, EU bubbles in the 00’s, etc.). Fiscal stimulus can temporarily ease the burden by increasing demand, and monetary stimulus can temporarily reflate the asset bubbles, but there’s no light at the end of the tunnel. (Not to mention that US federal deficit spending just boosts Chinese manufacturing sector and pollutes the planet more than anything else.) Earth has a finite amount of space and resources, and the mathematics of compound interest mean that growth rates will have to be low from here on out (there’s no way the global economy will double by 2060 and then double again by 2100; not even the Chinese and Indian booms together could get us growing like that, nor do I think Africa alone could, either). That’s something that fixing up a few dilapidated subway stations won’t change–eventually, the gains will slow as we’ll run out of infrastructure to repair. The reality is the urbanization and industrialization are the lifeblood of capitalism, and without those two processes happening on a major scale, growth is low (just as it was during the 17th century). The only thing that will get us growing again is a major world war that blows up buildings and infrastructure everywhere, just like World War II did. Reply ↓ ScottB April 2, 2017 at 2:13 am “Shhhhh…..”. Followed by, “ittttttt.” Reply ↓ BillC March 31, 2017 at 1:02 pm The article does not emphasize the factor that should (but surely will not) mitigate the extent to which the EU requires bail-ins by depositors and retail bondholders: the Italian banks’ problem is non-performing loans substantially attributable to the austerity imposed by the EU’s [non]growth and [non]stability pact. (Of course there’s also the factor of bank managers’ favoritism to political allies and back-scratching among the local elites. While that’s a key factor with MPS and some of the four already-partially-rescued smaller regional banks, it’s not the main cause of the Italian banking crisis). Why should this be significant? Because some Italian political party (5 Stelle? Fratelli d’Italia? Lega Nord?) may be able to clearly and simply enunciate the case that (1) EU austerity is the direct result of other nations’ (Spain, UK, Germany, US, …) banks’ irresponsible speculation in derivatives and the like but (2) Italian banks did not participate in that speculative orgy; they were just fulfilling their proper mission of financing local, regional, and national enterprises and (3) much of the Italian middle class will be ruined by EU-required bail-ins. If the voting public understands this causal chain, I think Italians’ conservative tendency to thus far stick with the EU and the Euro no matter what might be reversed overnight — and high time, too. Reply ↓ Stein April 1, 2017 at 7:57 am I’m sorry; but for the current problems, the Italians have nobody to blame but themselves. 1/ Their system did not allow them to fix their banks in time. The financial crisis was in 2008. It’s almost TEN years after and they still haven’t fixed their non-performing loans. The US did it quite fast (thanks, Obama) and put in a new bail-in rule. The EU took their time, but eventually did it and put in the BRRD, too. THe BRRD took years to negotiate and was not immediately implemented – so Italy could have bailed in its banks in the mean time, too. They did not. 2/ The bail in would have worked like a charm in a non-fraudulent system. But Italian banks sold their subordinated bonds – fraudulently – to mom&pop investors, thus making it ill-adapted. 3/ Italian banks did not receive non-performing loans out of nowhere. It is the Italian banks themselves that gave or bought such non-performing loans. So they did participate in the orgy, did not clean up afterwards for more than 10 years, fraudulently tried to cover everything up (because the subordinated bonds that are bail-in able are supposed to provide more capital to the banks), and are now going to screw the entire European Union because of this. I think Italian banks should be bailed in. But Italian bankers should be sent to jail. Reply ↓ Stein April 4, 2017 at 9:39 am Clarification: second to last paragraph should be read as “should be bailed out”. Typo (kind of important typo, though). Reply ↓ sunny129 March 31, 2017 at 4:03 pm What’s Shhhhhhhhh? They have successfully masked the Banking problems under various CREATIVE accounting with final paint job of Extend & Pretend’ No one challenged and the investors have accepted without any skepticism. Besides, they believe in the PUT by Draghi! Reply ↓ LT April 1, 2017 at 1:30 pm They’ve also masked it as I’ve said before: They say it’s a “populist” (voter) created crisis. At root, it’s yet anothet gift from the financial sector. Reply ↓ Gman March 31, 2017 at 6:02 pm Italy as a country, 8th richest in global terms I believe, ain’t poor, so somewhere along the line as ever, both within and without, as elsewhere in the EZ and the rest of the world, some are making hay out this debt crisis and have an interest in perpetuating it, whilst the blameless are yet again forced to endure its bitter consequences. Reply ↓ TheCatSaid March 31, 2017 at 7:35 pm I wonder how Italy would fare if they left the Euro, compared to the problems discussed here in the case of Greece. Specifically, how easily could Italy be self-sufficient in food at medicines? I suspect Italy would be in a stronger position to weather any such storm, and they would have even more tourism Euro revenue in a transition period. (Assuming a messy transition period during which the conventional payment systems would be in disarray.) Reply ↓ John March 31, 2017 at 9:19 pm I’ve seen Yves and NC writers argue a few times that Italy is the euro country best suited to ditch the euro. I think it’d be France though; their economy has always been more national and independent than the rest of Europe, which is why in the early years of the crisis, things weren’t nearly as bad there as they were in the PIIGS. Whichever country decides to do so will end up facing economic ruin as the powers that be will make sure to punish it as much as possible (just as they’ll do to the UK with the trade agreements) to make an example of it. Currency speculators will destroy the value of the new currency. And there are all of the crazy logistical and IT challenges that have been well-documented here as well. Of course the most interesting scenario, by far, is Germany leaving the euro. But I can’t ever seeing them be the first to do so, as they benefit too much from it. Reply ↓ H. Alexander Ivey March 31, 2017 at 10:05 pm Germany leaving the euro. But I can’t ever seeing them be the first to do so, as they benefit too much from it That might have been Cameron’s thought about Brexit. How well did that work out? Reply ↓ John April 1, 2017 at 1:26 pm Well, Cameron was an idiot for holding that referendum. And it’s also important to remember that Germans hate referendums. Reply ↓ John March 31, 2017 at 8:29 pm I think that the EU and Italy will come to some sort of compromise on the bail-in law, or they will organize some sort of private sector rescue. And if not, I don’t think Italians are quite ready to ditch the euro, even if a lot of folks lose money on the bail-in. Also, Beppe Grillo is not allowed to run for public office because of that manslaughter charge. We’ll see more of the status quo, at least for a few more years. Reply ↓ RBHoughton March 31, 2017 at 10:03 pm “…. the more serious the crisis gets, the less we hear about it” Isn’t that always the case with our ‘keep it under your hat’ media – information is money. For the money reporter its “What am I bid for an early chance to avoid loss?” For the politician hoping for a trouble-free life its “Don’t excite the natives you know how irritable they can get!” Don Quijones, Wolf Street and Naked Capitalism have done us all a great favor yet again. The level of money inflation is accelerating everywhere. Reply ↓ Stein April 1, 2017 at 7:58 am I was left under the impression that naked capitalism endorses the bail out of Italian banks. Has that changed? Reply ↓ Ignim Brites April 1, 2017 at 2:55 pm Why are NPLs important in determining the solvency of a bank? Certainly, the bank doesn’t have to pay to keep them on their books. So they are neither an asset or a liability. All that is relevant are performing loans, i.e. income, to liabilities. Now, it is certainly probable that banks have taken on liabilities in the expectation that what are now NPLs would be performing. And that is the core of the problem. But the measurement of the extent of the problem is simply income, future and current, based on performing assets vs liabilities, future and current.

Not only did Republicans capture the White House and maintain control of both chambers of Congress, they mopped up in the states as well. After the dust settled, Republicans held 33 governorships — tying a nearly century-old high-watermark — and controlled 25 state governments from top to bottom. One exception to this trend was Delaware, where I ended my term as governor on January 16, 2017. As I tucked my wedding picture, my NASCAR Starter Flag, and a few other sentimental items from my desk into a cardboard box, I had the satisfaction of knowing that my friend and fellow Democrat John Carney would be taking the next turn here. Moreover, John’s term would begin the 25th consecutive year that Delaware has had a Democratic governor. There are only two states with a longer streak and both are 3,000 miles away: Oregon and Washington. We are unique even amongst our otherwise blue-state neighbors, such as New Jersey and Maryland, where Republicans currently sit in the governor’s mansion. How has Delaware resisted the tide of Trumpism? Delaware is not immune to the ups and downs of the national economy. Certainly, the state suffered during the Great Recession, and our residents have faced their share of hardships. But I would also like to think that our state has done a better job than most at keeping the forces that led to Trump’s victory — the destructive anxieties bred by economic insecurity — at bay. Like President Obama, I won election in the midst of the deepening financial crisis and immediately had to govern through a blizzard of economic howitzers. Just after the recession hit, Chrysler and General Motors closed their local plants in Newark and Wilmington, leading to the loss of thousands of jobs. So did a major oil refinery. The poultry industry, a vital rural sector in Delaware, went into a tailspin, and one of our major producers fell into bankruptcy. And as Wall Street staggered, the back office financial services workforce housed in Delaware was slashed. All told, in the space of about a year, eight percent of Delaware jobs — 35,300 jobs — vanished, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To put that into context, that would translate into a loss of 11 million jobs nationwide. But as I left office, Delaware was enjoying the best job growth in our region since we hit bottom in 2010, an unemployment rate of 4.3 percent at the end of 2016, among the fastest-rising private sector wages in the nation (17.8 percent over the last two years), and a recent ranking as one of the three strongest state economies. More importantly, what we built during my tenure as governor was a slate of innovative new programs aimed at ensuring that every Delaware resident has a shot at sharing in the state’s growth. If there is any antidote to Trumpism, it’s broadly shared middle class prosperity. President Obama led the nation from the brink of depression back to health. But it wasn’t enough to rest on national economic indicators suggesting the country was on the right track. Many Americans and Delawareans were clearly still pessimistic about the opportunities that lay ahead for themselves and their families. Sweeping economic change was afoot. Factories that once sustained towns in Delaware and across the nation were shuttered. Jobs were outsourced overseas and to technology. If these problems weren’t addressed, voters and communities that felt ignored or patronized would seek solace elsewhere – including by turning to leaders whose views are extremist or counterproductive. If there is any antidote to Trumpism, it’s broadly shared middle class prosperity.So rather than simply picking on easy targets — such as big banks and Wall Street — I used my time in office to build an economic message and strategy centered on creating middle class jobs that would include everyone in our state.  This strategy had three primary ingredients: (1) focusing relentlessly on skills, for all residents at all stages of their careers; (2) engaging with the global marketplace to expand opportunities for Delaware’s entrepreneurs and companies, while attracting more companies to our state; and (3) promoting local economic development through projects to invest in city centers. As Democrats look to rebuild their electoral strength from the bottom up, the lynchpin of their strategy should be an economic agenda that fights Trumpism at its roots — by equipping all Americans with the tools they need to adapt to a rapidly changing economy and to look to the future with confidence, not fear. As small as Delaware may be, the path we’ve taken has larger lessons for how to restore economic opportunity in this country and rebuild faith in government’s role as a force for good in people’s lives. Skills for All Delaware has long been part of the global economy by simple virtue of the fact that many of the nation’s largest and best-known companies — including 60 percent of the companies in the Fortune 500 — are legally domiciled in our state. Delaware is also home to the corporate headquarters of such major firms as DuPont, AstraZeneca and Sallie Mae. Without doubt, Delaware’s status as the “corporate capital of the world” has been a boon to our state. But it has been a priority of mine — as it should be for all — to ensure that the prosperity companies enjoy creates opportunities for individuals as well. In Delaware, one way we’ve done this is to invest heavily in the skills of our citizens. Companies have more choices than ever about where to locate and hire. And technology means rote factory and service jobs that used to provide a good wage and benefits no longer exist. Delaware company leaders told me they would innovate, create jobs, and grow the economy here if they could find a skilled workforce that could learn and grow on the job. The work of MIT professors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee also proved to us that even amid economic uncertainty, there has never been a better time to be someone with the right skills, but never a worse time to be someone without those skills. In evaluating our own workforce, we discovered that more people in our state, like most of America, need credentials beyond a high school diploma. That’s why improving people’s skills — from pre-K to pre-retirement — is now an overarching and urgent priority. For example, the state provided a $250,000 grant, together with business and philanthropic partners, to help launch Zip Code Wilmington, Delaware’s first coding school and one of the first nonprofit coding schools in the country. ZipCode Wilmington offers a 12-week coding boot camp in Java and Javascript, followed by a 26-week paid apprenticeship. Anyone with a high school education can apply, and the program offers need-based scholarships for those who can’t afford the fees. Since its launch in late 2015, more than 100 graduates have found jobs, and their average salaries have grown from $25,000 to nearly $65,000. These graduates include professionals like Dawn Milnamow. Six months after struggling to get a full-time job, she was hired by JP Morgan Chase in an information technology position that nearly tripled her annual salary. The state also created a Pathways to Prosperity initiative, based on research from Harvard University about the disconnect between what students learn in school and the skills they need in the workforce. The program began with 30 high school juniors spending hundreds of hours in a manufacturing program at the state’s community college, Delaware Tech. Program administrators worked with the state manufacturing association and a community college to develop coursework. The kids got summer internships at companies making products like fuel cells and earned industry-recognized credentials along with college credits. Today, 6,000 students are in similar programs across a dozen growing industries. In addition to these efforts to create new opportunities for Delawareans already in or about to enter the workforce, we also took steps to ensure that more kids, especially those from lower-income households, were encouraged to pursue college and were ready to succeed. For instance, the SAT exam is now free for high school juniors, and the College Board now provides up to 8 college admissions application fee waivers per student for low income students. Colleges and universities now partner with high schools to reduce the need for remedial classes for matriculating students. The state’s youngest residents — the future engine of Delaware’s — are also now getting a better start. More than ten percent of kindergarten students in Delaware public schools (and more than 3,000 from k-4) are learning Chinese or Spanish in an immersion setting. Only Utah has done as much to help young kids learn a foreign language. By ninth grade they will be fully fluent, gaining a huge advantage over their future peers competing for jobs. And as part of our efforts to broaden opportunity for all children, high-quality early childhood centers now receive financial incentives to enroll low income kids while centers serving poor communities are getting the support to improve. As a result, 70 percent of children from low-income families are enrolled in a high-quality program, versus just 5 percent in 2011. Thousands more children are also receiving early mental health consultations and developmental screenings. All of what we achieved in Delaware can be achieved in all of our states and the country as a whole when our leaders are willing to stare reality in the face. It didn’t cost a ton of money; it didn’t generate political tantrums; and it was responsive to what businesses needed and people in our state wanted for themselves and their kids. As small as Delaware may be, the path we’ve taken has larger lessons for how to restore economic opportunity in this country and rebuild faith in government’s role as a force for good in people’s lives. A Global Delaware Nationally, the trade debate has been fraught. But in Delaware, we sidestepped that discussion to focus on things that help communities and create jobs, because globalization, like the weather, is something we can complain about but not change. Rather than turning inward, my administration pursued a strategy that was resolutely outward bound. We worked aggressively to grow Delaware’s global presence as an exporter of goods and services produced by our state’s residents and to market the state as a desirable destination for global investment. As one result, Delaware exports rose by $250 million between 2012 and 2015. In fact, our exports rose faster than every state on the eastern seaboard except New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Georgia. We doubled down on strategies that states have long pursued to grow their global footprint, such as organizing trade missions to help Delaware farmers and manufacturers establish relationships abroad. On one trip, we took four Delaware vegetable farmers to Canada and each left with agreements with some of the biggest Canadian distributors to sell their products. Delaware’s first state-led business trips to Mexico led to an estimated $11.2 million in additional sales.  Over just one and a half years, the program supported 40 Delaware businesses on trade missions to Canada, Mexico, Germany and South Korea.  The program cost the state about $70,000 but will generate an expected $16 million in export sales over the next 18 months – a terrific return on investment. On the other side of the ledger, my administration worked hard to woo foreign companies that would create good jobs in the state and invest in our communities. For instance, a Korean poultry company, Harim, rescued a closing facility in Southern Delaware, buying a facility that now employs nearly 1,500 people – nearly equal to the population of the town in which it is located. A Berlin-based tech incubator is opening its first non-German facility in Delaware to help German start-ups that want to do business in the U.S. To attract these new firms, we emphasized our efforts to support a strong workforce and positioned Delaware as a place of “soft-landing” where entrepreneurs have assistance dealing with streamlined licensing and permitting processes. iStock As more Americans opt for urban lifestyles, cities like Wilmington are revitalizing their central business districts. Make Downtown Happen The third leg of Delaware’s strategy over the last eight years was downtown revitalization. Smaller cities like Wilmington and former manufacturing hubs like Erie and Scranton suffered the most when globalization, automation, and new technologies decimated industries that once offered plentiful good-paying jobs, particularly in manufacturing. But these areas have great bone structures. We saw an opportunity to renovate abandoned property, attract new residents and businesses, and revitalize our downtowns. So in Delaware, we created Downtown Development Districts — designated areas in our cities and towns that qualify for development incentives and other benefits to attract residential, commercial, industrial, and mixed use development. We require the municipalities to provide a blueprint for how and where they want development to occur, so we can evaluate which plans make the most sense for the residents and all taxpayers, not just for a developer’s bottom line. Investors who make qualified real estate improvements receive grants for up to 20 percent of their costs above $25,000. Projects can be anything from a non-profit housing agency wanting to renovate a single abandoned property to a for-profit entity building a transformative project that involves residential units upstairs and shops downstairs. Among the results: A condemned parking lot in Wilmington is being replaced with 200 residential units and retail shops. And in Milford, small businesses are performing long-needed construction and renovations. Through $17.7 million in grants from the Delaware State Housing Authority, the three districts targeted for revitalization in the first phase of this strategy have attracted more than $329 million in investments. A second round of grants, for $3.6 million, will help five other districts in the state. While some investments have supported our biggest cities, the program is designed just as much to revitalize smaller, rural areas that, because of a less diverse economy, have been the hardest hit by the 21st century economic transformation. In Seaford, a town in southern Delaware decimated by the closing of DuPont’s nylon plant in the 1980s, we have seen the most significant investment in decades, including a new apartment building with high-end units right on the Nanticoke River. From 2000 to 2010, downtowns in America’s major cities experienced double-digit growth. That was more than twice their rate of overall growth. As more Americans, particularly college-educated young adults, opt for urban lifestyles, cities have a chance to revitalize their central business districts. That means there is more potential than ever in small and medium cities to build opportunity and make downtown exciting and vital again. When I first got into politics, Delaware wasn’t a Democratic state. During the 1990s, we had Republicans in the governor’s mansion, U.S. Senate and our lone House seat. While every state is in some ways a snowflake, the Delaware experience holds important lessons for the rest of the country. Our small size belies our diversity. We have urban centers and rural communities, a growing financial sector as well as a vital agricultural industry. (Chickens, in fact, far outnumber people.) As for the so-called Rising American Electorate of Millennials and minorities — yes, we have our share — but we also have one of the fastest-growing elderly populations in the country, a group that trends Republican. The struggles of our people, cities, and towns are very similar to those struggles in the interior of the country where the new economy threatens to pass many people by. When I first got into politics, Delaware wasn’t a Democratic state. During the 1990s, we had Republicans in the governor’s mansion, U.S. Senate and our lone House seat. Delaware voted for George H.W. Bush and twice for Ronald Reagan. Looking at Delaware now, we don’t profile as an obvious Democratic state. Yet Democrats have won here consistently since the turn of the century. In 1998, when I was first elected as Treasurer, Democrats held only three of the nine state and federal offices; it’s seven of nine today. The increasing abandonment of the Democratic Party happening in other states has not happened here. Democratic enrollment, in fact, has surged from an 8-point edge in 2000 to a 19-point margin today.  Globalization and technology are equal parts exciting and petrifying. What I realized as a Democratic governor is that I had to address both with the same level of passion. On one hand was the amazing potential generated from cutting edge ideas and on the other was the emptiness felt by those left on the sidelines. Throughout my tenure, the question I wrestled with was this: How do you create opportunity in an environment in which the only constant is constant change? In Delaware, we unraveled these riddles with a relentless focus on skills and education, on tying ourselves to the globe instead of running from it, and making our downtowns a full partner in the state’s success. Yes, other governors in other states have certainly pursued elements of the strategy we pursued in our state – and we all have much to learn from them, but it was the combination of these pieces – plus the belief that an active government could be the major force to make good things happen – that has kept Delaware moving forward when so many other areas of the country have struggled. These are lessons that any state can replicate – as can Congress and as should the President. Jack Markell Jack Markell served as Governor of Delaware from 2009 to 2017 and as State Treasurer from 1999 to 2009. He is also a past chair of the Democratic Governors Association and the National Governors Association.

But before Daniel Tarullo walks out the door of the U.S. central bank, he has some parting advice for the Trump administration: Leave Dodd-Frank alone. In his final speech at Princeton University on Tuesday, the outgoing Fed governor objected to efforts by the White House and Congress to weaken the rules that regulate the country's banks, making the case that American taxpayers shouldn't bear the risk of fewer safeguards protecting the financial system. Tarullo said it's "crucial" that banks continue to maintain strong capital, especially the largest banks. "Neither regulators nor legislators should agree to change that would effectively weaken that regime, whether directly or indirectly," said Tarullo in prepared remarks. "It would be tragic if the lessons of the financial crisis were forgotten so quickly." Appointed by President Obama in 2009, Tarullo is the Fed's key voice on bank supervision. For the past eight years, the 64-year old Massachusetts native has spearheaded efforts to impose tighter restrictions on U.S. banks in order to avert a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. He led the charge in requiring banks to undergo a yearly stress test to ensure firms can continue to lend even at the brink of a meltdown. He's also pressed for the biggest U.S. banks to hold higher amounts of better quality capital. Related: Tough federal bank regulator calls it quits Wall Street has often depicted Tarullo as a tyrant, arguing tougher rules have crimped lending and stifled economic growth. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon have been pushing for changes for years, arguing the industry has been too constrained by the 2010 regulatory reform law. But Tarullo has stood firm. "Eight years at the Federal Reserve has only reinforced my belief that strong capital requirements are central to a safe and stable financial system," said Tarullo. Raised in Woburn, Massachusetts, Tarullo grew up in a predominantly Italian and Irish middle-class suburb of Boston and graduated from Roxbury Latin School in 1969. He attended Georgetown University and went on to receive a law degree from the University of Michigan. In 1981, he paused his law practice in Washington to teach at Harvard Law School. He later returned to D.C. to advise Senator Edward Kennedy on employment and labor market issues and would later work in the Clinton White House in various economic policy roles. A pivotal moment in Tarullo's career came as he was getting ready to leave the Clinton White House. Discussions were beginning about crafting a bill that would replace the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law separating commercial and investment banks. It was then that he began to worry about how the financial industry was being regulated. His intellectual curiosity shifted to bank capital: the only regulatory instrument he believed policymakers had control over. It would become the focus of his work at Georgetown and the subject of his book. Daniel Tarullo is stepping down from his post as a member of the Fed's board of governors on Wednesday. In 2005, Tarullo met then-Illinois Senator Barack Obama at an informal policy dinner, and gradually became an important resource for the campaign's policy staff as it became clear a full blown financial crisis was imminent. Tarullo's influence would help shape one of the two speeches Obama would give days after the 2008 collapse of Bear Sterns -- laying the groundwork for what eventually would become Dodd-Frank. After helping to lead the new president's economic transition team, Obama nominated Tarullo to a 14-year term as a member of the board of governors. In May 2009, just months after arriving at the Fed, he would play an instrumental role in the first round of stress tests conducted on the largest U.S. banks. Tarullo then argued that the Fed should release the results to the public to allay market fears of how badly the banks were faring at the time. It was a risky and controversial decision, but it laid the groundwork for the Fed's annual stress tests. "The quick action in assessing the firms, recapitalizing them where needed, and sharing the results of the stress tests with the public stands as one of the turning points in the crisis," Tarullo said, recollecting that first trial. Related: Get ready for Trump's team of Wall Street watchdogs Tarullo's departure Wednesday will give Trump, who has called the Dodd-Frank reform of Wall Street a "disaster," greater rein to fill the vacancy with an official who will offer a lighter touch when it comes to overseeing the banks. In addition to Tarullo's seat, Trump will also have the chance to fill two other vacancies on the board, along with one more early next year when Janet Yellen's term as chairwoman expires. But Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at policy analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics, said any proposed changes would stop short of a complete overhaul. "Even if the Trump administration's appointees to the Fed seek to dismantle much of this -- and I suspect they will -- change will take time and only partially restructure the rules that have totally redefined American finance," Petrou told CNNMoney. In February, Trump signed an executive order, setting into motion the administration's game plan for scaling back what he views as overly burdensome financial rules. Trump's order for a regulatory review won't roll back regulations by itself. Congress will need to approve some policy changes, while others will need to be implemented by financial regulators the president hasn't appointed yet. Still, that hasn't kept the president from repeating his campaign promise to dismantle the reform law. "We're going to do a very major haircut on Dodd-Frank," said Trump at a town hall with CEOs, including Citigroup (C) boss Michael Corbat. "We want strong restrictions. We want strong regulation, but not regulation that makes it impossible for the banks to loan to people that are going to create jobs," Trump continued. Related: Democrats seek probe over weakening SEC's subpoena The Trump administration has singled out one provision of Dodd-Frank: the Volcker Rule, which bans the largest banks from taking bets with taxpayer money as a target. Two other potential marks: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a requirement that advisers on retirement accounts work in the best interest of their clients. On Tuesday, Tarullo agreed there's room for change on certain aspects of the reform law, including the Volcker Rule, which he said may be "too complicated." He said he also supported lifting the asset threshold of $50 billion, which triggers whether banks face tougher restrictions. For several years, Tarullo has endorsed raising the threshold significantly and exempting community banks from some of the rules under Dodd-Frank. And while there's room for debate, Tarullo said critical aspects of the reform law, particularly stress tests, should not be altered. He said proposals to remove the Fed's ability to approve a bank's payout to shareholders based on the results of their stress test were "ill-advised." Tarullo also strongly advised against giving banks deeper instructions on the annual exam to avoid firms from gaming the system. The Fed governor hasn't announced what his next role will be. For now, he'll return to Boston for several weeks as a distinguished fellow at MIT's Golub Center for Finance and Policy. In the meantime, his legacy hangs in the balance as proposed changes surface. "We're going to have to wait-and-see what changes are made to the Dodd-Frank rules," said Brian Gardner, a policy analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods told CNNMoney. "How deep is the roots of the work that he's done? I suspect it's pretty deep."

But before Daniel Tarullo walks out the door of the U.S. central bank, he has some parting advice for the Trump administration: Leave Dodd-Frank alone. In his final speech at Princeton University on Tuesday, the outgoing Fed governor objected to efforts by the White House and Congress to weaken the rules that regulate the country's banks, making the case that American taxpayers shouldn't bear the risk of fewer safeguards protecting the financial system. Tarullo said it's "crucial" that banks continue to maintain strong capital, especially the largest banks. "Neither regulators nor legislators should agree to change that would effectively weaken that regime, whether directly or indirectly," said Tarullo in prepared remarks. "It would be tragic if the lessons of the financial crisis were forgotten so quickly." Appointed by President Obama in 2009, Tarullo is the Fed's key voice on bank supervision. For the past eight years, the 64-year old Massachusetts native has spearheaded efforts to impose tighter restrictions on U.S. banks in order to avert a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. He led the charge in requiring banks to undergo a yearly stress test to ensure firms can continue to lend even at the brink of a meltdown. He's also pressed for the biggest U.S. banks to hold higher amounts of better quality capital. Wall Street has often depicted Tarullo as a tyrant, arguing tougher rules have crimped lending and stifled economic growth. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon have been pushing for changes for years, arguing the industry has been too constrained by the 2010 regulatory reform law. But Tarullo has stood firm. "Eight years at the Federal Reserve has only reinforced my belief that strong capital requirements are central to a safe and stable financial system," said Tarullo. Raised in Woburn, Massachusetts, Tarullo grew up in a predominantly Italian and Irish middle-class suburb of Boston and graduated from Roxbury Latin School in 1969. He attended Georgetown University and went on to receive a law degree from the University of Michigan. In 1981, he paused his law practice in Washington to teach at Harvard Law School. He later returned to D.C. to advise Senator Edward Kennedy on employment and labor market issues and would later work in the Clinton White House in various economic policy roles. A pivotal moment in Tarullo's career came as he was getting ready to leave the Clinton White House. Discussions were beginning about crafting a bill that would replace the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law separating commercial and investment banks. It was then that he began to worry about how the financial industry was being regulated. His intellectual curiosity shifted to bank capital: the only regulatory instrument he believed policymakers had control over. It would become the focus of his work at Georgetown and the subject of his book. In 2005, Tarullo met then-Illinois Senator Barack Obama at an informal policy dinner, and gradually became an important resource for the campaign's policy staff as it became clear a full blown financial crisis was imminent. Tarullo's influence would help shape one of the two speeches Obama would give days after the 2008 collapse of Bear Sterns -- laying the groundwork for what eventually would become Dodd-Frank. After helping to lead the new president's economic transition team, Obama nominated Tarullo to a 14-year term as a member of the board of governors. In May 2009, just months after arriving at the Fed, he would play an instrumental role in the first round of stress tests conducted on the largest U.S. banks. Tarullo then argued that the Fed should release the results to the public to allay market fears of how badly the banks were faring at the time. It was a risky and controversial decision, but it laid the groundwork for the Fed's annual stress tests. "The quick action in assessing the firms, recapitalizing them where needed, and sharing the results of the stress tests with the public stands as one of the turning points in the crisis," Tarullo said, recollecting that first trial. Tarullo's departure Wednesday will give Trump, who has called the Dodd-Frank reform of Wall Street a "disaster," greater rein to fill the vacancy with an official who will offer a lighter touch when it comes to overseeing the banks. In addition to Tarullo's seat, Trump will also have the chance to fill two other vacancies on the board, along with one more early next year when Janet Yellen's term as chairwoman expires. But Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at policy analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics, said any proposed changes would stop short of a complete overhaul. "Even if the Trump administration's appointees to the Fed seek to dismantle much of this -- and I suspect they will -- change will take time and only partially restructure the rules that have totally redefined American finance," Petrou told CNNMoney. In February, Trump signed an executive order, setting into motion the administration's game plan for scaling back what he views as overly burdensome financial rules. Trump's order for a regulatory review won't roll back regulations by itself. Congress will need to approve some policy changes, while others will need to be implemented by financial regulators the president hasn't appointed yet. Still, that hasn't kept the president from repeating his campaign promise to dismantle the reform law. "We're going to do a very major haircut on Dodd-Frank," said Trump at a town hall with CEOs, including Citigroup (C) boss Michael Corbat. "We want strong restrictions. We want strong regulation, but not regulation that makes it impossible for the banks to loan to people that are going to create jobs," Trump continued. The Trump administration has singled out one provision of Dodd-Frank: the Volcker Rule, which bans the largest banks from taking bets with taxpayer money as a target. Two other potential marks: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a requirement that advisers on retirement accounts work in the best interest of their clients. On Tuesday, Tarullo agreed there's room for change on certain aspects of the reform law, including the Volcker Rule, which he said may be "too complicated." He said he also supported lifting the asset threshold of $50 billion, which triggers whether banks face tougher restrictions. For several years, Tarullo has endorsed raising the threshold significantly and exempting community banks from some of the rules under Dodd-Frank. And while there's room for debate, Tarullo said critical aspects of the reform law, particularly stress tests, should not be altered. He said proposals to remove the Fed's ability to approve a bank's payout to shareholders based on the results of their stress test were "ill-advised." Tarullo also strongly advised against giving banks deeper instructions on the annual exam to avoid firms from gaming the system. The Fed governor hasn't announced what his next role will be. For now, he'll return to Boston for several weeks as a distinguished fellow at MIT's Golub Center for Finance and Policy. In the meantime, his legacy hangs in the balance as proposed changes surface. "We're going to have to wait-and-see what changes are made to the Dodd-Frank rules," said Brian Gardner, a policy analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods told CNNMoney. "How deep is the roots of the work that he's done? I suspect it's pretty deep." TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

AGENCIES Facebook Twitter Google+ WhatsApp Email President Donald Trump has promised sweeping reforms to "horrendous" US banking regulations that were introduced after the financial crisis. "We're going to do a very major haircut on Dodd-Frank," he said, referring to the Wall Street and consumer protection rules Barack Obama enacted in 2010. Dodd-Frank aimed to prevent banks taking on too much risk and to separate their investment and commercial arms. But Trump said he wants "some very strong" change to help the bank sector. "We want strong restrictions, we want strong regulation. But not regulation that makes it impossible for the banks to loan to people that are going to create jobs," the president told a group of about 50 business leaders at a White House meeting. "We're going to be doing things that are going to be very good for the banking industry so that the banks can loan money to people who need it." Trump had promised during his election campaign to relax rules on big banks, and subsequently ordered a review of the industry's regulations. Michelle Fleury, the BBC's New York business correspondent, says Republican policymakers are trying to see how they can pay for tax cuts. "They are trying to see if there is anything in Dodd-Frank that would save the government money and be used for tax reform," our correspondent says. 'Costly and confusing' But she added that any change would require a major piece of legislation passing through Congress. And Trump's failure to push through healthcare reformshad shown how tough this might be. The president's remarks have the backing of Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of one of the world's biggest banks, JP Morgan Chase. In his annual letter to shareholders, released on Tuesday, he said the regulatory burden "is unnecessarily complex, costly and sometimes confusing". Dodd-Frank was designed to resolve the too-big-to-fail problem that meant banks facing collapse had to be bailed out rather than wound down. But Dimon said banks had essentially solved this issue by boosting the capital they held in reserve and introducing tougher risk controls.

That’s good news for Brookfield’s new 2.216-square-foot tower at One Manhattan West, which still has 1.3 million square feet to rent from the 6th to part of the 23rd floors, and again from 46th to the top 67th floor. The mid-range floors have already attracted law firm Skadden Arps with 610,793 square feet on 28 through 45 and the National Hockey League with 160,625 square feet on the 23rd to 27th floors along with its retail store at the base. It is likely, however, that both Google and the television station portions of Scripps are more attracted to the fairy-dust transformation of the 2.15 million-square-foot Brutalist industrial-design 450 W. 33 St. into the more cheery, glass and tech friendly 5 Manhattan West. Brookfield spent $300 million in improvements that include a floor-to-ceiling ladder curtain wall designed by Joshua Prince Ramus of REX Architecture that by itself has attracted a bevy of lookers. While declining to confirm or discuss individual tenants, Brookfield executive David Cheikin said Brookfield is talking to tech and media firms for what are about 78,000- to 130,000-square-foot floor plates. “The energy and vibe and reception in the market [at Manhattan West] is very similar to what was happening at Brookfield Place,” Cheikin said. “People can see what the vision is and it is aligning with the corporate requirements.” Bruce Mosler of Cushman & Wakefield, who is leading the agency team, says, “We can now offer a tenant as much as 700,000 square feet and have three times that in demand.” Some of that space includes the top three floors that have 27-foot-high ceilings and a desirable 10,000-square-foot terrace. Rents range up to $105 per square foot. JPMorgan and the Financial Information Services Agency are among the tenants, and Whole Foods has just signed for 65,000 square feet where it will have plenty of additional indoor and outdoor seating. Scripps Food Network and television shows including “Cooking,” now operate out of a 165,227-square-foot lease at Chelsea Market on floors 2-6 that CoStar data show expires in mid-2021. Sources said that lease is coterminous with the one for 120,721 square feet at 1180 Sixth Ave., where it has been located since 1997. Scripps is also represented by Cushman & Wakefield, which declined comment. A Scripps spokesman said, “As a media company, we are always looking at spaces — which is how we found Chelsea Market — but we are a long way from acting on it.” Accenture, the former Andersen Consulting that is now a giant global consultancy expanding into tech, digital, cloud and security, is said to be looking for several hundred thousand square feet through different brokers. It has space in several locations, including 155 Sixth Ave. and at 1345 Sixth. As with any large corporate space search, it is also likely to be looking at other new towers in Hudson Yards and the World Trade Center along with Midtown. A spokesman for Accenture had no comment. As for Google, the company keeps creating and adding divisions along with hundreds of thousands of square feet around its 111 Eighth Ave. core in other hip buildings, including 450,000 square feet in Chelsea Market and 260,000 square feet at the upcoming Superpier 57, and so its interest in 5 Manhattan West is a natural fit.

Dividends are emerging as a key lure for investors in the world’s second-largest share market, with stocks of companies that consistently hand out the most cash outperforming the Shanghai Composite Index by the most since 2013. The catch? These plays are few and far between with China renowned as one of the stingiest markets globally when it comes to shareholder payouts. “What we’re finding fascinating is the whole yield story in China — you’d never think investors would look at China” for dividends, Catherine Yeung, an investment director at Fidelity International, which manages about US$290 billion (RM1.29 billion), said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “This trend is likely to continue and it’s going to bode well for these companies from a foreign investment perspective.” Despite this historic reluctance to embrace dividends, China has emerged as one of the best dividend trades this year, with Chinese payout stocks outperforming the market more than those in the US and Europe, where yield has been popular since the global financial crisis. The Shanghai Dividend Index climbed 0.6 per cent early Wednesday, swelling its advance this year to 7.4 per cent. Investors have long pushed for better yields from Chinese equity markets, which are dominated by state-run companies not necessarily attuned to the demands of international shareholders. More than a quarter of companies in the Shanghai Composite didn’t announce a dividend in their most recent results, while those that do pay shell out an average 35 per cent of their profits to shareholders, compared with 79 per cent for European companies and 57 per cent globally, data compiled by Bloomberg show. What’s changed is the government’s attitude. Beijing is urging state-owned enterprises to focus on dividends as part of a wider restructuring of SOEs. The securities regulator will “talk to” listed companies that don’t pay dividends but are capable of doing so, spokesman Deng Ge said March 31. “Tough measures” may be employed against them, he said. Market speculation The pressure seems to be paying off. State-run China Shenhua Energy Co., the country’s biggest coal miner, caused a stir last month when it issued a special dividend, spurring a 10 per cent surge in its mainland-traded shares and fuelling speculation over which companies could be next. For fund manager Lilian Leung, yield is unseating the economy as a reason to buy into Chinese stocks. “Many of these companies just started paying dividends,” said Leung, who manages JPMorgan Asset Management’s China Income Fund from Hong Kong. “As the economy slows, there’s a greater understanding that these strategies work in Asia too, and that China isn’t just about growth.” Chinese dividends haven’t escaped the attention of investors outside the region, either. Matthews International Capital Management LLC set up as many as 3,000 meetings last year to discuss dividend policies with companies in China, said Sherwood Zhang, a money manager at the San Francisco-based firm, which oversees about US$26 billion. “Finding companies that pay sustainable dividends is more about willingness,” Zhang said. “They still want to preserve capital, and think you shouldn’t care about dividends if you believe in growth.” Jefferies Group LLC is doubtful the market will see more dividend manoeuvres like Shenhua’s, and other investors have suggested the special payout was more about its parent company’s need for cash following a downturn in the coal industry. China Mobile Ltd., which some analysts tipped as capable of a Shenhua-like move, saw more than US$8 billion of its market value wiped out after its dividend disappointed investors last month. The danger when it comes to the Chinese dividend play is that it could attract income-starved investors looking for bond proxies. They could then dump the shares when yields rise, said Robert Davis, who manages NN Investment Partners BV’s emerging-market dividend fund in Brussels. While policy tightening poses a threat to dividend trades, China has cheap valuations on its side, according to Davis. The Shanghai dividend gauge, which is composed largely of banks, utilities and industrial companies, trades at 9.7 times estimated earnings, 26 per cent below the benchmark’s valuation, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “It’s an idea that actually is quite well suited to this point in emerging markets,” said Davis, who counts China as his fund’s largest geographical allocation. “China will be a more fertile hunting ground for dividends.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Ringgit opens higher against US dollar China becomes US’ biggest oil buyer as exports hit record Kim Dotcom announces new Bitcoin venture for content uploaders to earn money Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Activist targets GM share structure, board Second Australia miner declares force majeure in wake of Cyclone Debbie Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles As oil prices falter, fears return on BP and Shell dividends China stock bulls turn wary as growth sparks tightening risk China shares’ power surge leaves global investors sceptical LTAT declares 12pc dividend, bonus for FY16 Morgan Stanley: China’s stocks are set for a bright decade Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The company officially surpassed number two US carmaker Ford on Monday after reporting better-than-expected first quarter sales during the same news cycle, in which general US auto sales disappointed for March.  Shares of Tesla rose 1.74 per cent at closing yesterday to US$303.70 (RM1,346) per share, lifting its market capitalisation to US$49.4 billion, US$4 billion more than Ford’s and around US$1.9 billion below that of top US automaker General Motors. Tesla still makes and sells a fraction of the cars of those established giants, meaning that its rise on Wall Street is due to expectations that its pioneering work on electric cars will ultimately carry the day. Tesla’s most important offering on the mass sales front is the Model 3, which is still under development and aimed at the middle market with a far more affordable price than Tesla’s first two autos, the Model S and Model X. Founder Elon Musk celebrated the company’s surging stock price on Twitter, mocking sceptics with the barb “Stormy weather in Shortville,” a reference to “short sellers” who have lost money betting the stock would fall. Still, the significance of Tesla’s latest surge on Wall Street should not be exaggerated, JPMorgan Chase suggested in an investor note yesterday.  Tesla’s “modestly stronger trend to Model S & X deliveries does not necessarily read across directly to a smoother launch for the Model 3, which we believe drives valuation for that stock,” it said. Other questions surrounding the company include scrutiny of its autopilot technology and the wisdom of its 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, panned by many Wall Street analysts when it was first announced. Frowning on Detroit Tesla Model 3 is on track to begin production in July, with output gradually ramping up to what executives say will be 5,000 vehicles weekly by the end of this year. The Model 3 is priced at a moderate US$35,000 in the United States. The company says it expects to reach 500,000 cars per year in 2018. However, some are sceptical about that timeframe. Morgan Stanley said in a note last month that it does not expect a volume of 500,000 cars per year until 2024. It confirmed its “overweight rating” for Tesla on Monday with a target of US$305 in a note highlighting Tesla’s pioneering safety technology features. Tesla’s rise is part of a broader shakeout in American industry led by Silicon Valley that has shifted Detroit’s vernacular to speak in terms of “mobility” beyond cars and greater priority for autonomous features. Ford has ramped up its technology efforts and vowed to produce a fully autonomous car in 2021. GM, which has also pursued autonomous driving technology, has launched a mid-priced electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt. It sells for US$30,000, including US tax subsidies. Still, those cars are struggling to win plaudits from investors. Last week, activist investor David Einhorn proposed the creation of two classes of GM stock for better valuation. However, the company has fought that plan, calling it untested and risky. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Ringgit opens higher against US dollar China becomes US’ biggest oil buyer as exports hit record Kim Dotcom announces new Bitcoin venture for content uploaders to earn money Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Activist targets GM share structure, board Second Australia miner declares force majeure in wake of Cyclone Debbie Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles US stocks fall as March auto sales disappoint Tesla delivers quarterly record of 25,000 vehicles in Q1 2017 SpaceX hails ‘revolution’ after recycled rocket launch, landing (VIDEO) Ford boosts research in Canada for connected cars Musk diving into minds while reaching for Mars Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
Sections Deseret NewsFamily Family Michelle Singletary: Yes, pro athletes often make poor money decisions early in their careers, but didn't you, too? By Michelle Singletary For the Deseret News Published: April 4, 2017 8:05 p.m. Updated: 7 hours ago + Leave a comment View 1 Item Shutterstock If you came into the millions like some pro athletes do in their late teens or early 20s, would you really do things differently than you did — or are currently doing — with your thousands? WASHINGTON — As I watch the young men hustle on the basketball court during March Madness, and make what seem like impossible 3-point shots, part of me is thinking, "Ka-ching!" And just as quickly, I wonder how many of those young men, a few of whom eventually make it to the NBA, will leave the league broke after having earned millions. In 2009, Sports Illustrated examined the finances of former NFL and NBA players in a report that still stands as one of the most in-depth looks at athletes and their money. The magazine found that, after just two years of retirement, 78 percent of former NFL players were stressed financially or had gone bankrupt. Sixty percent of former NBA players were broke within five years. I ran an online search for stories about athletes and their finances, and here are some of the headlines that came up: — "Pro Athletes and Their Bad Money Habits" — "10 Pro Athletes Who've Hit Financial Rock Bottom" — "How Pro Athletes Lose Everything" Then there's ESPN's documentary "Broke," which is often cited as evidence that athletes are financially reckless. "Sucked into bad investments, stalked by freeloaders, saddled with medical problems, and naturally prone to showing off, many pro athletes get shocked by harsh economic realities after years of living the high life," the film's summary read upon its release. "Director Billy Corben paints a complex picture of the many forces that drain athletes' bank accounts, placing some of the blame on the culture at large while still holding these giants accountable for their own hubris." We think we know the story. A pro athlete makes a lot of money. He spends wildly on cars, homes, booze, vacations, watches, women, family and his entourage. We shake our heads at the conspicuous consumption and bad business deals. We judge the athletes harshly for their haughty lifestyle. You may think, "If I had that kind of money. " But here's where the judgment lacks context. If you came into the millions like some pro athletes do in their late teens or early 20s, would you really do things differently than you did — or are currently doing — with your thousands? Probably not, insists Maverick Carter, childhood friend and now business partner of basketball superstar LeBron James. In 2015, the two launched Uninterrupted, a digital multimedia network focusing on sports. Its new interview series "Kneading Dough," in partnership with JPMorgan Chase, aims to change the dialogue around the money misadventures of athletes. The debut episode, which you can view at uninterrupted.com, features Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green. Carter hosts. A second-round draft pick, Green says he made $850,000 in his first year in the NBA. He didn't hire a financial manager, as many players do. Instead, he wanted to learn how to manage money on his own. Although he concedes that he earns more than the average American household, he has dreams of becoming mega-wealthy. "Every day, every decision I make, (I ask:) How is this helping me to be a billionaire?" Green says. When Carter asks him about a purchase or decision he made that he later realized was stupid, Green doesn't have to think long. "A $21,000 night at the (night) club," he says. "I had a blast for sure, but I could have had a blast for $4,000." (I wanted to shout as I was watching the episode: "Or $40!") And what did he learn? Green tells Carter he was "hot" because, even considering the millions he makes now, it was wasteful. "That is $21,000 I can never get back." Most of the athletes we are judging make the vast majority of their income in their early 20s, Carter points out when I interview him. They are just out of high school or college and have had little to no time to develop good money-management skills. "Any normal person, no matter how many the zeroes, will establish a certain lifestyle," Carter said. For its part in the venture, Chase says it sees highlighting athletes and their money-management successes and struggles as a different way to reach people and encourage them to save and invest. "Financial fitness and literacy can feel so condescending," said Kristin Lemkau, chief marketing officer for Chase. "We wanted to do something that was more than a bank wagging their finger at people telling them to save." Comment on this story I look forward to peeking into the financial lives of the next athletes profiled because, as Carter and Chase envision the series, it will show what my grandmother always told me: It's not how much money you make that matters. It's how you make do with what you have. Readers can write to Michelle Singletary c/o The Washington Post, 1150 15th St., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20071.

The 10-year yield rose about four basis points to 2.36 percent at 4:10 p.m. in New York, after touching 2.31 percent, Bloomberg Bond Trader data show. The yield spread between five- and 30-year Treasuries widened to about 111 basis points. Research from primary dealers shows views are split about the future shape of the yield curve given the prospect of further rate hikes — a phenomenon that usually leads to flattening — while the Trump administration pledges fiscal stimulus that could prompt steepening.

These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright AFP President Donald Trump has promised sweeping reforms to "horrendous" US banking regulations that were introduced after the financial crisis. "We're going to do a very major haircut on Dodd-Frank," he said, referring to the Wall Street and consumer protection rules Barack Obama enacted in 2010. Dodd-Frank aimed to prevent banks taking on too much risk and to separate their investment and commercial arms. But Mr Trump said he wants "some very strong" change to help the bank sector. "We want strong restrictions, we want strong regulation. But not regulation that makes it impossible for the banks to loan to people that are going to create jobs," the president told a group of about 50 business leaders at a White House meeting. "We're going to be doing things that are going to be very good for the banking industry so that the banks can loan money to people who need it." Mr Trump had promised during his election campaign to relax rules on big banks, and subsequently ordered a review of the industry's regulations. Michelle Fleury, the BBC's New York business correspondent, says Republican policymakers are trying to see how they can pay for tax cuts. "They are trying to see if there is anything in Dodd-Frank that would save the government money and be used for tax reform," our correspondent says. 'Costly and confusing' But she added that any change would require a major piece of legislation passing through Congress. And Mr Trump's failure to push through healthcare reforms had shown how tough this might be. The president's remarks have the backing of Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of one of the world's biggest banks, JP Morgan Chase. In his annual letter to shareholders, released on Tuesday, he said the regulatory burden "is unnecessarily complex, costly and sometimes confusing". Dodd-Frank was designed to resolve the too-big-to-fail problem that meant banks facing collapse had to be bailed out rather than wound down. But Mr Dimon said banks had essentially solved this issue by boosting the capital they held in reserve and introducing tougher risk controls.

Vanity Fair hive Sign In/Up business technology politics the players hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology The Players Sign In/Up Levin Report Trump’s Fake “Town Hall” Was Like a Bad Episode of Veep Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Levin Report Trump’s Fake “Town Hall” Was Like a Bad Episode of Veep Featuring sycophantic questions, rambling answers, and, of course, a comedically oversized chart. by Bess LevinApril 4, 2017 5:09 pm Email Facebook Twitter “No Mr. President, I’ve never seen a chart this big.” By Win McNamee/Getty Images. America’s first C.E.O. president, Donald Trump, held a “town hall” at the White House on Tuesday to discuss “the American business climate.” And, as usual, it was exactly the sort of slow-moving train wreck to which we have gradually become inured over the past several months. Typically, when one hears the phrase ”town hall,” one imagines a public official or leader of some kind taking questions from their constituents or employees, who aren’t always entirely pleased with them. But Trump, who brought his own staff to cheer his C.I.A. speech, doesn’t like to leave such things to chance. Instead, the former reality-TV show host’s “town hall” involved gathering 50 C.E.O.s—two-thirds of whom hailed from Wall Street or the commercial real-estate industry and are hugely bullish on Trump—and forcing them to listen while White House staffers praised his apparently vast accomplishments. The entire embarrassing sideshow was almost funny: Trump himself took the stage to spout sentence fragments about all the “horrendous” regulations he’s going to scrap. Business veteran and First Daughter Ivanka Trump naturally took part in the event. And then there was the amazing question-and-answer portion of the afternoon, which included this softball to end all softballs from Reed Cordish, the assistant to the president for intergovernmental and technology initiatives: “Vice President Pence listed some of the amazing accomplishments that have taken place. Since your election, and your 75 days in office, the stock market has had almost unprecedented sustained growth. Unprecedented confidence from our manufacturing sector and other business sectors leading to massive private-sector investment in job growth. You have gotten rid of regulations that were unnecessary and job stifling. You have strengthened our borders and strengthened our military. You've nominated a great Supreme—superb Supreme Court justice, amongst many other things. How does all that feel?” In addition to essentially being asked by an employee, “When did you first realize how awesome you are?,” Trump used the 45-minute session to tell audience members, who included the chief executives of Citigroup, Blackstone, the New York Stock Exchange, Centerbridge Partners, and Paulson & Co., how he plans to make banking great again. It may or may not surprise you to hear the remarks were long on talking points about how he’s going to kick financial regulations’ asses and short on actual details or substance. “We are absolutely destroying these horrible regulations that have been placed on your heads,” Trump said. “You have regulations that are horrendous—Dodd-Frank is an example of what we’re working on and we’re working on it right now. We are going to do a very major haircut on Dodd-Frank.” Trump has previously claimed Dodd-Frank has prevented his “friends” from borrowing money for their businesses, which is a claim some people might describe as an “alternative fact,” since, according to CNBC, “bank lending to businesses and consumers has continued to hit new highs” since the law went into effect in July 2010. Nevertheless, Trump’s fellow billionaires have apparently impressed upon him the importance of rolling back those regulations, and the president has indicated he is more than willing to oblige. To underscore how terrible regulations are, Trump summoned an aide, D.J. Gribbin, special assistant to the president for infrastructure policy, to present a comically large chart meant to illustrate the many rules one would have to comply with in order to build “a simple highway.” This being the Trump administration, the highway in question was not an actual highway that had been built but a theoretical one that the Trump Team created so that their boss could have a fun prop to play with. Nevertheless, Donny used the visual aid to make the case that “getting a building approved in New York is a horrible thing” and that his administration is going to come to the rescue by “cut[ting] through a lot of red tape” and spending “a lot of money on shovels, not other programs.” Other farcical moments included Trump—who appointed a climate-change skeptic to run the E.P.A. and last week signed executive orders to roll back Obama-era climate-change regulations—unabashedly touting his record on the environment. “And we want environmental—we want environmental protection,” he explained. “I mean, I have won awards on environmental protection. I’m a big believer, believe it or not.” (As The Washington Post has noted, while Trump has repeatedly claimed to have won environmental “awards,” there is little evidence to support his claim.) Because there were no reporters present, save for some pool reporters in the back of the room, there was no one there to ask Trump to elaborate on his many plaques and ribbons for environmental excellence.

Jamie Dimon’s annual letter to JPMorgan shareholders is out and he’s very excited to have a president in the Oval Office who isn’t mean to the business community like Barack Obama. “Our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the years,” Dimon writes. “This progress is a function of continually making important investments, in good times and not so good times, to build our capabilities—people, systems, and products. . . . And this is during a time of unprecedented challenges for banks—both the Great Recession and the extraordinarily diﬃcult legal, regulatory and political environments that followed.” He continued: “We have long contended that these factors explained why bank stock price/earnings ratios were appropriately depressed. And we believe the anticipated reversal of many negatives and the expectation of a more business-friendly environment, coupled with our sustained, strong business results, are among the reasons our stock price has done so well this past year.” Dimon, a Democrat who was initially tight with Obama before their friendship cooled, quickly took to Trump after the Twitter super-user got elected, saying in March he thought Trump was doing a bang-up job. Trump’s big tax plan is missing a few minor elements In the wake of the absolute disaster that was the G.O.P.’s attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, also known as the thing Republicans talked about doing for a full seven years, the White House has said it will turn its efforts to the “big league,” “phenomenal” tax-reform plan that Trump has promised. There are just a few problems. For one, if Trump was apparently blindsided by how “complicated” health care turned out to be, why does he think re-writing the tax code will be any more simple? Then there is the fact that the Treasury Department, which would typically be essential to any such endeavor, is barely staffed. Per The New York Times: Besides Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, none of the 27 other political appointees who staff the department’s leadership have been confirmed, according to the Partnership for Public Service’s nomination tracker. Mr. Trump has announced only six other Treasury appointees and has yet to name anyone as assistant secretary of tax policy — a critical post for spearheading a rewrite of the tax code. Many important deputy under secretary roles also remain unfilled. At the current pace, Mr. Trump’s Treasury appointees might not be in place until summer or later in the year, leaving the department’s staff of career bureaucrats to handle the number crunching for a centerpiece of the president’s legislative agenda. Although Mnuchin has previously said that he wants to push a plan through by August, Trump told the Financial Times over the weekend that he “doesn’t want to talk about timing,” in what perhaps was a rare moment of recognition that this legislating business is hard. But wait, there’s more . . . In other tax-reform news, the White House is reportedly “exploring the creation of two controversial new taxes—a value-added tax and a carbon tax—as part of a broad overhaul of the tax code.” As the Post notes, “many economists view a VAT as a tax that disproportionately hurts lower-income workers.” A carbon tax, on the other hand, would “target the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouses gases in the burning of gasoline, coal, and other fossil fuels,” and would theoretically be supported by many Democrats, though they failed to reach a consensus on the issue when they controlled both Congress and the White House when Obama was in office. Partisan politics is a strange thing. Area Fed president calls it quits Richmond Federal Reserve president Jeffrey Lacker is resigning from his post, effective immediately, after admitting he spoke with an analyst at Medley Global Advisors about the September 2012 Fed meeting, which is generally frowned upon by his employer. And by “frowned upon,” we mean Lacker potentially violated policies that prohibit “providing any profit-making person or organization with a prestige advantage over its competitors.” According to Lacker, he was asked about an “important nonpublic detail” about plans for economic stimulus. “Due to the highly confidential and sensitive nature of this information, I should have declined to comment and perhaps have ended the phone call,” Lacker said in his resignation letter. “Instead, I did not refuse or express my inability to comment and the interview continued,” which strikes us as as the most Fed-speak-y way of saying “I f*cked up big time.” Goldman Sachs C.F.O discusses impending robot takeover Martin Chavez, who was promoted to Goldman’s chief financial officer role following the departure of Gary Cohn for the Trump administration, told Axios yesterday that most of the current jobs at the bank “won’t exist in a decade from now,” though he’s not worried about dwindling employment levels at Goldman because “the firm has plenty of opportunity to expand into other business lines,” provided employees don’t “fight automation for the explicit sake of ‘same job’ protection.” Last year, the Times reported that Chavez had essentially told employees that if all they do is “click buttons,” they should look in the mirror and ask themselves if they’re highly replaceable and, spoiler alert, the answer is yes.

Funds are disappearing faster than they are being created, but that doesn't mean there isn't money to be made, says Maury Fertig, CIO of Relative Value Partners . Discounts narrowed last year, but deals still exist. In the CEF universe, funds are trading at a median discount of 6.5% compared to a 20-year historical median of 5%. Fertig, who is based in Chicago, stopped by Barron's today to chat about CEFs. He highlighted three trading at big discounts boasting juicy yields. Eaton Vance Limited Duration (EVV) yields 7.5%. Fertig likes that it has moderate duration of three years and good balance in terms of credit quality. About 22% of the fund is in triple-A-rated bonds and holds higher-quality mortgage-backed securities. In 2012, it was trading at a premium, but is now trading at a 8.3% discount to net asset value or NAV. AllianzGI NFJ Dividend Interest & Premium Strategy (NFJ) yields 9.3%. The fund predominately holds stocks, but has 27% in convertible bonds. Largest holdings include Wells Fargo (WFC), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). The fund manager's value bent hurt performance in 2015. As net asset value dropped 9%, discouraged investors fled. As value came back into favor last year, the fund did better. It is trading at a 12% discount. Tri-Continental (TY) yields 4.1%. The fund is U.S. centric, holding about 68% of assets in stocks, 13% in corporate debt, 10% in convertible bonds, and 7% in convertible preferreds. Top holdings include Microsoft (MSFT), Bank of America (BAC), and Merck (MRK). Fertig says this is a fund for "patient investors," though performance seems to be coming back already. Last year, the fund returned 14.5%, beating 99% of peer funds. It is trading at a 14.3% discount to NAV.

Alts Equities Smart-Beta New ETFs ETF Ecosystem Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Smart Beta Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2017 → April → Active ETFs May Provide Greater Clarity in Uncertain Conditions Active ETFs May Provide Greater Clarity in Uncertain Conditions April 4, 2017 at 3:44 pm by Max Chen Short-term risks and swings could hit markets and investment portfolios. If investors want to reduce the uncertainties they are facing in an aging pull market, one may turn to actively managed stock exchange traded funds that are better able to manage risks and adapt to changing conditions. On the recent webcast, Does the Bull Market Still Have Legs?, Christopher Davis, Chairman and Portfolio Manager of Davis Advisors, warned that while observers may point to a steadily improving market environment, reality is never so accommodating as markets are unknowable and susceptible to short-term turns. For example, with the Federal Reserve eyeing interest rate normalization ahead, the markets have not showed a good track record in predicting the changes. Since 1982, the six month average forecasted direction of short-term interest rates were incorrect 64% of the time, compared to the actual direction of interest rates. Given the number of unknowns, Davis argued that investors should focus on the specifics and data that is readily available. For instance, what we do know is that equities are more likely to outperform debt securities, especially as the Fed eyes a tighter monetary policy and the U.S. economy continues to slowly expand. Specifically, Davis pointed out that a rise in interest rates will result in a negative price impact in a variety of fixed-income assets. A 1% rise in interest rates could translate to about a -1.9% return in 2-year Treasury notes or a -8.9% return in benchmark 10-year Treasuries. Davis warned that market dips are inevitable and investors often overreact during sell-offs. In the 88-year period ended 2016, the markets showed a 5% dip for every 3 months on average, a 10% decline for every 8 months and a 20% falloff every two-and-a-half years. Davis argued that investors’ may be their worst enemies as investor behavior has been the most significant cause of expenses. Data has shown that hiring and firing managers have resulted in diminished value over the short-term since the investor would not be able to capitalize on the long-term potential of the asset manager. Lastly, Davis believed that there is a compelling opportunity in select financial companies in the current market environment. Given their outlook on potential opportunities, Davis Advisors has focused on the financial sector as a “triple play” opportunity, pointing to attractive earnings, multiples and buybacks/dividends. S&P 500 financial companies are currently trading at the greatest discount to the broader market, reflecting their cheap valuations. Additionally, banks and insurers are also paying out some of the lowest dividends, which leaves them more room to grow their payouts in the years ahead. Davis mentioned a number of compelling company names given these three factors, including Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, American Express, Chubb, BNY Mellon and US Bank, which can be found in the actively managed Davis Select Financial ETF (NasdaqGM: DFNL). Davis Advisors’ preference for the financial sector is also reflected in the other active Davis Select U.S. Equity ETF (NasdaqGM: DUSA), which includes 38.0% financials. Overall, an active manager may be better positioned to adapt to a changing market environment, especially in an aging bull market where any small thing could pause the forward momentum. In a survey of advisors attending the webcast, 70% of respondents indicated that an active strategy would outperform in 2017. However, active ETFs may continue to find trouble in gaining traction among the investment community that has grown increasingly more interested in low-cost, passive funds, with 44% of respondents indicating that passive ETFs could gather the most assets in 2017, compared to 23% of advisors who think active ETFs will gain the most assets this year. Davis Advisors’ selection process may also allow investors to gain greater potential. For instance, DFNL includes a greater tilt toward mid-sized companies that are more capable of growth, whereas the S&P Financial Index focuses on the largest financial names.

Wayne Duggan , Benzinga Staff Writer     {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} April 04, 2017 2:37pm   Comments Share: Related Jim Cramer Gives His Opinion On Chesapeake Energy And American Airlines The Market In 5 Minutes Related DAL Wall Street Shrugs Off Latest Airline PR Disaster Friendly Skies Could Be Attractively Valued Skies Airline stocks were suffering another down day on Tuesday after Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) reported March traffic numbers and updated shareholders on second-quarter guidance. Update Gist Here are the highlights from Delta’s investor update: Projected March quarter operating margin is expected to be in the 10.0–11.0 percent range. March PRASM came in at 0.5 percent. In the March quarter, passenger unit revenue declined an estimated 0.5 percent. Delta returned roughly $350 million to shareholders in the March quarter. CASM-Ex including profit sharing fell in the +5.0–6.0 percent range in the March quarter. System capacity declined about 0.5 percent in the March quarter. Passenger unit revenue, which compares sales to flight capacity, is a major metric of efficiency for airlines. The new guidance of a 0.5 percent year-over-year decline represents a negative revision from the company’s previous Q1 passenger unit growth guidance of nearly flat. Shares of Delta, Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE: LUV), United Continental Holdings Inc (NYSE: UAL) and American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL) were all down more than 1.3 percent in midday trading on Tuesday. 2017: Clear Skies Or Stormy Weather? Delta isn’t the only airline not living up to expectations in 2017. Earlier in March, United CEO Oscar Munoz said the airline is combatting smaller-than-expected margins by increasing capacity. United upped its 2017 domestic capacity growth guidance from 1.5–2.5 percent to 3.5–4.5 percent. Evercore analyst Duane Pfennigwerth said United was “abandoning its commitment to shareholders to keep its capacity growth below GDP.” Rising capacity could eventually lead to a glut in available seats and loss of pricing power for airlines. Delta’s latest unit revenue guidance cut comes on the heels of similar cuts by American and Southwest in March. At this point, investor expectations for Q1 airline earnings season are relatively low. JPMorgan says the Delta's weak RASM projections will likely weigh on Delta shares and the rest of the airline sector. Since March 1, all and the “Big 4” airline stocks are down between 7 and 12 percent. Delta is expected to be the first of the Big 4 to report Q1 earnings on April 13.

Details of the order were not immediately available, but the action wasn't expected to make immediate changes to financial regulations. File- In 2010... By Matt Egan NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- President Trump has a message for bankers: Help is on the way. Trump promised on Tuesday to "do a very major haircut on Dodd Frank." He complained that regulators, not CEOs, are the ones "running the banks" these days. Bank CEOs are "petrified of the regulators. They're petrified. They can't move," Trump said during a town hall with CEOs, including Citigroup boss Michael Corbat. If there is a regulator that bankers are scared of, it's Daniel Tarullo. And Tarullo is stepping down on Wednesday from his post as the Federal Reserve's regulatory czar. Tarullo is the man behind bank stress tests and other efforts aimed at preventing a repeat of the financial crisis. Trump has repeatedly taken aim at Dodd-Frank, the post financial crisis reform law. On Tuesday, he called it an example of "horrendous" regulation that his administration is "absolutely destroying." Trump was light on the details about which specific parts of the law he'd like to get rid of. The White House has promised that relaxed regulation will create jobs by boosting lending to businesses that need funding. Trump's comments come at a time when banks are already lending to a ton to businesses. Commercial and industrial loans from commercial banks hit an all-time high of $2.1 trillion in November, according to the Federal Reserve. Not just that, but the banking industry as a whole generated record profits in 2016 for the third year in the past four, according to the FDIC. Out of 5,913 insured institutions, 59% of them made money in the fourth quarter. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen recently said U.S. banks are "quite profitable" and "quite strong" relative to their overseas peers. "I see well-capitalized banks that are regarded as safe, sound and strong," Yellen said. Trump said his administration will do things that are "very good for the banking industry." He said this will go "far beyond recommendations" on tweaking Dodd-Frank. Just two weeks after taking office, Trump signed an executive order instructing the heads of regulatory agencies to report back to him within 120 days with suggestions to change existing financial regulation. Gary Cohn, who left Goldman Sachs to become Trump's top economic adviser, stood behind Trump as he signed the order. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon echoed Trump's message to top executives on Tuesday in his own letter to shareholders, arguing "poorly conceived and uncoordinated regulations" have wreaked havoc on the U.S. economy. Dimon refrained from suggesting policy makers should undo the entire reform law, but said now was the time to figure out what changes could be made. "We're not looking to throw out the entirety of Dodd-Frank or other rules," wrote Dimon. "It is, however, appropriate to open up the rulebook in the light of day and rework the rules and regulations that don't work well or are unnecessary." Republicans have also pushed Trump to abolish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created by Dodd-Frank as a watchdog against financial abuse. But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said during his confirmation hearing that the CFPB, the brainchild of Senator Elizabeth Warren, is worth keeping. Mnuchin also supports the Volcker Rule, but suggested making changes to the controversial Dodd-Frank rule that bars big banks from making risky bets with their own money. One area of focus is to offer relief for community banks. Even Barney Frank, one of the architects of Dodd-Frank, recently told CNNMoney that community and midsize banks have been unfairly hurt by heavy legal costs. But Frank warned that dismantling the Wall Street reform law would increase the chances of a new "crash" in the financial system. --Donna Borak contributed to this report.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said he expects banks to keep “the bulk” of their operations in Britain after Brexit even though they are currently making contingency plans for the “worst-case outcome” after two years of divorce talks. Less than a week after Prime Minister Theresa May triggered the process for quitting the European Union, the chancellor said an implementation period after Britain leaves in March 2019 would help smooth the process. Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up “It’s clear most of the banks are making contingency plans to be in place by April 2019 which assume the worst-case outcome; that is from their point of view that they can no longer provide financial services directly from the U.K. into the EU,” Hammond said in an interview during a visit to New Delhi on Tuesday. “Most of them are planning for a very light-touch model at the beginning, with a few people located inside the EU and the bulk of their business remaining in London.” Banks based in the U.K. capital, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley, have been said to be in talks over properties in other European capitals, including Dublin and Frankfurt, as they prepare for Britain’s separation from the 27 remaining nations in the bloc. Estimates for the number of people who could move range from 4,000 to more than 200,000. “All of them so far as I can tell are hoping the outcome of the negotiations will allow them never to go further than that,” Hammond said. “Our job is to make sure that objective is delivered, so the banks are able to continue to operate with the critical mass of their business based in the U.K.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The total represented a 32 percent gain from the same period a year ago, thanks to record-setting activities across a number of markets and debt issuance. The activity also represents some hard data showing that enthusiasm for President Donald Trump's agenda is turning into actual economic activity. Records of various sorts were set in mergers and acquisitions, IPOs and debt issuance. "The political cycle and the two candidates that were running for president caused a real logjam in this kind of activity for a good part of 2016," said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness. "Everyone was on the sideline," he added. "Then you get an unexpected outcome from the election and that sort of animal spirits was the dynamite that opened up that logjam and you see this money flooding into the capital markets." The bank bonanza In the broad category of equity capital markets that includes various dealmaking activities, volume surged 52.8 percent in the first quarter from the same period in 2016, Dealogic reported. Investment-grade debt hit a record high of $413.1 billion, U.S. loan volume of $607 billion and refinancing of $439.4 billion both set first-quarter standards, and leveraged finance had its best quarter ever with $379.1 billion of deals. For banks, it added up to a bonanza. In addition to the jump in U.S. revenue, global investment banks took in $19.6 billion, a 20 percent annualized increase. Those are solid numbers that will help offset some of the tough sledding the banks have seen on the equity side as volumes have declined. "The bond market side of the house has been performing very well for the past several years," said Christopher Whalen, head of Whalen Global Advisors. "In a sense that isn't surprising. It's good news, but the bond market is much less profitable per dollar of transaction volume than the equity side of the house."

Among individual banks, JPMorgan Chase again was the biggest beneficiary of the spike in activity. The largest U.S. bank by assets generated $1.04 billion in revenue in the U.S. and $1.67 billion globally to again lead its competitors. The numbers should help with what is expected to be a solid quarter for bank earnings. As a group, financials are projected to show 14.8 percent profit growth for the first quarter, coming off a year when the sector dropped 0.2 percent, according to FactSet. However, Whalen cautioned investors not to get too caught up in the revenue boost, particularly regarding debt-driven deals. "You can't feed a lot of mouths with those volumes," he said. It's the economy Whether the activity that started the year spills over into the rest of 2017 depends on a number of factors. While the economy is expected to show subpar growth for the first quarter, expectations are that it will pick up, particularly if Congress can get a tax reduction bill through and start up on the infrastructure spending that candidate Trump promised. Some of the activity, particularly in refinancing and debt issuance, came from companies looking to get ahead of expected rate increases from the Federal Reserve. Markets will be watching closely how the central bank proceeds. Whalen believes that as long as the Fed refrains from letting its $4.5 trillion in debt holdings run off into the market, rates will stay low. Should Trump's agenda show signs of slowing, that could stifle animal spirits. But if progress continues and sentiment indicators remain high, economists believe the markets should benefit. "In general, the economy appears to be doing well," said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. "There's some optimism surrounding President Trump's election and the possibility that will bring deregulation and lower taxes (and) that's fed into a fairly good rally in the stock market. A lot of this activity is just stemming from that." — CNBC parent NBC Universal is an investor in Snap.
