U.S. Consumer Spending May Too JPMorgan Institute study shows spending falls when U.S. consumers have fewer daylight hours to shop Sarah Ponczek Subscribe November 3, 2016 — 10:48 AM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp The clocks turn back this weekend, giving most Americans an extra hour to cash in on sleep. But new research finds they tend to spend less money with fewer hours of daily sunlight. A study by JPMorgan Chase Institute compared purchases by credit and debit card users with its parent bank in two southwest U.S. cities: Los Angeles, which adjusts in and out of daylight saving time, and Phoneix, which follows mountain time year round. Los Angeles saw a 0.9 percent increase, relative to Phoenix, in daily card spending per capita in the month after switching the clocks forward during the U.S. springtime. But the spending reductions outpaced the boost — falling 3.5 percent — after the end of daylight saving time, and losing an hour, in the autumn as the days get shorter. The spending effects vary: Switching back clocks in the Fall impacts goods more than services while spending tends to drop more on workdays than weekends, the institute said. Grocery stores recorded the biggest decline, shedding almost 6 percent of daily retail per capita spending, followed by fuel sellers, retail shops and discount stores at more than 4.5 percent each.  The magnitude of change is smaller for restaurants probably because people eat at night no matter what time the sun goes down, and on health care and personal/professional services because it’s usually necessary, not discretionary, spending, the study showed. The study comes as the debate of daylight saving time's usefulness has been thrown into the spotlight -- including its effects on everything from people's health to energy conservation. Legislation to abolish DST in California almost made it through the state’s legislature, before the Senate squashed it in August. It followed movements over recent years in states such as Arizona, Florida and Michigan to consider changing how they observe time. The JPMorgan Chase Institute conducted the analysis using anonymized data from 450,000 customers for four time-change periods of each kind between October 2012 to June 2015.

Photo: AFP New York: After weeks of relatively calm expectations for a status quo US election result—Democrat in the White House, mostly Republicans in Congress—investors worldwide are boosting hedges against the possibility of a Donald Trump upset on 8 November. Since the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) surprise dealt a blow to Hillary Clinton by reigniting controversy over her emails late last week, haven assets are rising and riskier ones are falling. That’s in line with—albeit less dramatic than—what analysts have said will happen if the Republican wins or the Democrats sweep, much like the aftermath of the UK’s June vote to leave the European Union (EU). JPMorgan Chase and Co. raised a third possible surprise outcome in a report on Wednesday that it said may produce a similar market reaction, the title of which said it all: “I demand a recount”. The recent moves reflect worries that investors aren’t sure whether to believe reassurances from analysts including Morgan Stanley (Clinton “still favored”) and Citigroup Inc. (toss-up “overstates” Trump’s odds). Over the longer term, both candidates want to increase spending and cut taxes which would be bullish for stocks and bearish for fixed income. Below is a look at potential winners and losers. Stocks Clinton Wins: “The market has already priced in a Clinton victory,” Margaret Yang, a CMC Markets analyst in Singapore, said by phone. “Any upside will be limited if she wins.” Barclays Plc said in a report this week that the S&P 500 Index could gain as much as 3% if she wins. The benchmark lost ground on Tuesday for the seventh straight session. Beyond an initial “risk-relief rally on the prospect of policy continuity and predictability,” Deutsche Bank AG said Clinton’s plans to limit the capital gains tax break may “have negative/dampening impact on some key risk bellwether assets like equities into the turn of the year”. The biggest losers would be finance and drug companies. “A potential Democratic sweep would represent one of the toughest election outcomes for banks,” Morgan Stanley Research said in a report, citing the risk of tougher rules and tax changes that might hurt companies like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase and Co. Moves against carried-interest rules that benefit asset managers, also targeted by Trump, would hurt firms including Janus Capital Group Inc. and Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. Under Clinton, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks “could be hit by renewed pressure to curb price increases on drugs,” BlackRock Inc. researchers said in a report, noting her complaints about rising costs. Citigroup Inc. cut its rating on the European health-care industry to underweight in September, citing US election risks. Drugmakers Novo Nordisk A/S and Roche Holding AG have trailed the broader market this year as Clinton’s prospects rose, with the shares gaining only during times when her polling numbers fell. Hospital operators and medicaid providers such as HCA Holdings Inc. and Universal Health Services Inc. may benefit from continued Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to analysts from Strategas Research Partners, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG. Her plans to reduce dependence on fossil fuels would boost alternative energy producers, with Morgan Stanley touting the prospects of Sunrun Inc. and NextEra Energy Inc. under Clinton. Strategas also likes First Solar Inc. in that scenario. Evercore ISI adds General Electric Co., Tesla Motors Inc., SolarCity Corp. and Exelon Corp. to the list in its pre-election report. Trump Wins: “Valuations of US equities are quite high, and a Trump victory will trigger a massive sell-off,” CMC’s Yang said. Many would consider that a classic “black swan event”, she added, so the reaction would be “much more severe” than Brexit, which caused the S&P 500 Index to fall 5.3% in two days as benchmarks in Europe and elsewhere lost even more. Investors seeking haven in the yen would be “a negative for Japanese exporters”, Yang said. Barclays predicted the S&P 500 would nosedive by between 11-13% if Trump wins. The Republican’s shifting policy positions make his longer-term impact on particular sectors harder to assess. BlackRock’s analysis of the correlation between the two candidate’s polling numbers and sector stock performance suggest drugmakers, insurers and banks are expected to do better under Trump. Bloomberg News did a similar analysis for individual US stocks. Though finance companies may prefer Trump, BlackRock warned that repealing the post-crisis Dodd-Frank law, derided by the industry’s Republican allies, may result in “simpler and blunter but equally onerous rules”. Almost all sectors of the health care industry, from device-makers to providers, would benefit under Trump, BlackRock said. Companies that build and maintain civil infrastructure, such as Caterpillar Inc. and Ingersoll-Rand Corp., would have bigger opportunities for government work under Trump, given that his plans for such spending are much more ambitious than Clinton’s. The same holds true for military contractors, according to a Credit Suisse report. Morgan Stanley sees NRG Energy Inc., which uses coal to produce electricity, benefiting under a Republican White House, due to less regulation and slower growth in the use of renewables. Bonds Clinton Wins: A victory by the Democrat would initially drive up yields as investors sell off Treasuries in favour of riskier assets, Bank of America Corp. analysts said in a report. Ripple effects would raise borrowing costs for individuals and corporations worldwide because US sovereigns are the global debt benchmark. Yields on 10-year US bonds have risen as much as 36 basis points since Clinton’s lead over Trump started widening in late July, and the bank’s analysts called the Democratic Party’s improving prospects “a major factor” behind that move. They’ve fallen a bit since the FBI’s 28 October announcement about the emails. Over the longer term, a Clinton victory would do little to yields—as long as Republicans retain control of at least one chamber of Congress—because her fiscal stimulus would be relatively small, especially compared to Trump’s plans for bigger tax cuts and more infrastructure spending. A Democratic sweep would likely result in more spending and drive yields higher. Municipal debt could gain under Clinton because any increased taxes she imposes on the wealthy would make tax-free bonds more attractive, BlackRock said. Trump Wins: In the two weeks after the UK gobsmacked pollsters and voted to leave the EU on 23 June, the US benchmark 10-year yield fell 39 basis points and didn’t return to pre-Brexit levels until September. Something akin to that would happen if Trump defies conventional wisdom, analysts said. Credit Agricole SA predicts a “massive disjoint” that would send 10-year yields down at least 10 basis points if he prevails. After the dust settles, Trump’s tax cuts and infrastructure-spending plans may drive yields back up, especially if Republicans hold both the House and Senate. That impact could be exaggerated if the Republican’s isolationist foreign policy prompts countries with large Treasury stakes to unload them, Credit Agricole analysts said. Fiscal largess would also benefit inflation-linked bonds, which already are outperforming nominal securities this year. Yields would only remain flat under Trump, according to Bank of America, in the unlikeliest event of all: President Trump finds himself up against Democrats controlling both houses of Congress, because they would resist his massive tax cuts. Trump’s support for fossil fuels could spur a rebound for energy industry bonds, especially high-yield ones, after two years of major losses in the commodities slump, Wells Fargo and Co. said in a report. As for munis, “Trump’s plan to slash personal tax rates could deal a blow to the asset class”, BlackRock’s report said. Currencies Clinton Wins: The US dollar would gain versus other developed-market currencies with the Democrat heading toward the White House as traders focus attention on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in December, according to Capital Economics, a London-based research firm. Down the road, Bank of America sees the greenback gaining under Clinton only if the Democrats take Congress. Currencies from emerging markets have mostly priced in a Clinton win, which would be neutral or positive for all countries except Russia, Societe Generale SA said in a report. Mexico’s peso would benefit from a Clinton win more than any other emerging-market currency, Societe Generale said. It has acted as a barometer of the presidential contest, tending to move in tandem with her chances of defeating a candidate who promised to make the US’s southern neighbour pay for a wall between the two countries. Look for China’s yuan to “strengthen modestly in response to a Clinton win as currencies sensitive to the outlook for global trade rally in relief”, said Sean Callow, senior strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney. Trump Wins: The foreign-exchange markets this week are suggesting what might happen if the Republican triumphs, with the dollar tumbling against most major currencies and the Mexican peso bucking the trend as one of the worst performers against the greenback. Even after the immediate shock of a Trump win, the US dollar may weaken as developed-market currencies including the yen, euro, pound and franc rally on concern that China would dump US assets and the Fed would delay tightening monetary policy. The greenback could then rally in a three-to-nine month horizon as Republicans usher in tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth, Bank of America said. The candidate’s hostility toward China—including threats of steep tariffs over alleged currency manipulation—likely would drive the offshore yuan down about 3% by year’s end, said Ken Cheung, a foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd in Hong Kong. Longer term, the currency may fall more gradually under Trump as he exerts political pressure on the country’s leaders to slow its depreciation, said Xu Gao, an economist at Everbright Securities Co. in Beijing. Risk adversity in the aftermath of a Trump win would also hurt other developing-world currencies on fears that his protectionist stances could hurt emerging economies by reducing imports from them. That “could be negative for high-yielder countries”, Credit Agricole said in a report on Wednesday. The South Korean won may take a hit, given questions Trump has raised about the need for US troops on the North Korean border. Emerging Markets Clinton Wins: It’ll be risk-on if the Democrat retains control of the White House, which bodes well for developing markets. Investors may respond by bidding up Chinese defence shares because she comes across as the more hawkish candidate, said Francis Cheung, head of China and Hong Kong strategy at CLSA Ltd. Commodity producers in the developing world might rally on expectations that US demand will increase along with infrastructure spending. Trump Wins: “I can’t think of any country that would benefit if Trump wins,” CMC Markets’ Yang said. Evercore’s report mentioned one nation that might get a boost, suggesting investors buy Russian equities to hedge against the Clinton-leaning polls being wrong. Citigroup sees the MSCI Emerging Markets Index immediately falling at least 10%, with Mexican stocks leading the way down. One possible bright spot for Mexico: Construction companies such as Cemex SAB de CV may be positioned for contracts to build Trump’s proposed border wall. In Asia, “China will bear the brunt of risks if Trump wins,” said Ken Peng, an investment strategist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong, by phone. “He’ll probably introduce trade policies targeted against China,” weakening its economy. Protectionist US policies also would be “bad for a lot of economies that rely a lot on exports,” said Ben Bei, an analyst at CIMB Securities Ltd in Hong Kong. Peng said exporters from South Korea and Taiwan are among those with the most to lose. Yang adds Southeast Asia exporters to the list, including companies in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. To the extent that Trump is less welcoming to workers from abroad, his victory may hurt the Philippines’ broader economy, which gets the bulk of its overseas remittances from Filipinos employed in the US, Yang said. “India and Indonesia will be least affected if Trump wins,” due to their robust domestic growth, Peng said. Commodities Clinton Wins: Her environmental policies, especially her promise to combat climate change, will put pressure on coal and oil. The natural gas market could get a boost from her pledge to wean power plants off coal by using gas as “a bridge” to more reliance on renewables. Trump Wins: Natural gas prices likely would suffer as coal benefits under Trump. He has promised to roll back environmental rules that squeeze coal out of the US power market and promoted “clean coal” during one of the debates. Bloomberg Intelligence in September estimated that a victory by the Republican would shave 11% off natural gas demand in 2030 from last year’s levels, boosting coal use. Oil prices could get a lift from the return of a risk premium if Trump continues with the “bellicose language that’s been heard on the campaign trail” about Iran and scraps President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with the country, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund focused on energy. Gold, platinum and silver would the “biggest winners” if Trump wins, said Yang, the CMC Markets analyst. Since the day before the FBI’s surprise announced that it will examine newly discovered emails relevant to its inquiry of Clinton’s use of a private Internet server as secretary of state, all precious metals are up, including a 4.8% jump in silver and a 2.2% advance in gold. Copper may also get a bounce, Barclays said, citing moves in the metal’s price during the campaign suggesting “a Trump-related premium in infrastructure-related assets given expectations around his fiscal plan”.

Both access and design issues are preventing potential employees and employers from identifying the appropriate job fit. The report, “Swiping Right for the Job: How Tech is Changing Matching in the Workforce”, highlights the problems low and middle skilled workers and employers face in using technology, explores how tech is changing labor market interactions, and identifies the benefits, challenges and design changes required for labor market technology to have its greatest impact. “Despite an increase in technology usage, we’re seeing missed opportunity in job matching due to design flaws and access barriers,” said Chauncy Lennon, Head of Workforce Initiatives, JPMorgan Chase. “We’ve identified how to more efficiently connect people with the jobs and training they need and if we turn these lessons learned into smarter tools, we’ll create economic opportunity for everyone.” Labor market matching technology exists primarily online, and low- and middle-skill workers, who typically have wages below the median, are disproportionately likely to lack access to computers and the internet at home. Only sixty-three percent of those with a household income between $20,000 and $50,000 have access to broadband internet at home, compared to 80 percent of those with a household income between $50,000 and $75,000. While job seekers with varying degrees of education use their smart phones for job searching at approximately the same rate, job seekers who have not attended college are much more likely to go through the cumbersome process of using their smart phones to fill out an online job application and create a resume or cover letter than those who have graduated from college. Also, low- and middle-skill workers are more likely to lack proficiency in using computers and the Internet, making it difficult to navigate labor market matching technology. “JPMorgan Chase’s report underscores that too many skilled workers are being overlooked due to fixable architecture flaws in job matching technology,” said Byron Auguste, President and Co-Founder, Opportunity@Work. “When we design tools to take into account an individual’s personal affinities and background, employers will find far better candidates to place in their companies and for a longer period of time.” One example of a job matching tool design to address these issues is SkillSmart. Their platform is designed to connect job seekers, employers, and educators through mutually identified skills. The program allows employers to specify the skills needed for success in their company and helps individuals find opportunities based on their skillset. SkillSmart’s algorithm calculates how closely an applicant’s skills align with overall employer need. If job seekers do not have the necessary skills for a job they want, SkillSmart will provide suggestions for training opportunities. Additionally, SkillSmart helps educators to include in-demand skills in their curricula. Based on interviews with 45 industry leaders and an exhaustive review of research, the Swipe Right report highlights that finding the right person for the job is a crucial component of business success, employee wellbeing, worker productivity, and economic health. The consequences of getting the match wrong are high both for employees and employers. The cost of replacing a worker can be as much as 60 percent of an employee’s annual salary. Without good design, a tool will have limited usefulness and be challenging to implement. Without good implementation, a tool will not achieve its purpose of improved matching and quickly lose relevance. The report includes the following recommendations to improve the design and implementation of job matching technology: DesignBuild with User-Centered Design: Ensure that the tool is easy to use for both employers and job seekers by involving and consulting them throughout the tool design process. Use Target-Audience Language: The language used in job postings should avoid jargon and be familiar to the target job seeker. Encourage Skills-based Hiring: Work with employers to foster skills-based job descriptions and hiring practices rather than rely on increasingly irrelevant gatekeeping credentials. Engage Employers: Align with employers on occupational and skills definitions to develop a shared understanding among employers, training institutions, and job seekers. Integrate Training Opportunities and Pathways: Include easily accessible information on training opportunities to help job seekers gain skills to qualify for their desired positions. Consider Implicit Bias Mitigation: Reduce implicit bias in the hiring process by creating tools that do not expose employers to signals like names or addresses. Keep an Eye on National Trends, Use Local Data: A tool that uses local data and corresponds to the realities of the local labor market will be most helpful to current job seekers. Optimize for Mobile: An online tool should be created to reflect the ways that people use the internet, and mobile optimization is vital for job seekers who lack desktop access. ImplementationSupport Job Seeker Needs and Access: Regardless of how well a technology tool is designed, some individuals will need in-person guidance, and digital inclusion efforts may be needed to help everyone access the tool. Ongoing Activation of Industry Partners: Employers need to post their job openings through the tool and ensure that the information reflects their changing hiring needs. Recognize Need for Continued Refinement and Investment: Since online technology quickly becomes outdated, continued investment is needed to keep a technology tool up-to-date and appealing for users. Analyze Outcomes: Longitudinal data collection will help ensure that a technology tool aids employers in hiring by illuminating outcomes after the point of hire and helping determine best practices in labor market matching technology. This project is part of a $250 million, five-year New Skills at Work initiative that JPMorgan Chase & Co. has developed to help inform and accelerate demand-driven skills training and provide greater economic opportunity for all. Launched in 2013, New Skills at Work is providing data-driven analyses, engaging employers in sector partnerships, and supporting training programs that are aligned with local demand.

Bob Michele said the world's fifth largest asset manager increased exposure to inflation-linked bonds (TIPS) and emerging market debt in the last few weeks, expecting moderate growth and solid oil prices to lift inflation and support emerging market currencies. Global financial markets were roiled by signs the U.S. presidential election race was tightening just days ahead of the Nov. 8 vote, with a possible victory for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump seen as boosting uncertainty on U.S. foreign, economic and trade policies. But Michele told Reuters in an interview that U.S. politics is not among the major risk factors the firm looks at in coming months because the House of Representatives is likely to remain Republican. "This is very important because any law that the President would like to pass has to go through the House for approval," he said. "We are in an interesting position where, if (Hillary) Clinton gets elected, the House - if it remains Republican - will likely push back a lot of things she wants to do. "But if Trump gets elected and he tries to push through a lot of the extremist, protectionist things he has talked about, I expect the House will push that back." Since both candidates are highlighting the need to rebuild U.S. infrastructure, fiscal expansion is likely, whoever wins, Michele said. In addition, U.S. and world growth look better than expected at the start of 2016 and oil prices have recovered sharply from 12-year lows hit early this year, which is likely to underpin prices in coming months. "There's a lot that will happen in a couple of weeks that will appear to be very growth friendly and very inflation-oriented, including the election," he added. "Many of the things we're doing now are to prepare in advance." JPMorgan's asset management arm has added local emerging markets debt, Michele added, citing high real yield, upsides to growth and stabilization of currencies, thanks to recovering energy prices. He named Brazil, India, Indonesia and Russia as attractive targets, adding that it was a good time to take the currency exposure as well. Michele, who manages the firm's $455-billion fixed income portfolios, also said it was looking for opportunities to sell duration. "When markets rally, we would use that as an opportunity to cut duration of our portfolios because we think the market is going through a growth and inflation scare." JPMorgan Asset Management had $1.77 trillion in assets under management by September 30.

"Following" : "Follow"}} November 03, 2016 4:43pm   Comments Share: The housing market is still recovering and heating up, and big banks still love jumbo mortgages. According to new data, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) increased its activity for lending in jumbo mortgages that exceeded $417,000, in 2015. The two banks alone originated $37.1 billion and $23.3 billion respectively. This was an increase of nearly 90% for JPMorgan Chase and 68% for Bank of America, year over year. Now, the demand for mortgages is also increasing. Mortgage rates are still relatively low, when compared to the housing bubble in the mid- and late- 2000s. The increasing demand makes it attractive for banks to increase lending in the space. Shadow Banks Increasing Their Presence In The Mortgage Market Shadow banks are close to taking the lead in the mortgage market, in comparison to commercial banks. This hasn’t happened since the global financial crisis of 2007-2009. In 2015, non-bank lenders accounted for nearly 50% of mortgage activity in 2015. There’s no reason to believe that non-bank lenders won’t continue their growth in the market by the end of 2016. The mortgage market is estimated to hold approximately $80 trillion in assets in total. According to data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, shadow banks accounted for 55% of mortgage lending in 2006, 45% in 2014 and 48% in 2015. Although this may seem like trouble and could lead to another housing bubble, banks aren’t focused on the loans of the past. Prior to the financial crisis, large banks were giving out NINJA loans, also known as no income, no job mortgage loans. Instead, they’re shifting their focus to jumbo mortgages, which are less risky than NINJA loans. Shift to Jumbo Mortgages is Good for Banks Most banks who lend for jumbo mortgages hold these loans on their balance sheet. Holding these loans on the books is appealing to banks since they profit from the difference between jumbo loans’ interest payments and interest paid out on deposits. These loans are also less risky because they don’t carry buyback risk. Fannie Mae Is Fueling the Mortgage Market Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTC: FNMA), a housing-finance company, is giving some of its borrowers’ relief on some mortgage penalties. In addition to low mortgage rates, Fannie Mae’s move to shield lenders against some penalties should attract more mortgage borrowers. Fannie Mae’s new program will protect mortgage lenders against potential penalties stemming from flawed appraisals, just as long as the appraisals pass the tests of Fannie Mae’s automated system. Moreover, Fannie Mae will let lenders electronically verify mortgage borrowers’ assets and income. This will mitigate some of lenders’ risks when issuing new mortgage loans. Fannie Mae’s new changes should increase the number of mortgage borrowers, thus increasing activity in the mortgage borrowing market. Watch for What the Fed Says  Mortgage rates could change depending on what the FOMC decides on at its remaining meeting in 2016. The FOMC will be deciding on its monetary policy on December 13-14 2016. The markets placed over a 90% probability that the FOMC won’t raise rates at its November meeting. This is primarily because the FOMC doesn’t want to shake the markets right before the Presidential election. However, this has been going on for a while, and it seems as if the Fed is just winging it.  The market is looking for the Fed to raise rates in December, which will slightly affect the mortgage market. Additionally, some Fed officials are looking for three rate hikes between November 2016 and the end on 2017, which could put the flame out in the mortgage market.

Morgan's downgrade of Intersect ENT's stock yesterday. Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Nov 3, 2016 at 2:49PM   Image source: Getty Images. What happened Following a big drop in its shares yesterday that was caused by potential Medicare reimbursement headwinds, Intersect ENT (NASDAQ:XENT) reported third-quarter financial results that reassured investors and sent shares rallying 12.5% higher today at 2:30 p.m. EDT. So what On Nov. 1, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released the 2017 Medicare Hospital Outpatient Final Rule, implementing comprehensive ambulatory payment classification (APC) for upper airway procedures, including sinus surgery. The ruling for upper airway procedures, including sinus surgery, includes reimbursement at a fixed amount that's 40% to 50% below the current average amount. The ruling goes into effect on Jan. 1. The ruling led to J.P. Morgan downgrading Intersect ENT shares from overweight to neutral yesterday. J.P. Morgan also reduced its price target to $16 from $25. Between the ruling and J.P. Morgan's downgrade, Intersect ENT's shares tumbled by more than 40% on Wednesday. However, Intersect ENT's third-quarter conference call after the bell yesterday assuaged some of investors' fears. Management thinks that the CMS decision only directly impacts about 8% of its sales, and it doesn't expect any short-term changes in reimbursement from commercial insurers.  The company also said that sales of its Propel and Propel mini steroid-releasing implants, which are used in chronic sinusitis surgeries, grew 29.8% year over year to $18.47 million in the third quarter and that its third-quarter loss was $0.22 per share, or $0.05 better than industry watchers were predicting.  Now what Intersect ENT's not out of the woods yet. CEO Lisa Earnhardt was reassuring, but it did appear that she left the door open for some pricing risk longer term. Earnhardt's team is continuing "to assess the impact of the Medicare ruling" and the use of the words "near term" when describing their thinking that there will be "little to no impact" on non-Medicare business could be telling. However, Intersect ENT does have some things going for it. The company has $108 million in cash and investments on the books and it expects its use of cash to be around $23 million this year. That suggests it's got enough funding to continue to grow demand for its products, including new products that it hopes to see hit the market over the coming year. Assuming that Intersect ENT can limit the risk of pricing pressure (perhaps via getting its own CMS J-code for payment), then this stock could end up being a bargain-bin buy sometime next year.

Chandrasekaran , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} November 03, 2016 3:48pm   Comments Share: Related FB RBC's Mark Mahaney Talks FANG Trade And Other Tech Stocks 3 Worries For Facebook: Fake News, Ads And Analytics Apple, Palo Alto, Applied Materials Near Buy Points: Stocks To Watch (Investor's Business Daily) JPMorgan is not worried about the expected softness in ad sales of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) next year and noted the continued strong performance in the third quarter. The firm advised investors to engage in buying the shares during the pullback period and reiterated its Overweight rating and a target price of $175 on the stock. This implied more than 40 percent upside potentials from the current levels. Analyst Doug Anmuth’s comments came a day after the social media firm delivered better-than-expected numbers. The analyst thinks that the company has enough opportunities to improve monetization in the long term. In a research note, the brokerage said, “Facebook’s massive reach and engagement continue to drive network effects, and its targeting abilities provide significant value to advertisers. We believe it is still very early in the development of Facebook’s ad platform, including an ongoing improvement in ad targetability and measurement as well as a shift toward ads with higher quality formats, which we believe will become increasingly valuable to advertisers.” The analyst listed the following five key takeaways after the third-quarter earnings results: The social media firm is in a rarefied air. Company witnessed strong engagement with DAU/MAU in every region. Management’s comment on the outlook for the year 2017, which is termed as conservative by the brokerage. Expects revenue growth of 39 percent and sees 35 bps margin expansions. Estimates are more than achievable. At last check, the stock fell 5.55 percent to $120.11.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 12:20 AM, November 4, 2016 NEW YORK - Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley need not forfeit their estimated $100 million of profit from trading Facebook Inc stock soon after underwriting its May 2012 initial public offering, a federal appeals court said on Thursday. By a 3-0 vote, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan rejected a claim by Facebook shareholder Robert Lowinger that "lock-up" agreements forbade the sales because the banks and selling shareholders together formed a "group" owning more than 10 percent of the social media company's stock. The lawsuit was one of dozens targeting Facebook, the banks and others after the Menlo Park, California-based company's $16 billion IPO suffered from technical glitches and its stock price slid 54 percent within four months. Lowinger accused Facebook of concealing pessimistic internal growth projections from the public even as it quietly alerted the banks, who then passed the news to top clients and bet successfully against the stock. He sought to force the banks to turn their profits over to Facebook. U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan dismissed the lawsuit in May 2014, saying the lock-up agreements restricting insiders from selling stock were standard in the industry. Upholding that ruling on Thursday, Circuit Judge Ralph Winter said subjecting bank underwriters to similar restrictions would "complicate" their role, add millions of dollars of legal exposure and reduce the number of companies going public. "IPOs contemplate the sharing of confidential financial information with underwriters, agreements between underwriters and large pre-IPO shareholders limiting disposal of their shares, and trading by underwriters in the course of the offering," he wrote. "Far from being nefarious, these actions benefit existing shareholders and new public investors." Jeffrey Abraham, a lawyer for Lowinger, declined to comment. Goldman was not immediately available for comment. JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony, Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Mary Claire Delaney and Facebook spokeswoman Vanessa Chan declined to comment. Judge Sweet oversees separate class-action litigation against Facebook by retail and institutional investors who claim they overpaid for the company's shares. Facebook's share price has more than tripled from the $38 IPO price, despite the initial decline. The gains have made Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg the world's fifth-richest person, according to Forbes magazine. The case is Lowinger v Morgan Stanley & Co et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-3800.

(NYSE: JPM) lost 1.2 percent of value over the last five trading days.

Related Link: Here's How Crowdsourced Ratings Can Beat The Market Seeking to better reflect the aforementioned upside potential, the Vetr community upgraded its rating on shares of JPMorgan Chase on Tuesday, from 3.0 Stars (Hold) to 3.5 Stars (Buy) – out of a possible 5 Stars rating. It should be noted that, in accordance with the current score and price target, 53 percent of the crowd’s ratings are bullish right now.

But somewhat unlike the FBI, the central bank is not in the business of tossing live bombs into the final week of a presidential election. Pantheon’s Ian Shepherdson: “The Fed won't raise rates today, or substantively change the wording of the post-meeting statement. … “[I]f, as we expect, the committee is looking for reasons not to hike just six days before the election, they will be able to point to the one-tenth increase in September unemployment and the uncertain reliability … of the better-looking third quarter GDP data. We anticipate three hawkish dissents again, but the Committee is setting itself up to hike in December” Story Continued Below HFE’s Jim O’Sullivan: “We see virtually no chance of a rate hike this week, particularly given the proximity to next week’s election. As a result, the focus will be entirely on any hints in the statement about what might happen at the next meeting, on December 13-14. We don’t expect anything very market-moving.” MOODY’S MODEL PICKS CLINTON — Reuters: “Low gas prices and President Barack Obama's high approval ratings are key factors that favor Democrat Hillary Clinton winning the White House in next week's election, according to a model from Moody's Analytics that has accurately predicted the last nine U.S. presidential contests. Clinton is forecast to pick up 332 Electoral College votes against 206 for Republican Donald Trump, Moody's Analytics predicted … That would match Obama's margin … in 2012. “The Reuters-Ipsos States of the Nation project also predicts a Clinton win, with a 95 percent probability of her winning at least 278 electoral votes. A candidate needs to win at least 270 electoral votes to be elected president. The Moody's Analytics model is based on a combination of state-level economic conditions and political history, and has correctly called the outcome of each presidential election since Republican Ronald Reagan unseated Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1980.” Read more. LONDON BANKERS SAY CITY WILL RETAIN TITLE — In a poll out Wednesday from Synechron and the TABB Group: “72 percent of British bankers believe London will still be the financial centre of Europe in five years’ time … 55 percent of British banks have set up ‘Brexit Steering Committees’ to prepare for life outside the European Union … 56 percent of senior British capital markets executives believe that compliance costs will increase following Britain’s decision to leave the European Union … 78 percent of executives agree that Brexit will have a negative impact on UK financial markets” ALTMAN ON HRC AND TAX REFORM — Via Yahoo Finance: “Investment banker Roger Altman, a key Clinton adviser, explained Clinton’s view on corporate tax reform during a live Yahoo Finance panel discussion on the two presidential candidates’ economic policies. ‘We need corporate tax reform,” he said. ‘The campaign isn’t the place to negotiate the rate. Let’s wait until the election is over. At some appropriate point, she’s going to make a proposal.’ “In other words: It’s coming. It’s just not something Clinton wants to discuss during the campaign, when any plan to cut business taxes could be taken as a sop to corporate interests.” Read more. MAYBE 2016 DOESN’T EVEN MATTER — KBRA’s Christopher Whalen: “[W]e expect most of the major trends in terms of the global economy, interest rates, and currencies to be largely unaffected by the outcome of the U.S. poll. Simply stated, what happens within the U.S. political system has less and less impact on the rest of the world. “Americans like to flatter themselves that events inside our increasingly raucous political economy are somehow more important than developments in other parts of the world … Regardless of who occupies the White House, we believe that this tendency towards greater volatility and unpredictability in global markets will remain a central theme in the years ahead. The slow motion disintegration of the EU illustrates this danger” TRUMP RISE RATTLES MARKETS — Reuters: “Asian shares tumbled to seven-week lows and the dollar was on the defensive on Wednesday as investors were rattled by signs the U.S. presidential election race was tightening just days out to the Nov. 8 vote. Markets were beginning to rethink their long-held bets of a victory for … Hillary Clinton amid signs … Donald Trump could be closing the gap, forcing money out of riskier assets and into safe-havens such as the Japanese yen and gold. “Heavy selling also knocked the Mexican peso, seen as the most vulnerable to a Trump presidency due to his pledge to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to prevent entry of illegal immigrants. The peso, which posted its biggest fall in two months on Tuesday, extended losses to 19.308 to the dollar, its lowest level since early October.” Read more. FEAR GAUGE BACK TO BREXIT LEVELS — FT’s Nicole Bullock, Adam Samson and Courtney Weaver: “The Vix index, a measure of expected US stock market volatility known as Wall Street’s ‘fear gauge’, neared highs last seen in the aftermath of the UK’s vote to leave the EU this summer. Gold, seen as the ultimate haven investment, rose to its highest level since early October … “‘With the Brexit trading experience in recent memory, it seems that some traders don’t want to be caught off side again and have started to act,’ said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. Investors see Mrs Clinton as heralding less uncertainty for markets partly because her long political career means her policies are seen as more predictable.” Read more.

GLASS-STEAGALL THOUGHTS — Capital Alpha’s Ian Katz: “The emails released by Wikileaks support our thinking that Clinton won’t always be aligned with the bank-vilifying wing of the Democratic Party. … Clinton will likely govern from the center more than most expect. The emails confirm that Clinton’s advisers don’t believe that banks are the chief culprits for the financial crisis. As a result, she would initially resist calls to break up the large firms. “Having said that, the emails also show that the Clinton crew is profoundly pragmatic. We think that if it ever got to the point where there was enough public and congressional support to revive Glass-Steagall, Clinton wouldn’t put up a big fight. The main concern in the emails is how Clinton’s opposition to a new Glass-Steagall would be portrayed to the public and specifically in a Democratic primary debate” ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: Now delivering: Retirement security for life! We know saving for retirement can be difficult, but policymakers can help by supporting policies to encourage saving, make retirement plans more widely available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies.

Here are two well-to-do New Yorkers who add hours of travel to their schedules, and thousands of dollars to their campaign expenses, in order to avoid sleeping in the Middle America they promise they are running to represent. “ … [F]or Trump, near-nightly returns to Manhattan — from as far west as Reno, Nevada — mean a chance to sleep in his marble-and-gold hued 66th floor penthouse in Trump Tower.For Clinton, the hops to Chappaqua allow her to spread out in her colonial five-bedroom home, complete with 1.1 acres of land and a swimming pool.” Read more. TRUMP’S RIO WOES — Reuters’ Anthony Boadle and Stephen Eisenhammer: “A Brazilian prosecutor has opened a criminal investigation into investments made by two state pension funds in a luxury Rio de Janeiro hotel that is part of the Trump franchise, according to a court filing reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday. “The 130 million reais ($40 million) investment by the two small funds in the hotel's developer ‘required investigation’ due to its size, structure and high level of risk, Anselmo Lopes, a federal prosecutor in Brasilia, said in the document dated Oct. 21 that opened the inquiry.” Read more. FCC CONCERNS OVER AT&T-TIME WARNER DEAL — WSJ’s Shalini Ramachandran, Ryan Knutson and John D. McKinnon: “AT&T Inc.’s practice of exempting its streaming video services from data-usage caps is rankling competitors and shaping up as a major issue for regulators set to weigh the telecom giant’s proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc. “When AT&T rolls out its $35-a-month DirecTV Now online TV service this month, its wireless subscribers will be able to stream as much as they want without it counting toward their monthly data caps. But if the same customers binge on outside services like Netflix or Hulu, those bits will add up — potentially leading to surcharges.” Read more. CHINA-MALAYSIA SIGNS TRADE DEALS — FT’s Charles Clover: “China and Malaysia signed several trade and investment deals on Tuesday as China denied that it was trying to buy better ties with its southern neighbor. “The agreements signed on Tuesday with China will further invigorate the Beijing- Kuala Lumpur alignment and strain ties with the US. Most significantly, the two nations agreed to a wide ranging naval co-operation deal in which they will jointly develop coastal patrol vessels.” Read more. FREDDIE MAC PAYS OUT — POLITICO Pro’s Lorraine Woellert: “Freddie Mac will send a $2.3 billion dividend payment to taxpayers after profits more than doubled from three months earlier. “That's what the mortgage-finance company earned in the third quarter, buoyed by strong home-price growth and market reaction to Brexit. The $2.3 billion profit was up from $993 million in the second quarter and a dramatic reversal of a $475 million loss a year ago.” Read more. HULU BUNDLES UP FOR 2017 — The Atlantic’s David Sims: “Though “cord-cutting” is on the rise and subscription numbers have declined, the change has been gradual enough to not cut too deeply into profit margins. That may change in 2017, however, with the news that Hulu will offer more than 35 live TV networks to subscribers in the New Year for an as-yet undetermined price. With this kind of “bundling,” where various popular channels are sold as a package, streaming TV is starting to more closely resemble the very thing it was meant to replace.” Read more. GAS BREACH DRIVES UP PRICES — Washington Post’s Steven Mufson: “For the second time in less than two months, a major breach closed down a key gasoline pipeline, driving up fuel prices and demonstrating the vulnerability of the entire Eastern Seaboard to an accident on a single piece of infrastructure. “Gasoline prices before taxes and fees soared Tuesday more than at any time since 2008. Early in the day, prices jumped 15 percent but finished the day up 4.6 percent at $1.4841 a gallon after the company said it hoped to reopen the pipeline Saturday afternoon.” Read more. KOREA NAMES NEW PM AND FINANCIAL MINISTER — Bloomberg’s Kanga Kong: “South Korean President Park Geun-hye named a new prime minister and finance minister Wednesday as she seeks to stem the fallout from an influence-peddling scandal threatening her grip on power. “Park nominated Kim Byong-joon, a policy adviser under the administration of former President Roh Moo-hyun, as prime minister to take over from Hwang Kyo-ahn. Yim Jong-yong, chairman of the nation’s Financial Services Commission, will take over from Yoo Il-ho in the top finance role.” Read more. IRAQI FORCES ENTER MOSUL — AP’s Qassim Abdul-Zahra and Brian Rohan: “Iraq's special forces fought their way into the outskirts of Mosul on Tuesday, taking its state television building despite resistance by Islamic State group fighters that is only likely to stiffen when combat reaches the inner city. “It was the first time Iraqi troops have set foot in the city, Iraq's second-largest, in more than two years. The advance was the start of what is likely to be a grueling and slow operation for the forces as they fend off booby traps and ambushes in difficult, house-to-house fighting expected to take weeks, if not months.” Read more. GANNETT DUMPS TRONC — NYT’s Leslie Picker and Sydney Ember: “For a deal that took six months of battling back and forth, the message of its collapse was cursory. In a brief telephone conversation early Tuesday morning, Robert J. Dickey, the chief executive of the Gannett Company, told his counterpart at the company formerly known as Tribune Publishing that Gannett, the nation’s largest chain of newspapers, was dropping its $680 million-plus takeover bid — weeks after a price had been agreed upon. “A deal would have merged the publisher of USA Today with the owner of The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune. It was intended to build a scale large enough to cut costs and eke out profits in an industry struggling with shrinking advertising revenue and declining circulations. Over the six months when the two companies sparred over a deal, the advertising market for newspapers was deteriorating. Last week, the banks that would have financed a purchase balked” Read more. NEW REGS HITTING PROFITS … AND SAFETY? — Via TCH: “[N]ew research … finds that changes in regulation are reducing banks’ profitability and therefore the market value of their equity. Post-crisis financial regulations have made banks more resilient to adverse economic and financial shocks by requiring them to hold substantially more capital and made their balance sheets substantially more liquid. However … lower profitability and market value reduce bank resilience” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements. With longer lifespans, this often means saving for a longer retirement. These challenges have made planning and saving for retirement more difficult. But what if all Americans could get paychecks for life? Policymakers can help make this possible by supporting policies that encourage saving, make workplace retirement plans more broadly available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies.

Broomfield is the smallest county in the state, the newest county in the country and the ninth-fastest growing county in the United States. Ahrens has spent most of his life in the area. "I'm literally a home-grown mayor. So it's pretty serendipitous that I'm here at such an exciting time," Ahrens said. The county had several large businesses show interest in the past three months, including JPMorgan Chase, IKEA, and the plumbing and HVAC manufacturer Viega. JPMorgan Chase bought 106 acres of land on West 160th Avenue near Sheridan Parkway with the intention of building a $200 million data and storage facility. A few miles away at Interstate 25 and Highway 7, IKEA has plans for a large plot of land. It's located next to the gas station where Crystal Haislip works. Haislip has lived her entire life nearby and isn't thrilled about more growth. "It's not the small area that it used to be. It used to be fields. You used to be able to see the mountains and now you can't," Haislip said. "It's just going to keep going. It's not going to stop. There's nothing we can do." Ahrens agrees. "We could probably have the same conversation in six months and we'll have some new projects coming," Ahrens said. He also said the reason growth comes so easy is because there are no rule differences between the city and county of Broomfield. There's only one governing body for both. So not only do businesses only have to worry about one set of rules, the county can also combine services like the police department and the sheriff's office.

Updated: November 20, 2016 @ 11:56 am Full Forecast Obituaries News Sports Fun Buy & Sell Close AP Why Intersect ENT Shares Are Rallying Back 12% Today newsfeedback@fool.com (Todd Campbell) Nov 3, 2016 0   Image source: Getty Images. What happened Following a big drop in its shares yesterday that was caused by potential Medicare reimbursement headwinds, Intersect ENT (NASDAQ: XENT) reported third-quarter financial results that reassured investors and sent shares rallying 12.5% higher today at 2:30 p.m. EDT. So what On Nov. 1, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released the 2017 Medicare Hospital Outpatient Final Rule, implementing comprehensive ambulatory payment classification (APC) for upper airway procedures, including sinus surgery. The ruling for upper airway procedures, including sinus surgery, includes reimbursement at a fixed amount that's 40% to 50% below the current average amount. The ruling goes into effect on Jan. 1. The ruling led to J.P. Morgan downgrading Intersect ENT shares from overweight to neutral yesterday. J.P. Morgan also reduced its price target to $16 from $25. Between the ruling and J.P. Morgan's downgrade, Intersect ENT's shares tumbled by more than 40% on Wednesday. However, Intersect ENT's third-quarter conference call after the bell yesterday assuaged some of investors' fears. Management thinks that the CMS decision only directly impacts about 8% of its sales, and it doesn't expect any short-term changes in reimbursement from commercial insurers.  The company also said that sales of its Propel and Propel mini steroid-releasing implants, which are used in chronic sinusitis surgeries, grew 29.8% year over year to $18.47 million in the third quarter and that its third-quarter loss was $0.22 per share, or $0.05 better than industry watchers were predicting.  Now what Latest gallery in this section 5 charts that predict the Fed's intentions on interest-rate hikes Intersect ENT's not out of the woods yet. CEO Lisa Earnhardt was reassuring, but it did appear that she left the door open for some pricing risk longer term. Earnhardt's team is continuing "to assess the impact of the Medicare ruling" and the use of the words "near term" when describing their thinking that there will be "little to no impact" on non-Medicare business could be telling. However, Intersect ENT does have some things going for it. The company has $108 million in cash and investments on the books and it expects its use of cash to be around $23 million this year. That suggests it's got enough funding to continue to grow demand for its products, including new products that it hopes to see hit the market over the coming year. Assuming that Intersect ENT can limit the risk of pricing pressure (perhaps via getting its own CMS J-code for payment), then this stock could end up being a bargain-bin buy sometime next year.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) FILE - In this Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016, photo, a miniature reproduction of Arturo Di Modica's "Charging Bull" sculpture sits on display at a street vendor's table outside the New York Stock Exchange, in lower Manhattan. Stocks are opening slightly higher on Wall Street, giving the market a chance to break its longest losing streak in five years, Thursday, Nov 3. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • Stocks retreated for an eighth consecutive day on Thursday as nervous investors remain transfixed on the potential outcome of next week's U.S. presidential election, which has become too close to call. The stock market is now on its longest losing streak since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 28.97 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,930.67. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 9.28 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,088.66 and the Nasdaq composite index fell 47.16 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,058.41. With five days left until the election, Hillary Clinton maintains a lead in national polling in the U.S. presidential race but Donald Trump has significantly narrowed the gap, particularly in swing states. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Investors pointed to polls released in the last two days from Florida, New Hampshire and North Carolina where the two candidates are either statistically tied or Trump holds a small lead. Investors like certainty, which means they generally favor a Clinton victory as she is seen as maintaining the status quo. Trump's policies are less clear, and the uncertainty has caused jitters in financial markets. The last time the S&P 500 fell for eight straight days was early October 2008, the depths of the financial crisis. However the losses over this period have been modest, nowhere close to the losses racked up in 2008. "It's a pretty simple equation: uncertainty goes up, stock market goes down," said David Kelly, chief global strategist with JPMorgan Funds. The Mexican peso, which has become an indirect proxy among investors for Trump's chances at the White House, advanced 1 percent against the dollar on Thursday. Investors have speculated that a Trump administration would be negative for the Mexican economy, and would cause the Mexican peso's value to fall as a result. The VIX, a measure of volatility that is called Wall Street's "fear gauge," jumped 16 percent this week to its highest level since June. The measure is up 36 percent this week alone. Kelly said that Clinton is being considered a continuation of the Obama administration, which is mostly priced into the market, whereas Trump would represent a significant departure from current policies and would introduce a great deal more uncertainty into the economy. He expects the stock market to drop sharply if Trump wins. In other parts of the market, generic drug makers plunged after news reports came out at the Department of Justice was looking to file charges, alleging price fixing, against the companies by end of year. Mylan lost $2.53, or 7 percent, to $34.14, Teva Pharmaceuticals fell $4.13, or 9.5 percent, to $39.20 and Endo International plunged $3.54, or 19.5 percent, to $14.63. Facebook fell $7.22, or 6 percent, to $119.95. While the company reported third quarter results that easily exceeded analysts' estimates, it also acknowledged that growth in advertising revenue was slowing. Fitbit, the maker of wearable fitness trackers and other devices, plunged $4.30, or 34 percent, to $8.51 after the company slashed its outlook for the year, citing weak demand for its products. The company also cut its sales forecast for the holiday shopping season. The price of crude oil extended a losing streak into a fifth day. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped 68 cents to $44.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 51 cents at $46.35 a barrel in London. Heating oil fell 1 cent to $1.45 a gallon, wholesale gasoline fell 2 cents to $1.43 a gallon and natural gas fell 2 cents to $2.769 per 1,000 cubic feet. U.S. government bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.81 percent from 1.80 percent a day earlier. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 102.99 yen from 103.28 yen, while the euro edged up to $1.1099 from $1.1096 the day before. In metals trading, gold fell $4.90 to $1,303.30 an ounce, silver fell 28 cents to $18.41 an ounce and copper fell 2 cents to $2.249 a pound.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Op-ed: Should Mormons who voted for Trump get temple recommends?

The stock market is now on its longest losing streak since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 28.97 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,930.67. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 9.28 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,088.66 and the Nasdaq composite index fell 47.16 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,058.41. With five days left until the election, Hillary Clinton maintains a lead in national polling in the U.S. presidential race but Donald Trump has significantly narrowed the gap, particularly in swing states. Investors pointed to polls released in the last two days from Florida, New Hampshire and North Carolina where the two candidates are either statistically tied or Trump holds a small lead. Investors like certainty, which means they generally favor a Clinton victory as she is seen as maintaining the status quo. Trump's policies are less clear, and the uncertainty has caused jitters in financial markets. The last time the S&P 500 fell for eight straight days was early October 2008, the depths of the financial crisis. However the losses over this period have been modest, nowhere close to the losses racked up in 2008. "It's a pretty simple equation: uncertainty goes up, stock market goes down," said David Kelly, chief global strategist with JPMorgan Funds. The Mexican peso, which has become an indirect proxy among investors for Trump's chances at the White House, advanced 1 percent against the dollar on Thursday. Investors have speculated that a Trump administration would be negative for the Mexican economy, and would cause the Mexican peso's value to fall as a result. The VIX, a measure of volatility that is called Wall Street's "fear gauge," jumped 16 percent this week to its highest level since June. The measure is up 36 percent this week alone. Kelly said that Clinton is being considered a continuation of the Obama administration, which is mostly priced into the market, whereas Trump would represent a significant departure from current policies and would introduce a great deal more uncertainty into the economy. He expects the stock market to drop sharply if Trump wins. In other parts of the market, generic drug makers plunged after news reports came out at the Department of Justice was looking to file charges, alleging price fixing, against the companies by end of year. Mylan lost $2.53, or 7 percent, to $34.14, Teva Pharmaceuticals fell $4.13, or 9.5 percent, to $39.20 and Endo International plunged $3.54, or 19.5 percent, to $14.63. Facebook fell $7.22, or 6 percent, to $119.95. While the company reported third quarter results that easily exceeded analysts' estimates, it also acknowledged that growth in advertising revenue was slowing. Fitbit, the maker of wearable fitness trackers and other devices, plunged $4.30, or 34 percent, to $8.51 after the company slashed its outlook for the year, citing weak demand for its products. The company also cut its sales forecast for the holiday shopping season. The price of crude oil extended a losing streak into a fifth day.

Investors' enthusiasm was checked as they remain transfixed on the potential outcome of next week's U.S. presidential election. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average was little changed at 17,961 as of 12:30 p.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell five points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,093 and the Nasdaq composite lost 32 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,073. ELECTION JITTERS: With five days left until the election, Hillary Clinton maintains a lead in polling in the U.S. presidential race but Donald Trump has narrowed the gap. Investors generally favor a Clinton victory as she is seen as maintaining the status quo. Trump's policies are less clear, and the uncertainty has caused jitters in financial markets. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "It's a pretty simple equation: uncertainty goes up, stock market goes down," said David Kelly, chief global strategist with JPMorgan Funds. The Mexican peso, which has become Wall Street's proxy for Trump's chances at the White House, advanced 1 percent against the dollar on Thursday. Investors have speculated that a Trump administration would be negative for the Mexican economy, and would cause the Mexican peso's value to fall as a result. Kelly said that Clinton is being considered a continuation of the Obama administration, which is mostly priced into the market, whereas Trump would represent a significant departure from current policies and would introduce a great deal more uncertainty into the economy. He expects the stock market to sell off following a Trump victory. POUND UP: The battered British pound jumped more than 1 percent to $1.246 after a court ruled that Prime Minister Theresa May must hold a vote in parliament over leaving the European Union. May had maintained that the government could give the EU notice it is leaving without such a vote, after voters chose the "leave" option in a referendum in June. A vote in parliament was seen as making it less likely that the government would wind up with a "hard" exit involving loss of access to tariff-free business with the EU, which is the country's largest trading partner. The government can appeal the court decision. OUT OF SHAPE: Fitbit, the maker of wearable fitness trackers and other devices, plunged $4.42, or 34 percent, to $8.39 after the company slashed its outlook for the year, citing weak demand for its products. The company also cut its sales forecast for the holiday shopping season. UN-LIKED: Facebook fell $7.54, or 6 percent, to $119.60. While the company reported third quarter results that easily exceeded analysts' estimates, it also acknowledged that growth in advertising revenue was slowing. ENERGY: The price of crude oil extended a losing streak into a fifth day. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped 90 cents to $44.45 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, was fell 50 cents at $46.35 a barrel in London. BONDS AND CURRENCIES: U.S. government bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.82 percent from 1.80 percent a day earlier. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 102.97 yen from 103.28 yen, while the euro edged up to $1.1099 from $1.1096 the day before.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Op-ed: Should Mormons who voted for Trump get temple recommends?

Wendy Halloran and Elizabeth Wiley, KPNX 10:36 PM. MST November 03, 2016 Corky Heinsen holds her mother Janet Rickman's hand. (Photo: Jeff Blackburn/12 News) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Janet Rickman is one of more than 5 million Americans who suffer from Alzheimer’s. All seniors are vulnerable to financial exploitation – a recent study found one in twenty seniors reported being financially mistreated. But the population who suffers from dementia is especially vulnerable. In Rickman’s case someone close to her is accused of taking advantage of her diminished mental capacity to take $32,000 of her savings. To make matters worse, Richard Bauer, her son-in-law and the accused, worked for the state agency charged with protecting vulnerable adults from abuse, neglect and exploitation. A 12 News investigation has uncovered that the Department of Economic Security kept Bauer on the payroll, and didn’t have systems in place to keep him from returning after he was accused of financially exploiting Rickman. Bauer, who goes by Rick, was dismissed from the Department of Economic Security on March 3, 2016. His position at the time was listed as Senior Lead Apps Supervisor. But Bauer was not done working for DES in March. He came back to the agency not once, but twice, as a temporary worker via an agency after he was removed. RELATED: How to spot and report elder abuse DES director Tim Jeffries said Bauer’s first return was concluded as soon as they learned about it. But records show he came back a second time as a temporary worker, seemingly slipping through the cracks because no mechanism was in place to prevent his rehiring. Victim Janet Rickman’s story isn’t one of classic bookkeeper style embezzlement. It's a story about her son-in-law, who allegedly took control and converted her money for personal gain, according to investigative records. Earlier this year, a state grand jury indicted 56-year-old Bauer on two felony counts of fraudulent schemes and artifices and theft of funds from a vulnerable adult. His alleged victim is 83-year-old Janet Rickman, his mother-in-law, who suffers from an advance stage of Alzheimer’s disease. Bauer had worked for DES since 1993 in the IT department. His wife Virginia also worked at the agency in accounting. She last served as a fiscal services specialist before retiring in the fall of 2013. Virginia is Rickman’s daughter. RELATED: Get help caring for someone with Alzheimer's The Heinsens’ suspicions are raised Corky Heinsen is Virginia’s sister and Rickman’s other daughter. In the spring of 2015, Heinsen and her husband Paul sensed something was off with her mother's bank statements. At the time, Rickman’s doctor noted that she had become progressively more belligerent, confused and paranoid. Heinsen discovered her brother-in-law Rick Bauer was a cosigner on her mother's Wells Fargo account. Money was missing, a lot of it. She got Bauer on the phone and surreptitiously recorded the conversation, the old-fashioned way: a cassette recorder. Corky: “There's so much money missing.” Rick: "It's all care and living expenses there's nothing missing.” When Heinsen started asking questions, Bauer seemed to have a ready reason. Rick: “She took the money out of the bank and she gave it to me. She handed it to me and said, ‘here now go get me some groceries.’” But the answers Heinsen received did not make sense. “He tried to tell me it was a gift that my mother gifted it to him,” she explained. As far as she was concerned it was just one implausible excuse after another. Rick: “Mileage down to the post office and the bank every week for five years.” Corky: “Mileage for five years?” He denied the accusations. Corky: “My mom is, she's crying because she doesn't have any money. She’s wondering why you took all this money out every month.” Rick: “I took the money out every month? I didn't take the money out every month.” Then he claims Rickman kept taking money out of her bank. Corky: “Who would do that to an older woman? Rick: (Laughs.) Heinsen: "It's not funny.” Finally, a confession, of sorts. Rick: “Believe me the first three to four months it was, it was a point to where I wouldn't accept it. Then she forced it on me.” During the later investigation, the attorney general investigators got a subpoena and received bank records related to Rickman’s checking and savings accounts at Arizona Federal Credit Union on September 18, 2015. The investigators identified an official cashier’s check for $32,355.76 dated May 17, 2014, that was drawn from Rickman’s account. Records show the check was deposited two days later on May 19 at JP Morgan Chase Bank, and was endorsed by both Janet and Rick Bauer. And Bauer admitted to investigators that he deposited the cashier’s check into his savings account. Investigative records show Bauer claimed that Rickman told him to withdraw all of her money. He used that money to purchase a cashier's check in the amount of $32,355.76. He would later tell investigators from the AG’s Office that his mother-in-law told him he was to put the check away and not tell anyone, and to use it to pay his bills. But that’s not what he said on Heinsen’s recording. Corky: “What happened to my mom's $32,000. Rick: “What?” Corky: “$32,000. Rick: “I have no idea.” Corky: “You have no idea, Rick? You have no idea?” Rick: “I have no idea.” The lengthy recorded conversation sounded like a game of cat and mouse. Corky: “It's funny you have no idea Rick, because your name is on the back of the cashier's check. Your name. Your signature, Rick. So you have no idea, huh? That's why I mean you better stop what you're doing and you better think, and you better think real hard.” Rick: “Alright I'll stop what I'm doing.” Corky: “Yeah, you better stop because I have it right here. I've been to the bank several times and I'm onto you.” Daughter fights to protect vulnerable mother On June 9, 2015 the Heinsens filed complaints with the Office of the Attorney General and DES’s Adult Protective Services alleging her sister and brother-in-law left her mother financially destitute for their own personal benefit. Their suspicions were further heightened when the Bauers placed Janet in an assisted living facility, without the Heinsens’ knowledge or any discussion. The couple says they began looking into Janet’s financial situation and learned there was not enough money to pay for her long-term care. What’s more, Rickman had lived alone until October 2014, when the Bauers moved her into their trailer, telling the Heinsens that Rickman was not able to care for herself. “I just wished this had never happened to my mother,” said Corky Heinsen of Rickman. Rickman was frugal, living off social security and widow's benefits from her husband’s military service. “She always went without so that others could have what they needed,” Heinsen said. RELATED: The cost of Alzheimer’s and resources for those impacted In the last stage of Alzheimer's – stage 7 – Rickman has a blank stare that goes right through you. She's unable to speak, walk, or read. “My mother didn't know what they were doing,” said Heinsen. It’s a disease that robs her mind and breaks her daughter's heart. “Every day I see her it gets harder and I just pray to God each time that she knows who I am,” Heinsen said. This is the woman who Corky Heinsen says was victimized by her own son-in-law. “She didn't deserve this,” said Heinsen. She said DES was dismissive of her complaint. So she took her own steps to protect her mother. “I put her where no one could find her,” said Heinsen. “I was afraid that they would take the rest. And I don't want my sister and brother-in-law to know where my mother is,” Heinsen added. The investigation gets underway While Corky Heinsen had her suspicions about Bauer, his employer DES didn’t investigate him until the Heinsens filed a complaint in June 2015. Emails between the Heinsens and DES Human Services Specialist III Jade Shelton show Shelton told the Heinsens that this investigation had top priority and support from the top of the top. But come July 22, Shelton seemingly walked back her fervor and informed the Heinsens that the investigation was placed on hold. She wrote, “I am unable to interview the alleged perpetrator (AP) Richard Bauer per the Attorney General’s Office.” “They wanted it to go away. And someone tried to have it go away,” said Corky Heinsen.  More than six months would go by. The Heinsens were infuriated with the bureaucratic obstacles. Then, an email dated February 26, 2016, would bring some welcome news. DES’s Mark Darmer wrote that the department had completed its internal investigation and would be taking, “appropriate action on our employee as it pertains to our findings.” Darmer further wrote that the criminal portion of the investigation was being handled by the Arizona Attorney General’s Office. What Darmer meant by “appropriate action” was not entirely clear. It would soon come into focus. But the Heinsens were in for a shocker. Internal emails obtained by 12 News reveal Bauer left the agency on March 3, 2016. Director Jeffries has repeatedly declined to confirm whether Bauer was allowed to retire or if he was fired. He did agree to an on-camera interview, which he said was against the advice of his attorney. “Legally we cannot talk about Adult Protective Services cases and I'm having this interview despite legal advice not to have it from the attorney's paid to give me consultation,” Jeffries said. He answered the question about Bauer’s departure. “The former employee departed as an at-will employee and that's the extent of my comment,” said Jeffries. On April 26, 2016, the Heinsens emailed Darmer again to get clarification as to what the “appropriate action” was against Bauer. It would take just over two weeks for them to get a response. On May 11, 2016, Darmer responded. He apologized for the delayed response and indicated the case had been turned over to the Attorney General’s Office for possible prosecution. He wrote that he was unable to provide details regarding the disciplinary action related to the DES employee involved in the case, but that “appropriate action was taken against the employee.” Slipped through the cracks However, records show Bauer was allowed to come back to the agency. After Bauer’s return was discovered, Jeffries wrote an email asking, “How did this guy slip through the cracks?” Jeffries later answered that question during an on-camera interview: “He reappeared in the agency twice as a temporary worker.” “It was highly inappropriate for him to be allowed to return as a temp worker and to be allowed to return a second time as a temp worker,” said Jeffries. Corky Heinsen fails to understand how her brother-in-law continued working there. “No one did anything,” she said. Dark comedy of errors She was spot on. Bauer was even working for DES after he was indicted on July 14. Records show AG Special Agent Liz Lopez emailed Jade Shelton and Dale Doucet at DES that day telling them Bauer had been indicted and if they had any questions to let her know. Jeffries also sent an email to staffers that day, stating “Move forward without delay. And, find out how the employee was rehired.” Records clearly show that DES knew, all the way to the very top of the agency, Bauer had been working there. Even with this knowledge, Bauer worked there for nearly three more weeks before he was finally let go for the third time. We asked Jeffries if he personally told Bauer his services were no longer needed. His said no and couldn’t name who had asked Bauer to leave. “I don't recall who specifically but I do know it happened swiftly,” said Jeffries. Accused exploiter still worked within DES While DES used the word “swiftly”, the Heinsens take exception to describe the agency’s actions that way. While records show Bauer departed the agency March 3, he boomeranged back in rather quickly. In an email to 12 News, DES Communications Director Tasya Peterson confirmed Bauer began working the following month, on April 18, and stayed through July 15. An email from Gilbert Burgos, the Field Liaison to Director Jeffries, revealed that he informed Jeffries that Bauer was terminated at 11:30 a.m. on July 15.  Within three days, Bauer was back to work at DES via the temporary agency. Peterson confirmed Bauer started again on July 18. Nine days later, on July 26, 12 News attempted to talk to Bauer immediately following his “not guilty” arraignment outside Maricopa County Superior Court. Bauer left the courthouse flanked by his wife Virginia and his then-private criminal defense attorney James E. Novak. At the arraignment, Novak told the judge that his client was employed full-time -- a fact that 12 News brought to Jeffries’ attention in an email. Jeffries responded, stating that “Mr. Bauer was not an employee of DES.” While that may be technically true, Bauer was a temporary worker hired by temporary agency, Randstad. The agency is contracted by the state to provide a variety of temporary workers for DES. DES may not have hired Bauer for his second and third stint with the agency, but there is no refuting that he was working inside DES. Bauer wasn’t told his services were no longer needed for the last time until August 2. That came well after he was indicted on two felony counts of fraudulent schemes and artifices and theft from a vulnerable adult. “This individual never should have returned as a temporary worker once, let alone twice,” Jeffries said. What’s more, another internal email obtained by 12 News revealed there was no mechanism in place to prevent Bauer from returning. The director of the agency stated as much. “There was none. And that was breathtaking to me,” Jeffries said. However, Jeffries said this repeated series of firing and hiring has led to reforms.  “And from that dark comedy of errors we've put in place reforms to ensure that when someone departs the agency they don't boomerang back in any inappropriate form even as a temp worker,” said Jeffries. He did not expand on what those reforms are, however. The Heinsens were outraged at what our investigation uncovered. We asked Jeffries what he would say to them. “DES was not perfect in this and I take that quite deeply. And we've already reformed as a result of it. So, in some ways we're already redeeming this beautiful, vulnerable lady’s life.” When asked if he felt his agency failed the Heinsens, Jeffries said, “No.” When pressed he replied, “Well I'm a humble man. At the end the most important thing is to ensure justice is served. If families suffer additionally in the course of justice being served I will suffer with them.” Jeffries: Check to see if this ‘miscreant’ was ‘F’ing with our systems’ On top of allegedly stealing Rickman’s life savings, Bauer was investigated for using his position as an IT specialist to access her case file. An internal email reveals that, at one point, Jeffries wrote, “Check to see if this ‘miscreant’ was F’ing (sic) with our systems. He is bad news, and we must view his two returns as nefarious.” Later Jeffries said the DES internal review didn’t identify any damage. “I want mother justice to bring the hammer down on this miscreant,” said Jeffries. On July 14, Rick Bauer was indicted by a state grand jury for fraudulent schemes and theft of money from a vulnerable adult while he was a DES employee. In total, he's accused of stealing more than $72,000 from Janet. Investigators have no way to prove Bauer had Janet's blessing. She can’t speak. But according to documents obtained by 12 News, AG investigators are convinced Bauer used his position of trust and confidence as her caregiver to control and convert more than $32,000 of her money without her knowledge or consent for his own personal benefit. The cashier's check uncovered by Corky Heinsen – rock solid evidence. A torrent of ill will His wife Virginia Bauer, a retired DES employee, is standing by her man, but not her sister. Virginia responded to each of our questions with, “no comment.” But her sister said Virginia's actions have been a divisive wedge in their relationship. “As far as I’m concerned, I have no relationship with my sister,” said Corky. There is bad blood in the family since the Heinsens turned in the Bauers. Virginia unleashed a torrent of ill will through angry and menacing text messages. One from April 19, reads: “I hope you have died and gone to hell.” Followed by: “But would like to know how my mother is doing after all the bullshit you loaded into her head???” Then, nearly a month later on May 18: “Are you all dead??? Life is so wonderful without you all in it!!!” As for Janet, the Bauers are no longer a part of her life either. “We're the only ones that see my mother. That's my fault because I put her where no one could find her,” said Corky. The Bauers are questioned Special Agent Supervisor Robert Eckert and Agent Lopez, investigators from the Office of the Attorney General Special Investigations Section, interviewed the Bauers at their home. The couple was interviewed together, not separately. Rick Bauer had been previously interviewed alone while he still employed with DES. The prosecution report says the Bauers were not Mirandized nor were they in custody at the time of the interview. The interview lasted 86 minutes. The digital recording of that interview has been entered as evidence in the criminal case and is not yet releasable. According to the written report, Rick told the investigators that Janet was living on her own at her home in October of 2014 and had fallen down. He said at the time he would go to her home daily to help her. Then, he and his wife decided to bring Janet to live with them. Virginia told the investigators she quit her job to take care of her mother. But DES records show she left the agency on October 18, 2013, a year before. There were inconsistencies in Rick's story. For example, he told investigators Janet was able to use the bathroom on her own. But later said they would purchase Janet diapers. He admitted he deposited the $32,000 cashier's check into his saving account and paid off his credit card bills. "There's times were [sic] you know I feel guilty for taking some of the money that she had given me: but every time I tried to give it back to her, it's like, ‘No that's yours, you take it, you keep it, you earned it,’" said Rick Bauer. "I just got to where you know I didn't question it anymore and just took whatever she gave me," he added. Both Bauers admitted to investigators that they had known since 2014 that Janet was having issues with her mental capacity. Rick told investigators that her cognitive abilities began to diminish before she started living with them. When investigators asked if Rick felt it was appropriate to ask Janet to sign a general Power of Attorney, he said, "She wasn't that diminished when I actually had the POA signed over." He stated that Janet's mental capacity did not start getting worse until about March 2015. However, that contradicted what he told investigators earlier – that Janet had been having issues with her mental capacity since about 2014. The investigative report also reveals Rick Bauer seemed to evade questions about why he listed July 1, 2014 as the effective date on the POA even though it wasn't signed or notarized until September 21, 2014. He stated: "I didn't take any money from her." When asked what he spent the $32,000 check on, he told investigators he used it to pay his bills, which included credit card debt. According to Rick, Janet told him it was okay for him to use her financial resources to pay for his debt. Virginia told investigators that her mother wanted them to have the money because if she passed away they would not get the money. The investigator punctuated the case with this analysis: "Richard and Virginia, while in a position of trust and confidence as Janet's caregivers, had reason to know Janet lacked capacity at the time she gave Rick a $32,355.76 cashier's check. Furthermore, Janet also lacked capacity when she gave Rick cash every time she made cash withdrawals from her bank. Moreover, Janet also lacked capacity when she signed a general POA in September 2014.” Records show when the investigator reviewed the Wells Fargo checking and savings accounts from November 6, 2000 to July 12, 2014, he noticed Janet and her daughter Corky were authorized users on the account. On July 12, 2014 the investigation revealed there were two separate relationship change applications for the checking and savings accounts. One made Rick Bauer an authorized signer on both accounts; the other removed Corky from both accounts. The investigative report shows Virginia knew her mother was suffering from a diminished mental capacity. She made a contradictory statement to investigators that the Heinsens wanted nothing to do with her mother. Virginia Bauer is not facing any charges. Several months ago Michael Powell, the prosecutor from the Attorney General’s Office, offered Bauer a plea deal, which would substantially reduce his penalties. In the offer, if Bauer pleads guilty to theft from a vulnerable adult and pays more than $32,000 in restitution the day he is sentenced, he will avoid jail time. He will be on supervised probation. But Powell is now on military leave. Shawn Steinberg is the new prosecutor on the case. She has not yet made a new plea offer to Bauer. Whether it will include no jail time remains to be seen. Bauer also has a new defense attorney. He was appointed a public defender, Adam Schwartz. Judge initially denies camera coverage 12 News argued in court to be allowed to film the criminal proceedings in the State v. Bauer after Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Jose Padilla initially denied our camera request for Bauer’s September 14 pre-trial conference without holding a hearing or citing a reason. On September 27, David Bodney, attorney for 12 News, filed a request for camera coverage and asked for a hearing. Oral arguments were heard on October 6. Bodney argued that the public has a right to know about the abuse of vulnerable adults by state employees and how the government holds them accountable. Bauer’s court-appointed public defender Adam Schwartz objected to camera coverage in the room. He argued that it would cause “headaches” for his client, Bauer, if his face were to appear on the nightly news. Assistant Attorney General Shawn Steinberg, the prosecutor on the case, got approval from the victim’s advocate for camera coverage. On October 11, Judge Padilla ruled in 12 News’ favor, granting our request to have a camera in the courtroom for Bauer’s comprehensive pre-trial conference. What will justice look like? Bauer’s next court appearance is set for January and his trial is expected to get underway on February 22, 2017. As for one of Rick Bauer’s former defenses – that it was an act of God – Paul Heinsen lambasted that strategy, calling it “despicable.” “The defense is playing the delaying tactic. As you can see by the Notion of Defense, they throw as much BS up onto the wall and see what sticks. It’s an old defense tactic I have seen many times,” he said. Meanwhile, Corky Heinsen is losing her mother to the cruel disease, but she’s also lost her sister due to her efforts to seek justice for Rickman. “It really hurts because I’ve lost my sister,” Corky Heinsen said. For now, Corky Heinsen is focused on getting justice for her mother, even if Rickman doesn’t realize it. “Justice to me would mean that he (Rick Bauer) is held criminally accountable for what he did and is forced to repay at least some of the money he stole from my mother’s accounts,” said Corky Heinsen. “I realize there will never be a complete financial accounting.” Corky Heinsen also hopes DES is held accountable for what she calls a “lack of concern and total neglect.” “That hurts me deeply and always will.” Copyright 2016 KPNX CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS New analysis of the JonBenét Ramsey case Family thankful for support after mom's death Birdie Bus' roams Phoenix area to give rescued parrots forever homes Could cold-blooded killers go free?

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Wells Fargo Hikes Possible Legal Costs 70% as SEC Probes Sham Accounts Wells Fargo is grappling with regulatory probes and lawsuits after a scandal surrounding as many as 2 million unauthorized consumer accounts prompted the abrupt retirement of CEO John Stumpf. James Langford Nov 3, 2016 2:23 PM EDT Wells Fargo (WFC) boosted its estimate of possible litigation losses by 70%, to $1.7 billion, as the Securities and Exchange Commission joined regulators probing the bank's handling of a scandal involving as many as 2 million bogus customer accounts. That amount, which isn't reflected in Wells Fargo's profit-and-loss statements, is in addition to so-called probable losses that the bank does include, though the amount isn't specified. The estimate, listed in the bank's third-quarter regulatory filing on Thursday, compares with an assessment of $1 billion at the end of June. Wells Fargo didn't say which legal matters spurred the $700 million increase, though the San Francisco-based bank provided ligation updates on mortgage-lending probes and debit-card purchase lawsuits in addition to the retail division's sales-practices cases. Peter Gilchrist, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail that the figure reflected "a number of matters." The company, which once had a market valuation larger than JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) , has lost 8.9% of that since the bogus accounts were disclosed in a $185 million settlement with federal and local regulators in September. The revelation prompted an immediate backlash of lawsuits as well as probes by the Department of Justice and state attorneys general, and has cost Wells Fargo lucrative business deals with states from California to Illinois and Ohio. Chairman and CEO John Stumpf abruptly retired in mid-October after testifying in two Congressional hearings and giving up $41 million in unvested stock awards. The company's independent directors, led by Stephen Sanger, who was named chairman after Stumpf's departure, have launched an internal probe, which is still ongoing, according to a person familiar with the matter. "There are things that need to be fixed within our culture, and these weaknesses must be addressed," Tim Sloan, who succeeded Stumpf as CEO, told analysts at a Thursday conference. "My primary objective and the objective of our senior leadership team is to restore trust in Wells Fargo. That includes rebuilding pride in our company and our vision of meeting customers' financial needs." Well's Fargo's scandal has already had ramifications well beyond the San Francisco-based bank, with executives at JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) fielding questions about their own consumer sales practices during third-quarter earnings calls in October.

It’s part of what drove him into the Thoroughbred world, a passion of his since he was in high school and attended the 1954 Kentucky Derby won by a gray colt named Determine. Forty-seven years later, Oxley and his wife, Debby, would get to the Derby winner’s circle at Churchill Downs after their gray colt, Monarchos  , scorched his way to victory in 2001. Since then, the Oklahoma native and star polo player has blown alternately hot and cold in the sport, but lately the winds of change have brought the welcome scent of success back to the Oxleys, who will have a pair of Breeders’ Cup starters in La Coronel in the Juvenile Fillies Turf (gr. IT) and the impressive Classic Empire in the Sentient Jet Juvenile (gr. I). “It’s certainly been a roller-coaster of highs and lows, which I guess makes it exciting and unpredictable,” said Oxley, who owns Fawn Leap Farm just outside Midway, Ky. “We’re having a good season, and we’ve been fortunate with Classic Empire, who is the leader of the pack.” Oxley went to $475,000 to land the son of Pioneerof the Nile   as a Keeneland September yearling, having looked him over several times with his trainer, Mark Casse. “He had the perfect conformation and I told Mark we had to buy him,” Oxley said of the colt who won the Oct. 8 Claiborne Breeders’ Futurity (gr. I) about 100 yards from that auction ring. Oxley has enjoyed a rebirth in the sport this year, taking the Winning Colors Stakes (gr. III) with Diva Express, the Spinaway Stakes (gr. I) with Pretty City Dancer, the JP Morgan Chase Jessamine Stakes (gr. IIIT) with La Coronel, and the Futurity and Bashford Manor Stakes (gr. III) with Classic Empire. Last season the stable saw Noble Bird win the grade I Stephen Foster Handicap and the grade III Pimlico Special Handicap, Airoforce win the Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes (gr. II) and the Dixiana Bourbon Stakes (gr. III), and SkyTreasure win the Nassau Stakes (Can-IIT). Oxley is quick to affix the credit to his trainer. “There are so many components,” he said, “but foremost is Mark Casse and his incredible team. He’s put together the finest operation out there with top assistants and personnel on all levels. He’s the brains behind it all. And he’s awfully good at picking out yearlings and 2-year-olds to buy.” Classic Empire broke his maiden at first asking this May at Churchill Downs and won the Bashford Manor in just his second start. The only flaw in those performances was the colt’s inability to break cleanly. That manifested itself in a big way in the Hopeful Stakes (gr. I) at Saratoga Race Course in September, when he wheeled leaving the gate and dumped his rider as the odds-on favorite. Casse and company needed to go to work to get the talented runner back on track. Adding blinkers, Casse worked the colt from the gate twice and then brought him back in the Breeders’ Futurity. This time, Classic Empire broke clean as a whistle, settled into a stalking trip, and cruised to a professional three-length victory. “He did everything I could have hoped for that day,” said Oxley. “He was perfect and won under a hand ride, so you couldn’t have asked for anything better. I’ve been around this sport for 45 years and have had a lot of setbacks, so it’s nice to get optimistic and feel good about your program. We’re pretty excited right now; he’s continued to train well.” In addition to Classic Empire and La Coronel, who owns back-to-back turf wins, Oxley is excited about Speedmeister, who broke his maiden at Keeneland and looks like a 2-year-old with a future. Hopefully that future includes possible Kentucky Derby appearances by Speedmeister and Classic Empire. “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime thing,” Oxley said about winning the roses. “You hope to do it again, but who knows.” The up-and-down nature of the game was again brought home when Monarchos died recently. “It’s been a sad few days,” allowed Oxley. “He brings back so many memories and was such a great horse throughout his 2-year-old season and through the Derby. So many thrills. He’s been such a popular horse standing at Nuckols Farm close to our farm. He had visitors from all over the world and it was a wonderful 18 years racing and then as a stallion. Gray horses are always popular and gray Derby winners are even more popular. He struck a note with racing fans everywhere.” Tags Airoforce Classic Empire Classic Empire Diva Express La Coronel Noble Bird Sky Treasure Mark Casse John Oxley Monarchos Pretty City Daner Related Content Noble Bird Wins Fayette in Track-Record Time Tepin, Classic Empire Work at Churchill Downs La Coronel Powers Home in Jessamine Catch a Glimpse Preps on Keeneland Turf Classic Empire Works for Breeders' Futurity Airoforce, 'Oscar' Face Off at Kentucky Downs Bitumen, Runaway Lute Top Hopeful Gunnevera Dominates Delta Downs Jackpot California Chrome Could Race at Los Al Next Most Popular Stories Gunnevera Dominates Delta Downs Jackpot California Chrome Could Race at Los Al Next California Chrome Logs First Post-BC Work Ivan Fallunovalot Takes De Francis Dash Mastery Masterful in Bob Hope Victory Macagone Upsets Artie Schiller Field Healing for Veterans, a Refuge for Racehorses Cash Control Right at Home in Cardinal River Maid Scores in Bessarabian Gun Runner, Valadorna Possible for CD Stakes In Today's Edition Gunnevera Flies to Delta Downs Jackpot Score Plus news, analysis, entries, results & replays Download Today's Edition Or Download the App BloodHorse Daily Free and Brought to you Daily Get the latest insider news, analysis, entries and results on your phone or sent to your email!

But non-bank lenders are stepping in to fill the gap. For the first time, non-banks such as Quicken Loans Inc., PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust and PHH Corporation claimed a majority of the mortgage market, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. These institutions, which don’t take customer deposits and are supported by privately-owned, government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, took 51.4 percent of home loan money in the third quarter of 2016. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), that figure was just 24.2 percent in 2015 and 6.8 percent as recently as 2012. While the biggest American banks—namely, JP Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co.—still accounted for a large share of the mortgage market, that share fell to 21 percent as of September from 50 percent five years ago, according to the mortgage industry research group. The loan market itself also swelled in the third quarter to the largest dollar value since the fourth quarter of 2012, to $580 billion, a nearly 14 percent increase from the second quarter of 2016, Inside Mortgage Finance found. The figure bolstered signs earlier this year that the demand for mortgages has skyrocketed, with JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup Inc. seeing a collective 31 percent increase in the value of their mortgage operations between the first and second quarters of 2016. Americans’ increased desires to buy homes may stem from the Federal Reserve’s maintaining low interest rates since the 2008 crisis as a stimulus measure. On Wednesday, as in September, Fed chair Janet Yellen announced once again that the Fed would delay a hike, which would gradually trigger higher rates for adjusted-rate mortgages. So what’s pushing consumers to places like Quicken Loans, as opposed to banks like JP Morgan? Related Stories Fed To Make Decision On Interest Rate Hike US Housing Market On Solid Ground The Mortgage Bankers Association’s credit index, which measures the ease of attaining a mortgage on a scale of zero to 1,000, shows a steady climb over the past five years, from below 100 to 171.3 as of October. But that’s still miniscule in comparison to pre-crisis levels of between 800 and 900. So while Americans are increasingly able to get access to home loans, that availability has a long way to go to reach past levels. One reason for this may be the housing market regulations imposed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which makes it more difficult to get a home loan, as applicants have to supply more paperwork and proof that they’ll be able to pay it off. But nonbanks, which aren’t backed by capital or deposits, have taken on a disproportionate number of high-risk mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), with more than two-thirds of the FHA market. The trend may heighten risks surrounding the housing market’s stability, as these institutions are not only low-capital, but also less exposed to regulatory scrutiny as the megabanks. Because the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau does not have a comprehensive record of the entities, for instance, it cannot thoroughly enforce them to comply with its laws. And though the Federal Housing and Finance Agency “has indirect oversight” of market monitors such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, it “lacks statutory authority to examine these third parties to identify and address deficiencies” in the monitors’ scrutiny, according to the GAO.

But new research finds they tend to spend less money with fewer hours of daily sunlight. At 2 a.m. Sunday, clocks will be set back an hour. The time difference between the East Coast and Israel will be seven hours. Daylight savings time will return on Sunday March 12, 2017. A study by JPMorgan Chase Institute compared purchases by credit and debit card users with its parent bank in two southwestern U.S. cities: Los Angeles, which adjusts in and out of daylight saving time, and Phoneix, which follows mountain time year round. Los Angeles saw a 0.9-percent increase, relative to Phoenix, in daily card spending per capita in the month after switching the clocks forward during the U.S. springtime. But the spending reductions outpaced the boost – falling 3.5 percent after the end of daylight saving time, and losing an hour in the autumn as the days get shorter. The spending effects vary: Switching back clocks in the fall impacts goods more than services, while spending tends to drop more on workdays than weekends, the institute said. Grocery stores recorded the biggest decline, shedding almost 6 percent of daily retail per capita spending, followed by fuel sellers, retail shops and discount stores at more than 4.5 percent each. The magnitude of change is smaller for restaurants, probably because people eat at night no matter what time the sun goes down, and spend on health care and personal/professional services because it’s usually necessary, not discretionary spending, the study showed. The study comes as the debate of daylight saving time’s usefulness has been thrown into the spotlight – including its effects on everything from people’s health to energy conservation. Legislation to abolish DST in California almost made it through the state’s legislature, before the Senate squashed it in August. It followed movements over recent years in states such as Arizona, Florida and Michigan to consider changing how they observe time.The JPMorgan Chase Institute conducted the analysis using anonymized data from 450,000 customers for four time-change periods of each kind between October 2012 to June 2015.
