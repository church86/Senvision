But his view that not all is well on the ASX is not. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link In April average cash holdings overtook consumer discretionary stocks as the largest active position held by fund managers across any ASX sector. Photo: AFR While none have so far followed his lead in publicly quitting the market, many in Australia's professional investment community appear to be quietly preparing for a downturn.  According to the JPMorgan Fund Manager Radar, which assesses the public disclosures of major fund managers to deduce common themes, average cash holdings surged to 370 basis points in April, overtaking consumer discretionary stocks as the largest active position held by fund managers across any ASX sector. This follows several months of increasing cash allocations. "We do see the appeal [of cash] in a market where opportunities look increasingly constrained due to extended valuations (healthcare, industrials), structural concerns (banks, resources, retail) and style/franking limitations (REITS)," wrote JPMorgan equity strategist Jason Steed, adding he believed cash allocations could rise further. Advertisement Mr Parker, a 30-year veteran of funds management, said he was cashing out and returning "hundreds of millions" in client money because he believed the overheated east-coast property market, a Chinese debt bubble and overvalued equity markets would combine to spell "calamity" for Australian equity investors. "We think that there is too much risk in this market at the moment, we think it's crazy," he said. "Giving up management and performance fees and handing back cash from investments managed by us is a seminal decision, however, preserving clients' assets is what all fund managers should always put before their own interests." Veteran fund manager Geoff Wilson, of Wilson's Asset Management, didn't quibble with Mr Parker's assessment that the market was heading for some kind of downturn.  On the ASX – which has suffered a bad month, with the S&P/ASX 200 down more than 4 per cent and the big four banks on track for the worst May in 44 years – Wilson said: "It's going to be a tough period. And that's with the backdrop of the biggest global market in the very mature stages of a bull market," he added, referring to Wall Street's record-breaking run. Bennelong Australian Equity Partners' investment director Julian Beaumont was more sanguine, saying while the increasing allocation to cash holdings shows concern is building among fund managers, the level of systemic risk is being overstated. "The risks aren't that bad," he said. "We've always had these risks. [Mr Parker] talks to getting out of equities from the point of view that property looks over-bought. But what's the real relevance of that? A company like Woolworths, or CSL, or Telstra, isn't reliant on the property market. You should still be able to find opportunities. "Since the GFC, the worse the economy has looked, the more quantitative easing was required, the more the market has gone up ... it's not always the case that stockmarket returns will correlate with the economic picture. "We do believe there are some real risks in a large part of the economy, and we're positioning to avoid them." Defensive stance But both fund managers, assessments of risk aside, believed a falling market was no reason to give up on making returns for their investors.  BAEP is favouring sectors that are growing defensively, such as healthcare or everyday consumer products, plus Australian companies whose products are doing well overseas.  As for May's underperformance, "it's the top end that's really suffered", Mr Beaumont said, with the ASX 20 by far the worst performer. "We're certainly not throwing our hands up. We're actually finding some good opportunities. In fact, valuations look quite attractive in certain parts of the market, especially outside the large caps." Mr Wilson, whose main large-cap equity fund is holding 30 per cent cash, believed even if things did worsen as drastically as Mr Parker expected, any downturn would provide an "exciting" opportunity to make some serious money. "People deciding to get their money back, well, that's their choice. But as a professional fund manager, everyone at Wilson spends all day trying to make money. That's the case in cheap markets and in expensive markets."  Mr Wilson added it was his belief that times when equities looked stretched were the best for fund managers to raise money. That's because a crash, when it comes, offers fantastic opportunities to buy companies trading at steep discounts. "Significant market adjustments – whether it's the 1987 crash, the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 or the global financial crisis – they create phenomenal opportunities for astute investors. "Those three events were to me once-in-a-lifetime events where we could buy companies at, say, 50 per cent discounts to their cash backing." Anyway, he added, if you're going to sell out, knowing when to do so is a fraught business. "The thing is, you can never pick the top or the bottom of the market," he said, before wryly noting the market's tendency to confound expectations. "The fact that everyone's negative means it'll probably keep going up in the short term." Advertisement HuffPost Australia The Big Four Whingeing About The Bank ...

However, with innovative entrepreneurs making moves and an economy that is ready to reclaim its former glory, the Motor City is poised for an impressive resurgence. And if you need some convincing, JPMorgan Chase as 150 million reasons to believe in this Michigan gem. In tandem with Detroit Startup Week powered by Chase for Business, JPMorgan Chase has announced they will be increasing their initial investment in the economic recovery of Detroit to $150 million by 2019. This announcement comes after the original $100 million, five-year investment turned out to be two years ahead of schedule. Pretty impressive for a place once known as the largest US city to ever declare of bankruptcy. “Detroit’s resurgence is a model for what can be accomplished when leaders work together to create economic growth and opportunity,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase, in a press release. “This collaboration allowed us to speed up our investment and extend our commitment over the next two years. Going forward, I hope business, government and nonprofit leaders will see Detroit’s comeback as a shining example of how to put aside differences and work to find meaningful and innovative solutions to our most pressing economic problems.” The goal of this investment is to build upon the city’s progress, create livable, inclusive, and sustainable neighborhoods, arm residents with the skills needed for high-quality, well-paying careers, and provide small businesses with the capital they need to succeed. JPMorgan Chase has invested $107 million in loans and grants in Detroit’s economic recovery, including $50 million in community development financing, $25.8 million to revitalize neighborhoods, $15 million for workforce development, $9.5 million for small business expansion, and $6.9 million in additional transformative investments. “JPMorgan Chase has been a true partner in our work to restore economic growth and opportunity in Detroit,” said Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. “The firm’s investments have enabled thousands of Detroiters to receive training, created new opportunities for entrepreneurs and revitalized neighborhoods. There is more work to do, and I hope our continued partnership will build a thriving economy for all Detroiters.” Economic challenges are no stranger to Detroit. But this investment, along with the entrepreneurial spirit of the Motor City, is another step in the right direction. It will utilize everything in Chase’s arsenal to strengthen underlying organizations and create system-wide changes that will improve citywide workforce development strategy. Before you know it, this Michigan city will be the thriving economy we all know and love.

Speaking to journalists on Monday, François Villeroy de Galhau, who is also a governing council member of the European Central Bank, said: “We are having discrete but numerous and serious contacts” with banks in the UK about relocations. He said that “Paris has every chance” of attracting banks. Read more JPMorgan confirms hundreds of UK jobs to move to EU because of Brexit Earlier this month, JPMorgan said it would move hundreds of London jobs to Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg in preparation for Brexit. Daniel Pinto, the firm’s head of investment banking, said at the time that JPMorgan cannot afford to wait for confirmation on how the industry will be regulated after the UK leaves the EU. The sector is crucial to the UK economy and contributed about £71bn to the Exchequer last year, according to professional services firm PwC. Many banks have indicated that they will be forced to move at least some staff and are making contingency plans for a number of potential Brexit outcomes.

Goldman Sachs’ Europe chief executive, Richard Gnodde, confirmed in March that the bank would relocate hundreds of staff out of London before any Brexit deal is struck and said it had already begun implementing those plans. Axel Weber, chairman of UBS, said in January that about 1,000 of the bank’s 5,000 jobs in London could be at risk.

Everything from star traders to fast computers to unique analysis can give a big hedge fund an advantage over competitors. The latest battleground is data. Investors are vying for new data sets that their competitors don't have, or haven't thought of using. These can range from the basic credit-card sales information to satellite data that tracks shipping routes, and parsing this kind of data for trading signals has been called "the future of investing." The industry providing this to the funds has sprung up amid an explosion in obtainable data over the past decade. The bad news for the regular investor: the cost of data, and the complexity associated with turning it into investment insights, means it will probably only be available to the biggest and most sophisticated funds.  At JPMorgan's macro quantitative and derivatives conference on May 19, the bank surveyed 237 investors, and asked them about Big Data and Machine Learning. It found that 70% thought that the importance of these tools will gradually grow for all investors. A further 23% said they expected a revolution, with rapid changes to the investment landscape.  Screen Shot 2017 05 26 at 11.23.36 AMMore (JPMorgan) "There was widespread agreement that Big Data and Machine Learning is transforming the investment landscape across different trading frequencies, with more than 80% of participants expecting a reduction in relevance of traditional data sources," JPMorgan said in a note.  To be specific, 52% of investors felt big data was already rendering traditional data sources (like financial statements and economic releases) ineffective. In other words, the quarterly reports that many regular investors rely on are already becoming less relevant.  Screen Shot 2017 05 26 at 12.43.42 PMMore (JPMorgan) The rise of so-called alternative data has created a cottage industry of firms that source, process and consult on various data sources. The market for this data is expected to double in the next five years in the US, from $200 million today to $400 million, according to a recent TABB Group report. More than half (51%) of investors surveyed said they expected to buy semi-processed data, while 29% said they wanted to fully process in-house by consuming raw data.  Respondents to the survey were particularly interested in credit card and transactional data. Investors are able to use anonymous data gleaned from credit card statements, and the rise of online shopping, and the digital receipts we get in our email, is also a boon. That's because emailed receipts are usually itemized, giving investors greater detail into what people are buying. Screen Shot 2017 05 26 at 12.43.54 PMMore (JPMorgan) The biggest impediment? Cost. While a lack of expertise and management buy-in were cited by respondents as challenges, the most frequently cited impediment was high-fixed costs. That finding is striking, given JPMorgan's event attracted big money investors like BlackRock and AQR, with sizeable budgets to spend on the data, expertise and processing power. If they find it expensive, the regular investor has no chance.  NOW WATCH: Crocs has a new comeback plan — here's why it could actually work More From Business Insider Wall Street's workforce is slowly and relentlessly shrinking A definitive breakdown of the gloomy state on Wall Street A consumer-protection rule that had been delayed by Trump is set to go through Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

Sun-Sentinel A stranded traveler checks flight information May 9 at the Fort Lauderdale International Airport, where Spirit had canceled flights due to a labor dispute. Repeated cancellations by Spirit led to a melee among travelers this month. JOE CAVARETTA (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) Sun-Sentinel Business May 29, 2017 9:55 PM The route to air-travel discomfort starts on Wall Street By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ New York Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story When an unlucky passenger was violently dragged off a full United Airlines flight in Chicago in April, setting off a public-relations nightmare for the company, the blame naturally fell on the cabin crew, police and eventually airline executives. But ultimately, the episode was set in motion elsewhere – on Wall Street. Relentless pressure on corporate America is creating an increasingly Dickensian experience for many consumers as companies focus on maximizing profit. And nowhere is the trend as stark as in the airline industry, whose service is delivered in an aluminum tube packed with up to four different classes, cheek by jowl, 35,000 feet in the air. “There’s always been pressure from Wall Street,” said Robert L. Dilenschneider, a veteran public relations executive who advises companies and chief executives on strategic communications. “But I’ve been watching this for 30 years, and it’s never been as intense as it is today.” Rich bonus packages for top executives are now largely tied to short-term income targets and fatter profit margins instead of customer service. Of course, bolstering profits – and in turn, stock prices – has always been a big part of management’s responsibility to shareholders, but making it virtually the only criterion for executive pay is new. Five years ago, American Airlines factored in on-time arrivals, lost baggage and consumer complaints to help calculate annual incentive payments for top management. Today, these bonuses are based exclusively on the company’s pretax income and cost savings. United has also scaled back bonuses linked to reliability and customer satisfaction for senior executives in recent years. But in the wake of what happened in April, bonuses “will be made more comprehensively subject to progress in 2017 on significant improvement in the customer experience,” the company said in a financial filing. “Fifteen years ago, airlines competed with each other over who could buy the most planes or have the most routes,” said Jamie Baker, a top airline industry analyst at JPMorgan Chase. “Executives are just as competitive today, but it’s about who can achieve an investment-grade rating first, who can be a component in the S&P 500, and who has better returns for investors.” These new incentives also partly explain why airlines are packing seats more densely and squeezing more passengers into the back of the plane. “Densification is driven by the desire to sweat the assets and generate revenues without having to commit capital to building new planes,” Baker said. Such a shift isn’t unique to the airline industry. “As in other industries, like manufacturing or consumer goods, the focus is on more traditional financial metrics like pretax income, margins, return on capital and total shareholder return,” said Andrew Goldstein, head of the executive compensation practice in North America for Willis Towers Watson. “Airlines haven’t abandoned operational and customer-service metrics, but they are putting less emphasis on those factors.” With the economy growing at a rate of only 2 percent while the stock market rallies on promises of soaring earnings, something must give so profit margins can grow. In the case of United or Spirit Airlines, whose repeated cancellations led to a melee among travelers this month at a terminal in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, it was customer service. At other companies, like Ford and Alcoa, it was the head of the chief executive that was served up when profits failed to meet expectations. Mature industries – where double-digit annual profit growth is a reach in the best of times – are especially vulnerable to activist investors’ demands for board seats, bigger stock repurchases and other short-term financial rewards. The pressure is especially brutal in the airline industry because the key expense, fuel, is for the most part beyond management control. Yet airline executives have largely convinced Wall Street that the bad old days of bankruptcies and fare wars are over, replaced by the kind of predictable annual profits more common among industrial companies. That’s among the reasons fees have popped up in recent years for everything from checking bags to securing an assigned seat before boarding. Known on Wall Street as ancillary revenue, this stream of income is especially favored by investors because it doesn’t swing sharply the way fares do. And so far, despite occasional bouts of air rage and frequent consumer complaints, Wall Street has been getting what it wants. United’s stock has surged to more than $80 per share from $25 per share five years ago, with profit margins rising to 13.6 percent from 3.7 percent over the same period. Overall industry margins hit 16.3 percent, up from 5.2 percent in 2012. Spirit’s operating margins are among the highest in the industry, topping 20 percent in 2015 and 2016. But Paul Berry, a company spokesman, said Spirit had pivoted to focus more on customer service in the last year, even as some larger rivals keep cutting costs to compete. Despite rewarding top executives strictly according to financial targets, American said it, too, was committed to improving the passenger experience. “Every single person at American knows we succeed or fail based on how well we serve customers,” said Joshua Freed, a company spokesman. “We will only meet those financial goals if we keep our customers happy.” Still, the promise of steady profit growth has prompted even Warren E. Buffett to take a fresh look at airline stocks. He once famously called the industry a money-losing “death trap,” but reversed course late last year, with his company, Berkshire Hathaway, acquiring stakes in several airlines. “In the past, airline stocks were seen as hazardous to one’s wealth,” said Baker, the JPMorgan analyst. “They were trading vehicles, and potential destroyers of capital.” To be sure, some industry veterans insist it is a mistake to simply blame investors or hedge-fund managers for fostering a race to the bottom in customer service. “The response isn’t to Wall Street. It’s to customer behavior,” said Alex Dichter, a senior partner at McKinsey who works with major airlines. “About 35 percent of customers are choosing on price, and price alone, and another 35 percent choose mostly on price.” Dichter noted that when American added 2-4 inches of legroom in coach in the early 2000s, “as far as I know, the airline didn’t see one bit of improvement in market share or pricing.” “The great irony is that most CEOs would love to compete on product and experience,” he added. “It’s much more fun. The problem is that customers aren’t paying attention to that.” LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you   Comments   Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email a day ago "The end of an era": Customers, employees bid farewell to Bow Wow on closing day 1:12 a day ago "The end of an era": Customers, employees bid farewell to Bow Wow on closing day 2:27 3 days ago Now founder Nathan Barry hustled to land initial clients for Boise startup ConvertKit 0:35 13 days ago Growing Fresca Mexican Foods to expand with Caldwell plant View More Video Business The Latest: Canada woman among those killed on London Bridge Correction: Plant Explosion-Wisconsin story South Korea draws up $10 billion extra budget to create jobs US energy chief reassures Japan of commitment to environment Lawmakers leave behind school vouchers, face budget dispute Business Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services E-Edition (Digital Replica) Home Delivery Vacation Hold Newsletters Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Photo Store Archive Search Social, Mobile & More Mobile & Apps Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Instagram Advertising Information Place a Classified Local Deals Shopping Place an Obituary Today's Circulars More Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service

Senior management of SABB and Alawwal held talks with advisers on Sunday to discuss the principle of the merger and time frame for its completion, one of the sources said. SABB has selected another, undisclosed adviser for the transaction, the sources added. Nobody was available to comment at Alawwal, while SABB and JPMorgan declined to comment. SABB and Alawwal said on April 25 they had agreed to start talks on a merger that could create the kingdom’s third biggest bank with assets of nearly $80 billion. British banks are the biggest shareholders in both lenders. RBS acquired a 40 per cent stake in Alawwal when it bought ABN AMRO in 2007. RBS has been trying sell the stake for a number of years as it retreats from international operations. HSBC Holdings owns 40 per cent of SABB, which is the kingdom’s sixth largest bank by assets. Although the time frame for the merger has yet to be agreed, one of the sources said the accounts of the two banks could be consolidated by the end of 2017, but the merger would take longer.

REUTERS/Neil Hall By Tom Arnold and Saeed Azhar DUBAI, May 29 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian lender Alawwal Bank, 40 percent owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, has picked JPMorgan to advise it on a proposed merger with Saudi British Bank (SABB), sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. Senior management of SABB and Alawwal held talks with advisers on Sunday to discuss the principle of the merger and timeframe for its completion, one of the sources said. SABB has selected another, undisclosed adviser for the transaction, the sources added. Nobody was available to comment at Alawwal, while SABB and JPMorgan declined to comment. SABB and Alawwal said on April 25 they had agreed to start talks on a merger that could create the kingdom's third biggest bank with assets of nearly $80 billion. Advertisement British banks are the biggest shareholders in both lenders. RBS acquired a 40 percent stake in Alawwal when it bought ABN AMRO in 2007. RBS has been trying sell the stake for a number of years as it retreats from international operations. HSBC Holdings owns 40 percent of SABB, which is the kingdom's sixth largest bank by assets. Although the timeframe for the merger has yet to be agreed, one of the sources said the accounts of the two banks could be consolidated by the end of 2017, but the merger would take longer. Mergers and acquisitions are relatively rare in Saudi Arabia's banking sector, where 12 local commercial lenders operate. Reuters reported in March, quoting sources, that French bank Credit Agricole had picked JPMorgan to advise it on a potential sale of its 31 percent stake in Banque Saudi Fransi , valued at nearly $2.4 billion.

China manufacturing and services PMI allay fears of slowing economic momentum CS upgrades Myer and Super Retail, but consumer spending slump expected to continue British pound drops as polls indicate Labour is trimming gains of Conservatives Live updates Sort posts by Newest Oldest 4:38pm on 31 May 2017 That's all for today - thanks everyone for reading this blog and posting your comments. We'll be back tomorrow from 9am. Have a good evening. 4:26pm on 31 May 2017 Shares have closed slightly higher, thanks to some buying in oversold sectors such as banks and retail, but overall it was a dismal month for equity investors. The ASX ended the session up 0.1 per cent at 5724.6 but was down 3.4 per cent in May, its worst monthly performance since the market meltdown of January 2016 and biggest May drop since 2013. NAB's 1.3 per cent gain was the standout among the big four today, which otherwise just edged higher. Aristocrat Leisure was another big winner of the day, rising 3.8 per cent. CSL was the biggest drag on the benchmark index, falling 1.8 per cent, followed by a 2.9 per cent drop in Origin Energy. A dip in iron ore prices this week and headlines regarding the stockpiles of ore waiting in Chinese ports weighed on the big miners. Resource giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto slumped 0.4 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively. With the iron ore price trading flat at $US58.50 a tonne, Fortescue Metals bucked the trend and closed up 1.3 per cent.  Retail stocks Myer and Super Retail Group received some buying support, after Credit Suisse announced the un-loved sector might be oversold in those instances. The bank upgraded both stocks to "neutral" and the stocks jumped 2.4 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively.  Weighing heaviest on the market over the month was a steep 9.2 per cent fall in the financials sector, due to heavy selling in the big banks. 3:59pm on 31 May 2017 Bitcoin's rollercoaster ride over the past week has cryptocurrency sceptics feeling vindicated. Bitcoin is down 1.5 per cent at $2216 in Asian trade, nearly 20 per cent below its record high of $US2798.97 hit last week. The digital currency's more than 100 per cent surge in the past two months looks eerily familiar, argue the bears, pointing to November 2013, when the price quintupled in short order to top $US1000 for the first time. By Valentine's Day it was worth around half that, and spent the better part of the next two years languishing below $US500. Then it absolutely exploded, jumping more than $US1400 in two months. At its height last week, one bitcoin could buy about two ounces of gold. Its champions touted the arrival into the mainstream of blockchain, the coin's underlying technology which they say can lift the poor out of poverty and make transactions more secure, inexpensive and efficient. But signs of a top have emerged, detractors warn. On May 25, bitcoin surged more than $US300 to a record only to turn tail and close little changed. The $US600 round trip was the biggest daily swing in its history. It then slumped 8 per cent the next day. 3:35pm on 31 May 2017 Hong Kong's private home prices hit a record high for the sixth month in a row in April, reflecting a market fervour that the authorities are eager to tame. The Asian financial hub is one of the least affordable places on earth, where a nano-apartment of less than 20 square metres can cost as much as $US500,000. The dearth of supply, low interest rates, and the flow of capital from mainland China pushed prices up over 137 per cent since the financial crisis in 2008. In April, home prices rose 2.12 per cent from the previous month, according to an index compiled by the Rating and Valuation Department. The figure, at 327.4, surged nearly 20 per cent year-on-year. The latest index does not reflect the latest mortgage tightening measures announced by the city's de facto central bank earlier in May. "If property prices keep breaking records in the next month or two, I expect the government to introduce new cooling measures," said property consultancy Knight Frank's Senior Director Thomas Lam. He expects prices to rise 5 to 10 per cent this year. Some of the least affordable property in the world.  3:15pm on 31 May 2017 Domino's audit of its Australian stores in response to allegations of widespread staff underpayments has slipped six months behind schedule. The pizza maker said today that the audit of more than 700 franchised and corporate stores is taking longer than anticipated and that it won't be able to meet its June deadline. The company now expects the audit to be finished within six months. The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) is also investigating a number of Domino's stores after media reports this year of widespread underpaying of staff and a visa scam at one franchisee-owned store. Shares in Domino's are down 1.4 per cent at $57.57, taking this week's losses to more than 6 per cent. Domino's shares have dropped more than 6 per cent this week. Photo: Kate Leith Back to top 2:49pm on 31 May 2017 Investors hoping for a quick rebound in June after May's ASX declines may be disappointed, with history suggesting they shouldn't count on a June recovery. The old adage to 'sell in May and go away' proved prescient in 2017, with the S&P/ASX200 down 3.4 per cent as concern over Australia's housing boom and weak retail spending combined with falling commodity prices to lead to a nasty coordinated sell-off in the big banks, miners and big-name retailers. And for now, perhaps investors looking for quick gains would do well to heed the last part of the saying. In the nine times the ASX has fallen in May since 2000 it has gone even further into the red in June for five of those years, and recovered some ground in only four years. And the trend has grown more negative of late - in the last seven years, five have seen the market trade in the red in June, with an average drop of 4.2 per cent. Tax-selling can keep stocks suppressed in June, said Argonaut executive director of corporate stockbroking James McGlew. This is particularly the case with illiquid small-caps. But this can also be a fantastic buying opportunity for investors willing to bear some short-term turbulence, he said. "This is the time of year when the herd mentality does start to show," McGlew said. You've got to be aware of that, and of which sectors benefit from that." Here's more Where to in June? Some traders are tipping a rebound. Photo: Louie Douvis 2:17pm on 31 May 2017 Seek shares have dropped 1.6 per cent after Citi downgraded the stock from neutral to sell and cut its price target from $16.20 to $15.30 because of the impact the end of the housing boom would have on job listing volumes. It also cited weakness in Seek's Asian divisions and overexposure locally as reasons for the ratings cut.  The shares have declined 3.6 per cent over the last three days, falling to $16.89.  Citi says there has been rapid growth in ads for construction, trade, manufacturing and related jobs since 2014 even as the unemployment rate remained flat, but that those jobs are set to fall away following the peak of the housing market. Moves by regulators to tighten lending standards appear to have successfully cooled the runaway housing market, with property prices falling 1.1 per cent in May and apartment building approvals down 26 per cent over the past 12 months.  Citi predicts housing construction starts will fall by a quarter over the next two years and that job ad growth will fall to 1.5 per cent a year in 2018 and 2019, after growing at 10 per cent between 2014 and 2017.  While job ad numbers are usually connected to the unemployment rate, Citi told clients in a research note that half the outperformance of Seek was because of the housing construction boom and employee turnover in that industry.  "Even just a modest pullback in churn rates could lead to a large decline in the number of job ads, even if the change in the total number of people employed in the industry is negligible," analysts wrote.  1:53pm on 31 May 2017 Shares in iron ore miners have turned south as Chinese futures in the bulk commodity resume their selloff following a two-day holiday. Fortescue is now down 0.6 per cent after earlier trading more than 1 per cent higher, while Rio Tinto has dropped 1.3 per cent. Dalian iron ore futures have slid 3.3 per cent to 436.5 yuan ($US64), on track for a fifth session in the red. Spot iron ore is at $US58.50 a tonne, close to its lowest since October. Analysts have been noting that while iron ore prices are falling, steel is trading close to five-year highs. This comes as Platts reports that Chinese gross steel margins for exported steel rebar has touched a 2017 high – nearly 80 per cent higher than lows touched on April 13. "The rise in steel mill profitability, which mostly reflects weaker iron ore and coking coal prices, should give way to stronger steel output and iron ore demand in coming weeks," says CBA analyst Vivek Dhar. 1:31pm on 31 May 2017 The slump in consumer spending is expected to continue throughout the year as a major headwind for retailers across the country. In a note - 'What is going on in Australia's retail sector? - CBA blames weak wages growth as the single biggest factor weighing on the sector as households devote a greater portion of their wallet to health, utilities and education. "Consumers have a fine amount of disposable income and even with the assistance of a falling savings rate, record low wages growth has weighed significantly on the discretionary parts of retail trade," senior economist Gareth Aird said. "Soft total retail trade growth is largely down to a lack of spending growth on consumer durables and clothing." Demand for clothing and other discretionary goods has been weak for the past two years, as seen in falling department store sales and the collapse of a string of apparel retailers. Herringbone, Marcs and David Lawrence, Pumpkin Patch, Rhodes and Beckett are among a recent spate of largely high-end clothing retailers to have fallen into voluntary administration. Department store chain Myer has been warning "challenging trading conditions" continue to hurt its sales. The market value of retailers on the ASX have also come under pressure as investors sell down retail stocks following sales warnings and profit downgrades. Online giant Amazon's impending arrival in Australia will also put more pressure on retailers to sacrifice more profits for lower prices. Myer shares are at 86 cents, very close to all-time lows hit earlier this week, while JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman have suffered sell-downs largely linked to the Amazon threat. CBA also warned that the effectiveness of lower interest rates is close to being exhausted and only a lift in wages' growth will lead to an increase in retail spending. "Given the significant amount of slack in the labour market we don't see that happening in 2017 and we therefore conclude that the retail trade sector, in particular the discretionary parts of retail trade, will continue to be under pressure throughout the year," Aird said.  1:04pm on 31 May 2017 When auction clearance rates fall to around 65 per cent in Sydney, a housing downturn will be official, property analyst SQM Research managing director Louis Christopher says. Christopher, who correctly called the start of the current housing boom in 2012, said that when Sydney auction clearance rates - one of the key measures of housing market performance - hit the mid-60 per cent level and clearances in Melbourne fall to the high 60 per cent level, then "a new downturn can be called." The preliminary auction clearance rate for Sydney last week was 76.2 per cent while Melbourne was on 77.3 per cent, according to Corelogic. Both were higher than the same period a year ago. "We do believe we are getting close to a top and perhaps the major banks passing on the bank levy might just be the point which creates a trigger for a slowdown. We will wait and see," Christopher said. He also said a downturn could be closer after observing a rise in unreported auctions in 2017 against the bumper level of 2015. Keep an eye on auction clearance rates.  Back to top 12:39pm on 31 May 2017 The reactions to Altiar Asset Management's shock decision, taken by chairman and investment officer Philip Parker, to sell its equities fund an return the money to investors continues to be a key topic of discussion among Australia's investment professionals. The warning issued by Parker, which in large part rested on his concerns about the overheated property market, has been largely dismissed by senior property industry executives.

Joe Aston writes in Rear Window on "what has to have been the greatest money pit in Australian corporate history": In good news for investors in Network Ten, the free-to-air broadcaster is having a good week so far, closing at 19¢, off its Friday low of 17¢. Everything's relative, right? Remember this is after the 1-for-10 consolidation of Ten shares in January 2016. So when WIN proprietor Bruce Gordon was buying millions of these last decade for $2.58 a pop, he was effectively paying nearly $26 in a like-for-like comparison to the scrip you could pick up today for less than a silver coin. According to an ASX filing of July 2006, Gordon-related entities owned 48.8 million Ten shares, worth $126.2 million. If he'd done nothing since, he'd now own 4.88 million shares worth a princely $927,200. But instead he kept buying and buying and buying, including newly-issued capital. Gordon now owns 55.5 million post-consolidation Ten shares, worth $10.4 million. Yep, that's $9.5 million for, in effect, half a billion of shares. No wonder he catches the bus to Wollongong.  Chairman of archrival Seven, Kerry Stokes, quietly amassed a stake in late 2012 worth around $40 million. According to Ten's 2016 annual report, Stokes' Network Investments had 11.5 million shares as at October, now worth $2.2 million, which wouldn't buy you a bedsit in Darling Point.  Foxtel's $77 million placement just 18 months ago is now worth $9.75 million – which isn't inconsistent with the direction of Foxtel's own value to News Corp and Telstra. News co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch and then Consolidated Media chair James Packer paid around $130 million each (before the multiple raisings) at $1.50 (or, in effect, $15) in 2010 for a combined 14.9 per cent position now worth just $10.6 million And having sunk near enough to $200 million into Ten since 2011, Gina Rinehart's 8.2 per cent stake is now worth $5.8 million.  Read the full piece on the AFR. The biggest shareholder of Ten Network is Bruce Gordon, with 15 per cent of shares. He also owns regional broadcaster WIN.  Photo: Sylvia Liber 11:41am on 31 May 2017 One of the nation's biggest mutual lenders has cut interest-only loans in half and hiked interest rates by 40 basis points, heralding a tough new phase in attempts to cut back on risky borrowing. It means borrowers will have to take out two loans for a single property – a minimum principal and interest loan and a maximum interest-only. Teachers Mutual Bank, which includes UniBank and Firefighters Mutual Bank, is requiring a minimum of 50 per cent principal and interest for all home loans, which means the maximum interest-only is also 50 per cent. A new borrower seeking $300,000 will have two loans – a minimum of $150,000 on principal and interest and a maximum of $150,000 on interest-only. In addition, borrowers cannot draw down any cash from any loan where part of the total borrowing is interest-only and scrutiny of ability to pay has been toughened. It comes as latest APRA numbers reveal that interest-only loans still account for more than 36 per cent of total home loans by value in the March quarter, down from 37.5 per cent previously. APRA issued an order at the end of March requiring banks to cut interest-only loans to 30 per cent of new residential lending. Since then most lenders have increased minimum deposits to at least 20 per cent, raised interest rates, toughened scrutiny of borrowers' ability to pay and banned overseas' lenders. Here's more at the AFR Banks are cracking down on interest-only loans. Photo: Supplied. 11:11am on 31 May 2017 Growth in China's manufacturing sector in May kept pace with the previous month, an official survey shows, beating expectations in a reassuring sign the world's second-biggest economy is not losing too much steam after a solid first quarter performance. The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 51.2 in May, compared with the previous month's 51.2 and above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Continuing momentum gives policy makers room to rein in increased leverage and financial risks. Analysts last month upgraded forecasts for China's economic growth this year after an unexpected pick-up to 6.9 per cent in the first quarter. The data has put a bit of a spring into the Australian market, with both shares and the Aussie rising to the day's highs (albeit not a huge gain). 10:50am on 31 May 2017 Australia's yield advantage over the US is shrinking fast, which has stirred the Aussie dollar bears, but ANZ head of FX exchange Daniel Been notes that rate differentials are only one driver of the currency. The 10-year yield spread has narrowed to just 18 basis points, and last week even fell to just 16 basis points, the lowest in 16 years. The last time the yield gap was at these levels, the Aussie was fetching less than US50¢, but Been doesn't believe that the currency will fall below even US70¢, pointing out that when the spread was negative in 1998 the Aussie was 10¢ higher than in 2001. "This suggests that the absolute level of yield was not the only important factor for the AUD, even when it was very narrow," Been says, adding that even when you include changes in the terms of trade it doesn't tell the whole story. Instead, forex traders should include risk factors and the US dollar index to explain the performance of currencies such as the Aussie. As examples of risk driving market performance in 2001, Been cites the tech bubble bursting and the Enron scandal The subsequent rally in the US dollar was on its own worth about 5 cents of underperformance in the Aussie, he has calculated. So what does that mean for today? Been says it's much more helpful to look at the Aussie through this broader frame, which makes the situation for the currency look far less dire on a number of fronts. Here are a few reasons why he believes the Aussie isn't headed for 2001 levels: The terms of trade are significantly stronger than it was in 2000. In fact China was not even a part of the WTO last time the spread was at this level; The risk premium is already negative, implying the negative effect of a tighter spread is already integrated into the markets expectations for the AUD; The probability of a significant deterioration in risk appetite remains lower than it did in 2001, at least in the near term As such, Been doesn't believe that the fall in the interest rate spread is about to drive a slump in the AUD, or that the AUD at current levels is fundamentally misaligned with the level of rates given the broader environment. Quite the contrary, Been says the recent improvement in the current account should dampen the negative impact of the narrow rate differential, as the Australian economy's funding need has shrunk significantly.  "We think that the biggest risk to the AUD is ultimately going to be a sharp deterioration in risk appetite, rather than the narrowing in spreads, however we continue to think that, at least over the next 12 months, this remains a tail risk," Been says. "Until this kind of risk event can become integrated into a central scenario rather than a tail, we think that the AUD will remain stable above US70¢." Back to top 10:37am on 31 May 2017 Shares have opened fairly flat, with some buying in the oversold retail sector offset by drops in energy stocks. The ASX is down 0.1 per cent at 5714.2, putting it on track for a loss of 3.5 per cent in May, its worst monthly performance since the market mayhem of January last year. "Sentiment on Australian markets today could be influenced by how China's steel and iron ore markets perform when trading gets under way after a two-day holiday," CMC chief market analyst Ric Spooner says. "Prices were sliding at the end of last week and sentiment will not be helped if strong downward momentum continues today." Spooner added that investors will be hoping that today's release of China's manufacturing PMI can also hold the line after a softer read in April, which showed a decline in employment conditions. Blue chips are all over the shop, with the big banks trading flat to slightly higher, BHP down 0.2 per cent but Rio up 0.1 per cent and Fortescue gaining 1.25 per cent. One of the biggest winners is Aristocrat Leisure, up another 3.1 per cent as the pokies maker moves from strength to strength. Market dogs in the retail sector are catching some relief, with Myer gaining 1.8 per cent and Super Retail up 1.3 per cent after Credit Suisse upgraded both stocks to 'neutral'. 9:53am on 31 May 2017 SPONSORED POST The ASX's worst month since January 2016 will soon be in the rearview mirrow, and IG strategist Chris Weston wonders whether June has anything better in store: For some the idea of turning the page and closing what has been a fairly bleak month to be long the Aussie equity market will be welcomed. That being said, being long certain industrial and telco names has seen strong outperformance in the portfolio. What won't be welcomed is the idea that June is actually the worst month to be long or tracking the Aussie equity market, with the average loss over the past decade at 2.2%. We have seen the past four months of June down by an average of 3.1% and while past performance obvious doesn't predict future returns it is a consideration. Certainly, something to think about and the technical set-up on the ASX 200 is interesting, with the bulls happy to defend the 5775/77 level yesterday which we can see from the daily chart seems a quite pivotal support level representing swing lows in March and May. A break of this level and we should be talking sub-5600, but for now, we are watching to see if the bulls can build on the platform set yesterday. Turning to Asia and it will be interesting to watch China come back on line today after its two-day holiday. Of course, while the spot iron ore market has been open (as price is fixed in Singapore), we get the re-open of the Dalian iron ore and steel futures exchanges today and who knows where that will trade. The market will keep a beady eye on official manufacturing and services PMI data (at 11:00 AEST) for further signs of an economic downturn and we should expect a very modest slowdown in the pace of expansion here, with the manufacturing PMI data expected in at 51. Whether we are talking copper or AUD, the market hasn't been overly sensitive to this print of late, but that could change if the data comes in far lower or higher than forecast. Again, the prospect of the latter materialising seems very low.

"New Zealand's financial system remains sound and the risks facing the system have reduced in the past six months," Reserve Bank governor Graeme Wheeler said in the bank's semi-annual Financial Stability Report on Wednesday in Wellington. Still, he warned that global uncertainty remains elevated and that New Zealand would be vulnerable if a sharp reversal in risk sentiment drove up borrowing costs for banks. New Zealand home-owners have built up record amounts of debt in recent years as house prices soared, which may leave many stretched if borrowing costs were to rise quickly. Wheeler has cut his benchmark interest rate to a record low of 1.75 per cent to spur weak general inflation, requiring him to introduce lending restrictions in an attempt to curb housing demand. He said today that those restrictions have caused house-price growth to slow over the past eight months. However, "house prices remain elevated relative to incomes and rents, and any resurgence would be of concern", Wheeler said. A recovery in dairy prices over the past year had reduced risks faced by the dairy sector, though some parts of carry excessive debt and remain vulnerable, the RBNZ said. New Zealand's banking system "maintains strong capital and funding buffers, and profitability remains robust", the central bank said. Still, banks had increased reliance on offshore funding for credit growth and remain exposed to a shift in global sentiment. "A sharp reversal in risk sentiment could lead to higher funding costs for New Zealand banks and an increase in domestic borrowing costs," the RBNZ said. New Zealand home-owners have built up record amounts of debt in recent years as house prices soared, which may leave many stretched if borrowing costs were to rise quickly.  9:44am on 31 May 2017 Here are the overnight market highlights: SPI futures down 4 points to 5718 AUD +0.4% to 74.66 US cents (Overnight range: 74.16-74.69) On Wall St, Dow -0.2%, S&P 500 -0.1%, Nasdaq -0.1% In New York, BHP +0.4%, Rio +0.8% In Europe, Stoxx 50 -0.5%, FTSE -0.3%, CAC -0.5%, DAX -0.2% Spot gold -0.4% to $US1262.95 an ounce Brent crude -0.9% to $US51.82 a barrel Iron ore unchanged at $US58.50 a tonne Dalian exchange closed LME aluminium -1.3% to $US1926 a tonne LME copper little changed at $US5656 a tonne 10-year bond yield: US 2.21%, Germany 0.29%, Australia 2.39% Plus a few analyst recommendation changes: Henderson Group (HGGDA): New buy at UBS, PT $35.25; New market perform at KBW, PT $32 Myer Holdings (MYR): Raised to neutral at Credit Suisse, PT $0.82 Seek (SEK): Cut to sell at Citi Super Retail (SUL): Raised to neutral at Credit Suisse, PT $7.56 What to watch today: April private sector credit; China May manufacturing PMI, non manufacturing PMI; Japan April industrial production, housing starts; Euro zone April unemployment rate; Fed Beige Book And not to forget, Orica is trading ex-dividend. 9:37am on 31 May 2017 The British pound came under pressure overnight after a new poll found that PM Theresa May's Conservative Party risks falling short of an overall majority in next month's national election. The pound fell to $US1.2791, near a one-month low of $US1.2775 touched on Friday. The pound also slipped to 0.8738 pound per euro, near Friday's eight-week low of 0.8750, while the Aussie strengthened about 0.5 per cent to 58.3 pence. New constituency-by-constituency modelling by YouGov showed the Conservative Party might lose 20 of the 330 seats it holds while the opposition Labour Party could gain nearly 30 seats. Breaking: Latest YouGov Poll points to a hung parliament as @Conservatives could be 16 seats short of a majority. #GE2017 #gbpusd #UK #GBP pic.twitter.com/WLmcEzNn37— WealthFX (@WealthFXnet) May 30, 2017 The news came after a string of opinion polls show a narrowing lead for May's Conservatives, shaking the confidence among investors that May would easily win a majority in a national election on June 8. The US dollar fell to two-week lows against the safe-haven yen as investors turned cautious amid political worries in Europe as well as weaker stock and commodity markets after a long US holiday weekend. Worries that US political stalemate due to investigations into President Donald Trump's ties with Russia could hamper progress on tax cuts and other stimulus measures from Washington has been undermining the dollar. The dollar fell to near two-week low of 110.665 yen and last traded at 110.85 yen, while the Aussie lifted to US74.61¢. The US dollar index dipped to 97.396, around the levels it was trading at before Trump was elected in November. The trend is Labour's friend. Photo: HuffPo Back to top Search pagination Current page Live Article Posts1 Next Live Article Posts2 Share via Email Post on facebook wall Share on Google Plus Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit 1 new post(s) available.

"Investors believe the reform agenda will go forward, no matter the outcome of the political crisis", José Olympio Pereira, chief executive officer of Credit Suisse AG's Brazilian unit, said at an investment conference. "The reform agenda belongs to the country, not to a president", José Berenguer, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's Brazilian unit, said at the same conference. Temer must respond within 24 hours to federal police questions about allegations of his involvement in a sprawling political graft probe, a Supreme Court judge ruled on Tuesday, a source with direct knowledge of the investigation told Reuters. The billionaire owners of the world's biggest meatpacker, JBS SA said in plea-bargain testimony to police that Temer condoned bribing a potential witness in the "Car Wash" corruption case and took bribes himself. Temer strongly denies the allegations. Over the last week, market prices recovered from the rout triggered after word of the plea deal became public on May 17. Since then, the benchmark Bovespa stock index has accumulated a 5.3 percent loss. Credit Suisse's Pereira said another good sign is the growing number of Brazil-based companies filing for initial public offerings of shares. Three companies, healthcare services provider NotreDame Intermédica Saúde SA, reinsurer IRB Brasil Resseguros SA and the Brazilian unit of French retailer Carrefour SA filed with Brazilian securities industry regulator CVM for authorization for IPOs in the last two weeks. State lender Banco do Brasil SA Chief Executive Officer Paulo Caffarelli said the new framework for infrastructure investments should attract capital market investors. Caffarelli said the bank has increased loan disbursements to so far this year by 20 percent to companies and 25 percent to households, compared to the same period a year earlier.

Funded by Macomb Community College's Strategic Fund and part of J.P. Morgan Chase's $150 million commitment to Detroit's economic recovery, the award is designed to advance progress of larger scale funding for startup companies with high growth potential. Munetrix, based in Auburn Hills, will receive $100,000, which it must match. The company is a data science and advisory firm that provides analytics, planning, transparency and compliance tools for state and local governments, according to a news release from the college. Rochester-based Skypersonic was awarded $25,000 in support of its introduction to the market. The company develops drone technology for indoor applications for commercial, industrial, agricultural and civil purposes, the release said. "Investing in small businesses is essential for creating a vibrant local economy in Detroit," Chauncy Lennon, head of workforce initiatives for Chase, said in the release. The two companies were selected from a pool of 17 applicants. Companies in Genesee, Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, Shiawassee, St. Clair, Washtenaw and Wayne counties are eligible to apply.

Oil prices fell to keep U.S. crude below the $50 a barrel mark on concerns output cuts by the world's big exporters may not be sufficient to lessen a global glut and signs of resurgent output in Libya. The energy sector's 1.31 percent fall made it the worst performer among the major S&P 500 sectors. Exxon was down 0.6 percent. Financial stocks, down 0.8 percent, also supplied some downward pressure. JPMorgan fell 1.7 percent and Bank of America lost 1.4 percent as the two biggest drags on the S&P 500. U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four months in April and monthly inflation rebounded, pointing to firming domestic demand that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. "The markets are susceptible to geopolitical and to purely political risk, but in terms of the economy and in terms of earnings, we are where investors are comfortable," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. "There isn’t a huge rush to put more money into equities, there isn’t a huge rush to put more money into Treasuries - the market is treading water." Dallas Fed head Robert Kaplan told CNBC that while he was concerned about the recent economic data, he expected two more rate hikes in 2017. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said a hike is probably coming soon, though the central bank may want to delay if inflation remains soft. Traders currently see an 86.6-percent chance of a quarter-point rate hike by the Fed at its June meeting, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 50.81 points, or 0.24 percent, to 21,029.47, the S&P 500 lost 2.91 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,412.91 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.01 points, or 0.11 percent, to 6,203.19. The technology sector rose 0.31 percent, boosted by gains in Apple and Microsoft, both up 0.6 percent. Amazon was up 0.1 percent at $996.70, after briefly crossing the $1,000 mark. Alphabet's Class A shares were close behind, hitting a record of $997.62 before ending the session up 0.3 percent at $996.17. Telecoms jumped, up 1.4 percent, after MoffettNathanson upgraded the sector to "neutral" from "underweight," citing a lack of negative near-term catalysts. CardConnect's shares jumped 10.3 percent to $15.05 after First Data agreed to buy the payment processor for $750 million. First Data closed up 1.1 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.58-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.87-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows. About 5.68 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.69 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Energy companies also sank. Investors snapped up government bonds and high-yield stocks including phone companies and utilities. As bond prices rose, yields and interest rates fell. That reduced the profits financial institutions can make from mortgages and other types of loans. Energy companies fell to their lowest prices in a year. Technology companies continued to soar while airlines slumped as investors worried that the government could expand a ban on laptops in passenger cabins during international flights, which could affect business travel. Still, stocks remain close to their record highs. JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade, said he thinks stocks will stay at high levels until more details about the Trump administration’s tax proposals become public. “Barring unforeseen events, it’s really going to come down to progress and details about the tax plan,” he said. “We’ve had this run up primarily on the fact that earnings have been good.” However Kinahan said he thinks it’s likely Wall Street will be disappointed with any tax cut package that does pass, since the administration’s proposals will likely be scaled back in Congress. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,029.47.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.21 percent from 2.25 percent late Friday. With interest rates falling, JPMorgan Chase declined $1.46, or 1.7 percent, to $83.90. Smaller banks fell harder, as Hope Bancorp dropped 67 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $17.48 and First Financial Bancorp sank 75 cents, or 2.9 percent to $25.05. Oil prices recovered from an early stumble and finished only slightly lower, but energy companies continued to fall. Hess dropped $1.47, or 3.1 percent, to $46.67 and Schlumberger shed 85 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $68.74. The S&P 500 index of energy companies reached its lowest level in a year. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 45 cents to $51.84 a barrel in London. Technology companies continued to lead the way.

Chipmaker Nvidia gained $3.03, or 2.1 percent, to $144.87 and Micron Technology rose 95 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $30.71. International airlines slumped as the government considered expanding a ban on laptops from the passenger cabins of flights to the United States. In March the Trump administration said passengers flying from 10 cities, mostly in the Middle East, had to check all devices larger than a smartphone. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said that ban might be expanded to all international flights to and from the U.S. Delta Air Lines lost $1.74, or 3.4 percent, to $49.06 and United Continental slid $2, or 2.5 percent, to $79.25. American Airlines retreated 78 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $47.96. Online retail giant Amazon.com traded above $1,000 a share for the first time, but didn’t stay there.

Asian stocks mixed amid US political uncertainty, China data Associated Press | TOKYO (AP) — Asian stocks were mixed Wednesday as worries lingered over political uncertainty in Washington and shares drooped overnight in the U.S. while China was boosted by manufacturing data. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.1 percent in morning trading to 19,657.76 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3 percent to 5,736.30. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent to 2,351.21. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.2 percent to 25,759.49, while the Shanghai Composite was up nearly 0.5 percent at 3,124.12. WALL STREET: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,029.47. The Nasdaq composite dipped 7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,203.19. TRUMP FACTOR: An ongoing probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election has set off uncertainty about the administration of President Donald Trump. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has decided to provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee, while Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has rejected a House intelligence committee request for information. Former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the investigation. CHINA DATA: An official monthly survey showed that growth in China's factory activity was steady last month in a sign that the recovery in the world's No. 2 economy is holding up. The purchasing' managers index, or PMI, released Wednesday came in at 51.2 for May. THE QUOTE: "This suggests further stablization of the world's second largest economy and will allow policy makers more room to carry out the de-leverage campaign in an attempt to reduce the country's heightened debts," Margaret Yang Yan, analyst with CMC Markets Singapore, said of the China data. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 30 cents to $49.36 a barrel in New York. It lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 30 cents to $51.94 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose slightly to 110.09 yen from 111.07 yen late Tuesday in Asia. The euro was little changed at $1.1188 from $1.1181. ___ Yuri Kageyama can be reached on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Oil prices fell to keep U.S. crude below the $50 a barrel mark on concerns output cuts by the world's big exporters may not be sufficient to lessen a global glut and signs of resurgent output in Libya. The energy sector's 1.31 percent fall made it the worst performer among the major S&P 500 sectors. Exxon was down 0.6 percent. Financial stocks, down 0.8 percent, also supplied some downward pressure. JPMorgan fell 1.7 percent and Bank of America lost 1.4 percent as the two biggest drags on the S&P 500. U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four months in April and monthly inflation rebounded, pointing to firming domestic demand that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. "The markets are susceptible to geopolitical and to purely political risk, but in terms of the economy and in terms of earnings, we are where investors are comfortable," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. "There isn't a huge rush to put more money into equities, there isn't a huge rush to put more money into Treasuries - the market is treading water." Dallas Fed head Robert Kaplan told CNBC that while he was concerned about the recent economic data, he expected two more rate hikes in 2017. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said a hike is probably coming soon, though the central bank may want to delay if inflation remains soft. Traders currently see an 86.6-percent chance of a quarter-point rate hike by the Fed at its June meeting, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 50.81 points, or 0.24 percent, to 21,029.47, the S&P 500 lost 2.91 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,412.91 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.01 points, or 0.11 percent, to 6,203.19. The technology sector rose 0.31 percent, boosted by gains in Apple and Microsoft, both up 0.6 percent. Amazon was up 0.1 percent at $996.70, after briefly crossing the $1,000 mark. Alphabet's Class A shares were close behind, hitting a record of $997.62 before ending the session up 0.3 percent at $996.17. Telecoms jumped, up 1.4 percent, after MoffettNathanson upgraded the sector to "neutral" from "underweight," citing a lack of negative near-term catalysts. CardConnect's shares jumped 10.3 percent to $15.05 after First Data agreed to buy the payment processor for $750 million. First Data closed up 1.1 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.58-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.87-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.

U.S. stocks are lower early Tuesday, May 30, 2017, as energy companies once again slump with the price of oil and banks slide in tandem with bond yields and interest rates. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) TOKYO (AP) — Asian stocks were mixed Wednesday as worries lingered over political uncertainty in Washington and shares drooped overnight in the U.S. while China was boosted by manufacturing data. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.1 percent in morning trading to 19,657.76 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3 percent to 5,736.30. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent to 2,351.21. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.2 percent to 25,759.49, while the Shanghai Composite was up nearly 0.5 percent at 3,124.12. WALL STREET: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,029.47. The Nasdaq composite dipped 7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,203.19. TRUMP FACTOR: An ongoing probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election has set off uncertainty about the administration of President Donald Trump. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has decided to provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee, while Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has rejected a House intelligence committee request for information. Former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the investigation. CHINA DATA: An official monthly survey showed that growth in China's factory activity was steady last month in a sign that the recovery in the world's No. 2 economy is holding up. The purchasing' managers index, or PMI, released Wednesday came in at 51.2 for May. THE QUOTE: "This suggests further stablization of the world's second largest economy and will allow policy makers more room to carry out the de-leverage campaign in an attempt to reduce the country's heightened debts," Margaret Yang Yan, analyst with CMC Markets Singapore, said of the China data. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 30 cents to $49.36 a barrel in New York. It lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 30 cents to $51.94 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose slightly to 110.09 yen from 111.07 yen late Tuesday in Asia. The euro was little changed at $1.1188 from $1.1181. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Life Buy/Sell Business Banks pull stocks away from records as 7-day streak ends By Marley Jay • AP Markets Writer May 30, 2017 (…) Updated at 3:40 p.m. NEW YORK • A seven-day winning streak for stocks came to a quiet end Tuesday as banks, especially smaller ones, dropped along with bond yields and interest rates. Energy companies also sank. Investors snapped up government bonds and high-yield stocks including phone companies and utilities. As bond prices rose, yields and interest rates fell. That reduced the profits financial institutions can make from mortgages and other types of loans. Energy companies fell to their lowest prices in a year. Technology companies continued to soar while airlines slumped as investors worried that the government could expand a ban on laptops in passenger cabins during international flights, which could affect business travel. Still, stocks remain close to their record highs. JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade, said he thinks stocks will stay at high levels until more details about the Trump administration's tax proposals become public. "Barring unforeseen events, it's really going to come down to progress and details about the tax plan," he said. "We've had this run up primarily on the fact that earnings have been good." However Kinahan said he thinks it's likely Wall Street will be disappointed with any tax cut package that does pass, since the administration's proposals will likely be scaled back in Congress. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,029.47. The Nasdaq composite dipped 7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,203.19. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks tumbled 11.05 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,371.19. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.21 percent from 2.25 percent late Friday. With interest rates falling, JPMorgan Chase declined $1.46, or 1.7 percent, to $83.90. Smaller banks fell harder, as Hope Bancorp dropped 67 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $17.48 and First Financial Bancorp sank 75 cents, or 2.9 percent to $25.05. Oil prices recovered from an early stumble and finished only slightly lower, but energy companies continued to fall. Hess dropped $1.47, or 3.1 percent, to $46.67 and Schlumberger shed 85 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $68.74. The S&P 500 index of energy companies reached its lowest level in a year. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 45 cents to $51.84 a barrel in London. Technology companies continued to lead the way. Security software maker Symantec advanced 45 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $30.71. Chipmaker Nvidia gained $3.03, or 2.1 percent, to $144.87 and Micron Technology rose 95 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $30.71. International airlines slumped as the government considered expanding a ban on laptops from the passenger cabins of flights to the United States. In March the Trump administration said passengers flying from 10 cities, mostly in the Middle East, had to check all devices larger than a smartphone. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said that ban might be expanded to all international flights to and from the U.S. Delta Air Lines lost $1.74, or 3.4 percent, to $49.06 and United Continental slid $2, or 2.5 percent, to $79.25. American Airlines retreated 78 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $47.96. Online retail giant Amazon.com traded above $1,000 a share for the first time, but didn't stay there. The stock peaked at $1,001.20 shortly after the market opened and wound up with a gain of 92 cents to close at $996.70. The only other S&P 500 company valued at more than $1,000 a share is travel booking site Priceline, which slipped to $1,857.45 Tuesday. Investors value Amazon at about $476 billion and Priceline at $91 billion. E-commerce and payment services company First Data said it will buy payment processing company CardConnect for $15 a share in cash, or about $468 million. CardConnect's stock climbed $1.40, or 10.3 percent, to $15.05 and First Data picked up 18 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $16.82.

"There was nothing so significant in the macro data today that was going to cause anyone to really go anywhere, so we are just churning," said Ken Polcari, Director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York."And it’s all well and good until you get some sort of catalyst, negative or positive, that causes everyone to run for the door at the same time, trying to get in or get out."

Minnesota district court judge David S. Doty granted Wells Fargo's motion to dismiss, which some observers call a rarity among the proliferating 401(k) lawsuits against financial services companies, and barred plaintiffs from re-filing an amended complaint in the case.

Oil prices fell over 1 percent on concerns that output cuts by the world's big exporters may not be enough to drain a global glut that has depressed the market for almost three years. The energy sector's 0.94 percent fall led the decliners among the major S&P 500 sectors. Exxon was down 0.4 percent, while Chevron fell 0.2 percent. Adding to the pressure, financial stocks were down 0.5 percent. JPMorgan fell 1.1 percent, weighing the most on the S&P, while Goldman Sachs' 1.6 percent decline dragged on the Dow. Data showed core PCE price index fell to 1.5 percent in the 12 months through April from 1.6 percent in March, reinforcing views that the Federal Reserve might not raise rates again after June. "We're in a period of time where the first-quarter data was slightly weak and people are wondering if the data was an anomaly or is there something more there," said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. Dallas Fed head Robert Kaplan told CNBC that while he was concerned about the recent economic data, he expected two more rate hikes in 2017. U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four months in April, but the consumer confidence index fell to 117.9 in May from 119.4 in April. At 12:37 p.m. ET (1637 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 27.47 points, or 0.13 percent, at 21,052.81, the S&P 500 was down 1.21 points, or 0.050087 percent, at 2,414.61. The Nasdaq Composite was down 2.61 points, or 0.04 percent, at 6,207.59. The technology sector rose 0.3 percent. Apple's 0.5 percent rise was the biggest boost on the S&P and Nasdaq. Amazon was up 0.3 percent at $998.26, after briefly crossing the $1,000 mark. Alphabet's Class A shares were close behind, after hitting a record of $997.62. CardConnect's shares jumped 10.3 percent to $15.05 after First Data agreed to buy the payment processor for $750 million. First Data was up 0.8 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,770 to 1,069. On the Nasdaq, 1,824 issues fell and 926 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.

Oil prices declined, keeping U.S. crude below the $50 a barrel mark, on concerns output cuts by the world's big exporters may not be sufficient to lessen a global glut that has depressed the market for almost three years. The energy sector's 0.81-percent fall made it the worst performer among the major S&P 500 sectors. Exxon was down 0.4 percent. Financial stocks, down 0.8 percent, also supplied some downward pressure. JPMorgan fell 1.5 percent and Bank of America lost 1.1 percent as the two biggest drags on the S&P 500. U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four months in April and monthly inflation rebounded, pointing to firming domestic demand that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. "There was nothing so significant in the macro data today that was going to cause anyone to really go anywhere, so we are just churning," said Ken Polcari, Director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York. "And it's all well and good until you get some sort of catalyst, negative or positive, that causes everyone to run for the door at the same time, trying to get in or get out." Dallas Fed head Robert Kaplan told CNBC that while he was concerned about the recent economic data, he expected two more rate hikes in 2017. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said a hike is probably coming soon, though the central bank may want to delay if inflation remains soft. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 48.18 points, or 0.23 percent, to 21,032.1, the S&P 500 lost 2.3 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,413.52 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.68 points, or 0.12 percent, to 6,202.51. The technology sector rose 0.27 percent, boosted by gains in Apple and Microsoft, both up 0.3 percent. Amazon was up 0.3 percent at $998.34, after briefly crossing the $1,000 mark. Alphabet's Class A shares were close behind after hitting a record of $997.62. CardConnect's shares jumped 10.4 percent to $15.08 after First Data agreed to buy the payment processor for $750 million. First Data was up 1.1 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.48-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.88-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, is likely to remain on solid ground in the wake of other reports on Tuesday that showed confidence among households still at lofty levels despite some slippage this month and strong gains in house prices in March. "Fed officials can continue with their gradual pace of rate hikes in June as the economy remains on course for stronger growth this quarter and throughout the rest of the year," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending increased 0.4 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in March as households spent more on both goods and services. April's increase was the biggest since December and eased concerns about second-quarter economic growth after weak reports on core capital goods orders, the goods trade deficit and inventory investment in April. Consumer spending was previously reported to have been unchanged in March. Consumer spending grew at its slowest pace in more than seven years in the first quarter, helping to restrict the increase in gross domestic product to an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the first three months of the year. Following April's report and upward revisions to March's data, economists said consumer spending was running at around a 3 percent rate, a sharp acceleration from the first quarter's 0.6 percent pace. GDP growth estimates for the second quarter range between a rate of 2 percent and 3.8 percent. "This takes out the downside risk to our projection for 3 percent real GDP growth this quarter, and we now see more balanced risks around that call," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. U.S. stocks were trading slightly lower amid a drop in oil prices. The dollar .DXY dipped against a basket of currencies while U.S. government bond prices rose. TIGHTENING JOB MARKET Minutes of the Fed's May 2-3 policy meeting, which were published last week, showed that while policymakers agreed they should hold off hiking rates until there was evidence the growth slowdown was transitory, "most participants" believed "it would soon be appropriate" to raise borrowing costs. The U.S. central bank hiked rates by 25 basis points in March. Consumer spending is being boosted by a tightening labor market, which is gradually pushing up wages. Rising house prices are also supporting consumption. In a separate report on Tuesday, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 117.9 in May from 119.4 in April. The index, which hit a 16-year high of 124.9 in March, remains underpinned by labor market strength. The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, recorded its second strongest reading since 2001. "Fed Chair (Janet) Yellen has in the past used the labor market differential as a check on the unemployment rate, and the reading for May should provide confirmation to Yellen and her colleagues that the economy has reached the Fed's assessment of full employment," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.Expectations of further policy tightening next month are also supported by steadily rising inflation. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy rebounded 0.2 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in March. But the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.5 percent in the 12 months through April, the smallest gain since December 2015. The core PCE, which is the Fed's preferred inflation measure, rose 1.6 percent year-on-year in March. That was below the central bank's 2 percent target. "We anticipate 1.5 percent will mark the low on core PCE inflation and continue to see a move up to 2 percent next year," said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York. Personal income rose 0.4 percent last month as wages jumped 0.7 percent. Savings were little changed at $759.1 billion last month. A third report on Tuesday showed house prices increased 5.9 percent year-on-year in March.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.1 percent in morning trading to 19,657.76 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3 percent to 5,736.30. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent to 2,351.21. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.2 percent to 25,759.49, while the Shanghai Composite was up nearly 0.5 percent at 3,124.12. WALL STREET: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,029.47. The Nasdaq composite dipped 7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,203.19. TRUMP FACTOR: An ongoing probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election has set off uncertainty about the administration of President Donald Trump. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has decided to provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee, while Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has rejected a House intelligence committee request for information. Former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the investigation. CHINA DATA: An official monthly survey showed that growth in China's factory activity was steady last month in a sign that the recovery in the world's No. 2 economy is holding up. The purchasing' managers index, or PMI, released Wednesday came in at 51.2 for May. THE QUOTE: "This suggests further stablization of the world's second largest economy and will allow policy makers more room to carry out the de-leverage campaign in an attempt to reduce the country's heightened debts," Margaret Yang Yan, analyst with CMC Markets Singapore, said of the China data. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 30 cents to $49.36 a barrel in New York. It lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 30 cents to $51.94 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose slightly to 110.09 yen from 111.07 yen late Tuesday in Asia. The euro was little changed at $1.1188 from $1.1181. ___ Yuri Kageyama can be reached on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama Copyright 2017 by The Associated Press.

U.S. stocks are lower early Tuesday, May 30, 2017, as energy companies once again slump with the price of oil and banks slide in tandem with bond yields and interest rates. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) TOKYO (AP) — Asian stocks were mixed Wednesday as worries lingered over political uncertainty in Washington and shares drooped overnight in the U.S. while China was boosted by manufacturing data. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.1 percent in morning trading to 19,657.76 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3 percent to 5,736.30. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent to 2,351.21. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.2 percent to 25,759.49, while the Shanghai Composite was up nearly 0.5 percent at 3,124.12. WALL STREET: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,029.47. The Nasdaq composite dipped 7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,203.19. × Advertisement TRUMP FACTOR: An ongoing probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election has set off uncertainty about the administration of President Donald Trump. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has decided to provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee, while Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has rejected a House intelligence committee request for information. Former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the investigation. CHINA DATA: An official monthly survey showed that growth in China's factory activity was steady last month in a sign that the recovery in the world's No. 2 economy is holding up. The purchasing' managers index, or PMI, released Wednesday came in at 51.2 for May. THE QUOTE: "This suggests further stablization of the world's second largest economy and will allow policy makers more room to carry out the de-leverage campaign in an attempt to reduce the country's heightened debts," Margaret Yang Yan, analyst with CMC Markets Singapore, said of the China data. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 30 cents to $49.36 a barrel in New York. It lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 30 cents to $51.94 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose slightly to 110.09 yen from 111.07 yen late Tuesday in Asia. The euro was little changed at $1.1188 from $1.1181. ___ Yuri Kageyama can be reached on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Oil prices fell to keep U.S. crude CLc1 below the $50 a barrel mark on concerns output cuts by the world's big exporters may not be sufficient to lessen a global glut and signs of resurgent output in Libya. The energy sector's .SPNY 1.31 percent fall made it the worst performer among the major S&P 500 sectors. Exxon (XOM.N) was down 0.6 percent. Financial stocks, down 0.8 percent, also supplied some downward pressure. JPMorgan (JPM.N) fell 1.7 percent and Bank of America (BAC.N) lost 1.4 percent as the two biggest drags on the S&P 500. U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four months in April and monthly inflation rebounded, pointing to firming domestic demand that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. "The markets are susceptible to geopolitical and to purely political risk, but in terms of the economy and in terms of earnings, we are where investors are comfortable," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. "There isn’t a huge rush to put more money into equities, there isn’t a huge rush to put more money into Treasuries - the market is treading water." Dallas Fed head Robert Kaplan told CNBC that while he was concerned about the recent economic data, he expected two more rate hikes in 2017. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said a hike is probably coming soon, though the central bank may want to delay if inflation remains soft. Traders currently see an 86.6-percent chance of a quarter-point rate hike by the Fed at its June meeting, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 50.81 points, or 0.24 percent, to 21,029.47, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 2.91 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,412.91 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 7.01 points, or 0.11 percent, to 6,203.19. The technology sector .SPLRCT rose 0.31 percent, boosted by gains in Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), both up 0.6 percent. Amazon (AMZN.O) was up 0.1 percent at $996.70, after briefly crossing the $1,000 mark. Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Class A shares were close behind, hitting a record of $997.62 before ending the session up 0.3 percent at $996.17. Telecoms .SPLRCL jumped, up 1.4 percent, after MoffettNathanson upgraded the sector to "neutral" from "underweight," citing a lack of negative near-term catalysts. CardConnect's (CCN.O) shares jumped 10.3 percent to $15.05 after First Data (FDC.N) agreed to buy the payment processor for $750 million. First Data closed up 1.1 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.58-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.87-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows. About 5.68 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.69 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

NEW YORK >> U.S. stocks are lower Tuesday as energy companies once again slump with the price of oil and banks slide in tandem with bond yields and interest rates. Technology companies and consumer-focused companies continue to climb and Amazon.com briefly surpassed $1,000 a share for the first time. The losses threaten a seven-day winning streak for major stock indexes. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412 as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,037. The Nasdaq composite dipped 6 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,204. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks tumbled 9 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,372. About two-thirds of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange were trading lower around midday. The Standard & Poor’s 500 and Nasdaq have both risen for seven days in a row, and both closed at record highs Friday. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 63 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $49.17 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 85 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $51.79 a barrel in London. Hess dropped $1.58, or 3.3 percent, to $46.57 and Exxon Mobil shed 37 cents to $81.18. The S&P 500 index of energy companies reached its lowest level in a year. BONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.23 percent from 2.25 percent late Friday. When bond yields decrease, interest rates fall along with them, and that reduces the profits banks can make from mortgages and other loans. PNC Financial Services gave up $2.05, or 1.7 percent, to $119.27 and JPMorgan Chase declined 72 cents to $84.64. TURBULENCE: International airlines slumped as the government considered expanding a ban on laptops from the passenger cabins of flights to the United States. In March the Trump administration said passengers flying from 10 cities, mostly in the Middle East, could not bring laptops, tablets and some other devices in the cabins and had to check them instead. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said that ban might be expanded to all international flights to and from the U.S. It’s not clear how that might affect business travel, and Delta lost $1.50, or 3 percent, to $49.30. United Continental slid $1.81, or 2.2 percent, to $79.44 and American gave up 69 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $48.06. DEALING: E-commerce and payment services company First Data said it will buy payment processing company CardConnect for $15 a share in cash, or about $468 million. CardConnect’s stock climbed $1.38, or 10.1 percent, to $15.03 and First Data picked up 13 cents to $16.77. Offshore drilling contractor Atwood Oceanics jumped after it agreed to be bought by Ensco PLC for $10.72 a share in stock, or $863 million. Atwood rose $2.03, or 25.1 percent, to $10.11 while U.K.-based Ensco lost 28 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $6.42. Cloud-based incentives company Xactly agreed to be taken private by Vista Equity Partners in a deal that values it at $15.65 a share, or $499 million. Its stock added $2.20, or 16.4 percent, to $15.60. AMAZON MILESTONE: Online retail giant Amazon.com traded above $1,000 a share for the first time, peaking at $1,001.20 shortly after the market opened. Later it traded at $998.40, up $2.62 from Frida’s close. The only other S&P 500 company valued at more than $1,000 a share is travel booking site Priceline, which traded at about $1,846 on Tuesday. TECH AGAIN ON TOP: Technology companies continued to lead the way. Security software maker Symantec advanced 63 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $30.24. Chipmaker Nvidia gained $3.27, or 2.3 percent, to $145.11 and Micron Technology rose 70 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $30.46. CONSUMERS: The Commerce Department said consumer spending grew 0.4 percent in April, another hint that the economy is rebounding after a sluggish start to this year. Consumer spending is responsible for 70 percent of economic activity. An important measurement of inflation rose in April and it’s up 1.7 percent in the last year. That’s still below the Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent. The Conference Board, a business research group, said consumers were slightly less confident in May for the second month in a row.

Photos Videos Topics Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News Technology News WRAPUP 2-U.S. consumer spending, inflation data support Fed rate hike case Shares0 Tue, 30 May 2017-09:18pm , Reuters U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four months in April and monthly inflation rebounded, pointing to firming domestic demand that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, is likely to remain on solid ground in the wake of other reports on Tuesday that showed confidence among households still at lofty levels despite some slippage this month and strong gains in house prices in March. "Fed officials can continue with their gradual pace of rate hikes in June as the economy remains on course for stronger growth this quarter and throughout the rest of the year," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending increased 0.4 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in March as households spent more on both goods and services. April's increase was the biggest since December and eased concerns about second-quarter economic growth after weak reports on core capital goods orders, the goods trade deficit and inventory investment in April. Consumer spending was previously reported to have been unchanged in March. Consumer spending grew at its slowest pace in more than seven years in the first quarter, helping to restrict the increase in gross domestic product to an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the first three months of the year. Following April's report and upward revisions to March's data, economists said consumer spending was running at around a 3 percent rate, a sharp acceleration from the first quarter's 0.6 percent pace. GDP growth estimates for the second quarter range between a rate of 2 percent and 3.8 percent. "This takes out the downside risk to our projection for 3 percent real GDP growth this quarter, and we now see more balanced risks around that call," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. U.S. stocks were trading slightly lower amid a drop in oil prices. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies while U.S. government bond prices rose. TIGHTENING JOB MARKET Minutes of the Fed's May 2-3 policy meeting, which were published last week, showed that while policymakers agreed they should hold off hiking rates until there was evidence the growth slowdown was transitory, "most participants" believed "it would soon be appropriate" to raise borrowing costs. The U.S. central bank hiked rates by 25 basis points in March. Consumer spending is being boosted by a tightening labor market, which is gradually pushing up wages. Rising house prices are also supporting consumption. In a separate report on Tuesday, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 117.9 in May from 119.4 in April. The index, which hit a 16-year high of 124.9 in March, remains underpinned by labor market strength. The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, recorded its second strongest reading since 2001. "Fed Chair (Janet) Yellen has in the past used the labor market differential as a check on the unemployment rate, and the reading for May should provide confirmation to Yellen and her colleagues that the economy has reached the Fed's assessment of full employment," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Expectations of further policy tightening next month are also supported by steadily rising inflation. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy rebounded 0.2 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in March. But the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.5 percent in the 12 months through April, the smallest gain since December 2015. The core PCE, which is the Fed's preferred inflation measure, rose 1.6 percent year-on-year in March. That was below the central bank's 2 percent target. "We anticipate 1.5 percent will mark the low on core PCE inflation and continue to see a move up to 2 percent next year," said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York. Personal income rose 0.4 percent last month as wages jumped 0.7 percent. Savings were little changed at $759.1 billion last month. A third report on Tuesday showed house prices increased 5.9 percent year-on-year in March. (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

Oil prices fell over 1 percent on concerns that output cuts by the world's big exporters may not be enough to drain a global glut that has depressed the market for almost three years. The energy sector's 1.04 percent fall led the decliners among the major S&P 500 sectors. Oil majors Chevron and Exxon were down about 0.5 percent. Adding to the pressure, financial stocks were down 0.8 percent. JPMorgan fell 0.8 percent, weighing the most on the S&P, while Goldman Sachs' 1.3 percent fall dragged on the Dow. Data showed core PCE price index fell to 1.5 percent in the 12 months through April from 1.6 percent in March, reinforcing views that the Federal Reserve might not raise rates again after June. "We're in a period of time where the first-quarter data was slightly weak and people are wondering if the data was an anomaly or is there something more there," said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. Dallas Fed head Robert Kaplan told CNBC that while he was concerned about the recent economic data, he still saw two more rate hikes in 2017. Data showed U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four months in April, but the consumer confidence index fell to 117.9 in May from 119.4 in April.

U.S. stocks are lower early Tuesday, May 30, 2017, as energy companies once again slump with the price of oil and banks slide in tandem with bond yields and interest rates. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) TOKYO — Asian stocks were mixed Wednesday as worries lingered over political uncertainty in Washington and shares drooped overnight in the U.S. while China was boosted by manufacturing data. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 per cent to 19,628.57 in afternoon trading, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added nearly 0.2 per cent to 5,726.80. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.1 per cent to 2,345.58. Hong Kong's Hang Seng inched down nearly 0.1 per cent to 25,689.95, while the Shanghai Composite was up nearly 0.2 per cent at 3,115.33. WALL STREET: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 21,029.47. The Nasdaq composite dipped 7 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 6,203.19. TRUMP FACTOR: An ongoing probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election has set off uncertainty about the administration of President Donald Trump. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has decided to provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee, while Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has rejected a House intelligence committee request for information. Former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the investigation. CHINA DATA: An official monthly survey showed that growth in China's factory activity was steady last month in a sign that the recovery in the world's No. 2 economy is holding up. The purchasing' managers index, or PMI, released Wednesday came in at 51.2 for May. THE QUOTE: "This suggests further stablization of the world's second largest economy and will allow policy makers more room to carry out the de-leverage campaign in an attempt to reduce the country's heightened debts," Margaret Yang Yan, analyst with CMC Markets Singapore, said of the China data. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 29 cents to $49.37 a barrel in New York. It lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 30 cents to $51.94 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 110.94 yen from 111.07 yen late Tuesday in Asia. The euro slipped to $1.1172 from $1.1181. ___ Yuri Kageyama can be reached on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *   Previous Next     FILE - This Thursday, Oct. 2, 2014, file photo, shows the facade of the New York Stock Exchange.

THE QUOTE: "This suggests further stablization of the world's second largest economy and will allow policy makers more room to carry out the de-leverage campaign in an attempt to reduce the country's heightened debts," Margaret Yang Yan, analyst with CMC Markets Singapore, said of the China data. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 30 cents to $49.36 a barrel in New York. It lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 30 cents to $51.94 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose slightly to 110.09 yen from 111.07 yen late Tuesday in Asia. The euro was little changed at $1.1188 from $1.1181. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman The California Economic Summit To Be Held In San Diego For The First Time SAN DIEGO, May 30, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — The sixth annual California Economic Summit, the only statewide and multi-sector effort to promote economic security, will be held in San Diego on November 2-3, 2017. Through the Summit, a vibrant and diverse network of business, education, government and civic leaders are advancing a comprehensive agenda to reduce poverty, improve workforce opportunities, increase the supply of housing, lower the cost of living, and invest in communities and infrastructure necessary for a sustainable future. Earlier this year, a cadre of San Diego leaders took the initiative to bring the 2017 Summit to their region to continue the Summit’s strategy of using regional solutions to drive state policy. „I thought we had innovations here in San Diego, not only in housing but job creation and water management to showcase to the rest of the state, so I actively pursued this opportunity,” said Jennifer LeSar, who has been involved in the Summit’s Housing Action Team and was instrumental in the launch of Housing You Matters, a San Diego coalition working to improve housing affordability. „We have a diverse economy and are interested in developing more momentum for meeting the challenges for not only our region but for the entire state of California to successfully compete in the global economy.” Since 2012 the Summit’s robust network of civic, business and government leaders have been refining and promoting the Roadmap to Shared Prosperity. Among the accomplishments are the passage of $200 million Strong Workforce Program, which forged and funded new partnerships among community colleges, employers and students to help produce 1 million more skilled workers over the next decade. Summit leaders also helped to develop and are implementing Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts (EIFDs) to encourage local governments to work together to finance economic development projects. „JPMorgan Chase is delighted to participate in this very important conversation and action agenda about our state’s future,” said Kari Decker, Managing Director of the Office of Corporate Responsibility for JPMorgan Chase in the Western Region. „We are well aware that the cost of living here, especially housing, is rising faster than wages, that many workers require new skills to qualify for better-paying jobs and that state, regional and community leaders need to better collaborate to help build a stronger economy. This summit is a critical component of that collective effort.” The Summit has long been focused on California’s economic equality and defining steps that need to be taken to expand the middle class through a triple-bottom-line strategy that simultaneously grows the economy, improves environmental quality and increases opportunity for all. The Summit’s 2017 Roadmap to Shared Prosperity defines an action plan to address the One Million Challenges, a Summit initiative launched in response to the state’s high cost of living and wage gaps: Produce one million more skilled workers Build one million more housing units Save, capture, and reuse one million acre-feet of water annually Eighteen million Californians live below or near the poverty line. A lack of upward mobility is keeping Californians from achieving all they want for themselves, their children and their grandchildren. Building pathways to increase upward mobility is critical for the state’s future. „We know that Californians are inspired to act on this critically important issue,” said Jim Mayer, CA Fwd President and Chief Executive Officer. „The Summit, with its regional infrastructure and state influence, is best suited to develop and promote a unifying solution.” The California Economic Summit was developed by CA Fwd and the California Stewardship Network. ABOUT CA FWD California Forward (CA Fwd) is a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization, devoted to improving the performance of government in California. It believes that increased emphasis on accountability and transparency will create government that Californians deserve and expect. CA Fwd strongly advocates for confidence and trust in elected officials as being an essential ingredient to good government.  ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA STEWARDSHIP NETWORK The California Stewardship Network was created in 2008, when a group of diverse regions across California were inspired by Becky Morgan to come together to establish an alliance of regional partnerships to tackle the state’s most pressing economic, environmental and community challenges.

"Extraordinary measures are suitable for extraordinary times and categorically we are not in extraordinary times now. Look at the euro zone economy, it's on fire, growth is way above trend and it's shooting the lights out, so it does look a little weird," Nick Gartside, the international chief investment officer at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC on Tuesday. Speaking to a European Parliament committee on economic affairs on Monday, the ECB president argued that extraordinary monetary policies are still needed in order to raise inflation. "For domestic price pressures to strengthen, we still need very accommodative financing conditions, which are themselves dependent on a fairly substantial amount of monetary accommodation," he said, according to Reuters. Alex Kraus | Bloomberg via Getty Images His words, intended to temper expectations of any policy move by the central bank in June, weighed on the euro and seen European bond yields tick higher. The common currency earlier on Tuesday hit a more than one-week low of $1.111 against the dollar, although has since recovered to around $1.117. The euro shot higher Tuesday afternoon on a report by Reuters that said, citing unnamed sources, that ECB policymakers could discuss dropping its pledges to increase stimulus during their regular meeting next week. These price movements come as the ECB's official stance on dovish, ultra-loose monetary policy comes under increasingly heavy criticism. Jens Weidmann, Germany's representative on the ECB's Governing Council and president of the Bundesbank, said the current expansive monetary policy is "appropriate in principle" but also asked when the central bank would start to normalize. "As a result of the economic recovery and a predicted inflation rate of almost 2 percent in 2019, it is quite legitimate to ask when the Governing Council should consider monetary policy normalization," he said in Berlin on Monday, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, JPMorgan's Gartside, highlights that Draghi's dovish comments are starting to look a little bit odd, but underlines a potential reason for his stance. "Maybe the ECB are very wary of doing a 2011, and remember that was the year when they hiked rates in April, hiked rates in July, to cut them by the end of the year," he told CNBC. show chapters Euro zone economy is on fire: JPMAM    Tuesday, 30 May 2017 | 3:52 AM ET | 03:03 Paul Donovan, UBS chief economist, also weighed in, joking that Draghi has not begun his rehabilitation program to overcome his "addiction to easing." "Draghi told the European Parliament yesterday (Monday) that he did not have an easing problem, that it was only recreational easing and he could quit anytime that he wished to. It was just that he did not wish to," he said in his daily audio comment on Tuesday. Donovan believes the rest of the Governing Council will not allow Draghi to get away with aggressive dovishness for much longer. He predicts the ECB is likely to organically tighten policy in 2018, reducing the ECB balance sheet as a proportion of GDP (gross domestic product). The debate at the central bank seems to be shifting from if and when the central bank will begin normalization, to how quickly. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Omega Announces Closing of New and Amended Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities; Acquisition and Lease of 18 Facilities In UK; Corrects Market Rumor Related to Signature Healthcare May 30, 2017 09:16 AM Eastern Daylight Time HUNT VALLEY, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--New and Amended Credit Facilities. Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (NYSE:OHI) today announced that it has entered into (a) a new $1.8 billion senior unsecured revolving and term loan credit facility, comprised of a $1.25 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), a $425 million U.S. Dollar senior unsecured term loan facility (the “U.S. Dollar Term Loan Facility”), and a £100 million Pounds Sterling senior unsecured term loan facility (the “Sterling Term Loan Facility” and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the U.S. Dollar Term Loan Facility, collectively, the “REIT Credit Facilities”) and (b) an amended and restated $250 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility (the “Amended and Restated Term Loan”). In addition, Omega also announced that its subsidiary, OHI Healthcare Properties Limited Partnership (“OHI LP”), has entered into a new $100 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility (the “OHI LP Credit Facility”). Each of the new and amended credit facilities were effective May 25, 2017. The overall syndication of the REIT Credit Facilities and the OHI LP Credit Facility raised commitments of over $2.8 billion. The REIT Credit Facilities replace Omega’s previous $2 billion senior unsecured revolving credit and term loan credit facility (the “2014 Credit Facility”), part of which (a $200 million term loan due June 27, 2017) was previously repaid from proceeds of Omega’s $700 million senior notes offering in April 2017. The REIT Credit Facilities include an “accordion feature” that permits the Company to expand its borrowing capacity to an aggregate of not more than $2.5 billion. The Amended and Restated Term Loan amends and restates Omega’s previous $250 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility (the “2015 Term Loan”) to implement certain modifications to the terms and conditions similar to those now in the REIT Credit Facilities and the OHI LP Credit Facility. The OHI LP Credit Facility replaces OHI LP’s previous $100 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility (the “2015 OHI LP Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility is priced at LIBOR plus an applicable percentage (currently at 125 basis points, with a range of 87.5 to 165 basis points) based on the Company’s ratings from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and/or Fitch Ratings, plus a facility fee based on the same ratings (currently 25 basis points, with a range of 12.5 to 30 basis points). The Revolving Credit Facility will be used for (a) refinancing existing indebtedness, (b) financing acquisitions, and (c) funding working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. At May 25, 2017, the Company had $333 million in borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, of which $100 million was repaid on May 26, 2017. The Revolving Credit Facility matures in four years, on May 25, 2021, with two options by the Company to extend the maturity six additional months for each option. The U.S. Dollar Term Loan Facility, the Sterling Term Loan Facility, and the OHI LP Credit Facility are each priced at LIBOR plus an applicable percentage (currently at 145 basis points, with a range of 90 to 190 basis points) based on the Company’s ratings from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and/or Fitch Ratings. The U.S. Dollar Term Loan Facility, the Sterling Term Loan Facility, and the OHI LP Credit Facility each mature in five years, on May 25, 2022, and will be used to refinance existing indebtedness. Neither the Company nor OHI LP experienced any material early termination penalties due to the termination of the 2014 Credit Facility and the 2015 OHI LP Credit Facility in connection with the effectiveness of the REIT Credit Facilities and the OHI LP Credit Facility. For the three month period ending June 30, 2017, the Company expects to record a one-time, non-cash charge of approximately $5.5 million relating to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the termination of the 2014 Credit Facility. The REIT Credit Facilities are made up of a syndication of financial institutions. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated is Joint Lead Arranger and Sole Book Runner. Bank of America, N.A. is the Administrative Agent. Citizens Bank, National Association, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are Joint Lead Arrangers and Co-Syndication Agents. The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Compass Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, The Bank of Nova Scotia, SunTrust Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Capital One, National Association, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., Branch Banking and Trust Company, Regions Bank, Bank of the West, Fifth Third Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, The Huntington National Bank, Stifel Bank & Trust, Synovus Bank, , Bank of Taiwan, First Commercial Bank, Ltd., Land Bank of Taiwan, Taiwan Business Bank, E. Sun Commercial Bank Limited, Hua Nan Commercial Bank Ltd., Mega International Commercial Bank Co., Ltd. and Taiwan Cooperative Bank also participate in the REIT Credit Facilities. The OHI LP Credit Facility is made up of a syndication of financial institutions. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated is Joint Lead Arranger and Sole Book Runner. Bank of America, N.A. is the Administrative Agent. Citizens Bank, National Association, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are Joint Lead Arrangers and Co-Syndication Agents. The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Royal Bank of Canada, SunTrust Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Capital One, National Association and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. also participate in the OHI LP Credit Facility. United Kingdom (“UK”) Transaction. Omega also announced the completion of an acquisition and lease transaction with Gold Care Homes, a provider of care home services to the elderly in the UK. The transaction, which closed on May 11, 2017, for approximately $113 million, included 18 UK-based care home facilities and continues Omega’s expansion in the UK. Gold Care Homes is the second care home operator to be backed by Omega in the UK and this transaction follows similar transactions involving 35 care home facilities with its other UK care home operator, Healthcare Homes Group. Omega has now acquired a total of 53 care home facilities in the UK. Signature Holdings II LLC. Recent media coverage relating to one of Omega’s operators, Signature Holdings II LLC, inaccurately reported that Omega had engaged Alvarez & Marsal as a financial adviser in relation to matters involving Omega’s Signature Holdings II LLC-operated facilities. “While we do not provide financial information regarding our specific operators, the media report that we retained a financial adviser with regard to our facilities operated by Signature is simply false. We have a large and diverse portfolio comprised of approximately 1,000 properties located in 42 states and the UK and operated by 77 different operators. No single operator comprises more than 10% of our total portfolio based on rent and this diversification minimizes the potential for an adverse impact associated with any single operator encountering financial difficulties. Our management team has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to effectively address and resolve issues encountered by our operators and Omega’s credit quality, financial strength, and conservative balance sheet management are reflected in the favorable terms of the REIT Credit Facilities and the OHI LP Credit Facility,” stated Taylor Pickett, Omega’s President and CEO. Omega is a real estate investment trust investing in and providing financing to the long-term care industry. As of March 31, 2017, Omega has a portfolio of investments that includes approximately 1,000 properties located in 42 states and the United Kingdom and operated by 77 different operators.

Photos Videos Topics Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News Business News GLOBAL MARKETS-Europe feels the heat as political temperatures rise Shares0 Tue, 30 May 2017-04:21pm , Reuters European shares fell for a fourth day running on Tuesday and the euro was battling to avoid a similar fate, as the prospect of early Italian elections and Greece's ongoing struggles nudged up the political temperature gauge again. The region's banks also came under pressure as Deutsche Bank cut the sector to 'underweight', while sterling rebounded having been knocked recently by signs that next week's UK election is set to be closer than originally expected. All this drove the traditional safe-haven assets of gold and the Japanese yen higher and briefly pushed yields low-risk German government bonds to their lowest in more than a month. Low inflation readings out of Spain and Germany, as well as European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi's commitment to continued stimulus in a speech on Monday, helped keep the euro subdued at $1.116. At the heart of the moves, however, were signs that elections in Italy may now come as early as September, after the 5-Star Movement became the fourth big party to back a switch to a proportional electoral system. Italian shares remained flat having slumped 2 percent on Monday and southern euro zone bonds were also pushed into the red again. "We always knew Italy was going to come back into the market's sights but I think people thought we would have a longer stay of execution," said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley. "It does seem like the market will have to face worries about elections and populism again over the summer. That of course is a drag for the euro." In spite of the weakness seen in the last couple of weeks, the pan-European STOXX 600 index is still set to end May in positive territory and near a 2-year high. It will also be the index's fourth straight month of gains. Investors however are reshuffling their portfolios as they seek fresh catalysts following a surprisingly strong earnings season and hot streak of euro zone macro economic data. European equity strategists at Deutsche Bank downgraded banks to 'underweight' saying the sector's valuations - which have soared around 80 percent over the last year - were no longer "compelling". They also cut tech firms to neutral and JP Morgan's analysts did the same to carmakers. At the same time Deutsche upgraded construction and energy stocks to 'overweight' while JP Morgan raised UK stocks to neutral saying they were at the cheapest-ever levels on price price-to-book basis relative to region. "We think UK is becoming interesting in the regional allocation again," JPMorgan's strategists, led by Mislav Matejka, said in a note to clients. "(The) UK is a defensive market with high dividend yield. It should perform better in the backdrop of potential softening in activity indicators, lower inflation prints and continued range-bound bond yields." GOLD SHINES Greece's debt problems also continued to simmer after it failed to reach a deal on its next installment of its bailout programme earlier this month. Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos on Tuesday dismissed reports in Germany's Bild newspaper, that the country could opt out of receiving the new tranche if it does not receive clearer debt relief terms. The dollar index, under pressure over the past fortnight from concerns over the Trump administration's difficulties, gained around 0.2 percent in early trade in Europe. In commodities, oil prices retreated around 40 cents a barrel, as concerns lingered about whether the extension of output cuts by OPEC and other producing countries will be enough to support prices. Global benchmark Brent fell 0.8 percent to $51.90 and U.S. crude futures slipped about 0.4 percent to $49.60 a barrel. Gold meanwhile rose to a one-month high of $1,270 an ounce before it ran out of steam. It has risen almost five percent over the last three weeks as stock markets and other risk plays favoured by traders have stuttered. Risk surrounding the closeness of Britain's upcoming elections, the prospect of early elections in Italy and worries over Greek debt were supporting gold, said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at OANDA. "The picture will get more muddy as the week goes on as we have a lot of data from around the world coming in," he said.

While the brokerage may point to the controversy swirling around the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule, and while one might argue the merits of Vanguard’s funds, the truth is likely much simpler: Vanguard’s refusal to pay Morgan Stanley for access to their clients. Because Vanguard won’t pay Morgan Stanley MS, -0.21%  , Morgan Stanley won’t pay brokers to recommend Vanguard’s funds. What goes around, comes around. Coincidentally, this development arrives on the heels of Morgan Stanley’s settlement with Massachusetts securities regulators over allegations that the company ran an improper sales contest to boost their securities-based (margin) loan book. It is common knowledge that margin loans are one of the most profitable brokerage products, so at least there is some form of perverse logic at work here. Not so with the Vanguard decision. Does this sound familiar? It should. In 1995, one of Morgan Stanley’s acquisitions, Dean Witter, folded under intense media pressure and ended the practice of “differentiated commissions” (paying brokers higher commissions to steer clients into proprietary mutual funds). The details of these two breaches of client trust differ, but the core behavior is identical — distorting investor advice through ethically questionable compensation schemes. Morgan Stanley is hardly alone. Just two examples: Wells Fargo WFC, -0.52%  opened more than 2.2 million fake accounts to fulfill employee sales incentives. Since the scandal came to light in September 2016, more than 5,000 employees have lost their jobs — including then-CEO John Stumpf. J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, -0.51%  in 2015 was fined $307 million to settle accusations regarding improperly steering clients.to the company’s own — more expensive — mutual funds and hedge funds. The list of instances where banks and brokers have placed their interests before their clients is both impressive and depressing. But I shouldn’t really be surprised, as I witnessed with increasing dismay these practices occurring with accelerating frequency during a 30-year career in the investment business. (And I am not surprised that these same firms oppose adopting a fiduciary standard for brokers.) I eventually felt compelled to abandon the traditional broker-dealer world to join an independent registered investment adviser, The Caprock Group. Brokerage firms have a long history of pushing product, as investment banking, capital markets, sales and trading businesses each function as competing, stand-alone profit centers within larger organizations. In concert, they manufacture products which are then distributed to customers of the firms. The primary source of revenue for each of these profit centers? Those same customers. No amount of disclosure can entirely mitigate such misaligned incentives. Read: Still wondering what the fiduciary rule is? You’re not alone Perhaps the best example of this dysfunction is what is known as “open architecture” — terminology used by many firms to imply impartiality. But in reality their platforms are open only to investment managers willing to pay annual pay-to-play fees ranging from $250,000 to more than $1 million. Bank ownership adds yet another layer of potential conflict as firms squeeze ever more revenue from existing clients by cross selling them everything from checking accounts to credit cards, regardless of whether doing so is in the client’s best interest. As a result, brokers and bankers are accountable to their firm’s revenue goals and may be forbidden to advise on assets not held at the firm — even if those might be the best solutions for clients. It is critical to understand how much you are paying, to whom, and for what. The problem is that fees are often intentionally opaque. For example, UBS’s 2017 fee disclosure document is 33 pages long; Morgan Stanley’s runs 26 pages. Complicating matters is that many advisers simply dodge the question (or, worse, don’t know the answers). So how does an investor pierce the fog? Essentially, there are two types of fees. One is for advice. The other is for products. Both are rational. But both must be fully disclosed and understood. Brokers and bankers must outline every cost and expense borne by each investment they recommend. And if they recommend credit cards, margin loans, insurance products, or structured notes, they must both explain the investment rationale and justify the additional expense. Why? Because the impact of fees on performance is significant. A 1.5% fee difference over 20 years on a $1 million investment earning 6% is more than $700,000, consuming almost three-quarters of the value of the initial investment. Investors don’t need to be sold. They need to be advised. This is the age of transparency. Every investor has a right to clearly understand the fees and conflicts of interest that are present in the management of their investments. Every investor should insist that they be advised by a fiduciary. Every investor needs an advocate who can source, vet, and recommend the most efficient and cost-effective solutions available to help them achieve their goals. Investors don’t need to be sold. They need to be advised. And they need to know that their adviser’s interests are aligned with their own. In fact, aligned interests are now table stakes in the financial services world. From there, investment acumen, sophistication, capacity for independent thought and action, and a relentless fiduciary ethic are what divides great advisers from the rest. And every investor has the right to a great adviser. Greg Mech is a managing director at The Caprock Group.

While the brokerage may point to the controversy swirling around the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule, and while one might argue the merits of Vanguard’s funds, the truth is likely much simpler: Vanguard’s refusal to pay Morgan Stanley for access to their clients. Because Vanguard won’t pay Morgan Stanley MS, -0.21%  , Morgan Stanley won’t pay brokers to recommend Vanguard’s funds. What goes around, comes around. Coincidentally, this development arrives on the heels of Morgan Stanley’s settlement with Massachusetts securities regulators over allegations that the company ran an improper sales contest to boost their securities-based (margin) loan book. It is common knowledge that margin loans are one of the most profitable brokerage products, so at least there is some form of perverse logic at work here. Not so with the Vanguard decision. Does this sound familiar? It should. In 1995, one of Morgan Stanley’s acquisitions, Dean Witter, folded under intense media pressure and ended the practice of “differentiated commissions” (paying brokers higher commissions to steer clients into proprietary mutual funds). The details of these two breaches of client trust differ, but the core behavior is identical — distorting investor advice through ethically questionable compensation schemes. Morgan Stanley is hardly alone. Just two examples: Wells Fargo WFC, -0.52%  opened more than 2.2 million fake accounts to fulfill employee sales incentives. Since the scandal came to light in September 2016, more than 5,000 employees have lost their jobs — including then-CEO John Stumpf. J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, -0.51%  in 2015 was fined $307 million to settle accusations regarding improperly steering clients.to the company’s own — more expensive — mutual funds and hedge funds.
