Nisha Gopalan JPMorgan made $3.3 billion in revenue from investment banking (including trading and equity capital markets, debt capital markets and M&A) last year, about the same as Deutsche Bank made in 2015 when it ranked No. 1. Photo: Bloomberg Hong Kong: America, one; Europe, nil. In Asia, at least, US financial institutions are climbing up the investment banking league tables while their euro-area counterparts sink. But champagne corks shouldn’t be popping on Wall Street just yet. How long their current reign lasts will depend to a large degree on how long fixed income, currencies and commodities business remains robust. Deutsche Bank AG, weighed down by billions of dollars in fines for money laundering and manipulating interest rates, has slipped from pole position in Asia while JPMorgan Chase & Co., which expanded in FICC and equities, surged from seventh to first place, data from industry researcher Coalition show. The New York-based bank made $3.3 billion in revenue from investment banking (including trading and equity capital markets, debt capital markets and M&A) last year, about the same as Deutsche Bank made in 2015 when it ranked No. 1. In second spot in Asia is Citigroup Inc., followed by Morgan Stanley. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. coasted into sixth. It’s laid off about 30 bankers, most of them in Hong Kong and Singapore, as Chinese banks eat into all lenders’ share of the IPO pie and activity in Southeast Asia slows. Deutsche Bank’s come down shouldn’t be a major surprise considering the company’s litany of problems. Other European financial institutions have scaled back in the region, too. Barclays Plc closed its equities shop in Asia, while post the global financial crisis, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc is almost nowhere to be seen. Standard Chartered Plc has largely exited equities globally. JPMorgan Asia investment banking revenue, FY16 With China clamping down on mainland firms doing deals offshore, 2017 probably won’t be a big year for M&A, or investment banking in general for that matter. But a rebound in markets could spell the return of equities as a significant revenue driver, as was the case in the lead up to June 2015, before stocks in China crashed. That would be a boon for banks with strong equity franchises in the region, like UBS Group AG. It would also benefit Chinese lenders, which don’t have much of a fixed-income presence offshore but have been playing a bigger part in Hong Kong’s IPO market as they help mainland companies sell shares. Although exchange volumes in Asia Pacific are down 10.5% year-to-date, there are some notable bright pockets. Hong Kong is up 13.2%, for example, while year-on-year growth in Malaysia, India and Taiwan also reaches well into the double digits, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. American banks shouldn’t assume their good fortune is bulletproof.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jena McGregor By Jena McGregor March 23 Follow @jenamcgregor Citibank is one of six financial firms that a shareholder is targeting for more information about its gender pay gap. (Mark Lennihan/AP Photo) Last year, the investor Arjuna Capital helped urge seven tech companies to doing something unexpected: Publish the percentage pay gap that exists between their male and female employees and commit to closing it. Now, the woman behind that push is taking aim at another industry known for its male-dominated workplace: The financial sector. Natasha Lamb, managing director of Arjuna Capital, which focuses on sustainable and social impact investing, said Thursday she had filed proposals at six financial companies urging them to prepare a report addressing their goals at reducing the gender pay gap and including the percentage gap between the pay of men and women. The banks and credit card firms targeted are Citigroup, Wells Fargo, American Express, MasterCard, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. "It makes no sense to hold America's top tech companies to a high standard on gender pay equity and then pretend that banks should be allowed to discount the issue and operate with no transparency," Lamb said in a conference call with reporters. [Microsoft and Facebook tout equal pay -- but there's a more glaring problem] Lamb said she was going after the major banks in part because financial services is such a male-dominated industry. In the proposal, she cited data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows female financial advisers faced a 61.3 percent pay gap in 2014, the widest of occupations reviewed, as well as a 2016 study from the management consultancy Oliver Wyman showing it will take three decades before women reach 30 percent of the industry's executive committees. Other research cited showed links between risks and rewards for investors in companies that have diverse executive teams. Lamb said she has been in dialogue with all the companies in question, but most of the financial firms have been more opposed to her proposal. "We've seen a night and day difference in the tech and financial worlds," Lamb said. All but one of the six companies have come out against the proposal, Lamb said; she has not gotten an answer from MasterCard. Among the nine tech companies she worked with last year, only three formally opposed the resolutions in their proxies, one of which was eBay, where an unusually high number of shareholders voted in favor of the proposal and the company said it would share its analysis publicly. Of course, the tech companies revealed nearly nonexistent percentage gaps when analyzing people working in similar jobs, which may have made them more willing to share the information. Those numbers also overlook the industry's position gap: Men and women may earn roughly the same in the same jobs, but men are more frequently in higher-paying roles in both of these industries. Meanwhile, four of the banks -- Wells Fargo, Bank of America, American Express and Citigroup -- defended their numbers of female leaders and their pay practices in lengthy sections of their proxy statements. In them, the companies highlighted a range of internal efforts to prevent bias, improve numbers of women and minorities, use third party consultants to check for pay equity, as well as note recognition they've received for diversity and leadership involvement in diversity programs. As a result, Lamb's proposal was described by the companies as unnecessary. [Amazon, amid pressure from an investor, reports virtually no gender pay gap] In an emailed statement, Citigroup spokesman Mark Costiglio added that "we have had productive discussions with Arjuna Capital on their proposal and look forward to continued engagement on this issue." JPMorgan has not yet released its proxy, and a spokesman declined to comment, though Lamb said she expects the company to oppose the proposal, pending further dialogue. A spokesman from MasterCard, which also hasn't released its proxy, said in an emailed statement that it would be premature to comment on the resolution but that the company "strive[s] to ensure gender pay parity. We regularly examine pay practices and, at our company, both in the U.S. and globally, men and women in the same level earn equal pay for equal performance." Arjuna is not the only investor to propose votes about the gender pay gap this year; investors Pax World and Zevin Asset Management have also filed proposals, though some have been withdrawn after dialogue with companies. How bank investors will vote on the measure won't be clear until companies hold their annual meetings in the coming weeks. Votes for "social" resolutions like these are typically low -- last year, just 5 percent of investors voted in favor of a gender pay gap proposal from Trillium Asset Management. But Lamb says her proposal is not as "prescriptive" as the one at Citigroup last year, and believes her success at eBay shows there may be more interest in the topic. Being transparent, Lamb believes, "is in the enlightened best interest of these companies." As investors become more and more attuned to the data linking diversity and financial returns, it's become clearer "this is not a niche issue. It's a mainstream investor issue, and that's because there's a business case to support it." Read also: The gender pay gap isn't just unfair.

The purchases, made on Tuesday and Wednesday, were largely for tenors maturing in 2021-2023, said traders who asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly. JPMorgan Chase & Co. was the broker which bought the securities, they added. Foreign funds have been pouring into India, driving stocks to a record and pushing up bond prices, since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party won an election in a key state on March 11. Yields on local 10-year bonds are among the highest in the region and the rupee’s rally post the election results has made it Asia’s best-performing currency this month. “The outcome of state elections, a dovish hike by the Federal Reserve and relatively attractive valuations have been the key drivers of inflows,” said Nagaraj Kulkarni, a senior rates strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. Overseas banks were the biggest buyers of government bonds on Wednesday, with net purchases of about 54 billion rupees, data from the Clearing Corp. of India show. That marked an 11th straight day of net buying. Franklin Templeton’s Singapore-based spokeswoman Melissa Tan and JPMorgan’s India spokeswoman Mollica Senapati in Mumbai both declined to comment. The yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds slipped eight basis points in the last two sessions. It rose one basis point to 6.82 per cent as of 12:29 p.m. in Mumbai, reversing an earlier decline, after a report said authorities are set to discuss putting in place a new facility to absorb surplus cash in the banking system. Indian lenders, the biggest holders of sovereign debt, typically use excess funds to buy bonds. Modi’s majority win in Uttar Pradesh, India’s biggest state, is seen emboldening him to take more measures to spur expansion in Asia’s third-largest economy, which already boasts one of the fastest growth rates among the world’s major countries. The rupee was little changed at 65.4325 per dollar in Mumbai. Its 1.9 per cent advance this month is the best performance in Asia.

The public version needs significant upgrades to be able to handle anything like the volume of interactions on the internet today. Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 By Matthew Leising In late February about 200 executives, coders, and developers gathered in the downtown Brooklyn office of JPMorgan Chase & Co. to hear an all-day pitch for a new industry group called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. It's the ghostly sounding name for a so-called blockchain technology similar to the one that made the digital currency bitcoin possible. Its inventor, Vitalik Buterin, released his software to the world in 2015, not long after dropping out of the University of Waterloo, in Canada. Less than two years later, JPMorgan, BP, Microsoft, International Business Machines, and ING are among the companies in the group experimenting with it. Buterin didn't attend the EEA meeting, but he had a video message to deliver. Except the EEA couldn't get the video to play, because the computer hosting it crashed. As the crowd began to stir, a frozen frame of Buterin’s face came on-screen, then he disappeared. After the tech crew scrambled for 30 minutes, they finally got it to work. It's an apt metaphor for a technology that’s come with enormous promises but suffered setbacks almost from its inception. Last year, hackers stole $60 million worth of ether, the digital currency linked to Ethereum. The heist was a huge black eye—chances are, if you've heard about Ethereum, it’s because of the hack. And yet it isn't dead. The reason: Unlike bitcoin, this blockchain isn't really about currency. Its advocates think it could be a universally accessible machine for running businesses. "Ethereum gives you a new way for the computer to interact with the real world and how money moves," says Emin Gun Sirer, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University. “It’s potentially a huge game changer whose value has yet to be tapped." To understand what the excitement is about, it helps to start with bitcoin, because without it, there would be no blockchain. Previous attempts to create digital money that could be sent as easily as email ran into a problem: How do you guarantee that each virtual dollar is unique, so the sender can't spend the same cash more than once? For bitcoin, this is solved with blockchain, which is simply an online ledger book that's distributed on computers around the world. It tracks and verifies every use of bitcoin. To give people an incentive to maintain the blockchain on their machine, it awards a number of new bitcoins to the first computer to verify a transaction. It's like a banking system that runs itself—but its main use is just letting people move currency from point A to point B. Ethereum's ledger does more. It can store fully functioning computer programs called smart contracts: If person A performs job B for company C, it will trigger a payment of D back to A?...?and so on. As with bitcoin, the ether currency is a lure to get people to lend the system their computing power, and you need it to participate in a contract. Think of Ethereum itself as a way for people to make agreements and automate enforcement, all on a distributed network of computers. Once you can create contracts—which in essence are just operating procedures—you can use them to manage almost any kind of enterprise or organization. For example, John Hancock Financial is experimenting with a tailored version of Ethereum to keep track of compliance with know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering regulations in its wealth management unit. Airline industry giant Airbus SE wants to know if its supply chain management can be shifted to a blockchain. Like David Hasselhoff, Ethereum is popular in Germany: Power producer RWE AG and online bank Fidor Bank are investigating ways to integrate it into their businesses. The 2016 ether theft showed that though Ethereum may be powerful, it's still new and prone to mishaps. One of the first things people used ether for was to invest in a kind of decentralized venture capital fund built with an Ethereum smart contract. Investors could vote on how the fund's ether would be used; hackers found a bug in the contract that forced the fund to funnel its ether to them. After much consternation, there was a vote in the Ethereum community, supported by Buterin, to edit the blockchain’s transaction history so it appeared as if the hack had never occurred. Blockchain purists were so enraged at the idea of fiddling with the ledger, they began supporting an alternative form of Ethereum, which they took to calling Ethereum classic. Buterin is unapologetic. "In general, the Ethereum community is on board with the notion that we do not have to do things exactly the way that things are done in other crypto communities," he says. "I did not create Ethereum to let hackers get away with $60 million." This is the stuff of passionate debates on Reddit forums, but it may not matter to corporate users, because many of them don't want to work on the fully public Ethereum blockchain anyway. JPMorgan just released a version of Ethereum known as Quorum. Developers around the world can work with it, but only companies invited to participate will be able to record transactions and contracts on it. The Airbus blockchain would be similarly walled off. These blockchains would run alongside the main version of Ethereum, which anyone can use. "We've built an unstoppable, uncensorable world computer," says Joe Lubin, founder of ConsenSys, a Brooklyn company that develops blockchain applications, speaking of Ethereum. Andrew Keys, head of global business development for the company, still sees the technology as a grass-roots tool for cutting out intermediaries of all kinds—from law firms to online social networks. "Our digital identity is on Facebook, and Mark's getting paid," he says, referring to Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. "Instead of them housing that, we'll have self-sovereign identity with peer-to-peer transactions." In other words, instead of using Facebook to control who can and can’t see their family photos, people could one day set the rules themselves using smart contracts. Ethereum is still a long way from that kind of success in either its public or private forms. The public version needs significant upgrades to be able to handle anything like the volume of interactions on the internet today. Ethereum's leaders, in their response to the hack, offended a substantial part of the blockchain development and programming community, which isn't that big. On the business side, corporations have to be convinced that they won't be giving away trade secrets through their use of a ledger shared with other companies. At the same time, they'll need to keep the technology open enough so that anyone can put their ideas into the same Ethereum ecosystem. "I don't want to build AOL," says Amber Baldet, blockchain program lead for JPMorgan. "I want to build the World Wide Web." The bottom line: Ethereum could present a whole new way to run a business, but there are some serious kinks to work out. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Walking away with no regime for 230 billion pounds ($287 billion) of annual exports to the bloc and the 3.3 million Europeans in the U.K would be “perfectly OK,” says Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Not “frightening” at all, says Brexit czar David Davis. But analysts are painting an entirely different picture of an outcome they view as increasingly plausible: U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May balking at the EU’s demands or giving up on getting the sweeping trade accord she wants. And a collapse in the two-year talks, which May is set to trigger next week, would unleash costs and regulations that stand to damage Britain far more than the EU. “A deal will take a lot more time, goodwill and tact than has been on display from either side,” said Anand Menon, director of The U.K. in a Changing Europe research group, who sees a 50 percent chance of there being no deal on March 29, 2019. “I find it very hard to see how May gets all she wants.” An official in May’s government puts the chance of the talk collapsing at about 30 percent. EU negotiator Michel Barnier this week said the bloc should ready to deal with the “serious consequences” of a breakdown, such as longer queues at borders to how to handle transportation of nuclear materials. Uncharted Territory If May does walk away, then the U.K. would truly be in uncharted territory. Based on interviews and published analysis, here’s a rough map of what might happen should Britain spin out of the EU without a safety net. Even before May delivers an emergency statement to the House of Commons to explain the failure, financial markets would have already priced in the ramifications. Jordan Rochester, a London-based strategist at Nomura International Plc, predicts the pound would slump towards $1.15, extending its post-referendum slump to almost a quarter. The day in 2013 when David Cameron announced his intention to call a referendum sterling was at $1.58. Companies, meantime, would activate plans for the tumble over what they’ve long described as a “cliff edge” of uncertainty. Absent a deal, the U.K. would surrender tariff-free or friction-less trade with the EU’s 440 million consumers and any hope of a transitional phase to adjust. For manufacturers, World Trade Organization tariffs averaging about 5 percent -- and twice that for cars produced by the likes of Ford Motor Co. -- would be immediately imposed on trade with the EU, the market for 44 percent of Britain’s overseas sales. Farmers could face duties of around 40 percent and most industries would suffer higher import costs if Britain imposed its own tariffs on trade from the EU. That would reduce trade by about 30 percent, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Oxford Economics Ltd. estimates gross domestic product would be 3.9 percent smaller by 2030 or 96 billion pounds in inflation-adjusted terms. At ports, border checks would impede commerce further; the likes of BAE Systems Plc to J Sainsbury Plc might struggle to get timely delivery from the continent to keep assembly lines humming and supermarket shelves stacked. Then there’s the City of London -- a global hub of finance and the gateway for capital to and from Europe. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other banks that had hoped to keep servicing the bloc from London would likely accelerate the shift of jobs and operations into the EU or to New York. The consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimated that in a worst-case scenario, 70,000 financial-services jobs would be lost. ‘Day One’ “On day one, JPMorgan has to be able to conduct business with our clients in Europe,” Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg this month. The French or Germans would, without delay, repatriate control of the clearing of euro derivatives and credit-rating companies with bases in London would lose their authority to police continental companies. Xavier Rolet, CEO of London Stock Exchange Group Plc, has said 232,000 jobs could eventually be lost from the U.K. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up No deal would also further punish industries likely to be hamstrung by Brexit. Airlines such as EasyJet Plc might see their access to the continent cut off unless they relocate headquarters or sell more shares to investors in the region to satisfy regulators. The hospitality and agriculture sectors already face a struggle to get the workers they need as do pharmaceutical firms like AstraZeneca Plc, which would also have to deal with the loss of the European Medicines Agency from London. The hardest of Brexits would also risk the imposition of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic and embolden Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s push for a second independence referendum. This week’s terrorist attack on London also underscored the importance of continental security relationships, which could be jeopardized. For May, the threat to walk away is a basic negotiating tactic if the U.K. is to avoid being punished by the EU. “No deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain,” she said in January, adding it would be an “act of calamitous self harm” for Europe to try to retaliate against the nation for its desire to leave. British Bet May’s bullishness reflects the bet that Britain’s Blitz spirit would carry it through. She herself has held out the prospect of slashing corporate taxes to lure businesses and investment. Released of the EU’s constraints, the U.K would also count on free-trade deals from China to the U.S. If the talks do blow up, the most likely detonator is the demand that Britain must pay to leave. The EU’s need to prevent other breakaway efforts requires a cost be imposed on Britain -- a settling of accounts, in the view from Brussels. “We have to calculate scientifically what the British commitments were and then the bill has to be paid,” European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told the BBC Friday. Asked if the bill will be 50 billion pounds, Juncker replied: “It’s around that.” U.K. Trade Secretary Liam Fox has described such a fee as “absurd.” Some in government have questioned its legality; the EU could force the issue before the International Court of Justice. Brexit campaigners back home would also balk at paying too much. Money Talk While May wants to discuss divorce and a new trade deal at the same time, EU officials say they won’t even engage on commerce until the matter of the money is settled. "The EU recognizes it has huge leverage and is ready to use it,” said Gregor Irwin, chief economist at Global Counsel, a consulting firm. "There is a risk of the negotiations unraveling because you’re never quite sure how much it all means to the other side. If you push too far and it turns out they weren’t bluffing you end up with no deal." Even if a bill is paid, things don’t get any easier. While willing to give up membership of the single market for goods and services to regain control of immigration and lawmaking, May wants to win as much trade free of tariffs and bureaucracy as she can. That smacks of “cherry picking” to some in the region and if the EU balks, May could again walk. She will also know the risk of a poor trade deal would leave her prone to attack from the anti-Brexit lobby at home. Talks might ultimately need to break down for progress to be made, according to Oliver Harvey, a strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. In that event, May would call an election aimed at winning a mandate to strike a deal some in her own ruling Conservative Party won’t like. “The U.K. will eventually compromise,” said Harvey. “But this will depend on a weakening economy and market pressure, with a full cliff-edge Brexit likely to be fully priced in at some point in the next two years.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc said on Wednesday they would suspend digital ads on YouTube, joining a list of well-known British brands such as retailer Marks and Spencer Group Plc that are deserting Alphabet Inc’s Google. Google has come under intense scrutiny for ads appearing alongside videos on YouTube carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages. The company vowed an overhaul of its practices and said on Wednesday it has started an extensive review of its advertising policies. Shares of Google parent Alphabet ended down 1.2 per cent, or US$10.15 (RM 44.95) per share, at US$839.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. Control over online ad placement has become a hot-button issue for advertisers, with social networks and news aggregators coming under fire during and after the US presidential election for spreading fake news reports. Advertisers have also sought to avoid having their brands appear beside content that they categorize as hate speech. J&J said yesterday it wanted to ensure that its product advertising did not appear on channels that promote “offensive content.” JPMorgan, the biggest US bank by assets and the biggest issuer of general purpose credit cards, suspended all of its ads from YouTube yesterday, according to spokeswoman Trish Wexler. The bank spends about US$3 billion on marketing each year. YouTube has been a key driver of growth for Google as its traditional business of search advertising matures. Google’s net ad revenue worldwide from YouTube was US$5.58 billion last year, according to New York-based research firm eMarketer. While major brands suspending advertising on YouTube is a public relations pain for Google, the suspensions do not affect Google’s biggest ad product, search. According to eMarketer, Google’s 2017 global ad revenue is projected to be US$73.75 billion, grabbing 62 per cent of the US$99.62-billion search market. Search accounts for 83 per cent of Google’s overall ad revenue. The financial hit is also less certain because digital platforms tend to collect the bulk of their revenue from small-to-medium sized companies who cannot afford to buy on TV. “Digital dependence on the long-tail of advertising clients means that while major advertisers like P&G or agencies like Havas can publicly protest, they do not have the same impact on a Google or a Facebook as they have on a CBS or NBC,” analysts at MoffettNathanson wrote yesterday. “In other words, if a major brand marketer or agency moves money to TV and out of digital, the TV industry will see the benefit whereas the digital industry might not truly feel it.” — Reuters                 MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week China slinging salmon on the Internet lures Norway seafood fund Oil producers call to roll over output cuts beyond June American Air in negotiations to purchase stake in China Southern Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Jack Ma: DFTZ will be a Malaysian-run business China capital controls leave buyers of foreign property in bind (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles AT&T, Verizon join Google ad boycott Google apologises to ad clients for YouTube content fiasco Johnson & Johnson wins trial in talc product liability lawsuits Source: Saudi Aramco taps JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley for IPO, HSBC a contender Facebook tunes trending topics to better deliver news Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Primary sources. Global perspective. advertisement UK Supreme Court rejects JPMorgan executive's wrongful identification claim Thursday 23 March 2017 at 1:34 PM ET by Rachel Gerber ©  WikiMedia (Diliff) [JURIST] The UK Supreme Court [official website] ruled [judgment, PDF] on Wednesday that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) [official website] did not misidentify former JPMorgan official Achilles Macris in its penalty notice in connection with the "London Whale" Scandal. The FCA agreed that a conclusion that Macris was prejudiced would be justified if Macris was in fact identified in the warning and the penalty notices were served on JPMorgan. However, the FCA rejected the claim that Macris was identified. Lord Sumption, writing for the majority, while acknowledging that the meaning of the word "identifies" is not elaborated, stated: "it is clear from the language that it is the reasons contained in the notice which must identify the third party and not some extrinsic source." Sumption added: Once the facts relating to one person or firm under investigation are ascertained or admitted and are found to justify criticism or sanctions, there will often be no proper reasons for withholding that information from the market. Yet there will almost always be people in the know, who will realise when they read the notices which individuals are encompassed by apparently anodyne collective expressions such as "management" or who is likely to have been responsible for particular failings of the firm. ... Even for those who are further from the scene, the internet is a fertile source of information and gossip for those who are willing to go to some trouble to discover his identity.Macris expressed his disappointment [Reuters report] with the decision and stated that the FCA won the case on a mere technicality. Legal commentators pointed out that the decision "will do little to check the perceived tendency on the part of the regulator and firms to reach swift settlements ... at the expense of procedural rights for individuals caught up in regulatory investigations." The "London Whale" scandal [Bloomberg Backgrounder] began in 2012 when a trader, Bruno Iksil, known as the London Whale, caused losses amounting to USD $6.2 billion while at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Macris is just the latest in a long line of litigation on this case. Multiple traders for JPMorgan have been indicted and convicted for hiding trading losses and fraud [Financial Post reports]. Iksil's case was dismissed by JPMorgan but Ikshil has faced no enforcement action [Business Insider UK report].

Ethereum? It’s the ghostly sounding name for a so-called blockchain technology similar to the one that made the digital currency bitcoin possible. Its inventor, Vitalik Buterin, released his software to the world in 2015, not long after dropping out of the University of Waterloo, in Canada. Less than two years later, JPMorgan, BP, Microsoft, International Business Machines, and ING are among the companies in the group experimenting with it. Buterin didn’t attend the EEA meeting, but he had a video message to deliver. Except the EEA couldn’t get the video to play, because the computer hosting it crashed. As the crowd began to stir, a frozen frame of Buterin’s face came on-screen, then he disappeared. After the tech crew scrambled for 30 minutes, they finally got it to work. It’s an apt metaphor for a technology that’s come with enormous promises but suffered setbacks almost from its inception. Last year, hackers stole $60 million worth of ether, the digital currency linked to Ethereum. The heist was a huge black eye—chances are, if you’ve heard about Ethereum, it’s because of the hack. And yet it isn’t dead. The reason: Unlike bitcoin, this blockchain isn’t really about currency. Its advocates think it could be a universally accessible machine for running businesses. “Ethereum gives you a new way for the computer to interact with the real world and how money moves,” says Emin Gun Sirer, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University. “It’s potentially a huge game changer whose value has yet to be tapped.” Think of Ethereum as a way for people to make agreements and automate enforcement To understand what the excitement is about, it helps to start with bitcoin, because without it, there would be no blockchain. Previous attempts to create digital money that could be sent as easily as email ran into a problem: How do you guarantee that each virtual dollar is unique, so the sender can’t spend the same cash more than once? For bitcoin, this is solved with blockchain, which is simply an online ledger book that’s distributed on computers around the world. It tracks and verifies every use of bitcoin. To give people an incentive to maintain the blockchain on their machine, it awards a number of new bitcoins to the first computer to verify a transaction. It’s like a banking system that runs itself—but its main use is just letting people move currency from point A to point B. Ethereum’s ledger does more. It can store fully functioning computer programs called smart contracts: If person A performs job B for company C, it will trigger a payment of D back to A … and so on. As with bitcoin, the ether currency is a lure to get people to lend the system their computing power, and you need it to participate in a contract. Think of Ethereum itself as a way for people to make agreements and automate enforcement, all on a distributed network of computers. Once you can create contracts—which in essence are just operating procedures—you can use them to manage almost any kind of enterprise or organization. For example, John Hancock Financial is experimenting with a tailored version of Ethereum to keep track of compliance with know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering regulations in its wealth management unit. Airline industry giant Airbus SE wants to know if its supply chain management can be shifted to a blockchain. Like David Hasselhoff, Ethereum is popular in Germany: Power producer RWE AG and online bank Fidor Bank are investigating ways to integrate it into their businesses. The 2016 ether theft showed that though Ethereum may be powerful, it’s still new and prone to mishaps. One of the first things people used ether for was to invest in a kind of decentralized venture capital fund built with an Ethereum smart contract. Investors could vote on how the fund’s ether would be used; hackers found a bug in the contract that forced the fund to funnel its ether to them. After much consternation, there was a vote in the Ethereum community, supported by Buterin, to edit the blockchain’s transaction history so it appeared as if the hack had never occurred. Blockchain purists were so enraged at the idea of fiddling with the ledger, they began supporting an alternative form of Ethereum, which they took to calling Ethereum classic. Buterin is unapologetic. “In general, the Ethereum community is on board with the notion that we do not have to do things exactly the way that things are done in other crypto communities,” he says. “I did not create Ethereum to let hackers get away with $60 million.” This is the stuff of passionate debates on Reddit forums, but it may not matter to corporate users, because many of them don’t want to work on the fully public Ethereum blockchain anyway. JPMorgan just released a version of Ethereum known as Quorum. Developers around the world can work with it, but only companies invited to participate will be able to record transactions and contracts on it. The Airbus blockchain would be similarly walled off. These blockchains would run alongside the main version of Ethereum, which anyone can use. “We’ve built an unstoppable, uncensorable world computer,” says Joe Lubin, founder of ConsenSys, a Brooklyn company that develops blockchain applications, speaking of Ethereum. Andrew Keys, head of global business development for the company, still sees the technology as a grass-roots tool for cutting out intermediaries of all kinds—from law firms to online social networks. “Our digital identity is on Facebook, and Mark’s getting paid,” he says, referring to Facebook Inc. co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. “Instead of them housing that, we’ll have self-sovereign identity with peer-to-peer transactions.” In other words, instead of using Facebook to control who can and can’t see their family photos, people could one day set the rules themselves using smart contracts. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Ethereum is still a long way from that kind of success in either its public or private forms. The public version needs significant upgrades to be able to handle anything like the volume of interactions on the internet today. Ethereum’s leaders, in their response to the hack, offended a substantial part of the blockchain development and programming community, which isn’t that big. On the business side, corporations have to be convinced that they won’t be giving away trade secrets through their use of a ledger shared with other companies. At the same time, they’ll need to keep the technology open enough so that anyone can put their ideas into the same Ethereum ecosystem. “I don’t want to build AOL,” says Amber Baldet, blockchain program lead for JPMorgan. “I want to build the World Wide Web.” The bottom line: Ethereum could present a whole new way to run a business, but there are some serious kinks to work out. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(JPM) Stock Even at these levels, go long JPM for free and with room for error By Nicolas Chahine, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 21, 2017, 10:18 am EDT     Popular Posts: Let Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Short Itself for You Grab Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock for Free Profits!

(AMZN) Stock View All Posts The rally in banks that started in 2016 has been awe inspiring. So it’s no surprise that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stock also ran 60% from low to high in a year. Fundamentally, a rally of this magnitude usually is a result of severe mispricing from Wall Street. Source: via Wikimedia To be fair to analysts, there were also outside factors keeping a lid on all financial stocks. A decade ago we got the mother of all financial debacles which brought banks to their knees. Then the Fed took rates to zero thereby greatly impacting bank P&L’s. Then the regulatory hammer came crashing down on the financial institutions that survived. Click to Enlarge In 2016 the two major anchors weighing down banks were cut loose. Donald Trump won the election and promised to slash regulations. And, the Federal Reserve resumed its rate hike cycle. Both of these offer great upside potential to banks’ financial performance. Wall Street quickly priced in the benefit and perhaps too fast. This could have caused an overshoot situation. So is it too late to go long JPM stock at these altitudes? No. But instead of risking $90 per share buying JP Morgan, I will use options. There I can design trades that allow room for error. JP Morgan is often considered as the cream of the crop, so I will leverage that fact to generate income. JPM Stock Trading Advice The Bet: Sell the JPM Dec $70 naked put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.50 or better per contract to open. In return, I commit to buying JPM shares at $70 even if they fall below it. This would constitute a 20% discount from current levels. Since I would be open to losses below that, I only risk money I can afford to lose. Usually I like to sell opposing risk to balance my trade. In this case, I am willing to risk leaving the risk un-hedged. I feel that the time-until-expiration is long enough that I will be able to manage around short term price moves. I could opt to buy a few shorter-dated puts to hedge me against a potential downfall. Learn options as easy as 1-2-3 here. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

According to a new survey, the nonresidential construction sector expects business to grow, based on promises of big infrastructure spending. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) NEW YORK—Optimism within the nation’s business world is soaring—reaching its highest levels in years. Yet recovery from the 2008 financial crisis has been weaker than expected, with slow GDP growth. So what is making business owners so confident? The answer is a heady combination of positive economic indicators that were already in motion at the end of last year, coupled with many business-friendly promises from the new president—including tax reform, regulatory relief, a new health care regime, and more infrastructure spending. Although President Donald Trump hasn’t had time to show if he can deliver on those promises, confidence is certainly in the air. * According to JPMorgan Chase’s annual survey of business leaders, 76 percent of midsized company executives believe the new administration will have a positive impact on the economy and their businesses. The survey of 1,400 respondents closed the day of Trump’s inauguration. “Optimism is at its highest level—and pessimism is at its lowest level—over the past 7 years,” states the report. Small businesses are even more positive. In January and February, small business optimism reached its highest level in 43 years, according to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). “It is clear from our data that optimism skyrocketed after the election because small-business owners anticipated a change in policy,” stated NFIB President and CEO Juanita Duggan, in a report.

Trump promised to boost manufacturing and protect U.S. jobs during his visit to the plant. (Sean Rayford/Getty Images) Strong job growth over the last few months is bolstering the trend. Employment increased by 235,000 in February, alongside a moderate increase in wage growth, which contributes to higher confidence in future consumer spending. Jay Timmons, CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, commented in a statement on the February job numbers: “Today’s news is another strong indicator of the ‘Trump bump’ of positive economic activity. Across America, manufacturers’ confidence is high, and business optimism continues to soar, because of President Donald Trump’s laser focus on policies that will accelerate a jobs surge in America.” Small Business Looking Up Increasing optimism among Main Street small businesses could be an important signal for economic growth in 2017, as many of them have been struggling to survive since the Great Recession. Beth Goldberg, New York district director, U.S. Small Business Administration. Small business lending is up 8.5 percent in the first five months of this fiscal year compared to the previous year, said Beth Goldberg, district director of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) in New York. “Those loans have supported the creation and retention of 5,500 jobs” in New York City, she said. Businesses are using the financing to hire more people, purchase inventory, and invest in equipment with an eye to the future. Optimism in the construction sector is also growing, according to a recent survey by Wells Fargo. Especially in nonresidential construction, industry executives expect growth driven by Trump’s higher infrastructure spending and increased company profits. William Diaz, owner, ESC Cabling. “I have not seen a direct increase [in business] as of yet. But I am sure it will increase. I hear a lot of investment opportunities going on, which means a year from now there will be more projects,” said William Diaz, owner of ESC Cabling, a New York specialty contractor that designs and installs cabling systems and networks for construction projects. “Typically, when the big businesses get busy, they cannot bid on the small projects, so they allow the specialty contractors to do the work. Right now, I am bidding for a job that I probably would not even have the chance to bid [on a year ago]. I am on a short list. I have a good chance of winning,” Diaz said. He invested in equipment worth $15,000 to $20,000 to prepare for new construction work he expects to start rolling in. Massage therapist Rachel Beider at her studio in New York on March 20. Beider employs 48 therapists and plans to hire more. (Benjamin Chasteen/Epoch Times) Rachel Beider, a massage therapist and owner of two clinical massage therapy studios in Brooklyn, also began the year with a more positive outlook. Her business started booming after the election. “We did see an increase [in business] after the election. And after the inauguration, we had a very large increase in clients, and we have started to see them more frequently,” Beider said. She employs 48 massage therapists and plans to hire four more. “Last year, we averaged 50 new clients a week. This year, we are averaging 70 new clients,” she said. Beider is confident she will break $1 million in sales this year. Easy Access to Capital The optimistic climate is also driven by easy access to capital thanks to lower interest rates in recent years and more creative financing options from financial technology (fintech) firms. Bryan Doxford, senior vice president, New York Business Development Corp. “We do see a lot of businesses thriving generally because of abundance or availability of capital,” said Bryan Doxford, senior vice president at New York Business Development Corporation, which provides loans to small businesses. Many online lenders popped up in recent years, ranging from merchant cash advance providers to services from companies like PayPal and Amazon. * “A lot of businesses are finding it easy because capital underwriting criteria are pretty loose for many of these lenders. Oftentimes, underwriting criteria are just based on the company’s average daily balance—how much money they have in the bank,” he said. Doxford, however, is worried about the easy access to cash, since the online lending space is not regulated and some of these lenders are predatory. “The interest rates that we tend to see on some of these online lenders are 30 to 40 percent,” he said. Not all sectors see a bright future, however. Some retailers and restaurants are struggling with disruptive changes from big companies like Amazon, which is growing its food delivery service. The S&P Retail Select Industry index is down 13 percent since it peaked in December last year. Restaurant business has tumbled in recent months, with store sales and traffic levels down for the four consecutive months through January, according to the National Restaurant Association. Real Estate Honeymoon Is Back For Bond Street Partners, a luxury real estate team based in Los Angeles, 2017 is already proving to be their best year to date, with over $200 million in sales in the first three months. James Harris, partner, Bond Street Partners. “There was an uncertainty leading up to the election in how the real estate market would be affected. However, we saw a definite increase in the luxury market at the end of the year that is still continuing,” said James Harris, partner at Bond Street. Founded in 2011, the real estate team is positioned to break national sales records this year. Aleksandra Scepanovic, co-founder and managing director, Ideal Properties Group New York brokers are reporting the same trend. “We are definitely noticing business optimism on the rise. Whether it is attributable to the recent election or the weather change, there is an increased interest across the board,” said Aleksandra Scepanovic, co-founder and managing director of Ideal Properties Group, a real estate firm in Brooklyn. Activity, especially in commercial real estate leasing, picked up after the inauguration, she said. Businesses hunting for space in Brooklyn are coffee shops, cafes, health and wellness centers, and gyms, according to Scepanovic. And demand from movie production studios and shared office spaces is also on the rise, she said. Banks Are Thriving After years of underperforming, banking sector stocks rallied on the prospect of a strong economy and deregulation. The KBW Index, which serves as a banking industry benchmark, has climbed 20 percent since the election. Related Coverage The Great IPO Comeback of 2017 The banks, especially small and midsized ones that depend on the interest rate spread, will thrive on the expected interest rate hikes this year. Also, these banks are optimistic about changes Trump plans to make to the Dodd-Frank Act—legislation regulating banks passed by the Obama administration in 2010. Smaller banks have suffered much more than the larger ones from the law’s increased regulatory costs. Many went out of business. Community banks play a critical role in the development of small businesses. Luvleen Sidhu, president, BankMobile. Luvleen Sidhu, president of BankMobile, a startup that provides fee-free banking services, says deregulation is the main reason people are excited about Trump. “It provides banks with more opportunity going forward to be innovative and to continue to disrupt the space that is quite antiquated and partly being held back by regulators,” she said. Sidhu believes there will be many changes in the financial services sector under the Trump administration. Many fintech companies will have to form partnerships or merge with traditional banks, she said. BankMobile, a division of Customers Bank, was recently sold to Florida-based Flagship Community Bank. Bringing Back Manufacturing Jobs The manufacturing sector added 28,000 jobs in February and 57,000 jobs over the past three months, according to Labor Department statistics. Elise Gould, senior economist, Economic Policy Institute. Not all of that can be attributed to Trump, though, says Elise Gould, senior economist at Economic Policy Institute, which focuses on conditions for low- and middle-income families. “I am optimistic that the economy will continue to recover. … But it is also important to remember that the economy President Trump inherited was pretty strong,” said Gould. Nonetheless, the signs are good. “As employment continues at the rate it is now, more people will be pulled into the labor market. And eventually, unemployment rate will keep falling,” she said. Scott Paul, president, Alliance for American Manufacturing. Scott Paul, president of the nonprofit Alliance for American Manufacturing, says there is a guarded sense of optimism among manufacturers. “I think it’s hard to tell whether this is an upswing in both overall job creation and manufacturing,” he said. “But one thing that is pretty clear is that businesses and markets do seem more optimistic about what the future holds.” Manufacturers in some sectors are especially hopeful about Trump’s proposed tariff and trade policies. Those in direct import competition with China, such as steel, aluminum, semiconductor, and other commodity manufacturers, feel they will be better off, said Paul.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) “In the steel sector in particular, over the last two years, there have been about 15,000 layoffs. The fact that some workers are returning to their jobs is certainly good news,” he said. But not all is rosy, according to labor unions. Rexnord Corp. announced in December that it would close its plant in Indianapolis and move 300 union jobs to Mexico. The plant, which produces bearings, is close to the Carrier facility where Trump claimed credit for saving jobs the same month. Chuck Jones, president, United Steelworkers Local 1999. Workers are making $20 per hour in Rexnord’s Indianapolis plant, said Chuck Jones, president of United Steelworkers Local 1999. “We can’t compete with $3 an hour wages in Mexico,” he said. Jones was criticized by Trump on Twitter in December, after he blamed the president for misrepresenting the saved job numbers. “Maybe throughout the country, there’s a reason for optimism, but we don’t see it in Indianapolis,” Jones said. For Scott Paul, it remains to be seen if Trump can actually deliver on his promises, hence the business optimism may be premature. “I’m not certain how Congress and the administration will reach a broad agreement on some of these issues. They might, but I don’t think any of these will be particularly easy.” Macroeconomic Signs Boost Confidence For the first time since the financial crisis, signs of positive economic growth are broadly based. The Federal Reserve gave its vote of confidence on the global economy by raising interest rates this month. The Fed also laid the groundwork for two more rate increases this year, a sign that the central bank expects continued economic improvement. There are many economic indicators pointing upward. The gain of 235,000 jobs in February soared past Wall Street expectations and dropped the official unemployment rate to 4.7 percent. More importantly, hourly salaries and wages grew 2.8 percent year over year. The Consumer Price Index, a benchmark for inflation, gained 0.1 percent in February—a solid increase that was otherwise muted by a 1 percent decline in national gasoline prices. Small business optimism skyrocketed after the election reaching, its highest levels in 43 years, according to the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index. Leading economic indicators are also up. The ISM manufacturing index, which tracks U.S. aggregate manufacturing activity, rose to 57.7 in February from 56.0, exceeding analyst expectations. Increased manufacturing activity signals that producers expect a higher volume of orders and future sales. Despite expected interest rate hikes, housing starts—another precursor to economic expansion—increased 3.0 percent in February to an annual rate of 1.29 million units, the strongest reading in four months. The U.S. economy added 235,000 jobs in February, while the official unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent—levels not seen since 2007. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates a GDP growth rate of 0.9 percent for the first quarter, according to the bank’s March 16 GDPNow model. Economic optimism isn’t just confined to the United States. Global GDP grew 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter 2016. For the first quarter of 2017, moderate GDP growth is expected in the United States, the Eurozone, and Japan. Then there’s the stock market. The S&P 500 Index has added 9 percent since the election and 5 percent since Jan. 1. Equity investors have cheered Trump’s business-friendly promises to cut regulation and corporate taxes and to increase infrastructure spending. Corporate earnings have also turned around. Companies within the S&P 500 reported a 4.9 percent average increase in fourth quarter 2016 earnings. It was the first time the S&P has seen earnings growth in back-to-back quarters since early 2015, according to FactSet. Sixty-five percent of S&P 500 companies also beat their mean earnings-per-share estimates. While it’s true that earnings have been boosted in recent years from cost cuts and stock buybacks, today’s lean corporations are well-positioned to further augment economic and wage growth if demand picks up. Related Coverage Innovation Key to Job Growth in America After Decades of Chinese Imports, How to Revive American Manufacturing? But there are uncertainties too that could dent investor enthusiasm. The ongoing debate in Congress surrounding the overhaul of the Affordable Care Act could drag on in 2017, potentially delaying implementation of other policy proposals—such as tax reform and infrastructure spending—to 2018. A material delay could drain political capital for policy change, especially as midterm elections approach. There’s also uncertainty about the effects of Trump’s tax plan, specifically the border tax that pits importers against exporters. “Without revenues from the border adjustment tax, corporate tax rate cuts are likely to be less aggressive than envisioned during the campaign,” wrote Ulrik Bie, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, in a recent analysis. Much of the recent stock market run-up has been driven by hope related to Trump’s tax reform, but final details could differ from those fueling initial investor optimism. Despite the bounty of positive economic indicators, for now the recent uptick in optimism remains just that—optimism. While businesses gear up for increased production, consumers feel more confident, and the Fed believes rate hikes are justified, it remains to be seen whether optimism will translate into real economic expansion on the ground.

Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International, the Houston investment bank, on Wednesday slashed its 2018 forecast for the dominant North American crude, West Texas Intermediate, by 13 percent to $65 a barrel. The reason: They see U.S. output rising by 1.2 million barrels a day in that time, 50 percent more than in an earlier forecast. That level of increase, layered on top of uncertainty over how long OPEC will hold to its deal to cut production, has since Jan. 3 shaved about $8 off the price of the global benchmark, Brent. The question now: Is there room ahead for such growth, or is the market on a slippery slope? "There’s just too much oil out there," said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts, in a telephone interview. "We keep being told the market will rebalance and we’re not seeing any evidence. It’s hard to maintain a bullish posture here." For the second half of 2017, Tudor reduced its price estimate by $10 to $62.50. It isn’t alone in its reassessment. JPMorgan Chase & Co. revised its U.S. price forecast downward for the second half of 2017 to $53.75 and Brent to $55.75, anticipating both will drop by another 25 cents in 2018. The analyst, David Martin, didn’t disclose his previous price forecasts. The half-decade span of 2010-2014, when oil averaged more than $100 a barrel, spurred oil companies to embark on some of the riskiest, costliest exploration ventures in the history of the petroleum industry in search of new barrels. The subsequent flood of supply -- and its negative impact on prices -- shows little sign of receding. Long-Term Outlook “Super-high oil prices financed the oil industry to seek new supply,” Paul Sankey, senior oil and gas analyst at Wolfe Research LLC, said in a note to clients. “The industry has responded aggressively, so that the long-term outlook for oil prices is lower.” Still, analysts remain relatively positive in their comments. Martin, at JPMorgan, said he remains “tactically bullish” for the next two quarters, despite “less ambitious” price expectations, according to a March 20 report. The recent decline in prices presents an “excellent opportunity to buy oil,” he said. Societe Generale SA revised its price forecast “moderately higher” than a previous forecast, though its estimate remains more moderate than Tudor’s. It sees crude touching $60 a barrel at the end of 2017. The French bank expects OPEC will continue to extend production cuts into the second half of the year, according to a note led by Michael Haigh. The comments come after the U.S. oil rig count has nearly doubled from its 2016 low of 316 as shale plays like the Permian Basin go through a drilling resurgence, while crude inventories reached all-time highs this month. The supply growth sank West Texas Intermediate close to the $47 mark on Wednesday. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The message has come through phone calls, speeches and an uncommon notice from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the top regulator for national banks, banking and regulatory sources say. A four-page memorandum sent to bank examiners last month said foreign lenders and their customers are hurt when Wall Street turns its back. "Customers that cannot make alternative banking arrangements elsewhere may effectively be cut off from the regulated financial system altogether," according to the "supervision tips" memo obtained by Reuters. The OCC typically issues only a few such memos each year to help examiners navigate complex banking issues. Policymakers have become increasingly concerned that banks are ejecting broad swaths of customers from the financial system out of fear of being penalised over money-laundering violations. For example, customers with ties to Yemen or Syria have a harder time maintaining accounts and banks have ended such relationships, according to a senior compliance officer at a major US bank. To steer clear of violations, JPMorgan Chase & Co stopped doing business with 18,000 customers in 2015 and pulled back from 500 foreign partner banks, CEO Jamie Dimon told investors in a letter last year. Regulators want to prevent terrorists from swapping cash through US banks or their foreign partners. Banks must file a "suspicious activity report" when they encounter a transaction that could be criminal - like a series of small-dollar transfers. But the rules can hamper ordinary money transfers or charitable giving. US firms have warned that they cannot vouch for the customers of their foreign partner banks. That is one reason fewer banks will handle transfers of funds Somalis living in the United States want to send to relatives at home. More Somalis live in Minnesota than anywhere else in the United States and Rep. Keith Ellison of Minneapolis is among leading Democrats who have called for easing banking rules. The "know your customer" standard expects banks to understand their clients' business. But there are limits. "There is no general requirement to know your customers' customer," Thomas Curry, the OCC chief, said in September. The OCC conveyed that message to examiners in a January conference call, as well as the "tips" memo. On the call, "we were told we would no longer be asking for customer lists for foreign correspondent banking relationships for the banks we oversee," said one official who was on the call but not authorised to speak to the media. Foreign firms that partner with US lenders are known as "correspondent" banks. A spokesman for the OCC declined to comment on the examiner phone call or the "supervision tips" sheet. Banks waste billions of dollars each year satisfying money-laundering rules, a leading Wall Street trade group said last month, asking for a complete overhaul of the "know your customer" rules. The number of special activity reports rose to almost a million last year from 669,000 three years earlier, according to the US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which collects such data.

SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link William Harris, the founder of Personal Capital, said the problems with getting access to data from banks had grown worse over the last year. Photo: NYT But now big banks are making a concerted push to set new restrictions on how technology companies can get access to this personal financial data, in some cases refusing to pass along information like the fees and interest rates they charge.Banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo say they want to give consumers access to their data, but are seeking new rules in response to a lack of standards for how technology companies handle personal financial data. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo say they want to give consumers access to their data, but are seeking new rules in response to a lack of standards for how technology companies handle personal financial data. Photo: NYT “When you think about millions of customers handing over their bank account credentials to third parties, who currently have no real oversight or examination of their security controls, you start to understand why our members get pretty nervous,” said Jason Kratovil, vice president for government affairs for payments at the Financial Services Roundtable, which represents the largest banks.The tech companies, in turn, complain that the steps being taken by banks will not lead to better security and are motivated, instead, by a fear that the data will allow the financial upstarts to offer better deals on loans and checking accounts. Advertisement William Harris, founder of Personal Capital, a San Francisco-based start-up, said the problems with getting access to data from banks had grown worse over the last year. To him, it was a sign that the banks viewed open access to data as a threat to their business, given that it would allow customers to see how much they pay for financial products.”It’s pretty clear the real intent of the banks is to limit this data because it puts their business model at risk,” he said.

The company allows consumers to look at their financial accounts on one dashboard, and provides them with financial advice. Photo: NYT The clash over personal financial data points to a broader recognition that personal digital records are among the most valuable currencies in the increasingly digital economy.Corporations are eager to gain access to the digital trails that people leave behind to determine which products are marketed to what consumers and at what prices. The data – and who can have access to it – ultimately affects how much people pay for everything from a home loan to car insurance.But the law has been slow to keep up with the quickly evolving ways that companies seek to hold onto customer data or share it with other companies.One of the primary companies that help move data between the banks and the start-ups is Envestnet Yodlee. The company said that in the last two months, several large banks had told it that it would lose access to at least some data in the near future if it did not agree to new restrictions on the data it is pulling.Some of the banks have said they do not want to share the interest rates and fees that they charge customers, even when customers ask for that information to be passed along, said Steve Boms, vice-president for government affairs at Yodlee.Boms said that his company was pushing back against the requests because “with data limitations you are hindering the ability of millions of consumers to save more and optimize their finances”.JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, which have been among the most aggressive in seeking new agreements, said they would pass along any information that customers wanted, as long as the customers themselves requested it.JPMorgan is hoping to create a dashboard on its website where customers can choose to turn on or off the data flowing from the bank to any outside provider.The banks say they are pushing for new data agreements in an effort to stop technology companies from getting access to customer data in ways that the customers might not understand, or that could create security risks.Right now, few rules or standards exist for how technology companies can use the data they collect f… Post navigation Duchess of Cambridge calls motherhood a ‘huge challenge’ in rare insight into home life Golf: Mullinax grabs lead at Puerto Rico Open Search for: Recent Posts Phillauri box office FAILURE will not affect Anushka Sharma in any way!

Jonathan Velline, Wells Fargo's head of ATM and branch banking, said that the San Francisco-based bank decided to apply the smartphone technology to all of its 13,000 cash machines after piloting the idea in select locations across the country. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are among the big banks that have announced digital upgrades to their ATM infrastructure, but Wells Fargo is the first U.S. bank to roll out cardless machines across its entire network.

"The new feature allows customers to withdraw cash at any time, even when they don't have their cards on them," Velline said. The new option will also improve protections against data theft, Velline said. Related: The Stubborn Costs that Banks Can't Erase "Security certainly was a big aspect of the cardless feature and the two-step identification helps reduce the risk of fraud," Velline said, adding that the elimination of cards prevented so-called skimming techniques that criminals employ to read and store data of cards inserted into ATMs. Wells Fargo, the third-largest U.S. bank, was once the envy of Wall Street, able to seemingly sell its customers a range of different products and highly regarded for its stock price which had once made it the world's most valuable bank. But last year's revelations over a sales scandal that involved the creation of as many as 2.1 million fraudulent accounts in customers' names without their permission took a toll on the company. The lender has since seen a sharp drop in the number of consumers opening checking and credit card accounts.

"Digitalizing services is unquestionably the way to the future and the arguments are very powerful, but U.S. banks are still far behind," said Gerard du Toit, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Company. Accessible, well-designed digital offers not only provide a massive cost advantage, but also significantly improve customer loyalty, du Toit said.

Follow the money. By Lindsey Allen, opinion contributor - 03/23/17 06:00 PM EDT 566   © Getty Images After years of protest and debate resulted in the rejection of the Keystone XL (KXL) pipeline under the Obama administration, all expectations are that the Trump administration is now just days away from reopening this national wound. Trump is expected to reverse course and approve the controversial project that will move Canadian tar sands oil through U.S. territory to be sold to international markets. Let's be clear: the KXL pipeline would be a disaster — for clean water, clean air, indigenous and other land rights and the will of the millions of Americans who raised their voices in opposition.  ADVERTISEMENT The KXL would be a disaster for everybody except the friends of the new administration who will be lining their pockets at the planet's expense. While many once again consider the KXL pipeline a done deal, we have a plan that could still stop it.    Our best hope today to stop this misguided, outdated idea is to follow the money and turn off the spigot of cash flowing from the banking industry to the dirty energy sector. Giant fossil fuel projects like this one require billions of dollars to build and lock us into decades of carbon pollution. We need to ensure that banks stop bankrolling and profiting off climate chaos and human rights abuses. Even energy giants like TransCanada, the company behind the Keystone pipeline, need the support of major financial institutions to lend them the kind of money required for construction of such gargantuan industrial infrastructure. For too long, these mega banks have managed to avoid responsibility for the consequences of supporting companies that profoundly shape the future we will all live in.  It’s time to turn up the heat and demonstrate that banks will no longer be allowed to operate behind the scenes with no accountability for the damaging social and environmental impacts they contribute to. It is time to name names and pull these power players out from the shadows and into the light of public scrutiny.  Twenty-one financial institutions currently serve as TransCanada’s ATM, offering over $5 billion in revolving credit to its pipeline business in three loans that were each updated this past December. JP Morgan Chase and Bank of Montreal are the lead banks arranging the credit. Notably, Citibank and Wells Fargo, which both financed the highly-controversial Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), are once again involved, and they re-upped their support for TransCanada while the DAPL fight was raging.  The fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota took the fossil fuel industry — and the banks that support it — by surprise. When tens of thousands of people began protesting and getting arrested at Citi, TD Bank and Wells Fargo branches around the country for the banks' involvement in financing DAPL, the banks took notice and went on the defensive. When major cities like Seattle, San Francisco and Davis, Calif. started to divest billions in assets from these banks over their involvement in DAPL, they really began to sweat.  Too often, banks are seen as either immune to public pressure or somehow outside the decisionmaking process for major projects like KXL or DAPL. In fact, banks have near total discretion over how and whom they lend their money to. When they feel the spotlight shining on them, they have been responsive to public opinion. Grassroots campaigns have pushed major banks to adopt policies against funding things ranging from slave labor to mountaintop removal coal mining, with significant declines in the financial flows to those industries as a result.  Just this month, Shell became the latest fossil fuel giant to either sell off or write down its tar sands reserves, citing collapse in public support and a bleak financial future for the sector. This is no longer a matter of banks getting ahead of the curve, it’s a matter of them seeing the writing on the wall of an industry in terminal decline.  Since 2011, the fight to stop construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline has united and catalyzed the U.S. environmental movement. In fact, the movement that has grown around opposition to the KXL project has contributed to redefining who and what the environmental movement in this country is seen as. The Cowboy and Indian Alliance marched on D.C. and pipeline fighters, working with local landowners in the East Texas, held an 80-day tree-sit to stop construction on the southern leg of KXL. Indigenous groups, Nebraskan landowners and communities of faith became the new face of the resistance. Most importantly, millions of people made public comments in the official record and nearly 100,000 pledged to engage in civil disobedience if the pipeline was approved.  As a quick reminder, this is a project by a Canadian company to ship the dirtiest and most-polluting form of fossil fuel from the Canadian tar sands through the U.S., only to be shipped out to foreign markets. This oil is not even for the American market. However, those living in Indigenous territories and rural areas along the pipeline would bear the inevitable consequences of leaking pipelines, polluted waterways and many other negative environmental hazards. Locking horns with the global financial industry to transition big banks away from supporting fossil fuel infrastructure development is a daunting challenge. But it is one this moment in history demands of us.  The fight against KXL was never just about a pipeline. It has always been and continues to be a struggle between opposing views for our collective future. With the outsized influence their billions of dollars afford them, banks are a major part of this story and therefore must be a major part of our struggle for a just and climate-stable future.    Lindsey Allen is the executive director of the Rainforest Action Network, an environmental organization based in San Francisco.

In Asia, at least, U.S. financial institutions are climbing up the investment banking league tables while their euro-area counterparts sink. But champagne corks shouldn't be popping on Wall Street just yet. How long their current reign lasts will depend to a large degree on how long fixed income, currencies and commodities business remains robust: Where the Money Comes From Asia Pacific corporate and investment banking revenue fell by 7 percent in 2016, more than the global decline of 2 percent Source: Coalition Note: Excludes onshore China. Deutsche Bank AG, weighed down by billions of dollars in fines for money laundering and manipulating interest rates, has slipped from pole position in Asia while JPMorgan Chase & Co., which expanded in FICC and equities, surged from seventh to first place, data from industry researcher Coalition show. The New York-based bank made $3.3 billion in revenue from investment banking (including trading and equity capital markets, debt capital markets and M&A) last year, about the same as Deutsche Bank made in 2015 when it ranked No. 1. In second spot in Asia is Citigroup Inc., followed by Morgan Stanley. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. coasted into sixth. It's laid off about 30 bankers, most of them in Hong Kong and Singapore, as Chinese banks eat into all lenders' share of the IPO pie and activity in Southeast Asia slows. Deutsche Bank's come down shouldn't be a major surprise considering the company's litany of problems. Other European financial institutions have scaled back in the region, too. Barclays Plc closed its equities shop in Asia, while post the global financial crisis, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc is almost nowhere to be seen. Standard Chartered Plc has largely exited equities globally. JPMorgan Asia investment banking revenue, FY16 $3.3 billion With China clamping down on mainland firms doing deals offshore, 2017 probably won't be a big year for M&A, or investment banking in general for that matter. But a rebound in markets could spell the return of equities as a significant revenue driver, as was the case in the lead up to June 2015, before stocks in China crashed. That would be a boon for banks with strong equity franchises in the region, like UBS Group AG. It would also benefit Chinese lenders, which don't have much of a fixed-income presence  offshore but have been playing a bigger part in Hong Kong's IPO market as they help mainland companies sell shares. Although exchange volumes in Asia Pacific are down 10.5 percent year-to-date, there are some notable bright pockets. Hong Kong is up 13.2 percent, for example, while year-on-year growth in Malaysia, India and Taiwan also reaches well into the double digits, Bloomberg Intelligence data show.

Back to site Banking Politics Wall Street Trump’s SEC Nominee Has a Major Conflict-of-Interest Problem Trump’s SEC Nominee Has a Major Conflict-of-Interest Problem Jay Clayton is tied to big banks and corporations—and that could hold up fraud enforcement. By David Dayen March 23, 2017 Facebook Twitter Email Print SEC Chairman nominee Jay Clayton is sworn in prior to confirmation hearing on March 23, 2017, in Washington, DC. (AP Photo / Pablo Martinez Monsivais) The dominant theme of Thursday’s Senate Banking Committee hearing with Jay Clayton, nominee for chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was conflict of interest. Not the well-documented conflicts of some of the more notorious members of the Trump administration but the conflicts of Clayton himself. Ad Policy A partner at the high-powered corporate law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, Clayton represented Wall Street banks throughout his career. He served as Goldman Sachs’s lawyer during the Wall Street bailout, allowing it to emerge from the financial crisis relatively unscathed. He helped deliver failed investment bank Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase and other failed investment bank Lehman Brothers to Barclays. He defended Ally Financial in its foreclosure fraud settlement with the government and represented Deutsche Bank in its “mirror trade” Russian oligarch money laundering scandal. He was the lawyer of record with mortgage servicer Ocwen during a scandal so distasteful the CEO was forced to resign. Oh yeah, also his wife is a broker at Goldman Sachs. (She reportedly plans to step down upon Clayton’s confirmation.) Matt Taibbi rightly suggested that Clayton would be “the most conflicted SEC Chair ever,” and given the history of SEC chairs, that’s saying a lot. Clayton’s non-bank clients raise more alarm. They include Valeant, the scandal-ridden pharmaceutical company, and Volkswagen, which deceived the public by cheating-diesel emissions tests. According to Public Citizen, Clayton’s family gets millions of dollars in annual dividends from a private company named WMB Holdings, some of which Clayton plans to retain even if confirmed. This company and its affiliated partners (Delaware Trust Co and CSC) are conduits for creating shell corporations and other sketchy vehicles used in tax evasion and money laundering. Public Citizen found apparent links between these companies and Mossack Fonseca, the notorious Panamanian law firm at the center of the Panama Papers scandal.

But Senator Elizabeth Warren, who spoke at a  rally against Clayton’s nomination yesterday on Capitol Hill, did highlight the practical effect of these conflicts of interest that enable the Trump administration and his wealthy friends to personally benefit. Clayton would be unable to vote to enforce the law against several big banks, including Goldman Sachs and Barclays. In her first round of questioning, Warren noted that, under a presidential executive order, Clayton would have to recuse himself from participating in any enforcement actions against a former client for the first two years of his tenure. That means “you would not be able to vote to enforce the law against several big banks, including Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, and UBS,” Warren said. These are firms that have been involved in repeated enforcement actions at the SEC. But it goes further, because the executive order also forces recusal in any matter in which Sullivan & Cromwell, Clayton’s former law firm, is involved. And the firm’s roster of clients is massive. An analysis of its recent clients published by Allied Progress estimates that Clayton would have to withdraw “from cases involving nearly one-third of the institutions on the Financial Stability Board’s list of ‘global systemically important banks.’” Plus, as Warren points out, “any reasonably strategic company…could simply hire [Sullivan & Cromwell] to represent them before the agency, and you couldn’t vote for enforcement of that company.” Clayton mildly disputed this, but it’s accurate. Why is this important? Clayton promised at the hearing to “enforce the law strictly” and to “root out any fraud and shady practices in our financial system.” But without Clayton’s input, the committee would be down to an even number of Democratic and Republican appointees. Normally that would be a 2-2 split, but currently, there’s a vacancy on each side. And if those commissioners disagree along party lines, a deadlock would mean not moving forward on enforcement. So putting a chair on the SEC who has to constantly recuse himself on enforcement matters really advantages corporation, as a tie lets them off the hook. GET A DIGITAL SUBSCRIPTION FOR JUST $9.50! Subscribe “If President Trump wanted to make sure that the SEC would have a hard time in going after his Wall Street friends, it seems to me that you would be the perfect SEC chair,” Warren said, revealing the scheme. You can lie in a number of contexts in American life, but when you lie where stocks and trades are involved, the SEC is supposed to step in. If it can’t because of Jay Clayton’s conflicts, corporations would be stupid not to keep on lying in a grab for profit. The stakes are higher now than ever. Get The Nation in your inbox. To be clear, we just got finished having an SEC chair who had to constantly recuse herself from enforcement cases. Mary Jo White, a former (and now current) partner at another big-time Wall Street law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, had to recuse herself from over four dozen investigations in her first two years, and in numerous instances that resulted in a 2-2 deadlock, ending the case. White’s husband John White was a corporate lawyer with Cravath Swaine & Moore, and corporations hired Cravath just to knock White out of cases, precisely the fear Warren expressed regarding Clayton. Clayton protested that, if he recuses, “my fellow commissioners will be able to handle the matters ably and to good effect.” Senator Mike Rounds (R-SD) suggested that a split vote doesn’t mean that the corporation is guilty of the crime, which is irrelevant. Senator Thom Tillis amusingly fumed about punishing success, actually saying, “I feel like I’m living in a reality-TV version of Atlas Shrugged.” But Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) got to the heart of the issue. Recusals aside, the personal relationships that come from being marinated in a Wall Street viewpoint cannot help but play a role in shaping someone like Clayton’s perspective. Even if there’s no reason to recuse from a case, Clayton likely knows the lawyer on the other side of the table, or the client, or both. You hear about foxes being put in charge of hen houses, but it’s more like putting in charge another hen, someone who listens to and understands the industry more than the stated mission of the regulatory agency. In her second round of questioning, Warren offered a practical application. Clayton admitted that he met with billionaire investor Carl Icahn after he was nominated for SEC chair. Icahn has an unpaid role with the Trump administration as a deregulatory czar, but has not sold off any of his prodigious holdings. He has been accused of using his influence with Trump to get a change to ethanol rules that will save an oil refinery he controls $200 million a year. You hear about foxes being put in charge of henhouses, but it’s more like putting in charge another hen. Clayton told Warren at the hearing that Icahn and he discussed the importance of activist investors in improving the performance of public companies. Activist investing is what Icahn does. This is a billionaire lobbying the future SEC chair (without registering as a lobbyist) to encourage his business model. One of Icahn’s activist investments, the multilevel marketing company Herbalife, is under active SEC investigation. Clayton wouldn’t even say definitively that it would be inappropriate to speak with Icahn if he were confirmed. Warren noted that Icahn could easily use material non-public information gained by advising the administration to make money on stocks, a classic insider-trading scenario under the SEC’s purview. “The Trump administration has conflicts everywhere,” she said. “It’s difficult to determine whether someone is working in the interests of American people or lining their pockets.” Clayton, of course, pledged no favoritism. But he’s the worst person to adjudicate this, being hopelessly conflicted himself, both specifically with his Wall Street clients and in terms of mindshare. If the SEC was ever a cop on the beat, it is turning off the siren and going back to the police station for a few years. Corporate wrongdoers can’t wait. 2 Comments Facebook Twitter Email Print David Dayen David Dayen is the author of Chain of Title: How Three Ordinary Americans Uncovered Wall Street’s Great Foreclosure Fraud, winner of the Studs and Ida Terkel Prize.

The opinions expressed are her own.) By Gina Chon WASHINGTON, March 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A Wall Street insider risks further polarizing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Jay Clayton, the white-shoe attorney President Donald Trump has picked to lead the agency, will have to sit out decisions on Goldman Sachs and other clients. That increases the prospect of tie votes that can block or diminish enforcement. Clayton's clients at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell were a source of praise and criticism during his Senate hearing on Thursday. He worked on the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan in 2008 and the 2014 IPO of Alibaba, among other high-profile deals. In government, he would have to recuse himself from cases involving clients, including Barclays and Valeant Pharmaceuticals, for one year. Several of his clients were or are currently under SEC investigation. Recusals were sometimes a problem under Clayton's predecessor, Mary Jo White. She couldn't work on cases involving clients she had at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton for one year, in addition to decisions involving her lawyer-husband's firm, Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Senator Elizabeth Warren said White had to recuse herself from about 48 cases. Clayton's wife works for Goldman but plans to leave if he gets the Washington job, a person familiar with the matter said. White's absence sometimes led to deadlocks among the four other commissioners and months-long delays in enforcement cases. In 2014, the SEC was stuck on whether to grant a waiver to Bank of America in relation to its $16.6 billion settlement for misleading investors on mortgage-backed securities sales. It ultimately granted a waiver to allow the bank to more easily raise capital for clients after imposing unique conditions, including requiring a compliance consultant. The SEC's work goes beyond enforcement, and many of those areas have been bogged down by politics. The agency has delayed a market-structure overhaul aimed at ensuring the system isn't rigged in favor of high-frequency traders, and it's been the slowest regulator to write rules mandated by Dodd-Frank. White, a Washington outsider as Clayton is, found it difficult to navigate the partisanship, even inside the Democratic Party that appointed her. The SEC may soon be left with just one commissioner - acting Chair Michael Piwowar, a Republican - if no one else is nominated. That prospect may aid Clayton's transition. Eventually the agency should be fully staffed. If Clayton doesn't quickly learn the ways of Washington, deadlocks could exacerbate the commission's politicization. On Twitter https://twitter.com/GinaChon CONTEXT NEWS - The U.S. Senate Banking Committee on March 23 held a hearing on the nomination of Jay Clayton, President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission. Clayton is a partner at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, where he worked on some of the biggest deals during the 2008 financial crisis. He represented Bear Stearns on its sale to JPMorgan, Barclays Capital on its purchase of assets of Lehman Brothers out of bankruptcy, and Goldman Sachs on its capital injections from Warren Buffett and the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program. - Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats criticized Clayton for his Wall Street ties. In his opening statement at the hearing, Clayton said he would not be soft on financial wrongdoing. "I am 100 percent committed to rooting out any fraud and shady practices in our financial system," he said. "I recognize that bad actors undermine the hard-earned confidence that is essential to the efficient operation of our capital markets." - For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on - SIGN UP FOR BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS http://bit.ly/BVsubscribe (Editing by Tom Buerkle and Martin Langfield) Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

The company allows consumers to look at their financial accounts on one dashboard, and provides them with financial advice. 3/3 SLIDES SAN FRANCISCO — The big banks and Silicon Valley are waging an escalating battle over your personal financial data, including the amount you spent on dinner last week and how much you are paying for your mortgage. Quotes in the article Intuit Inc INTU ▼ 119.72 -0.27 -0.23% Envestnet Inc ENV ▼ 32.00 -0.65 -1.99% Wells Fargo & Co WFC ▲ 55.83 +0.58 +1.05% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 87.29 -0.10 -0.11% Technology start-ups like Mint and Betterment have been building services that pull together your bank account and credit card records — after you supply the passwords. But now big banks are making a concerted push to set new restrictions on how technology companies can get access to this personal financial data, in some cases refusing to pass along information like the fees and interest rates they charge. Banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo say they want to give consumers access to their data, but are seeking new rules in response to a lack of standards for how technology companies handle personal financial data. “When you think about millions of customers handing over their bank account credentials to third parties, who currently have no real oversight or examination of their security controls, you start to understand why our members get pretty nervous,” said Jason Kratovil, the vice president for government affairs for payments at the Financial Services Roundtable, which represents the largest banks. The tech companies, in turn, complain that the steps being taken by banks will not lead to better security and are motivated, instead, by a fear that the data will allow the financial upstarts to offer better deals on loans and checking accounts. Sign up for the Morning Briefing newsletter William Harris, the founder of Personal Capital, a San Francisco-based start-up, said the problems with getting access to data from banks had grown worse over the last year. To him, it was a sign that the banks viewed open access to data as a threat to their business, given that it would allow customers to see how much they pay for financial products. “It’s pretty clear the real intent of the banks is to limit this data because it puts their business model at risk,” he said. The clash over personal financial data points to a broader recognition that personal digital records are among the most valuable currencies in the increasingly digital economy. Corporations are eager to gain access to the digital trails that people leave behind to determine which products are marketed to what consumers and at what prices. The data — and who can have access to it — ultimately affects how much people pay for everything from a home loan to car insurance. But the law has been slow to keep up with the quickly evolving ways that companies seek to hold onto customer data or share it with other companies. The European authorities have largely decided that consumers, not companies, own the digital records associated with their accounts. As a result, European banks are generally being forced to make it easy for their customers to share their financial data with whomever they choose. In the United States, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act broadly directed banks to make electronic records available to consumers, but there has been little detail on what that means in practice. The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray, has made it clear that he believes banks have not been willing enough to give customers control over their own data. “We recognize that data access makes it possible to realize the many benefits of competition and innovation,” Mr. Cordray said in a speech this month in New York. “We remain concerned about reports of some institutions that may be limiting or restricting access unduly.” Mr. Cordray has been moving toward writing new rules on this front, but it is uncertain if he and the bureau will survive and push the banks to open up under the Trump administration. Banks, in the meantime, have taken the initiative by pushing technology companies to accept new agreements on how they use the data they pull from the banks. One of the primary companies that help move data between the banks and the start-ups is Envestnet Yodlee. The company said that in the last two months, several large banks had told it that it would lose access to at least some data in the near future if it did not agree to new restrictions on the data it is pulling. Some of the banks have said they do not want to share the interest rates and fees that they charge customers, even when customers ask for that information to be passed along, said Steve Boms, the vice president for government affairs at Yodlee. Mr. Boms said that his company was pushing back against the requests because “with data limitations you are hindering the ability of millions of consumers to save more and optimize their finances.” JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, which have been among the most aggressive in seeking new agreements, said they would pass along any information that customers wanted, as long as the customers themselves requested it. JPMorgan is hoping to create a dashboard on its website where customers can choose to turn on or off the data flowing from the bank to any outside provider. The banks say they are pushing for new data agreements in an effort to stop technology companies from getting access to customer data in ways that the customers might not understand, or that could create security risks. Right now, few rules or standards exist for how technology companies can use the data they collect from customers. It is also not entirely clear who would be held liable if a data breach at a service like Venmo or Mint led to financial losses for a customer. “It is in everybody’s best interest to come to more robust arrangements, from a security perspective,” said Brett Pitts, the head of digital for Wells Fargo Virtual Channels. In January, both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo signed agreements with Intuit — the owner of Mint, TurboTax and QuickBooks — that will give Intuit more streamlined access to data from the banks, in exchange for new rules about how Intuit uses the data. The banks have said they want the agreement with Intuit to be a model for similar agreements with other technology companies. In recent negotiations, including those with Intuit, Wells Fargo has asked to be paid by technology companies that want better access to its data, a sticking point for technology companies that believe data should flow freely. Mr. Pitts said the payments were intended to help the bank cover the additional infrastructure costs involved in providing real-time access to data. The negotiations with Yodlee are particularly important because it is the largest so-called data aggregator. Yodlee and a few other data aggregators serve as the middlemen between the banks and the start-ups, pulling the data from the banks and putting it into a form that start-ups like Betterment and Digit can use. Yodlee is the biggest aggregator, but it has also been the most controversial because of what it does with the data it collects. In particular, the company has been criticized for taking the billions of credit card transactions running through its pipes and selling them to hedge funds and other investment firms. Investors want to look through the transactions for trading signals, such as any indication that a particular retailer or product is doing better than expected. Yodlee has said that it scrubs the data of any personal information before it sells it to third parties. But other aggregators that compete with Yodlee, including its largest competitor, Plaid, say they do not sell customer data to third parties and do not think it would be right to do so, given that the consumers do not generally know their data is being sold in this way. JPMorgan has been insisting in negotiations that it will provide easy access to its data only if technology companies agree not to sell the data to third parties. Intuit agreed to those terms in its deal with the bank. This has not been the only sticking point in negotiations with Yodlee, however, and Yodlee is not the only company that has complained that the banks are making it harder for customers who want access to information about their bank accounts. Mr. Harris of Personal Capital has been one of the most outspoken critics of the banks. His company allows consumers to look at all their financial accounts on one dashboard, and also provides them with financial advice based on their holdings. Mr. Harris, who was previously the chief executive at Intuit and PayPal, said that many banks publicly say they are sharing data while making it hard, behind the scenes, for companies like Personal Capital to get access to it. Some companies, he said, will throttle access to data, or shut it down for hours at a time. “It happens with a frequency that is too often to simply be the result of some technical problems,” Mr. Harris said. He said that agreements like those Intuit recently struck with the banks would speed up the movement of data, but give the banks too much control over the data flowing to companies like Personal Capital. “We suss out the data and show the customer what they are actually paying,” he said. “From a business model point of view that is not in the best interest of the banks and brokers. It’s encouraging customers to get smart and get well-priced products.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

The JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN (NYSEArca: AMJ) and the ALPS Alerian MLP ETF (NYSEArca: AMLP), the two largest MLP-related exchange traded products, gained 0.8% and 0.7% Thursday, respectively. The State Department’s will approve a permit by Monday, which could mark the beginning of process of a lengthy and complicated approval process from state regulators and legal challenges, Reuters reports. Tom Shannon, the State Department’s undersecretary for political affairs, is expected to approve the cross-border permit for TransCanada Corp’s (NYSE: TRP) pipeline on or before Monday, Former President Barack Obama blocked the proposal, arguing that the pipeline would not reduce fuel prices for Americans and would only contribute to global warming emissions, but Trump supports Keystone and signed an executive order days after he took office to expand on its construction. The Monday deadline is the end of a 60-day period that Trump ordered back in January when he first signed the executive order. “If people want to build pipelines in the United States, they should use American steel and they should build it and create it right here,” Trump said at a Monday rally in Louisville, Kentucky. “That pipeline is going to be manufactured right here.” The Keystone pipeline is expected to funnel over 800,000 barrels=per-day of heavy crude from Canada’s oil sands to U.S. refineries and ports along the Gulf of Mexico. Nick Loris, an energy and environment researcher at the Heritage Foundation, said an approval would “reestablish some certainty and sanity to a permitting process that was hijacked by political pandering.” MLPs primarily deal with the distribution and storage of energy products, so their business model is less reliant on the commodities market since MLPs profit off the quantity of oil and natural gas they are able to move around. Consequently, MLPs have historically shown a weaker correlation to energy prices over longer periods as MLPs act more like energy toll roads, profiting on the volume of oil moving through their pipelines.

Morgan has topped in overall investment bank revenue for Asia Pacific in 2016, according to the latest data released by Coalition, a data-analytics and intelligence firm, associated with rating company Crisil. JP Morgan's revenues from merger and acquisition, trading and other investment banking activity rose 11 per cent to $25.2 billion in 2016 from $22.7 billion in the preceding year, show data from Coalition. The bank has earned revenues in 2016 across fixed income, equities, and banking operations. It also ranked first or joint first in every other region. "We continue to make significant investments in the region, maintained our focus on delivering the right strategic solutions to our clients and achieved record results in a year that was characterized by unpredictable geopolitical events," the bank said in a statement. J.P. Morgan's FICC and Equities businesses both ranked among top 3 in Asia Pacific, according to Coalition. "The strong momentum in 2016 was driven primarily by a solid performance in the Fixed Income business, which enabled us to post record year-on-year growth. Our equities business has gained significant market share across the region in the past couple years as well," the bank said. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup ranked joint second overall for the period while Bank of America was ranked next. Globally, J.P. Morgan again ranked as the top investment bank in terms of revenue in 2016, according to Coalition, maintaining top positions in the U.S., EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa). The Coalition data covers key business components of the investment bank, including fixed Income, currencies & commodities (FICC), equities (cash equities, equity derivatives, prime services and futures & options) and investment banking division (M&A, equity capital markets and debt capital markets).

In January, finance minister Michael Noonan raised the possibility that the government could try to return part of the bank to private ownership as early as May as markets improve. The government said on Thursday that Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Goodbody Stockbrokers, JPMorgan and UBS have now been appointed as bookrunners for a potential sale. They will join Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and Davy Stockbrokers who were appointed as global coordinators in December. Last year, Ireland pushed back the timetable for selling its stake, citing unfavourable market conditions, but Noonan has said rising bank share prices suggest he might get the value needed. The 99.9 percent state-owned bank became the first domestic-owned Irish lender to restart dividends since the financial crash almost a decade ago, when it proposed a 250 million euro payment earlier this month after reporting strong margin and capital growth during 2016.

Trump and his new blue-ribbon panel of working-class champions have announced a bold new initiative to create millions of American jobs. A spokesman for the panel, Steve Schwarzman, praised Trump as a leader who wants to “do things a lot better in our country, for all Americans.” Wait a minute — Steve Schwarzman? Isn’t he a billionaire hedge-fund huckster on Wall Street? Yes — and holy money bags, there’s Jamie Dimon, head of the scandal-ridden bank JPMorgan Chase. Working-class champions? Hardly. Trump’s whole “jobs” panel, it turns out, is made up of Wall Street banksters and corporate powers like Wal-Mart that are notorious for laying off and ripping off workers. Trump-the-candidate fulminated against such moneyed elites, calling them “responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class.” But now, in a spectacular flip-flop, he’s brought these robbers directly inside his presidency, asking them to be architects of his economic strategy. Worse, he’s doing this in the name of helping workers. Hello! To develop policies beneficial to working stiffs, bring in some working stiffs! But there’s not a single labor advocate on his policy council, in his cabinet, or anywhere near his White House. Thus, the so-called “job-creation plan” announced by Trump and his corporate cohorts doesn’t create any jobs, but calls instead for de-regulating Wall Street. These flim-flammers actually want us rubes to believe that “freeing” banksters to return to casino-style speculation and consumer scams will give them more money to invest in American jobs. Do they think we have sucker wrappers around our heads? Trump’s scheme will let banks make a killing, but it doesn’t require them to invest in jobs — so they won’t. There’s a name for this: fraud.   OtherWords columnist Jim Hightower is a radio commentator, writer, and public speaker. He’s also the editor of the populist newsletter, The Hightower Lowdown.

 UK moves to faster check clearing BI Intelligence Mar. 23, 2017, 10:42 AM 184 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Tencent turns to cloud and innovation for growth THE RETAILER MOBILE WALLETS REPORT: How stores can benefit from developing their own digital payments apps THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY EXPLAINED: The Trends Creating New Winners And Losers In The Card-Processing Ecosystem This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. In October, the UK will see its bank-to-bank check clearing systems begin to digitize, shrinking check processing times from six business days to one, according to Finextra. The UK’s Cheque and Credit Clearing Company (C&CCC) will initiate a phased rollout of check upgrades, starting with select financial institutions and building societies in October, that will broaden to include the remainder by the second half of 2018.   This is a long-overdue upgrade to a waning but still-popular payments type. Faster checks matter because paper isn’t dead — yet. Although on the decline, checks still accounted for $423 billion in the 12 months ending February 2017. Writing and cashing those checks are millions of people, businesses and charities who will benefit from the faster processing times of the upgrade. It will open the door for bank-to-bank mobile deposit. In the UK, at certain progressive banks it is possible for two members of the same institution to exchange a check and deposit it using a smartphone. However, it is not currently possible for two people at different banks to do so, because there is no system in place for banks to exchange check images between one another. The upgrade will set up such a system, clearing the runway for mobile imaging services, which have already proven popular globally, to take off in the UK. For banks, the move to digital will translate to major cost savings. JPMorgan Chase recently shared that it costs the bank 96% less to deposit a check digitally than it does via a human teller. To end users, it’s likely the upgrade will only slow down checks’ declining popularity in the UK, not reverse the trend. In the US, which has long had intrabank mobile deposit, peer-to-peer payment technologies are still eating into checks’ market share, due to their high ease of use and lack of fees. In the US, when customers make payments via banks, they’re completed in two ways: via wire transfer, or through the Automated Clearing House (ACH). ACH transactions, which are less expensive for customers and which accounted for 18% of total noncash US payments volume in 2012, can take up to five days to settle because of the way that they are processed. That’s problematic, because it interferes with consumer demand for convenience and could slow the supply chain or make it more challenging for banks and businesses to get paid in the way they need to conduct operations. As a result, the US Fed looked into the ACH system in 2013, and found that there was no “ubiquitous, convenient, and cost-effective way for US consumers and businesses to make fast payments between banks.  In response, the Fed, NACHA, and private institutions have begun to find ways, together and separately, to modernize the US payments system in order to increase convenience and catch up to many of the country’s trade partners. The Fed has formed a task force, which will resolve potential solutions, while NACHA and private institutions are pushing banks to hit a set of three same-day settlement deadlines through late 2016 and into 2017. Such a system will particularly benefit high-growth spaces in the electronic payments ecosystem, like P2P and B2B payments, which could magnify its impact over time. Though it’s likely the system could grow ACH volume by making it a more appealing option in these high-growth areas, it could become a hindrance to banks. That’s because the implementation is costly and time-consuming — the Fed find that the business impact is net-neutral to negative for these firms. Instead, the parties that reap these benefits are providers of services in these high growth areas, like mobile bill pay firms or P2P vendors, which means that banks are actually aiding their competitors. That means that Faster Payments could ultimately enhance the impact of digital disruption in the payments ecosystem, rather than mitigate it. Jaime Toplin, research associate for BI Intelligence, Business Insider’s premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on faster payments that looks at why the US needs a Faster Payments system, explains how the country plans to implement it, evaluates the different areas that are most likely to be impacted by Faster Payments, and determines which parties benefit from such a system and which are hindered by it. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Sluggish settlement of payments in the US is pushing NACHA, the national electronic payments trade group, and the Federal Reserve to reform the system. US payments made via ACH can take three to five days to settle.The Fed's Faster Payments Task Force and NACHA are looking to implement a same-day settlement program in the US by 2017 in order to increase consumer convenience.  The number of transactions affected by faster payments will increase over time.Four key areas — P2P, B2B, C2B, and B2C payments — will gain the most from such a system. And these areas, which comprised 12% of US payments volume in 2014, will grow rapidly over time, therefore magnifying the impact of such a system. Faster payments implementation will be a mixed bag for banks, because of additional costs associated with the burden of implementation. And the platform is likely to actually boost third-party providers, like P2P app vendors or mobile bill pay firms, by giving them an easy way to increase efficiency, engagement, and volume, without a substantial rise in transaction costs.

REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser Reuters/Faisal Al Nasser By Tom Arnold, Davide Barbuscia and Hadeel Al Sayegh DUBAI, March 23 (Reuters) - Oil giant Saudi Aramco has selected Samba Capital as one of two banks to work as an adviser on its planned share sale in Riyadh, banking sources told Reuters on Thursday. At least six investment banks pitched for a role advising the world's largest oil producer on its listing on the Saudi stock exchange in Riyadh, the Tadawul. Saudi authorities are aiming to list a total of up to 5 percent of Aramco - on the Tadawul and one or more international markets - in an initial public offering that could raise $100 billion. Saudi Aramco said it did not comment on rumour or speculation. Samba Financial Group , the parent of Samba Capital, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Advertisement JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have been asked to work on Saudi Aramco's global listing, alongside independent boutique bank Michael Klein and New York-based boutique investment bank Moelis & Co , sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters. HSBC is also a leading contender for a role, sources have said. The fees the local advisers are likely to earn will be dwarfed by those taken by their global counterparts, but should still be lucrative given the deal would be the largest local listing in Saudi Arabia's history. "The government will negotiate aggressively on the fees and their size will depend on how much of Aramco the government decides to list," said a banker familiar with the matter. The local role will entail working with regulators at Saudi's Capital Market Authority to prepare for the Tadawul listing, which is expected to be smaller than the international portion. Samba Capital, the investment arm of Saudi Arabia's third-largest bank by assets, is one of the more active local investment banks. Saudi Arabian sports and fitness business Leejam Sports Co was expected to hire Samba Capital to advise it on a stock market flotation in the kingdom, Reuters reported in May 2016.

Banks took a whooping 233 billion euros ($251.31 billion) at the ECB's TLTRO (targeted long-term refinancing operation), over 100 billion more than had been forecast, fanning hopes of another spending stampede by market bulls. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 rose 0.25 percent with Frankfurt, Paris and Milan up as much as 0.6 percent and Wall Street set to open higher ahead of a key test of Donald Trump's policymaking ability. Highly indebted Italy, Spain and Portugal and euro zone bank also saw their bonds rally, as analysts bet that they would be the first items on the shopping list of many of the 474 banks that had taken the ECB money. "That (TLTRO) was a policy designed for extraordinary times, we are not in them now," said Nick Gartside, JP Morgan Asset Management's international CIO for fixed income. Markets showed no lasting reaction to Europe's latest terror attack, which for the second time in 10 years had seen the region's financial centre, London, targeted. These attacks, including in France, Germany and Belgium last year as well those in London and Madrid more than 10 years ago, have made little impact on economic confidence or financial markets in isolation. Sterling started steady and then climbed swiftly above $1.25 as more-resilient-than-expected UK retail sales data proved that Britain's consumers aren't being cowered by looming Brexit negotiations and rising inflation. The dollar was also creeping higher with attention firmly whether or not Trump will get his highly-publicised healthcare changes to roll back 'Obamacare' passed by U.S. lawmakers. "What we are getting this week is a questioning of how much of the risk rally is predicated on future Trump policy," said Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at State Street Global Markets. "There are concerns that this vote (on healthcare reform) will be a litmus test of how much fiscal expansion he can get through." After losing 3.5 percent in the past 10 days, the dollar was roughly steady at 111.05 yen. It gained as much 0.1 percent to $1.0786 per euro and hovered 0.1 percent higher against the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength. IRON SLAM In commodities markets, the focus remained on iron ore prices in China as they followed up a 16 percent slump on Wednesday by falling to their lowest in more than two months. Pressure came from a continued slide in steel and simmering concerns about demand in China, the world's top consumer. The most-traded iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange closed down 1.9 percent at 580.50 yuan ($84). The risk rally elsewhere saw gold dip however and oil rebounded, after touching its lowest since November overnight on data that showed U.S. inventories, already at a record high, grew by far more than forecast. Analysts said oil had found technical support and was being pushed up as traders took new long positions after the overnight low, but supply concerns kept the gains in check. U.S. crude added 0.75 percent to $48.40 a barrel and global benchmark Brent climbed 0.7 percent to $50.99. With several major currency pairs steadying after a week of losses for the dollar, the biggest FX mover of the day was Australia's dollar, down half a percent on the back of nerves in China's money market and a slump in prices for its iron ore exports. The New Zealand dollar was steady at $0.7046 after its central bank held interest rates at a record low 1.75 percent, and reiterated it would remain there for a "considerable" period of time. TRUMP TEST MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had advanced 0.2 percent overnight. Japan's Nikkei closed 0.2 percent higher too, as a weaker yen offset a political scandal over the relationship of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife with a Japanese nationalist education group that bought state-owned land. China's CSI 300 rose early on hopes that index compiler MSCI may include A-shares in its indices, but those gains were lost as money began flowing out of the mainland market through link to the Hong Kong exchange. Wall Street futures were pointing to modest gains, though it was likely to be tense going ahead of the Trump policy test. On Wednesday the Nasdaq jumped 0.5 percent and the S&amp;P 500 closed 0.2 percent higher, while the Dow Jones was flat, after all three touched their lowest levels in about five weeks earlier in the session. Trump has been trying to rally support for his plan to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democratic former president Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation. Trump and Republican leaders of the House of Representatives have said they were making progress in their efforts to win over conservative Republicans who have demanded changes to the legislation. They plan a vote on the bill, Trump's first major legislation since he took office, later on Thursday. "If he can't push through the bill, it would further damage stocks. It also raises the risk of his other policies, like tax cuts, being delayed," said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.

REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Illustration/File photo By Marc Jones | LONDON LONDON Euro zone stocks and bonds rallied on Thursday as banks snapped up almost quarter of a trillion euros of interest-free European Central Bank cash in what the ECB hopes will be the last outing for one of its main crisis-fighting tools. Banks took a whooping 233 billion euros ($251.31 billion) at the ECB's TLTRO (targeted long-term refinancing operation), over 100 billion more than had been forecast, fanning hopes of another spending stampede by market bulls. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 rose 0.25 percent with Frankfurt, Paris and Milan up as much as 0.6 percent and Wall Street set to open higher ahead of a key test of Donald Trump's policymaking ability. Highly indebted Italy, Spain and Portugal and euro zone bank also saw their bonds rally, as analysts bet that they would be the first items on the shopping list of many of the 474 banks that had taken the ECB money. "That (TLTRO) was a policy designed for extraordinary times, we are not in them now," said Nick Gartside, JP Morgan Asset Management's international CIO for fixed income. Markets showed no lasting reaction to Europe's latest terror attack, which for the second time in 10 years had seen the region's financial centre, London, targeted. These attacks, including in France, Germany and Belgium last year as well those in London and Madrid more than 10 years ago, have made little impact on economic confidence or financial markets in isolation. Sterling started steady and then climbed swiftly above $1.25 as more-resilient-than-expected UK retail sales data proved that Britain's consumers aren't being cowered by looming Brexit negotiations and rising inflation. The dollar was also creeping higher with attention firmly whether or not Trump will get his highly-publicised healthcare changes to roll back 'Obamacare' passed by U.S. lawmakers. "What we are getting this week is a questioning of how much of the risk rally is predicated on future Trump policy," said Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at State Street Global Markets. "There are concerns that this vote (on healthcare reform) will be a litmus test of how much fiscal expansion he can get through." After losing 3.5 percent in the past 10 days, the dollar was roughly steady at 111.05 yen. It gained as much 0.1 percent to $1.0786 per euro and hovered 0.1 percent higher against the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength. IRON SLAM In commodities markets, the focus remained on iron ore prices in China as they followed up a 16 percent slump on Wednesday by falling to their lowest in more than two months. Pressure came from a continued slide in steel and simmering concerns about demand in China, the world's top consumer. The most-traded iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange closed down 1.9 percent at 580.50 yuan ($84). The risk rally elsewhere saw gold dip however and oil rebounded, after touching its lowest since November overnight on data that showed U.S. inventories, already at a record high, grew by far more than forecast. Analysts said oil had found technical support and was being pushed up as traders took new long positions after the overnight low, but supply concerns kept the gains in check. U.S. crude added 0.75 percent to $48.40 a barrel and global benchmark Brent climbed 0.7 percent to $50.99. With several major currency pairs steadying after a week of losses for the dollar, the biggest FX mover of the day was Australia's dollar, down half a percent on the back of nerves in China's money market and a slump in prices for its iron ore exports. The New Zealand dollar was steady at $0.7046 after its central bank held interest rates at a record low 1.75 percent, and reiterated it would remain there for a "considerable" period of time. TRUMP TEST MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had advanced 0.2 percent overnight. Japan's Nikkei closed 0.2 percent higher too, as a weaker yen offset a political scandal over the relationship of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife with a Japanese nationalist education group that bought state-owned land. China's CSI 300 rose early on hopes that index compiler MSCI may include A-shares in its indices, but those gains were lost as money began flowing out of the mainland market through link to the Hong Kong exchange. Wall Street futures were pointing to modest gains, though it was likely to be tense going ahead of the Trump policy test. On Wednesday the Nasdaq jumped 0.5 percent and the S&P 500 closed 0.2 percent higher, while the Dow Jones was flat, after all three touched their lowest levels in about five weeks earlier in the session. Trump has been trying to rally support for his plan to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democratic former president Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation. Trump and Republican leaders of the House of Representatives have said they were making progress in their efforts to win over conservative Republicans who have demanded changes to the legislation. They plan a vote on the bill, Trump's first major legislation since he took office, later on Thursday. "If he can't push through the bill, it would further damage stocks. It also raises the risk of his other policies, like tax cuts, being delayed," said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.

The dollar has almost erased its gains from the so-called Trump Trade, as pro-growth policies from the presidential administration have yet to materialize. UBS AG’s wealth-management unit recommended selling the dollar against the euro, and JPMorgan Chase & Co., the world’s second-biggest currency trader, advised clients to ditch bullish bets in the short term. “The case has become more compelling” to short the dollar, said Constantin Bolz, a foreign-exchange strategist at UBS in Zurich. The bullish dollar consensus since Donald Trump’s election in November “is turning step by step” as markets question US policies and their effectiveness. UBS sees the euro-dollar exchange rate climbing as high as US$1.15 (RM5.09) over the next six months from US$1.0784 today. It expects dollar-yen to fall to below ¥110 (RM4.4) in the same period. The US currency has fallen 3.7 per cent this year as traders awaited details on the size and scale of fiscal-stimulus proposals and cues from the Federal Reserve about the path of interest-rate increases. The weakness follows four years of gains as the world’s largest economy recovered from the financial crisis and the Fed began to nudge borrowing costs higher. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed Thursday. Technical Indicators In options markets, protection against a rising dollar is getting cheaper as the outlook on the currency becomes more pessimistic. Risk reversals, an indicator of market sentiment and option positioning, have been signaling a shift away from dollar bullishness. The EUR/USD one-year risk reversal has plunged as markets discount the prospect of Marine Le Pen winning the French election. Investors are also less bearish against the euro versus the dollar. The so-called smile of one-year volatility, which reflects the cost of protecting against low-probability events, has flattened. A JPMorgan Chase & Co. measure of volatility in G-7 currencies is below its average for the past year, and not far from the lowest level since 2014. Similarly, the dollar-yen one-year risk reversal has gone up. Another bearish signal is the Bloomberg dollar spot index’s 50-day moving average crossing under its 100-day moving average. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week China slinging salmon on the Internet lures Norway seafood fund Oil producers call to roll over output cuts beyond June American Air in negotiations to purchase stake in China Southern Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Jack Ma: DFTZ will be a Malaysian-run business China capital controls leave buyers of foreign property in bind (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Top NSA official ridicules allegation Britain spied on Trump Trump promises ‘renewal of the American spirit’ Petraeus, other ex-officers in line to replace White House security advisor Flynn Trump says undocumented migrant raids fulfill ‘campaign promise’ Trump moves to roll back financial regulation Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Photos Videos Topics Live NZ 67/0 (25.3) - SA 314/10 (89.2) Live IND 248/6 (91) - AUS 300/10 (88.3) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Ravindra Gaikwad Yogi Adityanath Virat Kohli Donald Trump Narendra Modi Home Money GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks, bonds cheer bumper ECB cash handout Shares1 Thu, 23 Mar 2017-06:11pm , Reuters Euro zone stocks and bonds rallied on Thursday as banks snapped up almost quarter of a trillion euros of interest-free European Central Bank cash in what the ECB hopes will be the last outing for one of its main crisis-fighting tools. Banks took a whooping 233 billion euros ($251.31 billion) at the ECB's TLTRO (targeted long-term refinancing operation), over 100 billion more than had been forecast, fanning hopes of another spending stampede by market bulls. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 rose 0.25 percent with Frankfurt, Paris and Milan up as much as 0.6 percent and Wall Street set to open higher ahead of a key test of Donald Trump's policymaking ability. Highly indebted Italy, Spain and Portugal and euro zone bank also saw their bonds rally, as analysts bet that they would be the first items on the shopping list of many of the 474 banks that had taken the ECB money. "That (TLTRO) was a policy designed for extraordinary times, we are not in them now," said Nick Gartside, JP Morgan Asset Management's international CIO for fixed income. Markets showed no lasting reaction to Europe's latest terror attack, which for the second time in 10 years had seen the region's financial centre, London, targeted. These attacks, including in France, Germany and Belgium last year as well those in London and Madrid more than 10 years ago, have made little impact on economic confidence or financial markets in isolation. Sterling started steady and then climbed swiftly above $1.25 as more-resilient-than-expected UK retail sales data proved that Britain's consumers aren't being cowered by looming Brexit negotiations and rising inflation. The dollar was also creeping higher with attention firmly whether or not Trump will get his highly-publicised healthcare changes to roll back 'Obamacare' passed by U.S. lawmakers. "What we are getting this week is a questioning of how much of the risk rally is predicated on future Trump policy," said Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at State Street Global Markets. "There are concerns that this vote (on healthcare reform) will be a litmus test of how much fiscal expansion he can get through." After losing 3.5 percent in the past 10 days, the dollar was roughly steady at 111.05 yen. It gained as much 0.1 percent to $1.0786 per euro and hovered 0.1 percent higher against the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength. IRON SLAM In commodities markets, the focus remained on iron ore prices in China as they followed up a 16 percent slump on Wednesday by falling to their lowest in more than two months. Pressure came from a continued slide in steel and simmering concerns about demand in China, the world's top consumer. The most-traded iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange closed down 1.9 percent at 580.50 yuan ($84). The risk rally elsewhere saw gold dip however and oil rebounded, after touching its lowest since November overnight on data that showed U.S. inventories, already at a record high, grew by far more than forecast. Analysts said oil had found technical support and was being pushed up as traders took new long positions after the overnight low, but supply concerns kept the gains in check. U.S. crude added 0.75 percent to $48.40 a barrel and global benchmark Brent climbed 0.7 percent to $50.99. With several major currency pairs steadying after a week of losses for the dollar, the biggest FX mover of the day was Australia's dollar, down half a percent on the back of nerves in China's money market and a slump in prices for its iron ore exports. The New Zealand dollar was steady at $0.7046 after its central bank held interest rates at a record low 1.75 percent, and reiterated it would remain there for a "considerable" period of time. TRUMP TEST MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had advanced 0.2 percent overnight. Japan's Nikkei closed 0.2 percent higher too, as a weaker yen offset a political scandal over the relationship of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife with a Japanese nationalist education group that bought state-owned land. China's CSI 300 rose early on hopes that index compiler MSCI may include A-shares in its indices, but those gains were lost as money began flowing out of the mainland market through link to the Hong Kong exchange. Wall Street futures were pointing to modest gains, though it was likely to be tense going ahead of the Trump policy test.

Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website  ×  1  =  nine Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter The Ethereum price is up about 250% over the past four weeks thanks to a timely combination of rising institutional interest and a dire impasse among users of fellow cryptocurrency Bitcoin. A month ago, the price of Ethereum was under $13. Now it's trading at about $45, according to the website CoinMarketCap.com. Much of the surge in the Ethereum price has come from Bitcoin owners either bailing on Bitcoin or hedging their digital currency bet by purchasing some ether. But not all. Ethereum has developed substantial "buzz" as a cryptocurrency with features distinct from those of Bitcoin. Over the past year, this upstart has attracted attention from such heavy hitters as Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), and CME Group Inc. (Nasdaq: CME). Still, most of the vertical spike in the Ethereum price is the result of nervous capital moving from Bitcoin to Ethereum. About half of the Ethereum trading volume is from Bitcoin/Ethereum trades, with the rest coming from Ethereum/fiat pairs. (Ethereum purchases in U.S. dollars make up about one-fifth of the trades.) One highly publicized event that caused some of the movement occurred March 10, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) denied a rule change that would have allowed the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF to begin trading on the Bats BZX Exchange. Anticipation that the SEC would approve the Winklevoss ETF had pushed the Bitcoin price as high as $1,327, an all-time high. The price of Bitcoin plunged about $300 in the immediate aftermath of the SEC denial. But that's not the main reason Bitcoin capital has been moving into Ethereum in recent weeks. A Bitcoin Crisis Is Driving Up the Ethereum Price While the Bitcoin price has soared in recent months – despite a recent pullback, it's still up about 24% over the past three months – a crisis brewing for almost two years has finally come to a head. The argument is over how to increase the capacity of the Bitcoin network to process transactions. Right now it is close to capacity, which has at times caused transactions to be delayed. Fees are rising as well because transactions that offer higher fees get priority. One faction wants to increase the size of Bitcoin's blocks from one megabyte to two or even eight megabytes to fit more transactions in. The other wants to use a technology called Segregated Witness to squeeze more transactions into the space available. Related: How to Buy Bitcoins – Your Guide to Digital Profits Without getting into all the ugly details, this has become an extremely contentious civil war. Advocates of a variant of the Bitcoin software called Bitcoin Unlimited — the side that wants to increase the block sizes – have gained more support over the past few months, particularly from the powerful Bitcoin miners. That has raised the specter of what's called a "hard fork" of Bitcoin, which essentially would split Bitcoin into two incompatible variants. That's what has so many in the Bitcoin community concerned. After the split, it would be unclear which one is the "real" Bitcoin. The resulting confusion would play very badly in the mainstream financial media, causing the Bitcoin price of both versions to plummet. Such a disruptive event would also open the door for another cryptocurrency to steal some of Bitcoin's thunder. And Ethereum, the No. 2 cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, is the most logical candidate. Fear of a Bitcoin hard fork has driven the movement of capital from Bitcoin to Ethereum. Cryptocurrency exchanges like Bitfinex, Poloniex, and Kraken trade in both, making it easy for customers to buy Ethereum with their existing Bitcoin. And Ethereum has become the go-to choice because of the "buzz" I mentioned earlier. Here's why Ethereum is the new darling of the cryptocurrency world… The Ethereum Price Would Be Rising Even Without Bitcoin's Woes Join the conversation. Click here to jump to comments… (3) COMMENTS FACEBOOK COMMENTS TAGS Tags: Ethereum price Harold | March 22, 2017 The only way I could purchase Eth was by buying Bitcoin with fiat and exchanging it, so I can't agree with 'most of the vertical spike in the Ethereum price is the result of nervous capital moving from Bitcoin to Ethereum.' Reply Jeff | March 23, 2017 Ethereum can be purchased solely on its own via several online wallets, certainly the rise has a lot to do with the bitcoin debacle as people are looking at alternate crytocurrencies to trade and make money. Dash is another benefiting from bitcoin woes. Reply John | March 22, 2017 I agree with Harold's comment. I purchased all my ETH the same way, through BTC.

Subhadip Sircar Foreign funds have been pouring into India, driving stocks to a record and pushing up bond prices, since Narendra Modi’s party won an election in UP on 11 March. Photo: iStock Mumbai: Franklin Templeton Investments bought about Rs8,000 crore ($1.2 billion) of Indian government bonds in two days this week, a person with knowledge of the matter said. The purchases, made on Tuesday and Wednesday, were largely for tenors maturing in 2021-2023, said traders who asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly. JPMorgan Chase & Co. was the broker which bought the securities, they added. Foreign funds have been pouring into India, driving stocks to a record and pushing up bond prices, since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party won an election in a key state on 11 March. Yields on local 10-year bonds are among the highest in the region and the rupee’s rally post the election results has made it Asia’s best-performing currency this month. “The outcome of state elections, a dovish hike by the Federal Reserve and relatively attractive valuations have been the key drivers of inflows,” said Nagaraj Kulkarni, a senior rates strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. Overseas banks were the biggest buyers of government bonds on Wednesday, with net purchases of about Rs5,400 crore, data from the Clearing Corp. of India show. That marked an 11th straight day of net buying. Franklin Templeton’s Singapore-based spokeswoman Melissa Tan and JPMorgan’s India spokeswoman Mollica Senapati in Mumbai both declined to comment. The yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds slipped eight basis points in the last two sessions. It rose one basis point to 6.82% as of 12:29pm in Mumbai, reversing an earlier decline, after a report said authorities are set to discuss putting in place a new facility to absorb surplus cash in the banking system. Indian lenders, the biggest holders of sovereign debt, typically use excess funds to buy bonds. Modi’s majority win in Uttar Pradesh, India’s biggest state, is seen emboldening him to take more measures to spur expansion in Asia’s third-largest economy, which already boasts one of the fastest growth rates among the world’s major countries. The rupee was little changed at 65.4325 per dollar in Mumbai. Its 1.9% advance this month is the best performance in Asia.

Published: 09:52 March 23, 2017 Cleofe Maceda, Senior Web Reporter   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Dubai: Emirates aims to let passengers take their laptops past security gates at Dubai International Airport and collect the devices only before boarding as the world's largest international carrier seeks to minimise the impact of an electronics ban on routes to the US. The state-owned carrier is planning to permit devices affected by the ban within the security perimeter to allow passengers, particularly those flying in premium seats, to use laptops and tablets until the last possible moment, it said in an email. The airline will then take the items for storage in the cargo hold until arrival. Additional staff will be deployed to avoid disruptions to the flow of passengers, especially in the first few days of implementing the new rules, which come into effect on March 25. The US ban, announced Tuesday, prevents passengers on non-stop flights from 10 Middle Eastern airports from bringing large electronics into the aircraft cabin. Read: Canada, France mull electronic bans, too Watch: Emirates responds to laptop ban Q&A: What you need to know about the electronics ban  "This new security measure is disruptive and operationally challenging in several regards,"  Emirates President Tim Clark said in a statement. "We are closely monitoring the business impact of this new security measure, and we will decide on our strategies and interventions accordingly."  Emirates stands to be one of the hardest hit from the new security rules, as well-paying business customers seek alternatives to avoid costly downtime during flights. Airlines operating out of European hubs could gain with the promise of "making better use of business travelers' time,"  Jamie Baker, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a note, adding that the electronics ban has "the potential to alter global traffic flows."  "I am optimistic we will get through this,"  said Emirates' Clark, declining to comment on the motivations behind the ban. "Our job is to comply, and manage the commercial and operational challenge."  Compliance Emirates Airline, the largest carrier in the Middle East, runs 18 flights to 12 American destinations daily. The United States announced on Tuesday that passengers aboard incoming flights from ten Muslim-majority countries will be barred from carrying laptops, iPads, DSLR cameras and other devices in aircraft cabins. The ban will take effect on Saturday, March 25 until October 14 this year and affect people flying direct to the United States from Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the UAE, Amman, Jordan; Cairo; Istanbul; Jeddah and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia; Kuwait City; Casablanca, Morocco and Doha, Qatar. The United Kingdom also announced a similar ban affecting flights from some airports in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Jordan. Canada and France also announced they are mulling a similar move to ban electronics items larger than a mobile phone in the passenger cabin. Emirates had said it was informed about the ban only on Tuesday, leaving them a very small window to prepare for the new regulations. However, they are working to ensure disruption to passenger flow and impact on customer experience is minimised. “We are informing affected customers and coordinating with the various airport stakeholders,” Clark said. “Emirates will deploy extra staff at the airport to ease and assist passengers, especially in the first days of the new rules taking effect. Our aim is to ensure compliance with the new rules, while minimising disruption.” Allowing passengers to have access to their laptops and other devices until they are just about to board the plane will lessen the inconvenience among flyers, particularly those who are on a business trip and need to work on their personal laptops.  “We are working on a solution that will enable our passengers to utilise their electronic devices to the last possible moment – whereby they hand their laptops or tablets into our care just before boarding,” Clark said. “These will then be stowed in the cargo hold and returned to the passengers when the flight lands in the US. It will mean our passengers, particularly those travelling in the premium cabins or flying for business, can still work on their devices while enjoying our lounges at Dubai airport.” With inputs from Bloomberg  Expand Share your views.

Rockefeller served as chairman and CEO of Chase Manhattan Bank, which after a series of mergers is now JPMorgan Chase. But he was also born into great wealth as a grandson of John D. Rockefeller, who was the founder of the Standard Oil empire and America’s first billionaire. According to Forbes, David Rockefeller was worth $3.3 billion at the time of his death, making him the world’s oldest billionaire. He died in his sleep Monday morning of congestive heart failure at his home in Westchester County, New York, according to family spokesman Fraser P. Seitel. Rockefeller retired in 1980 as CEO and chairman Chase Manhattan after nearly nearly 35 years at the bank. But he was also well known for his charitable work. He donated almost $2 billion to a wide range of institutions, including The Rockefeller University, Harvard University, the Museum of Modern Art, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Council on Foreign Relations. He also founded the Trilateral Commission, an organization designed to promote cooperation among the nations of North America, Western Europe and Japan. To mark his 100th birthday in 2015, Rockefeller donated more than 1,022 acres of land in Seal Harbor, Maine to the Mount Desert Island Land and Garden Preserve. He was the last surviving grandchild of John D. Rockefeller, who started the oil empire that today includes both Exxon Mobil and Chevron. Many members of his family were drawn more to politics than to business. His brother Nelson served as governor of New York and U.S. vice president while another brother, Winthrop, served as governor of Arkansas. He also had a nephew, Jay Rockefeller, who served as U.S. senator from West Virginia. David Rockefeller started out in government as well, serving as secretary to former NYC mayor Fiorello LaGuardia before joining the army during World War II.

The commission found that from at least 2007, Citibank and its competitors had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for spot trades in relation to currency trading involving US dollar/ rand currency pairing. The commission found that the banks manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times. Banks implicated include Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase, JP Chase Bank, Investec, Standard New York Securities, Standard Chartered Bank, HSBC Bank, Credit Suisse Group, Standard Bank of SA, Commerzbank AG, Australia and New Zealand banking group, Nomura international, Macquaerie Bank, Absa Bank, Barclays Capital and Barclays Bank. The Competition Tribunal held a hearing in Pretoria yesterday to determine the validity of the terms of Citibank’s settlement agreement with the commission. The commission had determined that Citibank should pay a fine of R69m, an amount less than 10% of the company’s turnover (which is usually the benchmark for such fines). Citibank undertook to cooperate with the commission and avail witnesses to help in the prosecution of the other banks that colluded. The commission’s head of the cartel division, Makgale Mohlala, said Citibank had decided to not disclose the percentage of turnover to which the R69m fine amounted. However, he said that the fine, despite being less than 10% of Citi’s annual turnover, was justified because it was a means of incentivising the bank in providing substantial evidence to prosecute the other banks. Commissioner Tembinkosi Bonakele said that the settlement with Citibank was to encourage speedy settlement and full disclosure to strengthen the prosecution case against the other banks. He said that many of the banks involved are misleading the public in denying their involvement in the cartel, whereas in tribunal hearings they sing a different tune. “ The other banks are not cooperating but Citibank has already presented us with evidence on the cartel and how they manipulated the rand and to what effect,” he said. Mohlala said the commission is proceeding with prosecutions of other banks as they have denied their involvement in the cartel. “They refused to cooperate, therefore we are proceeding with Citibank, Absa and Barclays as our key witnesses to help bring the case to fruition. We are ready to take them on,” he said. -THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za basil RELATED ARTICLES National Shocking child pregnancy statistics revealed National Struggle veteran Kathrada condition stable National Social grants to be paid on time National Sister expected to take stand in Henri van Breda axe murder case Mpumalanga Bushbuckridge ANC denies assaulting DA councillor NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

At center stage is the familiar sight of Governor Elvira Nabiullina staring down inflation. The central bank took the unusual step of showing its cards ahead of time, with the head of its monetary policy department, Igor Dmitriev, saying a hold and reductions of 25 to 50 basis points in the 10 percent benchmark will be under consideration on Friday. Only last month it warned the potential for easing in the first half has "diminished." But the meeting also marks the most tightly contested decision among forecasters since last July, with some of the world's biggest banks divided over policy makers' readiness to pull off their first rate cut in six months. VIDEOS TOP JOBS While JPMorgan Chase & Co. moved up its call for the year's first decrease to this week from June — and now predicts a reduction of a quarter point — Goldman Sachs sees a pause for another month. Credit Suisse is among three of the 40 participants in a Bloomberg survey to see a cut of half a point. The split goes to the heart of the dilemma facing the central bank. While price growth near historical lows makes the case for easing obvious, the disagreement is over the best timing to loosen policy as inflation expectations remain elevated. Although the Bank of Russia moved in 50 basis-point steps for its last three reductions, it may switch to quarter percentage-point decreases, which is more typical for countries where inflation isn't high, according to First Deputy Governor Ksenia Yudaeva. "Low inflation momentum and strong currency have opened space for a more front-loaded easing path and the central bank needed to untie its hands by preparing the market for a more dovish shift," JPMorgan analyst Anatoliy Shal said in a report, pointing to Dmitriev's comments. The expectation now is that the central bank will "move in 25 basis-point steps at (nearly) every meeting, not in 50 basis-point steps at every second meeting." Of the four most accurate forecasters, three — B&N Bank PJSC, HSBC and Renaissance Capital — predict no change. Forward-rate agreements signal 49 basis points of decreases in borrowing costs over the next three months, the most since late January. The ruble is up 3 percent against the dollar since the central bank's last rate meeting on Feb. 2. "There is room to reduce the policy rate but we do not see any reason for the Russian central bank to rush at the current juncture," HSBC currency strategists Murat Toprak and Dominic Bunning said in a report. "The priority has to remain on inflation, whilst economic activity is moving in the right direction anyway. The fact that inflation expectations are still high and the oil price is weaker call for prudence." The Bank of Russia has said a "moderately tight" stance is needed to bring inflation to its 4 percent target at end-2017. While the central bank's research and forecasting department conceded this month that price growth has begun to slow "faster" than forecast, it only saw grounds for "very gradual" monetary easing. After their February meeting, policy makers said the letup in prices "is partially attributed to temporary factors," including a bumper crop and a stronger ruble exchange rate. It's an argument they may use again this time, especially as inflation expectations, a key concern for the central bank, rose in February.

Moneycontrol News Hindustan Zinc Credit Suisse has maintained its neutral stance on the stock with an unchanged target price of Rs 340. It terms the company’s payout as a big one and stated that a stake sale by the government looked unlikely anytime soon. With the dividend, the Centre has received Rs 5,800 crore, which should help its finances in FY17. The brokerage house prefers Vedanta over Hindustan Zinc. Macquarie has maintained its outperform rating with a reduced target price of Rs 340. It has also lowered FY18-19 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 6 percent factoring lower cash. The research firm believes the dividend cannot be read as a precursor to government stake sale. It, however, makes a strong case for high dividend yield should drive a multiple re-rating. On the payout, the dividend implies 143 percent payout for FY17. The special dividend is lead by the government’s fiscal requirements, it said. Deutsche Bank has reiterated its buy call on the stock with a target of Rs 364 as it views the dividend payout as a highly positive thing. He believes the distribution of surplus cash will support a re-rating. The quantum of dividend was higher than expectations and sees 700 bps improvement on return on equities. Furthermore, it believes that the premium valuations for the firm should sustain given the strong zinc pricing outlook. Dr Reddy’s Nomura has a buy rating with an unchanged target of Rs 3,594. It highlighted that concerns on inspection outcome have been affirmed now. Cipla JPMorgan has a neutral call on the stock with a target of Rs 575. The research firm sees some traction in respiratory business but large opportunities are still some time away. The company currently awaits large ANDA approvals in the US, it said. But domestic formulation is growing higher than the industry, but watch out for the impact of goods and services tax (GST), the research firm said.

Macquarie has maintained outperform rating on the stock with a target of Rs 345. It has highlighted the windfall income of USD 1.2 billion from the dividend payout of Hindustan Zinc. The research firm pegs tax leakage from dividends to be neutral to the company’s target price. Furthermore, it feels that the company may be able to pay higher dividend, given tax credits against dividend distribution tax paid by Hindustan Zinc.JPMorgan too has an overweight call on the stock with a target of Rs 330. It concurs with previous view that the dividend is a big positive for the company. The research firm further expects the company to return the cash to shareholders through a buyback or dividend. Dish TVMacquarie has maintained outperform rating on the stock with a target of Rs 125. The stock remains a top pick in the Indian Media space, the research firm said. Clarity on GST rate and subscription uptick from Q1 will be the key near term variables, the Macquarie has said. Motherson SumiMorgan Stanley is underweight on the stock with a target of Rs 258.

It points out that the valuation must be viewed in the context of high earnings growth visibility and feels that government initiatives are an opportunity for structural increase in market share. Next catalyst for the stock is strong earnings growth in Q4FY17. IT sector CLSA believes the weakness in the dollar index may boost dollar revenue in Q4 and first quarter of next fiscal. Simultaneously, sharp rupee strengthening is likely to be a headwind on margins. Hedging and lower wage hikes may limit FY18 earnings impact.Furthermore, growth in dollar revenue, buyback or dividends could be stronger drivers than forex pressure. Cross-currencies are likely to help Q4 growth by 50-90 basis points. tags #Cipla #Dish TV #dividend payout #Hindustan Zinc #IT Sector #Motherson Sumi #Stocks Views #TVS Motor #Vedanta Related news Business Reliance Industries may move to Rs 1400: Ashwani Gujral Mar 25, 2017 12:09 PM Business Idea Cellular to break 200-DMA, head to Rs 75-80: Ashwani Gujral Mar 25, 2017 12:05 PM Business Expect 8-10% rally in HPCL, BPCL; ITC may head to Rs 315-320: Ashwani Gujral Mar 25, 2017 11:49 AM Business Buy Bank of Baroda; Jet Airways may test Rs 520, Indiabulls Housing Finance Rs 1010: Ashwani Gujral Mar 25, 2017 11:16 AM Business 'HZL special dividend credit positive for Vedanta Resources' Mar 24, 2017 09:05 PM Business Mkt to trade sideways; spaces like cement, auto ancillary, PSU banks look good: Pros Mar 24, 2017 05:19 PM Business Wabco India can be a Rs 10000 stock in 18 months: Mehraboon Irani Mar 24, 2017 04:50 PM Business IRB Infrastructure looks attractive, prefer Dalmia Bharat: Mehraboon Irani Mar 24, 2017 04:36 PM Business Bharat Financial Inclusion may test Rs 1000: Prakash Gaba Mar 24, 2017 04:25 PM News Most Popular Top News Maybe it's time for hostile takeovers; govt must back honest risks: Uday Kotak D-Mart bumper listing: Should you buy, book profits or hold shares?

Jump to Navigation AU EDITION | Monday, March 27, 2017 As of 2:24 AM AEST Subscribe AU Edition Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition U.K. Edition U.S. Edition FOLLOW | Make IBT your homepage Search Home Business News Sports Life Entertainment Video News US banks secure lead over Europe, JP Morgan on top By Frenalyn Wilson on March 23 2017 2:07 PM 0 0 0 0 The offices of JP Morgan in the Canary Wharf district of London, January 28, 2014. Reuters/Simon Newman Investment banks in the United States have secure global lead over Europe, with the top five spots now firmly in the hands of US banks. Data from the industry analytics firm, Coalition, shows that JP Morgan keeps its reputation as number one in the global investment banking league in 2016. The bank’s revenues surged 11 percent to US$25.2 billion ($AU32.8 billion) last year from US$22.7 billion ($AU29.6 billion) in 2015. The revenue came from trading, mergers and acquisitions, among other investment banking activities. Last month, JP Morgan’s CIB CEO Daniel Pinto said the bank saw progress across all segments of equities. “Clients want bigger and better JPMorgan, and that’s where we invested,” he said. Citi Bank, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley are also among the top banks by revenue. Morgan Stanley is in fifth place in the ranking, a spot it shared with Germany's Deutsche Bank in 2015. US banks currently take in around a two-thirds share of the investment banking revenue pie, with the gap consistently improving since 2011 when the split between the US and Europe was roughly 50-50. Amrit Shahani, research director at Coalition, said European banks went through some significant trading underperformance in 2016. “They should improve, albeit from a low base. We expect them to maintain and build on their market share this year,” CNBC quotes Shahani. Meanwhile, Reuters reports that shares in US banks dropped on Tuesday as investors shrunk back from a post-election rally over concerns that the US President Donald Trump would not be able to fulfil his promises for large-scale relief on tax and regulation. For instance, Bank of America Corp shares fell 5.8 percent while KeyCorp was down 6.5 percent. Investors are concerned that if the Trump administration won’t manage to pass the healthcare bill this week, it would be harder to execute a regulatory reform. "The market is starting to get a little fed up with the lack of progress in healthcare because everything else is being put on the backburner,” RJ Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York, said. Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, backed up Grant’s statement, saying people are already looking at who would suffer if regulatory change is not pushed through. Trading in US Treasuries around the US Federal Reserve's rate hike announcement reportedly hurt US banks too.

REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo By Tina Bellon | NEW YORK NEW YORK Starting on Monday, Wells Fargo & Co depositors can withdraw money using a smartphone at any branded ATM, the latest sign of U.S. lenders moving away from traditional brick-and-mortar banking. Jonathan Velline, Wells Fargo's head of ATM and branch banking, said that the San Francisco-based bank decided to apply the smartphone technology to all of its 13,000 cash machines after piloting the idea in select locations across the country. Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co are among the big banks that have announced digital upgrades to their ATM infrastructure, but Wells Fargo is the first U.S. bank to roll out cardless machines across its entire network. The 20 million customers on Wells Fargo's mobile banking app will be able to request an eight-digit code to enter along with their personal identification code at an ATM to retrieve cash. "The new feature allows customers to withdraw cash at any time, even when they don't have their cards on them," Velline said. The new option will also improve protections against data theft, Velline said. "Security certainly was a big aspect of the cardless feature and the two-step identification helps reduce the risk of fraud," Velline said, adding that the elimination of cards prevented so-called skimming techniques that criminals employ to read and store data of cards inserted into ATMs. Wells Fargo, the third-largest U.S. bank, was once the envy of Wall Street, able to seemingly sell its customers a range of different products and highly regarded for its stock price which had once made it the world's most valuable bank. But last year's revelations over a sales scandal that involved the creation of as many as 2.1 million fraudulent accounts in customers' names without their permission took a toll on the company. The lender has since seen a sharp drop in the number of consumers opening checking and credit card accounts. As have many other U.S. lenders over the last years, Wells Fargo has invested in the development of digital tools to attract customers and slash costs at its retail branches. "Digitalizing services is unquestionably the way to the future and the arguments are very powerful, but U.S. banks are still far behind," said Gerard du Toit, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Company. Accessible, well-designed digital offers not only provide a massive cost advantage, but also significantly improve customer loyalty, du Toit said.

Jonathan Velline, Wells Fargo's head of ATM and branch banking, said that the San Francisco-based bank decided to apply the smartphone technology to all of its 13,000 cash machines after piloting the idea in select locations across the country. Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co are among the big banks that have announced digital upgrades to their ATM infrastructure, but Wells Fargo is the first U.S. bank to roll out cardless machines across its entire network. The 20 million customers on Wells Fargo's mobile banking app will be able to request an eight-digit code to enter along with their personal identification code at an ATM to retrieve cash. "The new feature allows customers to withdraw cash at any time, even when they don't have their cards on them," Velline said. The new option will also improve protections against data theft, Velline said. "Security certainly was a big aspect of the cardless feature and the two-step identification helps reduce the risk of fraud," Velline said, adding that the elimination of cards prevented so-called skimming techniques that criminals employ to read and store data of cards inserted into ATMs. Wells Fargo, the third-largest U.S. bank, was once the envy of Wall Street, able to seemingly sell its customers a range of different products and highly regarded for its stock price which had once made it the world's most valuable bank. But last year's revelations over a sales scandal that involved the creation of as many as 2.1 million fraudulent accounts in customers' names without their permission took a toll on the company. The lender has since seen a sharp drop in the number of consumers opening checking and credit card accounts. As have many other U.S. lenders over the last years, Wells Fargo has invested in the development of digital tools to attract customers and slash costs at its retail branches. "Digitalizing services is unquestionably the way to the future and the arguments are very powerful, but U.S. banks are still far behind," said Gerard du Toit, a partner at consulting firm Bain &amp; Company. Accessible, well-designed digital offers not only provide a massive cost advantage, but also significantly improve customer loyalty, du Toit said.

Jonathan Velline, Wells Fargo's head of ATM and branch banking, said that the San Francisco-based bank decided to apply the smartphone technology to all of its 13,000 cash machines after piloting the idea in select locations across the country. Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co are among the big banks that have announced digital upgrades to their ATM infrastructure, but Wells Fargo is the first U.S. bank to roll out cardless machines across its entire network. The 20 million customers on Wells Fargo's mobile banking app will be able to request an eight-digit code to enter along with their personal identification code at an ATM to retrieve cash. "The new feature allows customers to withdraw cash at any time, even when they don't have their cards on them," Velline said. The new option will also improve protections against data theft, Velline said. "Security certainly was a big aspect of the cardless feature and the two-step identification helps reduce the risk of fraud," Velline said, adding that the elimination of cards prevented so-called skimming techniques that criminals employ to read and store data of cards inserted into ATMs. Wells Fargo, the third-largest U.S. bank, was once the envy of Wall Street, able to seemingly sell its customers a range of different products and highly regarded for its stock price which had once made it the world's most valuable bank. But last year's revelations over a sales scandal that involved the creation of as many as 2.1 million fraudulent accounts in customers' names without their permission took a toll on the company. The lender has since seen a sharp drop in the number of consumers opening checking and credit card accounts. As have many other U.S. lenders over the last years, Wells Fargo has invested in the development of digital tools to attract customers and slash costs at its retail branches. "Digitalizing services is unquestionably the way to the future and the arguments are very powerful, but U.S. banks are still far behind," said Gerard du Toit, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Company. Accessible, well-designed digital offers not only provide a massive cost advantage, but also significantly improve customer loyalty, du Toit said.

Main suspects in this case are former Head of St. Maarten Tourist Bureau Regina LaBega (57), and ECDMC’s managing directors Fabian Badejo (66) and E.A.I. F. (37). All suspects, including ECDMC, will have to answer to charges of embezzlement in employment, theft, forgery, and tax evasion. During Thursday’s session, Prosecutor Nanouk Lemmers read out the voluminous indictments. LaBega was the only suspect present during Thursday’s hearing. She will be represented in this case by attorney Shaira Bommel. The other suspects will be represented by lawyer Safira Ibrahim. The three suspects were arrested May 30, 2016, based on “complaints” filed by then Head of the Finance Department Bas Roorda in November 2010. They were released three days later. Detectives have been busy with the investigation into staff working at St. Maarten Tourism Bureau for quite some time. National Detectives conducted house searches at five different locations on October 15, 2015. The investigation resulted in a number of sub-investigations, which led to an extensive case file. Among charges is the embezzlement of US $142,000 in payments to ECDMC from an account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank in New York which were not meant to cover the operational cost of the New York Tourist Office (NTO), or for activities and expenditures which were not directly related to the North-American market. The suspects will also be charged with money-laundering to the amount of $140,000, Lemmers said. The suspects were also charged with embezzlement of almost US $27,500 at the Tourist Bureau between December 3, 2008, and October 21, 2010, in using Chase Bank cheques for other purposes. LaBega will also have to answer to allegations that she committed forgery in writing a job letter. All defendants are also suspected of membership in a criminal organisation between September 2008 and June 2011, aimed at committing crimes, such as embezzlement and evasion of profit, income and wage tax. The charges will not be discussed during the May-10 hearing. On that day, the lawyers will have the opportunity to request additional investigations and the hearing of witnesses.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 24 March 2017 | MYT 12:43 PM YouTube hate videos snare Ikea ads as Google crisis spreads More cracks showing: The controversy over ad placement, now in its second week, is expanding at a pace Alphabet Inc’s Google has struggled to match in its response. — Reuters Major advertisers across Europe are still appearing alongside extremist YouTube videos days after technology giant Google said it was taking steps to protect its clients from inadvertently supporting hate.  An anti-Semitic clip claiming the existence of a “Jewish World Order” was featured alongside advertisements in Germany from insurer AXA SA, oil company Total SA in France, Range Rover vehicles in South Africa, footwear retailer Skopunkten and website Tradera in Sweden, Bloomberg searches of YouTube from each country found on Thursday.  Separately, a sermon by preacher Ahmad Musa Jibril, who according to US prosecutors once took credit for a terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia, can be viewed alongside advertisements from Nissan in Sweden and wireless carrier MTN Group in South Africa. Meanwhile, the Islamophobic English Defence League gathers support from advertisers Total, Netflix Inc, IBM and watchmaker Tag Heuer International in France.  The controversy over ad placement, now in its second week, is expanding at a pace Alphabet Inc’s Google has struggled to match in its response. On Thursday, as Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt said Google could “get pretty close” to guaranteeing companies’ ads won’t be placed near hateful material, advertisers throughout Europe were confronting more than a dozen new examples and scrambling to protect their brands.  “We didn’t know that our ads were played in this context,” Axa spokeswoman Anja Kroll said in an email. “We have immediately arranged for an update of the filters and stopped the delivery” of the ads because “diversity, tolerance and openness are values that are of key importance for us and that we practice daily.”  Awaiting answers  While Axa hasn’t pulled its ads from YouTube, the German unit is using “blacklist” filters to prevent its ads from appearing next to extremist, racist or other undesired content, Kroll said. In this case, she said, the filters apparently failed.  “We don’t comment on individual videos but as announced, we’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear,” a Google spokesperson said. “We’re also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.”  Range Rover said in an email it was suspending its YouTube campaign in South Africa while it investigates. Telenor Sweden, which had an ad showing before a propaganda video from a Swedish neo-Nazi group, also halted all YouTube advertising, according to Aron Samuelsson, a spokesman.  Nissan said it was “urgently reviewing” with Google while Nilson Group AB, owner of Skopunkten, said it had asked its media agency about the ads and is “awaiting answers,” according to Linda Fernell, a spokeswoman. Total, IBM, MTN, Tag Heuer, HBO and Netflix didn’t respond or had no immediate comment. Tradera’s owner, Paypal Holdings Inc, declined to comment.  In Sweden, an Ikea AB spot was found alongside a homophobic and anti-Semitic video entitled: “Gay Pride Parade a Tool of International Jews.” An ad for HBO’s The Young Pope found its way to the pre-roll for “Jewish Hypocrisy – Flooding Europe With Immigrants” in Spain.  “It is completely unacceptable that IKEA appears in a context like this,” spokeswoman Cecilia Nettelbladt Stenberg said by phone. “What we’ve done now is to ask our media agency to immediately investigate the reason behind this.”  Maximum volume  The discomfort highlights the reliance of Google and Facebook Inc on automated computer programs that maximise volume and have helped them dominate online advertising, through their popular sites and their advertising networks. Digital advertising grew by 17% globally to US$178bil (RM788.54bil) in 2016, according to marketing consultant Magna Global, which projects that digital-based ad sales will overtake TV to become the No. 1 media category this year.  The global array of companies caught up in the controversy illustrates the scale of the problem for Google, which risks potential financial and reputational damage. The company was already facing claims in lawsuit by the family of a terror attack victim that it profits from ads linked to terrorist propaganda promoting violence. The latest crisis erupted after a Times of London investigation last week revealed ads running alongside offensive content. Alphabet’s market value has dropped by about US$24bil (RM106.12bil) this week.  “A cascade of major brand boycotts for Google ad spend (mostly non-search) has emerged, raising concerns on first quarter and second quarter results and the future of programmatic advertising,” Justin Post, an analyst with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a research note on March 23, referencing the automated software programs Google uses to match advertisers with content online.  JP Morgan Chase & Co and Ford Motor Co suspended their YouTube ads on March 23. AT&T Inc, Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Verizon Communications Inc joined the boycott earlier this week, after British Broadcasting Corp, Sainsbury Plc, Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp said they had pulled ads in the UK.  The latest examples show the scope of the Google’s problem isn’t confined to two large markets. It’s global, affecting major advertisers in big European markets including Germany, France and Sweden, as well as South Africa.  At Skopunkten, a major shoe-store chain in Sweden, spokeswoman Fernell said she was unaware of the “Jewish World Order” video but said the company had noticed some unwanted videos popping up in its YouTube campaigns. “I hope they can help us redirect the ads,” she said. “We need to learn more about this.”  While Google’s tools can be incredibly sophisticated, allowing ads to follow users from site to site, the software hasn’t fully matched the human judgment necessary to protect brands from inadvertently funnelling cash to causes their customers would find objectionable. The high number of intermediaries in digital advertising further complicates the problem. So Google’s announced fixes may not completely solve the challenge.  “Google isn’t yet fully addressing advertisers’ concerns and needs to take stronger steps to regain the trust of brands,” Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients on March 23.  Google said on March 21 that it was increasing safeguards to protect advertisers, such as automatically excluding ads from videos deemed “potentially objectionable” and giving advertisers more control over placement. While YouTube revenue isn’t reported separately by Google, analysts estimate the video site brings in billions of dollars each year, and say it’s among Google’s fastest-growing businesses.  Schmidt, in an appearance on Fox Business Network’s Mornings With Maria on March 23, said Google can generally ensure clients that their ads won’t be placed next to “hate” content.  “We match the ads and the content,” Schmidt said, according to a transcript from Fox Business. “But because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match.”  He said that Google had tightened its policies and increased the amount of time it spends manually reviewing the content, “and so I think we’re going to be okay.” — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Advertising & Media , Analyst Reports , Technology Related Stories You May Be Interested Iranian immigrant rose to building Google’s business, leading Twitter’s board Standout screens shake up smartphone design in latest-gen handsets OnePlus 3T is now available China's ZTE posts Q4 net loss after US sanction case fine Staying connected through social media Is technology ruining your relationship?

Devices affected by the ban will be allowed within the airport's security perimeter so that passengers can use their laptops and tablets until the last possible moment, the state-owned carrier said in a statement. As all hand baggage will be subject to a "detailed search" at the gate, customers will need to present the items there to be packed in boxes and carried in the plane's cargo hold during the flight. The service is free of charge, it said. Additional staff will be deployed to prevent disruptions, especially in the first few days of implementing the new rules, which come into effect on March 25. The US ban, announced on Tuesday, prevents travellers on non-stop flights from 10 Middle Eastern airports from bringing large electronics into the aircraft cabin.   US bans big electronics as carry-on iterms from 10 airports Related Story US, UK to ban electronics on flights from Middle East, North Africa   4-41985585.1_41999365_-_22_03_2017_-_files-us-travel-aviation-security.jpg Related Story What to know about US, British cabin ban on larger electronic devices The ban applies to flights from 10 airports in the region, including direct flights to the United States from Dubai International Airport and Ataturk Airport in Istanbul. US airlines do not operate direct flights out of the airports included in the ban. A similar British ban covers all airports in Turkey, Jordan and four other countries, but not the United Arab Emirates. Both countries have cited credible threats to civil aviation from Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group as the reason for the ban, which has come under criticism for targeting majority-Muslim countries. "Perhaps the silver lining to this is that they can now justifiably give themselves a break from their devices," Emirates President Tim Clark said in the statement. Emirates stands to be one of the hardest hit by the new security rules, as well-paying business customers will probably seek alternatives to avoid costly downtime during flights. Airlines operating out of European hubs could gain with the promise of "making better use of business travellers' time", Jamie Baker, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said in a note, adding that the electronics ban has "the potential to alter global traffic flows". Only about 6 per cent of passengers who use online links aboard Emirates' US flights connect with their laptops and 4 per cent operate tablets, with the remaining 90 per cent gaining access through smartphones, Emirates' Clark said. The prohibition applies only to the carrier's nonstop US services and not flights that stop in Milan or Athens on the way, Emirates said.

It’s easy to see why, with the “smart money” — traders betting through the Fed funds futures market — expecting another hike just three months from now. In all, the market’s calling for three hikes this year, and so is Janet Yellen. One Rate Hike Down, Two to Go? But if you let that scare you away from high-yield sectors like CEFs, real estate investment trusts and preferred shares, you’ll miss out on some serious income. In a moment, I’ll show you how to pick the CEFs with the most upside, along with the high payouts these funds are known for. First, here’s why I’m pounding the table on them now. Busting a Big CEF Myth When many folks think of CEFs, the first word that comes to mind is leverage, and the risk that funds’ borrowing costs will spike along with rates. And it’s certainly true that borrowed cash plays a big part in CEFs’ outsized dividend payouts. Take the Calamos Strategic Total Return Fund (NASDQ:CSQ), one of the oldest equity-based CEFs (CSQ holds 63% of its portfolio in common stocks, with the rest in corporate bonds, convertible bonds and preferred shares). Thanks to leverage, the fund’s management team can borrow cheaply, at around the LIBOR rate (more on that in a moment) to buy investments with higher returns. The difference heads out to investors in the form of dividends. It’s why CSQ can hold stocks with middling dividend yields, like Apple, Inc. (NASAQ:AAPL) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), yet hand its shareholders a 9.0% payout. 7 Dividend Stocks With Yields That Grow Like Weeds So it’s no wonder CEF investors are concerned. But history suggests now is not the time to avoid the space—it’s time to get greedy for yield instead. To see why, let’s look at the last rising-rate period, from July 2004 through June 2006. Back then, the 3-month LIBOR rate, which moves in lockstep with the Fed funds rate, spiked to 5.48%. And at 1.7% at the outset, LIBOR was starting at a much higher baseline than today’s 1.1%. That’s an explosion—and it should have demolished CEFs, right? Wrong. Of the 10 largest CEFs by assets under management (AUM) today, six were around then—and all posted double-digit total returns during that two-year span. What’s more, their average return of 17.4% bested the S&P 500’s 17.0%. And three — the Nuveen AMT-Free Municipal Credit Income Fund (NYSE:NVG), the Nuveen California Quality Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:NAC) and the Nuveen Municipal Credit Income Fund (NYSE:NZF) — beat the market handily. Muni-Bond CEFs Rose With Rates… It’s true that all three of these are municipal-bond funds, which are the biggest CEF category by AUM. But popular stock-based CEFs — such as CSQ and the Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (NYSE:GDV), run by famed value investor Mario Gabelli — did just fine, too: … And So Did Equity Funds The bottom line? We’ve still got a long way to go (and likely not in this rate-hike cycle) before rising rates become a significant headwind for CEFs. And we can give ourselves some extra protection by zeroing in on funds with reasonable leverage. That’s easy: right now, the average CEF’s leverage is equal to 33% of AUM, so any fund with a ratio below that will have less to fear from higher borrowing costs. CSQ qualifies, at 29.8%, as does GDV, at just 23.9%. My No. 1 Rule: Buy the Disappearing Discount So put your rate fears aside. Because there’s something else that will have a far greater impact on your CEF returns: a fund’s discount to net asset value (NAV), and more important, whether management has a plan to narrow that discount.

Born: 12 June 1915 in New York. Died: 20 March 2017 in New York, aged 101. David Rockefeller was the last of his generation in a famous American family that taught its children that wealth brings great responsibility. Even as children, he and his siblings had to set aside portions of their allowances for charitable giving. That lesson lasted throughout his life; to mark his 100th birthday in 2015, Rockefeller gave 1,000 acres of land next to a national park to the state of Maine. Rockefeller was the grandson of Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller and the youngest of five sons and one daughter born to John D. Rockefeller Jr. He was also the guardian of his family’s fortune and head of a sprawling network of family interests, both business and philanthropic, that ranged from environmental conservation to the arts. Unlike his brothers Nelson, the governor of New York who hungered for the White House and was briefly vice president, and Winthrop, a governor of Arkansas, David Rockefeller wielded power and influence without ever seeking public office. Among his many accomplishments were spurring the project that led to the World Trade Center. And unlike his other brothers, John D. 3rd and Laurance, who shied from the spotlight and were known for philanthropy, David Rockefeller embraced business and traveled and spoke widely as a champion of enlightened capitalism. “American capitalism has brought more benefits to more people than any other system in any part of the world at any time in history,” he said. Rockefeller graduated from Harvard in 1936 and received a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago in 1940. He served in the Army during World War II, then began climbing the ranks of management at Chase Bank. That bank merged with the Manhattan company in 1955. He was named Chase Manhattan’s president in 1961 and chairman and CEO eight years later. He retired in 1981 at age 65 after a 35-year career. In his role of business statesman, Rockefeller preached capitalism at home and favoured assisting economies abroad on grounds that bringing prosperity to the Third World would create customers for American products. He parted company with some of his fellow capitalists on income taxes, calling it unseemly to earn a million and then find ways to avoid paying the taxes. In 2015, Forbes magazine estimated his fortune at $3 billion. As one of the Rockefeller grandchildren, David belonged to the last generation in which the inherited family billions were concentrated in a few hands. The next generation, known as “the cousins,” are more numerous. Rockefeller was estimated to have met more than 200 rulers in more than 100 countries during his lifetime, and often was treated as if he were a visiting head of state. Under Rockefeller, Chase – now known as JPMorgan Chase – was the first U.S. bank to open offices in the Soviet Union and China and, in 1974, the first to open an office in Egypt after the Suez crisis of 1956. In his early travels to South Africa, Rockefeller arranged clandestine meetings with several underground black leaders. “I find it terribly important to get overall impressions beyond those I get from businessmen,” he said. But Rockefeller took a lot of heat for his bank’s substantial dealings with South Africa’s white separatist regime and for helping the deposed, terminally ill Shah of Iran come to New York for medical treatment in 1979, the move that triggered the 13-month U.S. embassy hostage crisis in Tehran. Rockefeller maintained the family’s patronage of the arts, including its long-standing relationship with the Museum of Modern Art, which his mother had been a fervent patron of. His private art collection was once valued at $500 million. The Rockefeller estate at Kykuit, overlooking the Hudson River north of New York City, is the repository of four generations of family history. One of the major efforts of Rockefeller’s later years was directed at restoring family influence in the landmark Rockefeller Center, most of which had been sold in the 1980s to Japanese investors. He eventually organised an investor group to buy back 45 per cent of the property. His philanthropy earned him a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honour, in 1998. Rockefeller and his wife, the former Margaret McGrath, were married in 1940 and had six children – David Jr, Richard, Abby, Neva, Margaret and Eileen. His wife, an active conservationist, died in 1996.

British retail sales volumes in February rose by 1.4 per cent from January, beating the 0.4 per cent increase forecast by a Reuters poll of economists and following three consecutive monthly declines. For the three months to February, this was still the biggest slide for retail sales in nearly seven years as higher fuel prices eroded shoppers' disposable income. The Office for National Statistics said the monthly improvement was too little to offset a drag from weak demand in the previous months. But added to comments by Bank of England (BOE) deputy governor Ben Broadbent, the numbers bolstered speculation the bank might be able to raise interest rates at least once in the next year, driving the pound half a cent higher. It peaked at US$1.2528, its highest since Feb 24, before retreating to US$1.2505, up 0.2 per cent on the day. It was also 0.4 per cent stronger at 86.20 pence per euro. "The concerns about the UK economy are overdone," said Mr Nick Gartside, international chief investment officer for fixed income at JPMorgan Asset Management. "You look at the CPI release on Tuesday, you look at the retail numbers today and it does feel like the Bank of England can begin to think about raising rates. Why shouldn't it?" The sterling has lost nearly a fifth of its value since the Brexit referendum in June, contributing to a spike in domestic inflation which has further weighed on previously robust consumer spending. A stream of recent data had suggested British consumer sentiment waning, as rising prices force Britons to spend less on non-essential items. That speaks for continued easy monetary policy. But signs that BOE will step in to support the pound with both hawkish talk and potentially a rise in official borrowing costs have instead dominated the past week's trade in the pound. Mr Broadbent said yesterday it was possible that interest rates could rise, although he also highlighted the strong sense of caution among investors about the outlook for Britain after Brexit. A number of major banks have warned in the past month that the sterling could fall below US$1.20 as public jousting with Brussels on the terms of Britain's departure from the EU gets going after the launch of talks next month. ING currency strategist Viraj Patel said: "The headline (number) is great, but the actual underlying story is still weakening ... that's what matters for a policymaker."

Still, the labor market continues to tighten, which together with the strength in housing, should underpin economic growth."New home sales are the secret sauce that helps make the economy grow," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. "This will put some backbone in investment spending and make this economic expansion more sustainable." The Commerce Department said new home sales increased 6.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000 units last month, the highest level since July 2016. Sales have now more than recouped the sharp drop suffered in December.Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.7 percent of the overall market, rising 0.7 percent to a rate of 565,000 units in February. Sales were up 12.8 percent compared to a year ago, showing the housing market's resilience despite reduced affordability. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around 4.30 percent. House prices increased 5.7 percent in January from a year ago, according a government report published on Wednesday. Last month's new home sales were likely partially buoyed by unseasonably warm weather. Most economists see a limited impact on housing from higher mortgage rates because a tightening labor market is improving job opportunities for young adults. "Rising mortgage rates don't appear to have been much of an impediment to increasing housing demand in February as solid job gains, faster wage growth, and stronger household formations offset the drop in affordability," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.  In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 258,000 for the week ended March 18.Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market for 80 straight weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970 when the labor market was smaller. The job market is currently near full employment. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose only 1,000 to 240,000 last week. U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors focused on whether the House of Representatives would pass a Republican-sponsored bill to begin dismantling Obamacare, which is seen as the first significant policy test for President Donald Trump.Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the PHLX housing index gaining 0.7 percent. U.S. government bond prices fell while the dollar rose slightly against a basket of currencies.LABOR MARKET FIRMING The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for March's nonfarm payrolls report. The four-week average of claims fell 7,750 between the February and March survey weeks, suggesting another month of strong job gains. Job growth has averaged 209,000 per month over the past three months and the unemployment rate is at 4.7 percent, close to the nine-year low of 4.6 percent hit last November. Tightening labor market conditions and rising inflation enabled the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates last week. "The claims data do not suggest a clear shift in labor market conditions between the reference periods for the February and March reports," said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.The market for new houses is benefiting from a shortage of properties for sale. A report on Wednesday showed a 3.7 percent drop in sales of existing homes in February.Last month, new single-family homes sales surged 30.9 percent to their highest level since November 2007 in the Midwest and increased 3.6 percent in the South. They jumped 7.5 percent in the West but slumped 21.4 percent in the Northeast.The inventory of new homes on the market increased 1.5 percent to 266,000 units last month, still less than half of its peak during the housing boom in 2006. At February's sales pace it would take 5.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.6 months in January. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

The Wall Street bank this year faced shareholder proposals on topics ranging from its corporate structure to its financial ties to a controversial oil pipeline, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The issues would have been up for a vote at Goldman's annual meeting in April. But in at least two cases, shareholders withdrew proposals after Goldman made concessions; in another three, the SEC sided with the bank's view that the proposals were not worth including. A Goldman spokeswoman and SEC spokesman both declined to comment. The last time the bank had a proxy free of shareholder proposals was in 2006, which covered the prior year, said proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services. While Goldman may still face questions about its executive pay, it stands out among big U.S. banks that have so far filed proxies, all of which are facing battles at their upcoming annual meetings. "It's unusual for a large company, particularly large financial institutions that attract public attention, to have no shareholders proposals on their proxy," said Yaron Nili, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin who focuses on corporate governance. For many years, management teams of big banks dismissed activist shareholders as nuisances and their issues as irrelevant. But after the 2008 financial crisis, their annual meetings and investor gatherings became circus-like events: Protesters shouted down executives over bailouts, decried societal failures and, in one case, a topless female began chanting on stage in front of a conference room. In 2010, Goldman faced seven proposals - its biggest number ever - addressing topics like climate change and executive compensation, according to ISS. Goldman management began making a greater effort to engage with small investors, looking to restore the bank's reputation after critics cast it as the greediest on Wall Street. "As the financial crisis gets further in the mirror, Goldman Sachs seems to be less in the spotlight," said Patrick McGurn, special counsel for ISS. Last year the bank held 150 meetings focused on corporate governance with 77 shareholders in total, according to its proxy. In interviews, some investor activists said Goldman deserves credit. "Their willingness to engage is meaningful," said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a California nonprofit that withdrew a resolution it had filed calling for Goldman to report on its financial involvement in a contentious Dakota pipeline project. In return, Goldman agreed to review policies on human rights and other issues. In other cases, Goldman won permission from regulators to leave measures off its proxy like a union-backed proposal that would have barred certain equity awards for executives leaving to enter government service. Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo are each facing at least four proposals. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley have not yet filed their proxies, though SEC filings indicate that they successfully fought off several. The toughest job for Goldman this year may be to win shareholder backing for its executive pay, which won support from just 66 percent of votes cast last year. Support for executive pay among Russell 3000 companies averaged 91 percent last year, according to consulting firm Semler Brossy. After meeting with shareholders, Goldman made changes such as cutting a long-term award for Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein amid concerns it was too complex. The board awarded Blankfein, who is also chairman, $20.2 million for his work last year.

Still, the labor market continues to tighten, which together with the strength in housing, should underpin economic growth."New home sales are the secret sauce that helps make the economy grow," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. "This will put some backbone in investment spending and make this economic expansion more sustainable." The Commerce Department said new home sales increased 6.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000 units last month, the highest level since July 2016. Sales have now more than recouped the sharp drop suffered in December.Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.7 percent of the overall market, rising 0.7 percent to a rate of 565,000 units in February. Sales were up 12.8 percent compared to a year ago, showing the housing market's resilience despite reduced affordability. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around 4.30 percent. House prices increased 5.7 percent in January from a year ago, according a government report published on Wednesday. Last month's new home sales were likely partially buoyed by unseasonably warm weather. Most economists see a limited impact on housing from higher mortgage rates because a tightening labor market is improving job opportunities for young adults."Rising mortgage rates don't appear to have been much of an impediment to increasing housing demand in February as solid job gains, faster wage growth, and stronger household formations offset the drop in affordability," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.  In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 258,000 for the week ended March 18.Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market for 80 straight weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970 when the labor market was smaller. The job market is currently near full employment. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose only 1,000 to 240,000 last week.U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors focused on whether the House of Representatives would pass a Republican-sponsored bill to begin dismantling Obamacare, which is seen as the first significant policy test for President Donald Trump.Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the PHLX housing index gaining 0.7 percent. U.S. government bond prices fell while the dollar rose slightly against a basket of currencies.LABOR MARKET FIRMING The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for March's nonfarm payrolls report. The four-week average of claims fell 7,750 between the February and March survey weeks, suggesting another month of strong job gains.Job growth has averaged 209,000 per month over the past three months and the unemployment rate is at 4.7 percent, close to the nine-year low of 4.6 percent hit last November. Tightening labor market conditions and rising inflation enabled the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates last week. "The claims data do not suggest a clear shift in labor market conditions between the reference periods for the February and March reports," said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.The market for new houses is benefiting from a shortage of properties for sale. A report on Wednesday showed a 3.7 percent drop in sales of existing homes in February.Last month, new single-family homes sales surged 30.9 percent to their highest level since November 2007 in the Midwest and increased 3.6 percent in the South. They jumped 7.5 percent in the West but slumped 21.4 percent in the Northeast.The inventory of new homes on the market increased 1.5 percent to 266,000 units last month, still less than half of its peak during the housing boom in 2006. At February's sales pace it would take 5.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.6 months in January. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... "What Washington needs is adult supervision." --Barack Obama Yesterday's opening missive, " Wall Street Blues," depicted an overvalued market, moderating U.S. economic prospects, elevated investor optimism and a new Administration that, arguably, appears to be doing nearly everything it can do to jeopardize its legislative agenda (which, despite protestations in some parts, has been crucial to the S&P index's impressive run since the November election). The latter is an important point, though Jim "El Capitan" Cramer, and some others, have disputed President Trump's prospective market influence -- here and here, for example -- and respectfully disagree with my narrative. To me, the domestic economic recovery and the trajectory of growth is far too fragile (and stock prices by almost every metric to high) to dismiss the growing probability that the Trump agenda is on less than a solid foundation -- owing, in part, to numerous (bizarre) tweets, policy decisions, constitutional issues and, arguably, a general level of disorganization. That said, I expect the Republicans to come together and pass an affordable health-care bill which will likely be a product of extensive compromise and, in the main, imperfect to the Republican and Democratic parties. I anticipate that the stock market may very well rally somewhat further in response. But, as always, it is all about one's timeframes (and risk profile) -- and I am describing my near-term tactical strategy. I am concerned with what follows after health care's passage -- that future policy (regulatory and tax reform, repatriation and fiscal policy) may be hobbled and that our markets will feel the pain. My Tactical Approach to the Markets As I wrote yesterday, for my trading positions, the market's influences are too "newsy," and I have reduced my gross and net exposures. Fortunately, many of these positions have been on the short side and have benefited from a market that may be rolling over. Financial stocks, which I have been negative on -- particularly life insurance ( Lincoln National (LNC) from $73 to $63, Metlife (MET) $56 to $51) and brokerages ( Goldman Sachs (GS) from $253 to $229, Morgan Stanley (MS) from $47 to $41) -- have been the right places to be short. There Is Always a Bull Market Somewhere In fact, Jim and I might BOTH be right. There will always be attractive stocks to own in nearly any market setting -- hopefully I have some (last night Campbell Soup (CPB) announced a $1.5 billion share repurchase). But ignoring valuation, investor sentiment, moderating domestic economic growth expectations, political and geopolitical risks is not my path. Moreover, for every Amazon (AMZN) there is a Macy's (M) and a Nordstrom (JWN) . For every PVH Corp. (PVH) there is a Target (TGT) . For every Boeing (BA) there is a General Electric (GE) and a Caterpillar (CAT) . For every Apple (AAPL) there is a Hewlett Packard (HPE) . And for every JPMorgan (JPM) there is a Deutsche Bank (DB) . So, as always (and as Jimmy opines), search to identify the winners (and if you are a short seller, search to identify the losers). It remains my view that in the aggregate (and when considering overall market exposure), ignoring valuation, sentiment, the bigger economic picture (in retail, housing and autos) -- and even politics (and geopolitics) -- may be injurious to your investment well being. Five Charts That Spew Overvaluation While I recognize that valuations are a poor timing tool, we must never forget what Warren Buffett said: "Price is what you pay, value is what you get." I discuss five charts that embody some of my valuation concerns. 1. Warren Buffett's favorite indicator, total market capitalization compared to GDP, is now at 130% -- that's a +130% rise in the last eight years 2. The cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE) developed by Yale's Robert Shiller is, with the exception of 1929 (preceding the Great Depression) and 2000 (dot.com bubble), at the highest reading on record 3. An all-time high in cash flow multiples -- occurring by P/E ratio expansion and not through profit growth (2012-2016 experienced +0.5% compounded growth versus 1995-1999 of +9%): 4. Rising margin debt hit a record high in January, 2017 -- the prior tops were one month and three months prior to the bear markets that began in 2000 and in late 2007: 5. The Bull Market in Complacency: Bottom Line I remain negative on equities -- by my calculation, the aggregate downside risk "trumps" the upside reward by a factor of about 3:1. My market forecast, expressed in last December's 15 Surprise for 2017, remains the same: "The S&P Index has a high of 2,375 (up 5%) for the year and a low of 1,815 (down 20%), closing the year closer to the low end of the annual price range (down 15%)."

Wells Fargo Customers Won’t Need A Card To Get Cash At ATMs Anymore Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Wells Fargo Customers Won’t Need A Card To Get Cash At ATMs Anymore Image courtesy of the-specious March 23, 2017 1:50 pm EDT By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk atm banking banks cash look ma no card wells fargo Can’t be bothered to carry a debit card, but need some cash on the go? Not a problem for Wells Fargo customers with smartphones, as the bank is rolling out its cardless technology at all of its roughly 13,000 cash machines. The new digital upgrades will roll out starting Monday, after the company says a test of the system in select locations around the U.S. worked out well, reports Reuters. Here’s how it will work: Customers using the Wells Fargo app request an eight-digit code to enter along with their PIN at an ATM, and voila! Cash spits out. Along with giving customers access to cash without a card, the new feature will help prevent data theft, Jonathan Velline, Wells Fargo’s head of ATM and branch banking, tells Reuters. “Security certainly was a big aspect of the cardless feature and the two-step identification helps reduce the risk of fraud,” Velline said, adding that without cards, card skimmers will have a harder time stealing that information. While Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have also implemented new ATM technologies, Wells Fargo is the first of the U.S. big banks to have its entire network have cardless capabilities, notes Reuters. Wells Fargo has been busy trying to make up with customers after its recent fake account fiasco perpetrated by employees who opened more than two million unauthorized accounts. As a result, customers have been avoiding opening new accounts and credit cards with the banking biggie. So if there’s anything Wells Fargo can do to improve itself in its customers’ eyes — like cardless ATMs — it’s going to try it.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking Enlarge Caption  Email More A A WASHINGTON: New U.S. single-family home sales jumped to a seven-month high in February, suggesting the housing market recovery was gaining momentum despite higher prices and rising mortgage rates. Other data on Thursday showed an unexpected increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week. Still, the labor market continues to tighten, which together with the strength in housing, should underpin economic growth. "New home sales are the secret sauce that helps make the economy grow," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. "This will put some backbone in investment spending and make this economic expansion more sustainable." The Commerce Department said new home sales increased 6.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000 units last month, the highest level since July 2016. Sales have now more than recouped the sharp drop suffered in December. Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.7 percent of the overall market, rising 0.7 percent to a rate of 565,000 units in February. Sales were up 12.8 percent compared to a year ago, showing the housing market's resilience despite reduced affordability. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around 4.30 percent. House prices increased 5.7 percent in January from a year ago, according a government report published on Wednesday. Last month's new home sales were likely partially buoyed by unseasonably warm weather. Most economists see a limited impact on housing from higher mortgage rates because a tightening labor market is improving job opportunities for young adults. "Rising mortgage rates don't appear to have been much of an impediment to increasing housing demand in February as solid job gains, faster wage growth, and stronger household formations offset the drop in affordability," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.  In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 258,000 for the week ended March 18. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market for 80 straight weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970 when the labor market was smaller. The job market is currently near full employment. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose only 1,000 to 240,000 last week. U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors focused on whether the House of Representatives would pass a Republican-sponsored bill to begin dismantling Obamacare, which is seen as the first significant policy test for President Donald Trump. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the PHLX housing index gaining 0.7 percent. U.S. government bond prices fell while the dollar rose slightly against a basket of currencies. LABOR MARKET FIRMING The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for March's nonfarm payrolls report. The four-week average of claims fell 7,750 between the February and March survey weeks, suggesting another month of strong job gains. Job growth has averaged 209,000 per month over the past three months and the unemployment rate is at 4.7 percent, close to the nine-year low of 4.6 percent hit last November. Tightening labor market conditions and rising inflation enabled the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates last week. "The claims data do not suggest a clear shift in labor market conditions between the reference periods for the February and March reports," said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. The market for new houses is benefiting from a shortage of properties for sale. A report on Wednesday showed a 3.7 percent drop in sales of existing homes in February. Last month, new single-family homes sales surged 30.9 percent to their highest level since November 2007 in the Midwest and increased 3.6 percent in the South. They jumped 7.5 percent in the West but slumped 21.4 percent in the Northeast. The inventory of new homes on the market increased 1.5 percent to 266,000 units last month, still less than half of its peak during the housing boom in 2006. At February's sales pace it would take 5.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.6 months in January. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

The rise of e-commerce and titanic shifts in how shoppers spend their money has hit malls and stores hard. Visits to malls declined by 50% between 2010 and 2013, according to the real-estate research firm Cushman & Wakefield. Amazon in contrast has continued to eat up market share. The company accounted for 53% of onlines sales growth in the US in 2016, according to market research firm Slice Intelligence. In other words, for every new dollar American consumers spent online, Amazon took 53 cents of it. The offering has been built on speed, ease and cost. And now, according to a note out March 23 by equity analysts at Morgan Stanley, the retail giant has a new weapon in its war against brick-and-mortar retailers: credit cards.   In January the firm renewed its credit card partnership with JPMorgan, and rolled out a new "Prime-only 5% cash back incentive for purchases on Amazon." "The penetration of Amazon's credit card appears headed higher," the bank said. "13% of people who do not already have an Amazon credit card say they are "very likely" to sign up for either the enhanced Chase card or Synchrony card." Morgan Stanley said that the firm's new card will drive more consumers to spend their money on Amazon.  "Amazon's new Chase card is expected to drive more spend towards Amazon and away from retailers as 82% of prospective new Amazon card owners plan to shop "more" or "a lot more" on Amazon than they currently do." The bank has a price target for Amazon of $900 per share, above Amazon's current share price of $849.84. Their price target for a number of retailers are lower than the current market price. For instance, the bank's price target for Nordstrom Inc. is $38 per share, below its current $42.33 share price. Their price target for Kohl's is $35 per share, below its current $37.42 price.  MI SHARE THIS POST News for Amazon.com MIDEAST STOCKS - Factors to watch - Mar 26 (AMZN, DPW, C, DPW, BBD., 1090, WAHA, BARC) Reuters 5h Amazon Expands Prime Exclusive Phones With Alcatel A30, Moto G5 Plus RTTNews 2d After Trump rally, equity investors move into healthcare, retailers (GILD, AGN, AMZN, SIG, BC, HZO, LKOH, 012330, EMBR3) Reuters 2d PRESS DIGEST - Wall Street Journal - March 24 (AAPL, AMZN, DIS, GME) Reuters 2d Amazon.com wins $1.5 bln tax dispute over IRS (AMZN) Reuters 3d Budget fédéral 2017 - Le Barreau du Québec demeure sur son appétit PR Newswire 3d Amazon has a new weapon in its war on brick-and-mortar retail (AMZN) Business Insider 3d BRIEF-Amazon.Com Inc defeats IRS in tax-court case - WSJ (AMZN) Reuters 3d Click here for more news your MARKET VIEW Your Personalized Market Center Related Stocks Amazon.com 845.71 -1.97 (-0.23%) 3/24/2017 Disclaimer Get real-time Amazon.com charts here >> Find News GO Home / Stocks / Amazon.com-Quote / News for Amazon.com Amazon.com / Amazon has a new weapon in its war on brick-and-mortar retail (AMZN) Follow us Need help?

Other data on Thursday showed an unexpected increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week. Still, the labor market continues to tighten, which together with the strength in housing, should underpin economic growth. "New home sales are the secret sauce that helps make the economy grow," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. "This will put some backbone in investment spending and make this economic expansion more sustainable." The Commerce Department said new home sales increased 6.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000 units last month, the highest level since July 2016. Sales have now more than recouped the sharp drop suffered in December. Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.7 percent of the overall market, rising 0.7 percent to a rate of 565,000 units in February. Sales were up 12.8 percent compared to a year ago, showing the housing market's resilience despite reduced affordability. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around 4.30 percent. House prices increased 5.7 percent in January from a year ago, according a government report published on Wednesday. Last month's new home sales were likely partially buoyed by unseasonably warm weather. Most economists see a limited impact on housing from higher mortgage rates because a tightening labor market is improving job opportunities for young adults. "Rising mortgage rates don't appear to have been much of an impediment to increasing housing demand in February as solid job gains, faster wage growth, and stronger household formations offset the drop in affordability," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 258,000 for the week ended March 18. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market for 80 straight weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970 when the labor market was smaller. The job market is currently near full employment. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose only 1,000 to 240,000 last week. U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors focused on whether the House of Representatives would pass a Republican-sponsored bill to begin dismantling Obamacare, which is seen as the first significant policy test for President Donald Trump. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the PHLX housing index gaining 0.7 percent. U.S. government bond prices fell while the dollar rose slightly against a basket of currencies. LABOR MARKET FIRMING The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for March's nonfarm payrolls report. The four-week average of claims fell 7,750 between the February and March survey weeks, suggesting another month of strong job gains. Job growth has averaged 209,000 per month over the past three months and the unemployment rate is at 4.7 percent, close to the nine-year low of 4.6 percent hit last November. Tightening labor market conditions and rising inflation enabled the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates last week. "The claims data do not suggest a clear shift in labor market conditions between the reference periods for the February and March reports," said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. The market for new houses is benefiting from a shortage of properties for sale. A report on Wednesday showed a 3.7 percent drop in sales of existing homes in February. Last month, new single-family homes sales surged 30.9 percent to their highest level since November 2007 in the Midwest and increased 3.6 percent in the South. They jumped 7.5 percent in the West but slumped 21.4 percent in the Northeast. The inventory of new homes on the market increased 1.5 percent to 266,000 units last month, still less than half of its peak during the housing boom in 2006. At February's sales pace it would take 5.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.6 months in January. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

The loan scheme originally designed during the 2011 debt crisis was tweaked last year to allow banks to get paid up to 0.4 percent of what they borrow on condition that they lend more to companies or consumers. In the last of these targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTRO) on Thursday, some 474 banks took up 233.5 billion euros of four-year loans, well above the 125 billion euros expected in a Reuters poll. This suggests banks anticipate a rise in lending, while analysts said they are also likely to continue to invest some of the money in government bonds from the likes of Portugal and Spain which pay relatively high levels of interest. With the ECB also set to trim the amount of money it pumps into the financial system by cutting its monthly bond purchases next month, some see the end of the TLTRO scheme as a signal that the worst is over for the bloc. "That (TLTRO) was a policy designed for extraordinary times, we are not in them now," said Nick Gartside, JP Morgan Asset Management's international CIO for fixed income. "You have growth above trend, you have politics calming down and you have the market pricing in both tapering (of bond purchases) and higher deposit rates. We are shifting from a story that was about divergence to one of convergence and it will be the ECB doing the converging." Yields, which move inversely to prices, of Portuguese , Spanish and Italian bonds fell as much as 5-7 basis points before paring those falls as the session wore on. That narrowed the gap with German equivalents, which also faced upward pressure from rising U.S. bond yields . The premium investors demand to hold Portuguese bonds over German equivalents briefly fell to a three-month low. The premium for Spanish bonds fell to a one-month low. "The talk that this money would be used for carry trades seems to be confirmed by these results and the market reaction," said ING rates strategist Benjamin Schroeder. An index of euro zone banks climbed almost 1 percent, outperforming the broader euro zone stock index which was up 0.8 percent on the day. "The cheap funding boosts the banks' interest margins," said Arne Petimezas, analyst at AFS Group. "This is the last time they could get such cheap loans, so they can pay down some of their bonds." In the future, banks will only be able to get either one-week or three-month loans from the ECB, which will be an enormous cut in the duration of credit available to them.

According to the source, the company, known as Cemig, plans to sell about 36 percent of Light at an auction instead of the roughly 27 percent initially considered. Cemig currently has a 26 percent direct stake in Light, plus another 26 percent held indirectly through an investment vehicle. Assuming Cemig keeps 16 percent of Light and based on a price of 25 reais per share, the deal could raise about 4.4 billion reais ($1.4 billion), the source said. About 70 percent of proceeds would go toward reducing Cemig's debt of 13.7 billion reais, with Light getting the rest, said the source, who did not elaborate on the structure of the sale. Cemig, which is Brazil's No. 3 power utility and is controlled by the state of Minas Gerais, is exiting some business segments and trying to turn around core operations such as power generation, renewable energy and transmission. Its debt has tripled since 2012, following a series of takeovers that failed to yield expected returns due in part to government-led renegotiations of power contracts. Reuters reported on March 16 that Cemig was considering the Light stake sale as well as selling majority stakes in power generation and transmission company Cemig GT and power distributor Cemig D. The moves would involve the engagement of partners and then a listing of Cemig GT and Cemig D in São Paulo and New York as early as this year. According to the source, Light Chief Executive Officer Ana Marta Horta Veloso wants Cemig to accelerate the stake sale, which could take place within weeks. Cemig has hired the investment banking units of Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and Banco do Brasil SA to work on the plan, the person said. Media representatives for Rio de Janeiro-based Light directed questions to Cemig, which did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Itaú and Banco do Brasil did not have immediate comments. Last week, Reuters reported Grupo BTG Pactual SA , JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc were vying for slots in the underwriting group. The banks declined to comment. The stake sale would end Light's controlling shareholder accord, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans are private. That would create a more dispersed ownership structure and improve corporate governance, offering a premium to Cemig's current share price, the source said, adding that 25 reais was not necessarily an indication of how the offering would price. Light's controlling bloc includes Cemig, engineering conglomerate Andrade Gutiérrez SA and investment vehicles Luce Participações SA and RME Rio Minas Energia. Shares of Light slipped 1.7 percent to 20.28 reais in midday trading, while Cemig rose 3.3 percent to 10.15 reais. Minas Gerais and Cemig also plan to ask the federal government to renew contracts for operating hydropower dams that expired in recent years in exchange for a reduction in debt that the federal government owes to the state for non-payment of export tax exemptions, the person said. Brazilian Deputy Energy Minister Paulo Pedrosa said on Tuesday that the federal government would take back all Cemig power dams whose licenses expired in recent years, having failed to reach a deal with the company to extend them. Efforts to reach officials at Minas Gerais state for comment were not immediately unsuccessful.

At least six investment banks pitched for a role advising the world’s largest oil producer on its listing on the Saudi stock exchange in Riyadh, the Tadawul. Saudi authorities are aiming to list a total of up to 5 per cent of Aramco — on the Tadawul and one or more international markets — in an initial public offering that could raise $100 billion. JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and HSBC have been asked to work on Saudi Aramco’s global listing, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Aramco declined to comment. Samba Financial Group, the parent of Samba Capital, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
