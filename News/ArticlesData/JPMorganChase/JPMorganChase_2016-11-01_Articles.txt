 JPMorgan has promoted the next generation of trading talent Matt Turner Nov. 2, 2016, 8:57 AM 7,760 facebook linkedin twitter email print Carlos Hernandez, right, JPMorgan Chase's head of global banking, with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson JPMorgan has made a round of promotions in its equities business, following the appointment of new global coheads of that business. The bank announced in September that Mark Leung and Jason Sippel would become global heads of equities, replacing Tim Throsby, who moved to Barclays. In a memo sent Wednesday, Leung and Sippel announced a raft of promotions below them. They include: Fater Belbachir will be head of volatility trading globally and relocate to London from New York. He had previously headed volatility trading and structuring for the Americas. Luiz de Salvo and Dennis Fitzgerald will become heads of global cash trading and also lead the Americas region. They previously headed cash equities trading in the Americas. Chris Berthe and Charles Chiang will head global delta one, and they will develop the synthetic equity business along with the prime business. David Robertson will take responsibility for JPMorgan's international financing business. Paul Brannan and Jonathan Cossey will become heads of prime brokerage. Brannan was previously US head, and Cossey led Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. JPMorgan ranked No. 2 on Wall Street for equities revenue in the first half, according to data from Coalition, with a No. 1 position in equity derivatives. "We are positioned incredibly well and yet, we still see more opportunities for us to invest and grow," Daniel Pinto, the CEO of the corporate and investment bank, said in a memo announcing the appointment of Leung and Sippel.

Both access and design issues are preventing potential employees and employers from identifying the appropriate job fit. The report, “Swiping Right for the Job: How Tech is Changing Matching in the Workforce”, highlights the problems low and middle skilled workers and employers face in using technology, explores how tech is changing labor market interactions, and identifies the benefits, challenges and design changes required for labor market technology to have its greatest impact. “Despite an increase in technology usage, we’re seeing missed opportunity in job matching due to design flaws and access barriers,” said Chauncy Lennon, Head of Workforce Initiatives, JPMorgan Chase. “We’ve identified how to more efficiently connect people with the jobs and training they need and if we turn these lessons learned into smarter tools, we’ll create economic opportunity for everyone.” Labor market matching technology exists primarily online, and low- and middle-skill workers, who typically have wages below the median, are disproportionately likely to lack access to computers and the internet at home. Only sixty-three percent of those with a household income between $20,000 and $50,000 have access to broadband internet at home, compared to 80 percent of those with a household income between $50,000 and $75,000. While job seekers with varying degrees of education use their smart phones for job searching at approximately the same rate, job seekers who have not attended college are much more likely to go through the cumbersome process of using their smart phones to fill out an online job application and create a resume or cover letter than those who have graduated from college. Also, low- and middle-skill workers are more likely to lack proficiency in using computers and the Internet, making it difficult to navigate labor market matching technology. “JPMorgan Chase’s report underscores that too many skilled workers are being overlooked due to fixable architecture flaws in job matching technology,” said Byron Auguste, President and Co-Founder, Opportunity@Work. “When we design tools to take into account an individual’s personal affinities and background, employers will find far better candidates to place in their companies and for a longer period of time.” One example of a job matching tool design to address these issues is SkillSmart. Their platform is designed to connect job seekers, employers, and educators through mutually identified skills. The program allows employers to specify the skills needed for success in their company and helps individuals find opportunities based on their skillset. SkillSmart’s algorithm calculates how closely an applicant’s skills align with overall employer need. If job seekers do not have the necessary skills for a job they want, SkillSmart will provide suggestions for training opportunities. Additionally, SkillSmart helps educators to include in-demand skills in their curricula. Based on interviews with 45 industry leaders and an exhaustive review of research, the Swipe Right report highlights that finding the right person for the job is a crucial component of business success, employee wellbeing, worker productivity, and economic health. The consequences of getting the match wrong are high both for employees and employers. The cost of replacing a worker can be as much as 60 percent of an employee’s annual salary. Without good design, a tool will have limited usefulness and be challenging to implement. Without good implementation, a tool will not achieve its purpose of improved matching and quickly lose relevance. The report includes the following recommendations to improve the design and implementation of job matching technology: DesignBuild with User-Centered Design: Ensure that the tool is easy to use for both employers and job seekers by involving and consulting them throughout the tool design process. Use Target-Audience Language: The language used in job postings should avoid jargon and be familiar to the target job seeker. Encourage Skills-based Hiring: Work with employers to foster skills-based job descriptions and hiring practices rather than rely on increasingly irrelevant gatekeeping credentials. Engage Employers: Align with employers on occupational and skills definitions to develop a shared understanding among employers, training institutions, and job seekers. Integrate Training Opportunities and Pathways: Include easily accessible information on training opportunities to help job seekers gain skills to qualify for their desired positions. Consider Implicit Bias Mitigation: Reduce implicit bias in the hiring process by creating tools that do not expose employers to signals like names or addresses. Keep an Eye on National Trends, Use Local Data: A tool that uses local data and corresponds to the realities of the local labor market will be most helpful to current job seekers. Optimize for Mobile: An online tool should be created to reflect the ways that people use the internet, and mobile optimization is vital for job seekers who lack desktop access. ImplementationSupport Job Seeker Needs and Access: Regardless of how well a technology tool is designed, some individuals will need in-person guidance, and digital inclusion efforts may be needed to help everyone access the tool. Ongoing Activation of Industry Partners: Employers need to post their job openings through the tool and ensure that the information reflects their changing hiring needs. Recognize Need for Continued Refinement and Investment: Since online technology quickly becomes outdated, continued investment is needed to keep a technology tool up-to-date and appealing for users. Analyze Outcomes: Longitudinal data collection will help ensure that a technology tool aids employers in hiring by illuminating outcomes after the point of hire and helping determine best practices in labor market matching technology.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad U.S. presidential election offers little cause for alarm - JPMorgan AM's Michele By Reuters Published: 07:01 EST, 2 November 2016 | Updated: 07:01 EST, 2 November 2016 e-mail By Tomo Uetake TOKYO, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. presidential election is unlikely to be a major risk for financial markets as Congress is likely to put a brake on many policies, whoever wins, the fixed income chief investment officer of JPMorgan Asset Management said on Wednesday. Bob Michele said the world's fifth largest asset manager increased exposure to inflation-linked bonds (TIPS) and emerging market debt in the last few weeks, expecting moderate growth and solid oil prices to lift inflation and support emerging market currencies. Global financial markets were roiled by signs the U.S. presidential election race was tightening just days ahead of the Nov. 8 vote, with a possible victory for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump seen as boosting uncertainty on U.S. foreign, economic and trade policies. But Michele told Reuters in an interview that U.S. politics is not among the major risk factors the firm looks at in coming months because the House of Representatives is likely to remain Republican. "This is very important because any law that the President would like to pass has to go through the House for approval," he said. "We are in an interesting position where, if (Hillary) Clinton gets elected, the House - if it remains Republican - will likely push back a lot of things she wants to do. "But if Trump gets elected and he tries to push through a lot of the extremist, protectionist things he has talked about, I expect the House will push that back." Since both candidates are highlighting the need to rebuild U.S. infrastructure, fiscal expansion is likely, whoever wins, Michele said. In addition, U.S. and world growth look better than expected at the start of 2016 and oil prices have recovered sharply from 12-year lows hit early this year, which is likely to underpin prices in coming months. "There's a lot that will happen in a couple of weeks that will appear to be very growth friendly and very inflation-oriented, including the election," he added. "Many of the things we're doing now are to prepare in advance." JPMorgan's asset management arm has added local emerging markets debt, Michele added, citing high real yield, upsides to growth and stabilization of currencies, thanks to recovering energy prices. He named Brazil, India, Indonesia and Russia as attractive targets, adding that it was a good time to take the currency exposure as well. Michele, who manages the firm's $455-billion fixed income portfolios, also said it was looking for opportunities to sell duration. "When markets rally, we would use that as an opportunity to cut duration of our portfolios because we think the market is going through a growth and inflation scare." JPMorgan Asset Management had $1.77 trillion in assets under management by September 30.

These Wall Street Honchos Hardly Ever Use Email Money 11/1/2016 Olivia Oran / Reuters © CNBC—NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Jamie Dimon, chairman, president and CEO of JP Morgan Chase In an age when most bankers use keyboards to communicate with each other, a small group of the Wall Street elite refuses to say anything substantive in an email, text or chat, and some will not communicate digitally at all. Quotes in the article Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRK.B ▼ 157.75 -0.64 -0.40% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 77.71 -0.31 -0.40% This group, which includes top bankers like JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and powerful investors like Carl Icahn and Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s Warren Buffett, were eschewing electronic communications long before the probe of U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s emails and the recent hacks of her campaign manager’s account made headlines. Some on Wall Street are nostalgic for a time when in-person conversations or phone calls were the norm, but others believe the words they type and send can come back to haunt them. Prosecutors have built insider trading, mortgage fraud and rate-rigging cases on embarrassing emails over the past several years, and they are often the most memorable part. Recent email woes among Washington power players have provided yet another reason for bankers to try to protect private correspondence from prying eyes. Dimon uses email but is known to keep his replies short and factual, favoring “yes,” “no” and “thank you.” That behavior was evident in company emails released by a U.S. Senate committee investigating JPMorgan’s $6.2 billion “London Whale” derivatives trading loss. In one message, Dimon replied with a simple “I approve,” showing some responsibility but giving no sense of how deeply he was involved with the decision to change risk tolerances at the bank. After hearing a passing reference to regrettable emails during an interview at a conference two years ago, Dimon volunteered: “Don’t send emails after you’ve had a drink.” A JPMorgan spokesman would not comment further. Other top investors like Icahn and Buffett rely on their assistants to send and receive messages. Buffett’s assistant, Debbie Bosanek, prints out emails for the billionaire investor. Although the investors are averse to two-way digital correspondence, both blast out carefully curated messages on their Twitter accounts, with Icahn attracting 304,000 followers and Buffet, 1.2 million. Read: Forget Hillary Clinton’s Missing Emails—What About Mine? Icahn has often used the tool to promote investments or political views, while Buffett has been relatively mum, tweeting just nine times. Ariel Investments chief John W. Rogers also shuns email, which he has described to associates as a “distraction.” His staff filters important messages, prints them out and puts them on his chair for review, according to spokeswoman Merrillyn Kosier. He prefers to speak with employees in person or over the phone. “I do think there is certain cautiousness today around email,” said Virginia Healy-Tangney, a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management who focuses on managerial communication. “Since the financial crisis, executives really have to be prepared for anything they say to potentially end up on the front page of the New York Times.” Go to MSN Home More in Money 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money Up Next The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from Money The $20,000 Rare Craft Beer That Comes Packaged in a Squirrel Money Adoption Is Pricey.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website 9  −   =  1 Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Whether or not you love Wall Street, Jamie Dimon has proven a capable CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) since he took the helm in 2006… As of 2015, Dimon has produced a 111% shareholder return since becoming CEO. And he led JPMorgan through one of the worst financial crises since the Great Depression. Part of Dimon's success is owed to his unique skillset and leadership style. Here's what we mean… 5 Things You Didn't Know About Jamie Dimon 1) Dimon accepted full responsibility for the 2012 London Whale crisis. Jamie Dimon Fact Sheet Born: March 13, 1956 (age 60); New York City, New York Pay Package: $27 million (2016) Net Worth: $1.1 billion (June 2015) Political Party: Democratic Board Member Of: Federal Reserve Bank of New York Religion: Greek Orthodox Spouse: Judith Kent Children: Julia Dimon, Laura Dimon, Kara Leigh Dimon Alma Mater: Tufts University, Harvard University Good leaders know better than to pass off the responsibility of big mistakes to their underlings — that's a mistake former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf should be able to attest to. In this case, a trader-gone-wild named Bruno Iksil (AKA the London Whale) helped run up esoteric credit default swap bets that cost the bank over $6 billion in 2012. It was a major embarrassment for Dimon, who later said the strategy was "flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed, and poorly monitored," according to The Wall Street Journal on May 11. What's worse, the trades took place in a unit that reported directly to Dimon. Rather than craftily dismissing his oversight — or easier yet, blaming Iksil — Dimon took full responsibility. In testimony to Congress, he told Sen. Jeff Merkley that "we made a mistake. I am absolutely responsible. The buck stops with me," according to Vanity Fair in November 2012.

In March 2008, Bear Sterns, a financial firm that heavily traded mortgage-backed securities, was on the brink of failure. To prevent it from collapsing, Dimon led JPMorgan to buy the company for $29 billion. JPMorgan assumed all of Sterns' risky exposures. Later in 2008, JPMorgan did the same with Washington Mutual, saving thousands of jobs. At the time, no other institution wanted to take over these risky and dangerous financial firms. But Dimon stepped up to the plate, and in doing so, he helped save the financial industry from collapsing. As a side note, because Dimon took over the balance sheets of these troubled banks, he also had to pay a $13 billion settlement with the Department of Justice for those firms' misdeeds. Don't Miss: A Special Profit Opportunity with Only Days Left to Get the Details 3) Dimon steered JPMorgan Chase away from peddling mortgage-backed securities (MBS) before the 2008 financial crisis.  While most other big banks like Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs were making risky MBS trades, JPMorgan was not. In fact, it was one of the few investment banks that largely discouraged the practice before the financial crisis, which is how it was able to absorb troubled firms during the crux of the debacle. Dimon was undoubtedly the major hand behind restricting his traders from being tempted by MBS trades. In 2006, he was credited for ordering his bank's chief of securitized products to deleverage more than $12 billion worth of subprime mortgages. 4) Despite having a net worth over $1.1 billion, Dimon is not an "extravagant man." According to those who work closely with Dimon, he doesn't live like a typical big bank CEO, Vanity Fair reported in November 2015. Heidi Miller, once listed by America Banker as one of the most powerful women in banking, worked for Dimon for 18 years. In an interview with Vanity Fair, she recounted: "I swear, if his wife didn't point out shirts that match his suits, I'm not sure what he would look like in the morning, half the time. I always think of him as somewhat rumpled. He is oblivious to the trappings of very fancy things." Dimon is not a member of the ritzy Augusta National Golf Club, unlike his two predecessors at JPMorgan Chase. In fact, he doesn't even play golf, Vanity Fair reports. During his five years living in Chicago from 2000 to 2005, when he was the CEO of Bank One Corporation, Dimon didn't attend a single black-tie charity event, despite expectations that he should as a corporate leader, according to Vanity Fair. And in 2004, after the merger of Bank One and JPMorgan Chase, Dimon spent his two-week vacation at a weekend house in Bedford, New York. He was alone, making his own coffee and perusing around the local Target in his wrangler jeans, Vanity Fair reported. Continue reading to see our No. 5 fact about Dimon that you might not expect. This quality of Dimon's is one of the reasons JPMorgan was so prepared going into the 2008 Financial Crisis, relative to other big banks. 5) Dimon runs JPMorgan with a conservative business approach.

And even they are converging into one category: companies that have been hacked and will be hacked again.” So many companies have since been hacked that it’s hard to compile a comprehensive list.

But somewhat unlike the FBI, the central bank is not in the business of tossing live bombs into the final week of a presidential election. Pantheon’s Ian Shepherdson: “The Fed won't raise rates today, or substantively change the wording of the post-meeting statement. … “[I]f, as we expect, the committee is looking for reasons not to hike just six days before the election, they will be able to point to the one-tenth increase in September unemployment and the uncertain reliability … of the better-looking third quarter GDP data. We anticipate three hawkish dissents again, but the Committee is setting itself up to hike in December” Story Continued Below HFE’s Jim O’Sullivan: “We see virtually no chance of a rate hike this week, particularly given the proximity to next week’s election. As a result, the focus will be entirely on any hints in the statement about what might happen at the next meeting, on December 13-14. We don’t expect anything very market-moving.” MOODY’S MODEL PICKS CLINTON — Reuters: “Low gas prices and President Barack Obama's high approval ratings are key factors that favor Democrat Hillary Clinton winning the White House in next week's election, according to a model from Moody's Analytics that has accurately predicted the last nine U.S. presidential contests. Clinton is forecast to pick up 332 Electoral College votes against 206 for Republican Donald Trump, Moody's Analytics predicted … That would match Obama's margin … in 2012. “The Reuters-Ipsos States of the Nation project also predicts a Clinton win, with a 95 percent probability of her winning at least 278 electoral votes. A candidate needs to win at least 270 electoral votes to be elected president. The Moody's Analytics model is based on a combination of state-level economic conditions and political history, and has correctly called the outcome of each presidential election since Republican Ronald Reagan unseated Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1980.” Read more. LONDON BANKERS SAY CITY WILL RETAIN TITLE — In a poll out Wednesday from Synechron and the TABB Group: “72 percent of British bankers believe London will still be the financial centre of Europe in five years’ time … 55 percent of British banks have set up ‘Brexit Steering Committees’ to prepare for life outside the European Union … 56 percent of senior British capital markets executives believe that compliance costs will increase following Britain’s decision to leave the European Union … 78 percent of executives agree that Brexit will have a negative impact on UK financial markets” ALTMAN ON HRC AND TAX REFORM — Via Yahoo Finance: “Investment banker Roger Altman, a key Clinton adviser, explained Clinton’s view on corporate tax reform during a live Yahoo Finance panel discussion on the two presidential candidates’ economic policies. ‘We need corporate tax reform,” he said. ‘The campaign isn’t the place to negotiate the rate. Let’s wait until the election is over. At some appropriate point, she’s going to make a proposal.’ “In other words: It’s coming. It’s just not something Clinton wants to discuss during the campaign, when any plan to cut business taxes could be taken as a sop to corporate interests.” Read more. MAYBE 2016 DOESN’T EVEN MATTER — KBRA’s Christopher Whalen: “[W]e expect most of the major trends in terms of the global economy, interest rates, and currencies to be largely unaffected by the outcome of the U.S. poll. Simply stated, what happens within the U.S. political system has less and less impact on the rest of the world. “Americans like to flatter themselves that events inside our increasingly raucous political economy are somehow more important than developments in other parts of the world … Regardless of who occupies the White House, we believe that this tendency towards greater volatility and unpredictability in global markets will remain a central theme in the years ahead. The slow motion disintegration of the EU illustrates this danger” TRUMP RISE RATTLES MARKETS — Reuters: “Asian shares tumbled to seven-week lows and the dollar was on the defensive on Wednesday as investors were rattled by signs the U.S. presidential election race was tightening just days out to the Nov. 8 vote. Markets were beginning to rethink their long-held bets of a victory for … Hillary Clinton amid signs … Donald Trump could be closing the gap, forcing money out of riskier assets and into safe-havens such as the Japanese yen and gold. “Heavy selling also knocked the Mexican peso, seen as the most vulnerable to a Trump presidency due to his pledge to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to prevent entry of illegal immigrants. The peso, which posted its biggest fall in two months on Tuesday, extended losses to 19.308 to the dollar, its lowest level since early October.” Read more. FEAR GAUGE BACK TO BREXIT LEVELS — FT’s Nicole Bullock, Adam Samson and Courtney Weaver: “The Vix index, a measure of expected US stock market volatility known as Wall Street’s ‘fear gauge’, neared highs last seen in the aftermath of the UK’s vote to leave the EU this summer. Gold, seen as the ultimate haven investment, rose to its highest level since early October … “‘With the Brexit trading experience in recent memory, it seems that some traders don’t want to be caught off side again and have started to act,’ said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. Investors see Mrs Clinton as heralding less uncertainty for markets partly because her long political career means her policies are seen as more predictable.” Read more.

GLASS-STEAGALL THOUGHTS — Capital Alpha’s Ian Katz: “The emails released by Wikileaks support our thinking that Clinton won’t always be aligned with the bank-vilifying wing of the Democratic Party. … Clinton will likely govern from the center more than most expect. The emails confirm that Clinton’s advisers don’t believe that banks are the chief culprits for the financial crisis. As a result, she would initially resist calls to break up the large firms. “Having said that, the emails also show that the Clinton crew is profoundly pragmatic. We think that if it ever got to the point where there was enough public and congressional support to revive Glass-Steagall, Clinton wouldn’t put up a big fight. The main concern in the emails is how Clinton’s opposition to a new Glass-Steagall would be portrayed to the public and specifically in a Democratic primary debate” ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: Now delivering: Retirement security for life!

FCC CONCERNS OVER AT&T-TIME WARNER DEAL — WSJ’s Shalini Ramachandran, Ryan Knutson and John D. McKinnon: “AT&T Inc.’s practice of exempting its streaming video services from data-usage caps is rankling competitors and shaping up as a major issue for regulators set to weigh the telecom giant’s proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc. “When AT&T rolls out its $35-a-month DirecTV Now online TV service this month, its wireless subscribers will be able to stream as much as they want without it counting toward their monthly data caps. But if the same customers binge on outside services like Netflix or Hulu, those bits will add up — potentially leading to surcharges.” Read more. CHINA-MALAYSIA SIGNS TRADE DEALS — FT’s Charles Clover: “China and Malaysia signed several trade and investment deals on Tuesday as China denied that it was trying to buy better ties with its southern neighbor. “The agreements signed on Tuesday with China will further invigorate the Beijing- Kuala Lumpur alignment and strain ties with the US. Most significantly, the two nations agreed to a wide ranging naval co-operation deal in which they will jointly develop coastal patrol vessels.” Read more. FREDDIE MAC PAYS OUT — POLITICO Pro’s Lorraine Woellert: “Freddie Mac will send a $2.3 billion dividend payment to taxpayers after profits more than doubled from three months earlier. “That's what the mortgage-finance company earned in the third quarter, buoyed by strong home-price growth and market reaction to Brexit. The $2.3 billion profit was up from $993 million in the second quarter and a dramatic reversal of a $475 million loss a year ago.” Read more. HULU BUNDLES UP FOR 2017 — The Atlantic’s David Sims: “Though “cord-cutting” is on the rise and subscription numbers have declined, the change has been gradual enough to not cut too deeply into profit margins. That may change in 2017, however, with the news that Hulu will offer more than 35 live TV networks to subscribers in the New Year for an as-yet undetermined price. With this kind of “bundling,” where various popular channels are sold as a package, streaming TV is starting to more closely resemble the very thing it was meant to replace.” Read more.

It was intended to build a scale large enough to cut costs and eke out profits in an industry struggling with shrinking advertising revenue and declining circulations.

Broomfield is the smallest county in the state, the newest county in the country and the ninth-fastest growing county in the United States. Ahrens has spent most of his life in the area. "I'm literally a home-grown mayor. So it's pretty serendipitous that I'm here at such an exciting time," Ahrens said. The county had several large businesses show interest in the past three months, including JPMorgan Chase, IKEA, and the plumbing and HVAC manufacturer Viega. JPMorgan Chase bought 106 acres of land on West 160th Avenue near Sheridan Parkway with the intention of building a $200 million data and storage facility. A few miles away at Interstate 25 and Highway 7, IKEA has plans for a large plot of land. It's located next to the gas station where Crystal Haislip works. Haislip has lived her entire life nearby and isn't thrilled about more growth. "It's not the small area that it used to be. It used to be fields. You used to be able to see the mountains and now you can't," Haislip said. "It's just going to keep going. It's not going to stop. There's nothing we can do." Ahrens agrees. "We could probably have the same conversation in six months and we'll have some new projects coming," Ahrens said. He also said the reason growth comes so easy is because there are no rule differences between the city and county of Broomfield. There's only one governing body for both. So not only do businesses only have to worry about one set of rules, the county can also combine services like the police department and the sheriff's office.

Less than a month after the IPO, Wall Street finally tells you what it thinks about this stock. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Nov 1, 2016 at 12:23PM Today we're going to tell you about a stock -- one that you may not have heard of before, but one that a few analysts think you should like. Camping World Holdings (NYSE:CWH) is the stock's name, and recreational vehicles (RVs) are its game. This morning, no fewer than six Wall Street analysts announced new ratings for Camping World Holdings, splitting their ratings down the middle with three buy ratings and three holds. R.W. Baird, KeyBanc, and Credit Suisse all hail from the buy camp, while Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs counsel holding the stock for now. And here's something that may surprise you: Each and every one of these bankers also helped to run Camping World Holdings' IPO last month! Now, wouldn't you like to know what they really think about the stock? Then you're in luck. Read on, and find out. Camping World loves the RV lifestyle -- but does Wall Street still love the stock? Image source: Camping World IPO prospectus. Let loose the bulls We'll let the bulls go first in this debate. Underwriting more than 688,000 Camping World shares, Credit Suisse tied as the stock's third-largest backer during last month's IPO. It's not too surprising, therefore, that Credit Suisse really likes this stock. Quoted on StreetInsider.com this morning, Credit Suisse rates Camping World stock an "outperform," and argues the company operates in a "fragmented industry," and offers "potential upside from higher EPS and multiple expansion." A seller of new and used RVs, Camping World also does good business selling insurance and other services to RV owners, a business model that Credit Suisse likes for its "recurring revenue model." With its "low valuation" of just $412 million in market capitalization, and trailing net profits of $190 million, Credit Suisse sees Camping World as "one of the most attractive stories in the consumer space." The analyst predicts Camping World, currently priced at $22 and change, will hit $28 within a year. For their parts, KeyBanc and R.W. Baird played lesser roles in the IPO -- but they're no less enthusiastic about the stock. According to data from ratings monitor TheFly.com, KeyBanc rates Camping World overweight with a $28 price target, while Baird says the stock will "outperform" and head to $27 a share. Having second thoughts What may interest investors even more than Camping World's enthusiasts, though, is the names of some of the analysts who once actively pushed investors to buy the stock, but whose own enthusiasm has now cooled. Chief among these are Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Each banker underwrote nearly 4.1 million shares of Camping World stock, and so presumably liked the stock four weeks ago. But both of these bankers now rate the stock no better than neutral. Up only pennies from its Oct. 7 IPO price of $22, Goldman says that Camping World stock is worth at best $24 today. TheFly quotes Goldman warning investors that "decelerating" RV shipments industrywide "will likely weigh on the stock's multiple." JPMorgan gives Camping World only slightly more credit, assigning a $25 price target to Camping World stock. Similarly, Wells Fargo rates the stock a "market perform," and says the stock is fairly valued anywhere in the range from $23 to $25 a share -- the lower price being only pennies more than what Camping World costs today, and just $1 above the price at which Wells was pushing the stock at its IPO! A Foolish view With Wall Street walking back its enthusiasm so soon after the IPO, investors may feel somewhat less than certain about Camping World's prospects today. So what's an investor to do -- panic and sell, or stick with the stock? Here's how I look at the situation. Currently, Camping World stock sells for a P/E ratio of just 2.2. That may sound absurdly low, and imply that Camping World's recent profits are a fluke. In fact, though, Camping World's earnings don't look like a huge aberration to me. The company earned $190 million in net profits over the past 12 months, true. But it earned not much less ($178 million) in 2015 as a whole, and $125 million the year before that. Even valuing the stock on its earnings from two years ago, therefore, I can't call Camping World obviously overvalued at a mere 3.3 times 2014 earnings. Meanwhile, analysts who have published estimates for the stock on S&P Global Market Intelligence agree Camping World is likely to grow its earnings at a modest 8% pace annually over the next five years. That doesn't seem like a lot to pay for a stock selling for 2.2 times earnings -- or even 3.3. Granted, Camping World stock carries a heaping helping of debt -- $1.3 billion net of cash. Granted too, its cash flow statement is not without blemishes. (Free cash flow for the past 12 months, for example, amounts to only $97.5 million -- barely half of reported net income.) Weighing all these factors into consideration, there is reason for caution about the stock. But even so, I don't see any need to panic and sell just yet.

Walter Kress, who began his new role in October, is now responsible for managing the US firm’s pension and retirement plan investment portfolios, according to his LinkedIn. Based in Secaucus, New Jersey, Kress is also in charge of developing a long-term strategy that is in line with EY’s operational priorities. The new CIO comes from serving nearly 10 years at JP Morgan as managing director and COO for the New York-based financial giant’s retirement plans. There, he was responsible for the plans’ investment operations as well as “the oversight of the nonmarketable alternatives,” his LinkedIn said. Kress also spent more than two decades in a variety of positions at Mellon Institutional Asset Management, primarily retail fund manager Dreyfus, and Prudential Securities. He holds a bachelor’s degree in finance and economics from Syracuse University and is also an elected member of the board of finance in Wilton, Connecticut.

Over the next five-to-10 years, the miners need new production to replace almost 170 million tons of capacity that’ll be lost as exhausted pits are closed and grades decline at aging operations, according to Global Mining Research Ltd. Even with forecasts that demand for seaborne supply will peak in 2018 and prices may drop below $40 a ton that year, new iron ore projects are seen offering better returns than some alternative investments. “Economically, it still makes a lot of sense to invest that level of capex, given the returns that these mines are likely to generate,” said Michelle Lopez, a Sydney-based investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Ltd., which holds BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group shares and globally manages $403 billion. Yet, the decisions will be difficult and “for the first time they are actually up against real capital constraints, they haven’t had that in the past couple of years,” she said. The collapse in commodity prices in the past five years will see total global capital spending by mining companies drop about 60 percent to a forecast $57 billion next year, from $145 billion at the peak in 2012, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates. Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., the No. 4 iron ore exporter, plans to make a decision within six months on a potential $1.5 billion investment to replace output, Chief Executive Officer Nev Power said last week. Rio Tinto, which in August approved its $338 million Silvergrass mine, needs to develop a 50-million-ton mine about every five years to hold production steady, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in an August note. Miners in Western Australia’s iron-rich Pilbara region need prices between $36 a ton and $51 a ton to justify replacement expansions, which could total $8.2 billion, the bank estimates. Prices in the $50 a ton to $60 a ton range will provide sufficient incentive for investments in expansions, according to global consulting firm EY. If prices collapse, then mine projects “may be shelved as the majors find better uses of their limited capital across the rest of the minerals portfolio,” according to Paul Mitchell, EY’s global mining and metals advisory leader. “It is obvious that these replacement mines can never be considered to be ‘guaranteed’ in an uncertain world.” Benchmark iron ore has averaged $54.70 in 2016, according to Metal Bulletin Ltd. data. Iron ore’s rebound in 2016 from three straight annual declines isn’t sustainable and the market may need as long as a decade to rebalance, Rio’s CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques was cited by 21st Century Business Herald as saying last month in Beijing. He echoed similar comments by BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie. About 30 percent of Melbourne-based BHP’s current iron ore output in Australia will need to be replaced as the 80 million ton Yandi mine ceases production in about fiscal 2023, according to Macquarie Group Ltd. BHP rose 0.4 percent to A$22.66 in Sydney trading Thursday, as Fortescue advanced 0.6 percent and Rio declined 0.5 percent. ‘Finite Capital’ Even if there’s lower demand from China, iron ore production is likely to remain a high margin business, BHP’s Mackenzie said in August. It would be “perfectly possible, in that environment, that we would still be able to justify an extension or a replacement,” he told investors on an earnings call. Rio and BHP both declined to specify when they expect to take decisions on potential investments in replacement mines. Both producers have warned a proposed additional levy on their iron ore operations in Western Australia would put new projects in jeopardy. The investment decisions will be made as China, the top commodities consumer, looks likely to favor other metals, including copper, as its economy shifts from growth rooted in steel-intensive infrastructure projects. Global refined copper demand may grow about 7 percent through 2020, more than double the rate of the world’s iron ore imports over the same period, Barclays Plc analysts including Dane Davis wrote in a Nov. 1 note. Iron ore developments will also need to compete against growth options in other commodities, according to researcher CRU Group. “There are internal fights for capital within the businesses, they are going to be allocating a finite amount of money across their whole portfolios,” Adrian Doyle, a Sydney-based senior consultant at CRU, said by phone.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION Certain information contained in this press release, including any information as to the Company's strategy, projects, plans or future financial or operating performance, constitutes "forward-looking statements". All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. The words "expect", "will", "may" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by the Company or Barrick North America Finance LLC as at the date of this press release in light of management's experience and perception of current conditions and expected developments, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements and information. Such factors include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold, copper or certain other commodities (such as silver, diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity); failure to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; timing of receipt of, or failure to comply with, necessary permits and approvals; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development; changes in mineral production performance, exploitation and exploration successes; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; increased costs, delays, suspensions and technical challenges associated with the construction of capital projects; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities, including geotechnical challenges and disruptions in the maintenance or provision of required infrastructure and information technology systems; the impact of global liquidity and credit availability on the timing of cash flows and the values of assets and liabilities based on projected future cash flows; the impact of inflation; fluctuations in the currency markets; changes in U.S. dollar interest rates; changes in national and local government legislation, taxation, controls or regulations and/or changes in the administration of laws, policies and practices, expropriation or nationalization of property and political or economic developments in Argentina, Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions in which the Company does or may carry on business in the future; lack of certainty with respect to foreign legal systems, corruption and other factors that are inconsistent with the rule of law; damage to the Company's reputation due to the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, including negative publicity with respect to the Company's handling of environmental matters or dealings with community groups, whether true or not; risk of loss due to acts of war, terrorism, sabotage and civil disturbances; litigation; contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties, or over access to water, power and other required infrastructure; risks associated with working with partners in jointly controlled assets; employee relations including loss of key employees; increased costs and physical risks, including extreme weather events and resource shortages, related to climate change; and availability and increased costs associated with mining inputs and labor. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion, copper cathode or gold or copper concentrate losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect the Company's actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company or Barrick North America Finance LLC. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. All of the forward-looking statements made in this press release are qualified by these cautionary statements. Specific reference is made to "Narrative Description of the Business-Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources" and "Risk Factors" in the annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2015, and to the management's discussion and analysis in respect of the annual audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the management's discussion and analysis in respect of the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, each of which is on file with the SEC and Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities and incorporated by reference in the Offer to Purchase, and to the section "Certain Significant Consequences for Holders" in the Offer to Purchase, for a more detailed discussion of some of the factors underlying forward-looking statements and the risks that may affect the Company's ability to achieve the expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. The Offerors disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

Photo: AP mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:00 AM, November 3, 2016 With the most unconventional election in modern American history drawing to a close, investors worldwide have begun hedging their bets that voters will keep a Democrat in the White House and Republicans in control of at least one chamber of Congress. Given all of the October surprises, that may not be a bad idea. Below is a look at potential winners and losers depending on who wins and loses. But first, a caveat. Investors’ immediate reaction to US elections often does not last. Stocks Clinton wins: “The market has already priced in a (Hillary) Clinton victory,” said Ms Margaret Yang, a CMC Markets analyst in Singapore. “Any upside will be limited if she wins.” Barclays said in a report this week that the S&P 500 Index could gain as much as 3 per cent if she wins. The benchmark lost ground on Tuesday for the sixth straight session. The biggest losers would be finance and drug companies. “A potential Democratic sweep would represent one of the toughest election outcomes for banks,” Morgan Stanley Research said in a report, citing the possibility of tougher rules and tax changes that might hurt companies like Goldman Sachs and J P Morgan Chase. Under Mrs Clinton, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks “could be hit by renewed pressure to curb price increases on drugs”, BlackRock researchers said in a report, noting her complaints about rising prices. Citigroup had cut its rating on the European healthcare industry to underweight in September, citing risks related to the election. Her plans to reduce dependence on fossil fuels would boost alternative energy producers. Trump wins: “Valuations of US equities are quite high, and a Trump victory will trigger a massive selloff,” CMC’s Ms Yang said. Many would consider that a classic “black swan event”, she added, so the reaction would be “much more severe” than Brexit, which caused the S&P 500 Index to fall 5.3 per cent in two days as benchmarks in Europe and elsewhere lost even more. Investors seeking haven in the yen would be “a negative for Japanese exporters”, Ms Yang said. Barclays predicted the S&P 500 would nosedive by between 11 per cent and 13 per cent if Mr Donald Trump wins. The Republican’s shifting policy positions make his longer-term impact on particular sectors harder to assess. BlackRock’s analysis of the correlation between the two candidate’s polling numbers and sector stock performance suggest drugmakers, insurers and banks are expected to do better under Mr Trump. Bloomberg News did a similar analysis for individual US stocks. Companies that build and maintain civil infrastructure would have bigger opportunities for government work under Mr Trump, given that his plans for such spending are much more ambitious than Mrs Clinton’s. The same holds true for military contractors, according to a Credit Suisse report. Currencies Clinton wins: The US dollar would gain versus other developed-market currencies with the Democrat heading towards the White House as traders focus attention on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in December, according to Capital Economics, a London-based research firm. Bank of America sees the greenback gaining under Mrs Clinton only if the Democrats take Congress. Currencies from emerging markets have mostly priced in a Clinton win, which would be neutral or positive for all countries except Russia, Societe Generale said in a report. The Mexican peso would benefit from a Clinton win more than any other emerging-market currency, Societe Generale said. It has acted as a barometer of the presidential contest, tending to move in tandem with her chances of defeating a candidate who promised to make the United States’ southern neighbour pay for a wall between the two countries. Look for China’s yuan to “strengthen modestly in response to a Clinton win as currencies sensitive to the outlook for global trade rally in relief”, said Mr Sean Callow, senior strategist at Westpac Banking in Sydney. Trump wins: The foreign exchange markets this week are suggesting what might happen if the Republican triumphs, with the dollar tumbling against almost all major currencies and the Mexican peso falling to a three-week low. Even after the immediate shock of a Trump win, the US dollar may weaken as developed-market currencies including the yen, euro, pound and franc rally on concern that China would dump US assets and the Fed would delay tightening monetary policy. The greenback could then rally in a three- to nine-month horizon as Republicans usher in tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth, Bank of America said. The candidate’s hostility towards China — including threats of steep tariffs over alleged currency manipulation — would likely drive the offshore yuan down about 3 per cent by year’s end, said Mr Ken Cheung, a foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. Longer term, the currency may fall more gradually under Mr Trump as he exerts political pressure on the country’s leaders to slow its depreciation, said Mr Xu Gao, an economist at Everbright Securities in Beijing. Risk adversity in the aftermath of a Trump win would also hurt other developing-world currencies on fears that his protectionist stance could hurt emerging economies by reducing imports from them. The South Korean won may take a hit, given questions Mr Trump has raised about the need for US troops on the North Korean border. Emerging Markets Clinton wins: It will be risk-on if the Democrat retains control of the White House, which bodes well for developing markets. Investors may respond by bidding up Chinese defence shares because Mrs Clinton comes across as the more hawkish candidate, said Mr Francis Cheung, head of China and Hong Kong strategy at CLSA. Commodity producers in the developing world might rally on expectations that US demand will increase along with infrastructure spending. Trump wins: “I can’t think of any country that would benefit if Trump wins,” CMC Markets’ Ms Yang said. Evercore’s report mentioned one nation that might get a boost, suggesting investors buy Russian equities to hedge against the Clinton-leaning polls being wrong. Citigroup sees the MSCI Emerging Markets Index immediately falling at least 10 per cent, with Mexican stocks leading the way down. One possible bright spot for Mexico: Construction companies may be positioned for contracts to build Mr Trump’s proposed border wall. In Asia, “China will bear the brunt of risks if Trump wins”, said Mr Ken Peng, an investment strategist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong. “He’ll probably introduce trade policies targeted against China,” weakening its economy. Protectionist US policies would also be “bad for a lot of economies that rely a lot on exports”, said Mr Ben Bei, an analyst at CIMB Securities in Hong Kong. Mr Peng said exporters from South Korea and Taiwan are among those with the most to lose. Ms Yang adds South-east Asian exporters to the list, including companies in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. To the extent that Mr Trump is less welcoming to workers from abroad, his victory may hurt the Philippines’ broader economy, which gets the bulk of its overseas remittances from Filipinos employed in the US, Ms Yang said. “India and Indonesia will be least affected if Trump wins”, due to their robust domestic growth, Mr Peng said. Commodities Clinton wins: Her environmental policies, especially her promise to combat climate change, will put pressure on coal and oil. The natural gas market could get a boost from her pledge to wean power plants off coal by using gas as “a bridge” to more reliance on renewables. Trump wins: Natural gas prices would likely suffer as coal benefits under Mr Trump. He has promised to roll back environmental rules that squeeze coal out of the US power market and promoted “clean coal” during one of the debates. Bloomberg Intelligence in September estimated a victory by the Republican would shave 11 per cent off natural gas demand in 2030 from last year’s levels, boosting coal use. Oil prices could get a lift from the return of a risk premium if Mr Trump continues with the “bellicose language that has been heard on the campaign trail” about Iran and scraps President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with the country, said Mr John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund focused on energy. Gold, platinum and silver would the “biggest winners” if Mr Trump wins, said Ms Yang, the CMC Markets analyst. To see why, look at what happened right after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced it will examine newly discovered emails relevant to its inquiry of Mrs Clinton’s use of a private Internet server as secretary of state: Gold futures rallied to a three-week high because demand for the metal as a haven jumped. Since the day before the FBI’s announcement, all precious metals were up. Copper may also get a bounce, Barclays said, citing moves in the metal’s price during the campaign suggesting “a Trump-related premium in infrastructure-related assets given expectations around his fiscal plan.” BLOOMBERG mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Business READ COMMENTED “India really means business”: Iswaran ’appy iPhone users as WhatsApp Web goes iOS ‘Your fried rice’s ready, Chef’ ‘Unicorns’ face up to reality of new dotcom bubble ‘Tweaks' to property cooling measures worth exploring, say industry players Yellen says Fed could raise interest rates 'relatively soon' World debut: Jaguar unveils all-electric I-Pace SUV With tougher rules, China wants fewer, but better, electric car makers With 'change in the air', PM May asks business to help on economy What’s most worrying about the current economic climate?

"Many of the things we're doing now are to prepare in advance."JPMorgan's asset management arm has added local emerging markets debt, Michele added, citing high real yield, upsides to growth and stabilization of currencies, thanks to recovering energy prices.He named Brazil, India, Indonesia and Russia as attractive targets, adding that it was a good time to take the currency exposure as well. Michele, who manages the firm's $455-billion fixed income portfolios, also said it was looking for opportunities to sell duration. "When markets rally, we would use that as an opportunity to cut duration of our portfolios because we think the market is going through a growth and inflation scare."JPMorgan Asset Management had $1.77 trillion in assets under management by September 30.

Alts Currency-Hedged Equities Fixed-Income New ETFs Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2016 → November → Europe ETFs Could Shine Next Year Europe ETFs Could Shine Next Year Tom Lydon November 2, 2016 0 Comment currency hedged ETFs, equities, EZU, featured, HEDJ, HEZU European stocks and the corresponding exchange traded funds have, for much of 2016, been disappointments, but some market observers believe with the euro poised to weaken and the dollar gaining momentum, European equities could deliver for investors next year. According to JPMorgan Asset Management, the European stock market has gotten too cheap to resist, with valuations on the MSCI Europe ex-UK Index and the FTSE All-Shares Index at attractive valuations when their price-to-earnings ratios are adjusted for inflation over the past 10 years, reports Aleksandra Gjorgievska for Bloomberg. Related: Brexit Opens Opportunity for Europe ETFs ETFs such as the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund (NYSEArca: HEDJ) and the iShares MSCI EMU ETF (NYSEArca: EZU), which is not currency hedged, have been hindered by a surprisingly strong euro, but that is a scenario that could change as well. The European Central Bank (ECB) has been an issue for investors this year, but the ECB recently noted it will not taper its quantitative easing program, at least not in the near-term. Market observers argued that the ECB could even extend its bond purchasing program to further support inflation. The ECB has already spent over a trillion euros buying government bonds, cut its benchmark rate to zero and adopted a negative deposit rate.

He cited a trade like getting long the German DAX index and short the Dow,” Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy for BK Asset Management told CNBC. Trending on ETF Trends Diversify an Investment Portfolio with an Infrastructure ETF Currency Hedged Japan ETFs Are Back in Demand International Bond ETFs That Help Manage Overseas Market Risks Soros Drops GLD Stake, Adds China, Japan ETFs Diversifying Income with Currency Hedged Bond ETFs Many traders are increasing bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve could hike interest rates in December, further strengthening the U.S. dollar against the euro currency. Consequently, investors who expect in an improving Eurozone economy, along with a depreciating euro currency, should consider currency-hedged ETF options to gain exposure to the region. For instance, the Deutsche X-trackers MSCI EMU Hedged Equity ETF (NYSEArca: DBEZ), iShares Currency Hedged MSCI EMU ETF (NYSEArca: HEZU) and the aforemetioned HEDJ target Eurozone countries but try to diminish the negative effects of a depreciating EUR – a weakening foreign currency would normally reduce returns on overseas securities when converted back into a stronger U.S. dollar.

The exchange-traded fund Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) is finally showing signs of life. Source: via Wikimedia From here there might be trouble, though. And to prepare for that, I want to try and pick on a few financial stocks. JPM stock stuck out as one challenging highs. If I am correct that there could be trouble, a stock at its highs is usually one of the first place sellers hit. Click to Enlarge This is not so as much a short on JPMorgan Chase itself as it is a short on markets in general. The U.S. Federal Reserve will eventually take more steps into their rate hike cycle and that will have a negative effect on equity prices in general. The perception is that Banks profit with higher rates. 9 Shiny New Dividend Stocks You Can Trust in the Long Run So, financials may at first rally with the rate hike but I believe that this will be temporary, as was the case last year. Banks will eventually follow the general equity markets’ move. JPM Stock Trade Trade No. 1 — The Bet: Buy JPM Dec $67.50/$65 debit put spread. This is a bearish trade for which I pay per 60 cents contract. This is my maximum potential loss. To profit, I need JPM stock to fall through both legs of my spread before it expires. If JPM stock drops below $65, I stand to gain $1.90 per contract. I usually like to lower my entry costs by setting an opposing trade. Usually it’s a bullish credit spread. In this case and since markets are currently nervous days ahead of the elections, I may delay the entry a few hours just in case we get a poll report showing a Trump lead. Trade No. 2 – The Bank (Optional): Sell JPM Nov $66/$65 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 15 cents per contract. Ideally here I need JPM stock to stay above my spread through the November expiration. This has a theoretical 85% chance of success and a 4% price buffer from current levels. The yield if successful would be 17% on money risked. Ideally I need this spread to expire worthless, at which point I have discounted my entry price for the December short by the 15-cent credit per contract. Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Already Needs a Price Cut This sounds complicated, but the idea is simple: From here, I believe there is more downside risk in JPM than upside potential. I want to capture that move as cheaply as possible. I am not obliged to hold any of the positions through the expiration. I can close for partial gains or losses at any time. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

updated guide to global loan market that has undergone substantial change since financial crisis News provided by Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP Nov 02, 2016, 11:43 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Nov. 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Global Leveraged Finance partners Michael Bellucci and Jerome McCluskey of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP have published a comprehensively updated manual for the global syndicated credit market,  The LSTA's Complete Credit Agreement Guide, Second Edition, in conjunction with the Loan Syndications & Trading Association (LSTA). Seven years and one global financial crisis after the first edition of the guide, Messrs. Bellucci and McCluskey and have produced a one-stop resource, covering all layers of the international loan market and reflecting the transformations and upheavals that have shaped syndicated credit agreements since 2009. The first edition quickly won an industry-wide reputation as the definitive reference, and the new edition remains the only updated single-volume guide to navigate the syndicated loan market and its underlying credit agreements. Andrew O'Brien, global head of Loan Capital Strategy for JPMorgan Chase, calls the second edition: "an excellent resource that provides clear explanation and rationale for the more complex components of today's credit agreements. It is a very useful tool for anyone involved in the loan market." Thomas Finke, CEO of global investment manager Barings LLC, said: "This is the comprehensive resource for deciphering the complexities of a syndicated credit agreement. A must-have guide for today's global loan market that unbundles the intricate layers of credit terms, market trends, and global forces that together impact the ultimate deal cut between the corporate borrower and its lenders." The book will be available in hardcover and electronically. In addition to all eRetailers, the book can be purchased from: Amazon Barnes & Noble The LSTA's Complete Credit Agreement Guide portrays the many changes that have occurred among lenders as well as borrowers since the recession and closely covers the evolving regulatory landscape of credit agreement provisions. Never a simple or an easy process, structuring and managing credit agreements are now more complicated than ever – whether for borrowers or lenders such as banks, hedge funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and other financial institutions.   "We believe this book is a cutting-edge resource for loan market participants," said Mr. Bellucci, "as well as a historical guide to the evolution of many standard credit agreement provisions and practices. We are excited for its publication." Mr. McCluskey added: "Since the last edition of the book was published in 2009, there has been a tremendous amount of turbulence and disruption in the syndicated loan markets. The standard credit agreement has been a great indicator of the substantial changes that have come to bear and we have tried to make sense of it all. Our goal was to build upon the excellent foundation provided by the first edition and to update what I believe is commonly known as the go-to reference guide for the loan market."   Included among the timely topics in the more than 700-page guide are: What to look for in large sponsor-driven deals The rise of "covenant lite" agreements for corporate borrowers seeking fewer covenant restrictions Yankee Loans Commitments, Loans, and Letters of Credit Interest and Fees Amortization and Maturity Conditions Precedent Representations Covenants Guarantees and Security Defaults and Enforcement Interlender, Voting, and Agency issues Defaulting Lenders Assignments, Participations, and Disqualified Lender Lists Borrower Rights Regulatory Developments ABOUT MILBANK Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP is a leading international law firm that provides innovative legal services to clients around the world.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Editorial Columns Letters Books Blogs Not enough   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet SEBI’s new rules for rating agencies focus mainly on operating procedures; what’s needed are stronger checks on conflicts of interest As large corporate groups grapple with high debt and delay loan repayments , the risk of such distress afflicting other segments of the financial system remains a live one. Some leveraged firms raise bonds and deposits directly from the public; others borrow from debt mutual funds which deploy retail money. In such cases, investor interests are sought to be protected mainly by requiring issuers to obtain credit ratings from independent rating agencies. But certain incidents in the past year have exposed chinks in the armour of the rating agencies themselves. A sudden default and suspension of credit ratings on a bond rated ‘investment grade’ from Amtek Auto led to sharp write-downs and losses for investors in two debt funds run by JP Morgan Asset Management Company. Sudden and steep downgrades in the bonds of some steelmakers have delivered nasty jolts to investors. SEBI’s recent circular calling for “enhanced standards for credit rating agencies” is ostensibly aimed at addressing these chinks. The circular seems to be devoted mainly to standardising the policies and processes at the rating agencies. Therefore, SEBI lays down detailed checks on what will constitute a ‘default’ on each instrument, asks rating agencies to specify financial ratios used for credit assessments, and provides a template for the rating released to the public. Rating agencies will also be required to make public disclosures of the periodicity at which ratings will be reviewed or placed on watch. There are just a couple of new rules that may serve a useful purpose for investors. One, when rating a new instrument, agencies will now be required to carry a three-year rating history of all other instruments from the same issuer. This should help investors gauge the overall creditworthiness of the borrower. Two, raters will no longer be allowed to suspend ratings and blank out issuers if they refuse to disclose information. They will instead be required to monitor a debt instrument over its entire life (with requisite disclaimers), even if the issuer fails to cooperate. While these tweaks are useful to avoid a repeat of JP Morgan-type episodes, SEBI has stopped short of actually pulling up rating agencies for abrupt rating suspensions and downgrades. It has also tiptoed around the biggest regulatory challenge confronting the rating business worldwide — the blatant conflict of interest arising from issuers (and not users) paying the rating fee. In India, this problem is compounded by rating agencies also offering a range of advisory services to corporate clients which may allow them to subtly influence ratings. SEBI has mandated a Chinese wall by requiring that people with business responsibilities play no part in rating decisions. But stronger regulatory checks are needed to ensure that rating agencies work in the best interests of investors, rather than their rating clients.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 7:30 PM, November 2, 2016 Updated: 8:00 PM, November 2, 2016 TOKYO - The U.S. presidential election is unlikely to be a major risk for financial markets as Congress is likely to put a brake on many policies, whoever wins, the fixed income chief investment officer of JPMorgan Asset Management said on Wednesday. Bob Michele said the world's fifth largest asset manager increased exposure to inflation-linked bonds (TIPS) and emerging market debt in the last few weeks, expecting moderate growth and solid oil prices to lift inflation and support emerging market currencies. Global financial markets were roiled by signs the U.S. presidential election race was tightening just days ahead of the Nov. 8 vote, with a possible victory for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump seen as boosting uncertainty on U.S. foreign, economic and trade policies. But Michele told Reuters in an interview that U.S. politics is not among the major risk factors the firm looks at in coming months because the House of Representatives is likely to remain Republican. "This is very important because any law that the President would like to pass has to go through the House for approval," he said. "We are in an interesting position where, if (Hillary) Clinton gets elected, the House - if it remains Republican - will likely push back a lot of things she wants to do. "But if Trump gets elected and he tries to push through a lot of the extremist, protectionist things he has talked about, I expect the House will push that back." Since both candidates are highlighting the need to rebuild U.S. infrastructure, fiscal expansion is likely, whoever wins, Michele said. In addition, U.S. and world growth look better than expected at the start of 2016 and oil prices have recovered sharply from 12-year lows hit early this year, which is likely to underpin prices in coming months. "There's a lot that will happen in a couple of weeks that will appear to be very growth friendly and very inflation-oriented, including the election," he added. "Many of the things we're doing now are to prepare in advance." JPMorgan's <JPM.N> asset management arm has added local emerging markets debt, Michele added, citing high real yield, upsides to growth and stabilization of currencies, thanks to recovering energy prices. He named Brazil, India, Indonesia and Russia as attractive targets, adding that it was a good time to take the currency exposure as well. Michele, who manages the firm's $455-billion fixed income portfolios, also said it was looking for opportunities to sell duration. "When markets rally, we would use that as an opportunity to cut duration of our portfolios because we think the market is going through a growth and inflation scare." JPMorgan Asset Management had $1.77 trillion in assets under management by September 30.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    While strategists and pundits fall over each other predicting how the U.S. presidential race will play out in markets, the stock market itself has a clear-cut view on which industry is most at risk: the banks. Financial institutions come up far more often than any other industry when share price correlation is plotted for sensitivity to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton’s election odds. Among the 100 stocks in the S&P 500 with the strongest ties, companies from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Progressive Corp., are moving the most based on politics. Their clear preference is for Trump. “There are things Democrats want to do that could hurt these companies and things Republicans want to do that will help them, and that’s why these correlations are so strong,” said Dan Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas Research Partners in Washington. “Financials are not priced for the event that you get a Democrat sweep. Markets are paying more attention to Fed policy and not enough to the election.” It’s not like bank shareholders need more drama this year. Financial stocks began 2016 by plunging 18 percent over six weeks, dragged down by concerns a recession was about to steamroll their lending business. Scandals, fines and firings have dogged the group since the bottom in February, with volatility cresting after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union sent banks down 8 percent in two days. Heavy correlation to the candidates is something else to process for bulls and bears as the Federal Reserve considers higher interest rates and signs of inflation emerge in the economy. Flows into and out of bank shares have been among the heaviest in the S&P 500 this year, with a net $300 billion pulled from the largest financial exchange-traded fund in 2016, the most since 2011. Financials For Trump While pretty much every industry has demonstrated an occasional preference for one party or another during the election season, none has been as tied to poll numbers on the RealClearPolitics website as financial companies. They’re the only ones that have moved in lockstep with the Republican’s odds while also moving inversely to Clinton’s numbers, suggesting investors believe the biggest difference between the candidates’ political agendas may be how they deal with Wall Street. Banks, online brokerages and diversified financial companies make up 20 of the top 50 companies most tied to Trump’s numbers, almost double the next most common group, technology stocks. Morgan Stanley sits atop the list, with a correlation of 0.68 to Trump’s polls since March, followed by E*Trade Financial Corp. and Fifth Third Bancorp, with correlations of at least 0.62. At the same time, many of those companies move inversely with Clinton’s chances. In the top 100 most polarized stocks, financial shares on average have a correlation of negative 0.24 with Clinton and a positive correlation of 0.41 with Trump. That spread is bigger than in any other group. “If you think Hillary wins but Republicans keep the house, it is trickier because more factors come into play given how wide the polls have become,” said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co. in Greenwich, Connecticut. “You want to be thoughtful around big banks, especially those most exposed to more Dodd-Frank.” Clinton Correlations Outside of financials and the handful of chipmakers that trade with Trump, the most discernible correlation between the election and industries are ones associated with a victory by Clinton. Among the 100 companies most correlated to politics, 69 are because of moderate to strong inverse relationships with her numbers, suggesting the effects of a Clinton administration on specific companies is more easily interpreted or that polls represent a stronger signal about her chances. Of the top 50 stocks most closely tied to Clinton’s polls, 21 fall in the consumer discretionary category, and the correlations are, on average, stronger than the companies that stand to benefit from a Trump election. Topping the list are retailers like Nordstrom Inc. and Tiffany & Co. and automotive stocks including Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. and BorgWarner Inc. The two groups have traded with positive correlations of at least 0.73 and 0.67 to the RealClearPolitics numbers. Not all of the equity market has shown a clear preference for a candidate. Some of the strongest relationships between stocks and polling show up in industrial shares, where strong correlations exist both for Trump’s and Clinton’s numbers. A possible reason: Both candidates will expand federal spending in an effort to jump-start the economy. “Beneficiaries of increased fiscal spending, such as construction and materials, have already rallied in anticipation of greater infrastructure spending post-election,” analysts at BlackRock Inc. wrote in an Oct. 25 note. “Yet this outperformance may be premature, as new fiscal programs take time to trickle down to corporate bottom lines.”   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.
